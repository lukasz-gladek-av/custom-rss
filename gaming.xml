That’s roughly eight heroes a year, and that means <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ roster could be nearly twice the size it is now in just a few short years. How does NetEase plan to do that? </p><p>Well, from the looks of it, the studio has dozens already in the pipeline. Leakers and dataminers have been reporting that file names already in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ code reference several characters who are likely in the works. Some of them are popular heroes I’m surprised aren’t in the game already, but other, more obscure characters might be making their way to the hero shooter in the coming months or even years as well. </p><p>It’s worth noting that there’s some dispute about how legitimate some of the leaks are, as some leakers are claiming a few of these names might be heroes NetEase actually has no plans to bring to the game<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Saulman11835779/status/1882506889562583539&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Saulman11835779/status/1882506889562583539" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> but instead were leaked by the company or planted in the code</a></span> to throw fans and dataminers off the scent, a claim which has other leakers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1882561140049269227&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1882561140049269227" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting the code for several heroes they claim are in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ files</a></span> to add legitimacy to their findings.

She’s a swordswoman so I imagine she’ll land in either Vanguard or Duelist.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="76df9179d75a3256939824bbee7a2659" data-recommend-id="image://76df9179d75a3256939824bbee7a2659" data-format="jpg" data-width="1421" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Beast is shown wearing a lab coat and glasses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Beast is shown wearing a lab coat and glasses." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="76df9179d75a3256939824bbee7a2659" data-recommend-id="image://76df9179d75a3256939824bbee7a2659" data-format="jpg" data-width="1421" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Beast is shown wearing a lab coat and glasses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Hank McCoy is one of many X-Men who have been leaked for <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1882027636802646492&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1882027636802646492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roughly translated, his leaked abilities</a></span> include “Field Experiment,” “Intelligence Analysis,” and something called “Dexterity,” which, taken together, make it sound like he might be a more strategic character.

He can shoot lasers from his eyes. That’s why he’s got those cool shades on indoors and in the middle of the night. But I’m curious to see how NetEase rounds out his kit when he mostly just blows holes in the side of things by looking in their direction. This is an easy Duelist character.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d091f7fc21a60f69d689033e60e3d161" data-recommend-id="image://d091f7fc21a60f69d689033e60e3d161" data-format="jpg" data-width="1428" data-height="804" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool stands in a TVA office." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Deadpool stands in a TVA office." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d091f7fc21a60f69d689033e60e3d161" data-recommend-id="image://d091f7fc21a60f69d689033e60e3d161" data-format="jpg" data-width="1428" data-height="804" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool stands in a TVA office." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Wade Wilson, the foul-mouthed, fourth-wall-breaking gunslinger, was one of the more surprising omissions from <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ launch roster, but it sounds like NetEase is bringing him into the fold in a future update. While he will likely have some sustainability given one of his abilities is a healing factor so strong he can’t die, I can’t see him being anything other than a hyperviolent Duelist capable of bringing absolute chaos and destruction to the battlefield with his firearms and swords.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8b18e4cf15dceb4ec439531152d54f8f" data-recommend-id="image://8b18e4cf15dceb4ec439531152d54f8f" data-format="jpg" data-width="867" data-height="512" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Emma Frost is shown in her diamond form as Sebastian Shaw stands beside her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Emma Frost is shown in her diamond form as Sebastian Shaw stands beside her." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Fox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8b18e4cf15dceb4ec439531152d54f8f" data-recommend-id="image://8b18e4cf15dceb4ec439531152d54f8f" data-format="jpg" data-width="867" data-height="512" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Emma Frost is shown in her diamond form as Sebastian Shaw stands beside her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The telepathic mutant Emma Frost has been long-rumored as a Vanguard due to her diamond form, which allows her to become essentially indestructible. I could see her using this to resist any incoming damage for a brief period of time, allowing her to safely disrupt the enemy team without risking herself. Her psychic powers could also give her some decent crowd control abilities that let her do some damage as she protects herself and others.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="27927f2945eb90cbc1f23d1ba2a7015c" data-recommend-id="image://27927f2945eb90cbc1f23d1ba2a7015c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2043" data-height="1147" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gambit looks at something off-screen while holding a playing card in his fingers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gambit looks at something off-screen while holding a playing card in his fingers." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="27927f2945eb90cbc1f23d1ba2a7015c" data-recommend-id="image://27927f2945eb90cbc1f23d1ba2a7015c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2043" data-height="1147" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gambit looks at something off-screen while holding a playing card in his fingers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There sure are a lot of mutants on this list, huh? Gambit is believed to be a Duelist based on the leaks, with his kit seemingly utilizing his kinetic energy manipulation. He’ll likely be a mixed attacker with his staff giving him some close-range options and his card-throwing abilities coming in clutch at range. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="010be09477b7946a8c555ad6214892b4" data-recommend-id="image://010be09477b7946a8c555ad6214892b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hit-Monkey stands on a red rug in a suit and sunglasses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hit-Monkey stands on a red rug in a suit and sunglasses." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="010be09477b7946a8c555ad6214892b4" data-recommend-id="image://010be09477b7946a8c555ad6214892b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hit-Monkey stands on a red rug in a suit and sunglasses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We really don’t have enough weird little freaks in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, so if Hit-Monkey joins the roster as is currently rumored, we’ll get a suit-wearing monkey doing his best Agent 47 cosplay.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/league-of-legends-was-the-most-watched-esports-game-of-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Despite the continued rise of VALORANT and the post-release energy surrounding Counter-Strike 2, the most watched esport in the world is still League of Legends, and it’s not really that close. The MOBA that serves as Riot Games’ foundation nearly doubled the amount of total hours watched from the second most watched title of 2024.</p>



<hr>







<p>According to <a href="https://escharts.com/news/top-esports-games-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data</a> from Esports Charts, fans watched 749.6 million hours of League of Legends esports events in 2024, up 27% from the year before. The 2024 World Championships, known commonly as Worlds 2024, unsurprisingly was the biggest event of the year. Worlds 2024 accumulated over 190 million hours watched, accounting for over a quarter of League esports hours watched all year. The event peaked during its grand finals, with a record 6,856,769 viewers tuning in to watch <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-2024-winner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">T1 and the legendary Lee “Faker” Sang-hyeok win their fifth Worlds event</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Trailing behind League of Legends is the mobile-based MOBA, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, which is wildly popular in Southeast Asia. In third place is Counter-Strike 2, followed by VALORANT, and then Dota 2 in fifth place. 2024 represents the first time that VALORANT has surpassed Dota 2 in total hours watched. While the Dota 2 scene suffered due to the discontinuing of the Dota Pro Circuit, VALORANT continued to grow internationally.</p>



<p>Esports Charts’ data doesn’t track viewership from Chinese livestreaming platforms though, due to “the unreliability of the reported statistics and lack of transparency in regards to how they are calculated.” But it’s clear that China is a massive priority for the top performing games. VALORANT expanded with the VCT China League in 2024, and also saw the first Chinese team, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/edward-gaming-wins-valorant-champions-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EDward Gaming, win its world championship</a>. For the first time in Counter-Strike’s illustrious history, a Major was held in Shanghai, where <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Team Spirit lifted the trophy</a>.</p>

It's likely you'll even be able to use this for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-6">PlayStation 6</a> when it eventually arrives, making this a worthwhile long-term investment.</p></div><p id="best-angled"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best angled" id="ugreenangle">3.

Instead of taking a risk and bending your HDMI cable, why not invest in a right-angle cable from the offset?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You do sacrifice a few things with this cable, however. For instance, it’s much shorter than many HDMI cables at only 3.3 feet. This might be fine for some people, but you should double check how much cable you need to connect your PS5 to your TV first. There’s also the fact that it only supports HDMI 2.0, so you won’t be able to enjoy the 120Hz refresh rate the PS5 is designed to be capable of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, if you need a right-angle cable at a very affordable price, the Ugreen Right Angle HDMI Cable is your best bet.</p></div><p id="cheapest"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Cheapest" id="basics">4.

You just need to assess the distance between your PS5 and TV, ensuring you invest in a cable that gives you plenty of room. This is especially true of you don't have a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-stand">good TV stand</a> that has holes in the back for cords to slip through,</p><p id="faq"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="FAQ">PS5-compatible HDMI Cables FAQ</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Are expensive HDMI cables worth it?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you have a modern 4K or 8K TV, you shouldn’t get sticker shock when looking for an HDMI cable. At these high resolutions, the amount of data the PS5 is pushing to your PC is massive, and cheaper cables run the risk of corrupting that data by using lackluster materials. However, if you’re playing your PS5 on an older display, you might want to consider either upgrading your TV, or opting for a cheaper HDMI cable.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What kind of HDMI cable does the PS5 use?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">To get the most out of your PS5, you should use a HDMI 2.1 cable. This supports 4K@120Hz, or 8K@60Hz, providing the best gaming experience.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Does the PS5 come with a HDMI 2.1 cable?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, the PS5 does come with a HDMI 2.1 cable. You don’t need to buy any additional cables unless you want a longer cable, one with features like braiding, or you need a spare.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Is HDMI 2.1 backward compatible?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, HDMI 2.1 is backward compatible. If you plug a HDMI 2.1 cable into a HDMI 2.0 port, it will still work. If you plug a HDMI 2.0 cable into your PS5, it will still work, but it won’t offer support for the same video output.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kegan is an avid gamer who has been playing games since his Atari days.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24351191/ayaneo-3-price-release-date-indiegogo-specs-handheld<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Ayaneo builds the best-looking handheld PCs in the business, but they’ve always been boutique. The 2023 Ayaneo 2, for example, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23604799/ayaneo-2-review-handheld-gaming-pc">cost $1,300 for an arguably worse experience than the $400 Steam Deck</a>. But that experience isn’t dampening my excitement for the new 7-inch Ayaneo 3. </p></div><p>Not only does this one start at $900, within striking distance of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">highest-end handhelds you’ll find at retail</a>, it’s the most feature-packed portable I’ve seen — with two USB4 ports <em>and</em> OcuLink <em>and</em> RGB-ringed Hall effect joysticks <em>and </em>your choice of two seemingly killer screens. Perhaps most exciting: a way to finally fix a handheld’s joystick and button layout to match your ergonomic preferences!</p><p>Just watch:</p><div><figcaption><em>Finally.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Animation by Ayaneo</cite></p></div><p>Ayaneo is calling the Ayaneo 3 “the world’s first modular handheld,” because there’ll be other modular options too. An extra $139 buys a set of six modules that let you swap out your joysticks for analog sticks, a six-button microswitch pad for fighting games, or even D-pads and face buttons with conductive silicone underneath for a different feel. </p><div><figcaption><em>Six modules and extra joystick toppers come with the “Magic Module” kit.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ayaneo</cite></p></div><p>But importantly, that basic module that lets you change joystick and button orientation and swap joystick caps comes with the handheld by default, and it’s not the only feature Ayaneo is impressively cramming into the $900 kit. </p><p>While you’ll “only” get a Ryzen 8840U, 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and 512GB of storage that that price — no <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go">Z2 option</a>, and the HX 370 model starts at $1500 — you do get your choice of OLED or IPS right away. </p><p>That OLED screen is a 1080p 144Hz HDR OLED panel promising 800 nits of global brightness and 110 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, specs which suggest it could even beat the Steam Deck OLED’s excellent screen.</p><div><figcaption><em>An actual photo of the Ayaneo 3.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ayaneo</cite></p></div><p>Like the Deck OLED, it unfortunately <em>doesn’t</em> have variable refresh rate for added smoothness — but if that’s important, the IPS panel option does! That one’s a 120Hz, 500-nit, native landscape 1080p display, according to the company, with 7ms response time and only 100 percent sRGB coverage (read: nowhere near as colorful as the OLED panel). </p><p>On top of all that, the Ayaneo 3 comes standard with both top <em>and</em> bottom USB4 ports, both of which are capable of 65W PD charging, <em>plus</em> the still-rare-on-handhelds Oculink port <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24319196/egpus-continue-to-evolve">for eGPUs</a>, and it takes full-length M.2 2280 SSDs for easy storage upgrades.</p><p>Plus, there’s a dedicated hardware mode switch on the bottom edge to switch the controller and virtual-mouse-and-keyboard modes. I doubt that will make up for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">the current state of Windows</a>, but it could help! Also, new trigger locks for its Hall effect triggers, if you want to switch them into a hair trigger mode.</p><p>I do have a few hesitations, even without having touched the Ayaneo 3. First, the company says its modules <em>electronically</em> latch into the frame — you have to eject them by pressing a software button, which activates a motor to release the latch. Sounds potentially fiddly?</p><p>Second, I’m sorry to report that this 1.5-pound handheld only fits a 49 watt-hour battery, even though the Asus ROG Ally X manages to fit an 80 watt-hour pack into roughly the same weight. Fingers crossed, but I wouldn’t expect great battery life here with neither a giant battery pack nor a particularly handheld-optimized chip.</p><p>Lastly, it’s always important to point out that these products are crowdfunded, and while Ayaneo has a history of delivering its promised handhelds, they haven’t always been great — and this is the most ambitious one yet. If that sounds worthwhile, <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-3-the-world-s-first-modular-handheld">you can find the Ayaneo 3 on Indiegogo</a> here. </p><p>The company says the handheld should ship at the end of April; here’s the whole price breakdown.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Microsoft's next big game, the RPG Avowed from The Outer Worlds developer Obsidian, is coming out in February. Unlike some of Obsidian's other RPGs, Avowed is not an open-world game. This serves the game best, Avowed region director Berto Ritger said.</p><p>Avowed features large "defined zones," as opposed to taking place in an open world. Ritger said having established and distinct zones is a "good pacing mechanism" for the choices players make.</p><p>"We know roughly what you've done before you've gone to the next thing. It's still a very open structure within those zones, where you can do whatever you want for the most part, but it's not one contiguous area where you could be anywhere at any moment," Ritger said in

It’s a shorter list that positions the new update as one of the smaller in recent memory, but that doesn’t mean it won’t keep players locked in for the time being.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rivals fans often show up for the FPS gameplay and stick around for the guns, so the Gunblade already feels right at home. This two-in-one rifle doubles as both a ranged weapon and a giant blade. Using both to catch your opponents off guard may prove useful in the heat of battle, especially on the new Rivals Bridge map. This suspended, concrete location leaves no room for small talk by putting players into close-quarters combat from the jump with only a few concrete walls and a bus standing in between them. Nosniy says the arena is located in Seoul and comes from creator @GreatGuyBoom.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/22/roblox-rivals-update-9-1737584645781.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Rivals Update 9 adds the Gunblade to the Roblox FPS experience's arsenal.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, fans will notice that the Rivals Update 9 patch notes don’t mention any specific bug fixes, balance changes, or quality-of-life additions. The developers acknowledge their decision to ditch any other tweaks in favor of adding the Bridge map and Gunblade. Although there was room to “slightly” modify the skins for the Demon Shorty and Demon Uzi while renaming a few other weapons, Nosniy does promise more to come with the next major content update.

However, the developers have confirmed what the game is not, and that is a "cosmic horror in feudal Japan." Executive Michal Nowakowski <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1758597188555591758" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said previously on social media</a>, "It's definitely NOT a cosmic horror in feudal Japan."</p><p>Given that Project Hadar is a new IP, it stands to reason it will take place in a new, original universe featuring brand-new characters. The word "Hadar" has <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/hadar" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">many definitions</a>, including a fossil site in Ethiopia and a star in the Centaurus constellation, but there is no telling if however the word may be defined is in any way associated with what the product might be when it's done.</p><p>CD Projekt developer Maria Mazu told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-3-and-cyberpunk-2077-studio-dev-thinks-it-only-makes-sense-for-cd-projekt-red-to-make-a-new-ip-that-comes-straight-from-us/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> that they were "so happy" to learn they would get to make a new IP. "I feel like it only makes sense given how many kinds of people we have on this, like the storytelling side of things but also our artists," Mazur said. "It feels like a waste not to invest all that into something new or something that comes straight from us. I am very excited about Hadar."</p><h2 id="Project_Hadar_game_engine">Project Hadar game engine</h2><p>Project Hadar is likely to be developed with Epic's Unreal Engine, though this is not confirmed. CD Projekt has a deal in place with Epic to make more of its games using Unreal Engine 5 as well, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">including The Witcher 4</a>, and it would make sense for the deal to cover CD Projekt's other games. But again, this is not confirmed.</p><h2 id="Who_s_developing_Project_Hadar_">Who's developing Project Hadar?</h2><p>CD Projekt is developing Project Hadar. As of October 31, 2024--which is when the latest data was published--CD Projekt said it had 18 people working on Project Hadar. This was actually down from 20 people at the end of July 2024. As you can see in the chart below, the overwhelming majority of CD Projekt's developers are working on Polaris, which is the codename for The Witcher 4.</p><p>CD Projekt has evolved in recent years to become a bigger studio that is making multiple games simultaneously. In addition to Hadar and The Witcher 4, CD Projekt's teams are working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">remake of the original Witcher</a>, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-witcher-game-project-sirius-is-undergoing-some-changes/1100-6512512/" data-ref-id="1100-6512512">Witcher spin-off called Sirius. </a></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4433498-screenshot2025-01-24at1.55.44pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4433498" data-ratio="0.56085918854415" data-width="838" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4433498-screenshot2025-01-24at1.55.44pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4433498"></a><figcaption>Only a small number of CD Projekt developers are working on Hadar right now.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4433498-screenshot2025-01-24at1.55.44pm.png"></figure><h2 id="Project_Hadar_development_news">Project Hadar development news</h2><p>CD Projekt <a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1577317922460024834" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced Project Hadar in October 2022.</a> At the time, the studio said the game was "created from scratch" and was, at the time, in the "earliest stages of the creative process." At the time, the studio made it clear that it was not developing an actual game yet, but instead putting together the "foundation" for a game.</p><p>No one should expect Project Hadar to be released anytime soon. The Witcher 4 is the studio's current main focus, and it just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">entered full production at the end of 2024.</a></p><p>CD Projekt making a new IP is a major development for the studio, as the company is best known for its adaptations of other creator's works. The Witcher is based on Andrzej Sapkowski's novel series, while Cyberpunk 2077 is based on Mike Pondsmith's role-playing game.</p>

On top of all the other mechanics and features, this ends up being a lot of information to remember. It’s a bit of an abrupt surprise for a game that otherwise bills itself as being chill and cozy. There is no need to worry though! We’ve got you covered with a breakdown of every currency in <em>Infinity Nikki</em> along with their uses and how to get them.</p><h2 id="h48226"><a id="bling"></a>Bling</h2><figure id="" data-id="9c3e7441d7e881f0d56f4baeca4152de" data-recommend-id="image://9c3e7441d7e881f0d56f4baeca4152de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nikki points toward a pair of floating Bling on a rooftop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nikki points toward a pair of floating Bling on a rooftop." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9c3e7441d7e881f0d56f4baeca4152de" data-recommend-id="image://9c3e7441d7e881f0d56f4baeca4152de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nikki points toward a pair of floating Bling on a rooftop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Bling is the only currency that <em>technically</em> isn’t related to any gacha banners. It can be used on the Surprise-O-Matic, which is a separate gacha mechanic that’s accessible pretty early on. Bling can be used to purchase items and materials from merchants you encounter in-game. Upgrading outfits and Heart of Infinity nodes are also dependent on it.</p><p>Bling will be the currency you accumulate the most in terms of quantity. While everything else will be gathered in the hundreds and thousands, you’ll be able to surpass millions of Bling eventually. But in-game items and such do get pretty expensive, so it works out. . And don’t be surprised if you need to farm for some more Bling in the endgame.</p><p>In addition to quest rewards, Bling can be found all over the open world. You’re bound to find a lot simply by going out and exploring. Exchanging materials for some in the Realm of Escalation will be the go-to strategy for you later on.</p><h2 id="h48227"><a id="diamond"></a>Diamond</h2><figure id="" data-id="e650a4ce77bdad8b19ac01f65b4ced61" data-recommend-id="image://e650a4ce77bdad8b19ac01f65b4ced61" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Diamond tab on the store, showing the options to use them toward Resonite Crystals and Revelation Crystals." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Diamond tab on the store, showing the options to use them toward Resonite Crystals and Revelation Crystals." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e650a4ce77bdad8b19ac01f65b4ced61" data-recommend-id="image://e650a4ce77bdad8b19ac01f65b4ced61" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Diamond tab on the store, showing the options to use them toward Resonite Crystals and Revelation Crystals." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Perhaps the most important out of all the currencies, <strong>Diamond is used to purchase both Resonite and Revelation Crystals, which are needed to pull on the permanent and limited-time banners respectively.</strong> They can also be used for refilling Vital Energy, but I recommend trying to use them for Revelations Crystals only.</p><p>You won’t find Diamonds just laying around out in the wild, but there are many ways to earn a tiny amount here and there. Activating Warp Spires and opening chests will give you a nice amount early on. Play some more and you’ll receive them for leveling up, completing quests, and completing various challenges. No matter if you’re a F2P user or someone with a wallet at the ready, these are always worth getting more of.</p><h2 id="h48228"><a id="stellarite"></a>Stellarite</h2><figure id="" data-id="9d3d52370957b9dfe1a9b5ebac4d613e" data-recommend-id="image://9d3d52370957b9dfe1a9b5ebac4d613e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Stellarite tab on the store, showing the various bundles ranging from $0.99 to $99.99." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Stellarite tab on the store, showing the various bundles ranging from $0.99 to $99.99." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9d3d52370957b9dfe1a9b5ebac4d613e" data-recommend-id="image://9d3d52370957b9dfe1a9b5ebac4d613e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Stellarite tab on the store, showing the various bundles ranging from $0.99 to $99.99." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Stellarite is the sole premium currency in <em>Infinity Nikki</em>, meaning you have to spend real money to obtain these.</strong> They can then be applied directly toward special outfits or some feature packs with HP recovery items. The more common use is to convert them into Diamonds with a one-to-one ratio. Although you can’t use your real money directly for the gacha banner pulls, there are only a couple of currencies you need to transfer around to do just that.</p><p>Remember that Stellarite is only obtainable with real money. You shouldn’t hold out hope that they’ll offer these in events or through special redeemable codes. The next couple of currencies are what you might see pop up in those situations.</p><h2 id="h48229"><a id="resonite"></a>Resonite Crystal</h2><figure id="" data-id="5267e90c77485655c93caf54f448fa47" data-recommend-id="image://5267e90c77485655c93caf54f448fa47" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The permanent Distant Sea banner that requires Resonite Crystals.

It highlights four distinct looks for Nikki." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Infinity Nikki</em>’s primary gacha banners are pulled by spending two types of crystals. <strong>Resonite Crystals are used specifically for the permanent Distant Sea banner.</strong> The outfits you can get here won’t be leaving, so you don’t need to feel too urgent when it comes to pulling for this banner.</p><p>Your primary method for obtaining these crystals is by trading in other currencies, namely Diamonds, Surging Ebb, and Tranquility Droplets. You can also earn some here and there by raising your Stylist Rank, Mira level, or by progressing through the free track of the Mira Journey battle pass. Pay attention to any upcoming events since those can give some out as rewards too.</p><h2 id="h48230"><a id="revelation"></a>Revelation Crystal</h2><figure id="" data-id="e167f4a0c5a635269d902b9ae9348bd0" data-recommend-id="image://e167f4a0c5a635269d902b9ae9348bd0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The limited-time Blooming Fantasy banner that requires Revelation Crystals.

It highlights a fairy look and another that’s carrying a camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That brings us to the second and arguably more valuable crystal. <strong>Revelation Crystals are used to pull in the limited-time banners.</strong> Just like any other gacha, the idea will be to get as many of these as possible before using them all to hopefully get the item you want.</p><p>There will be temporary codes to redeem and the occasional mail reward offering some Revelation Crystals. Otherwise, you can get them by exchanging with other currencies or through the paid track of Mira Journey. If you’re looking to exchange but aren’t sure which crystals to go for, I recommend focusing on Revelation Crystals. The fact that these are only used for time-limited banners inherently makes them more valuable.</p><p>On a related note, you might also be wondering what the Limited-Time Revelation Crystals that come with events are. <strong>Limited-Time Revelation Crystals work the same way as the regular ones, but they’ll expire at the end of the current banner.</strong> This isn’t a common mechanic among gachas, although one of the developer’s previous works had this function. I suggest using these up before they expire. Even if the banner doesn’t interest you, it’s better to use them to get some new items than let them waste. </p><h2 id="h48231"><a id=""></a>Tranquility Droplets</h2><figure id="" data-id="a0a188b296ba90ec5f934a669c92995a" data-recommend-id="image://a0a188b296ba90ec5f934a669c92995a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tranquility Droplets tab in the store.

Play the game and grind for the stuff you want, but make sure to take some time to just ride some bikes and look cute doing it.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Four years after its launch, US sales of Xbox Series X/S are trailing behind those of its predecessor, Xbox One, at the same point in the consoles' life time. Sales of PlayStation 5, however, are now firmly outpacing PlayStation 4.
</p>
<p>
That's according to sales data from marketing research and technology company Circana (formerly The NPD Group) in its latest monthly report. Circana executive director and games industry analyst Mat Piscatella summarised the company's finding  - covering US games and hardware spending up to December 2024 - in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2ddgpqc2n">lengthy post</a> on Bluesky (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/us-ps5-sales-are-pacing-ahead-of-ps4-while-xbox-series-lags-behind-xbox-one/">VGC</a>).
</p>
<p>
Commenting on some of the reports highlights, Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lggkcxfw3c2f">wrote</a>, "Through each console's first 50 months in the US market (life to date ending Dec 2024 for both Xbox Series X/S and PS5), PS5 lifetime unit sales are 7 percent ahead of PS4's pace, while Xbox Series X/S trails Xbox One by 18 percent." By comparison, Piscatella noted, "Through 38 months in the US (through Dec 2023), PS5 led PS4 by 6 percent while Xbox Series X/S trailed Xbox One by 13 percent."

<p>
Circana's 2024 end-of-year report charts what Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2dpa7su2n">called</a> a "rough" 12 months for gaming hardware, with consumer spending falling 29 percent compared to last year. On a more granular level, spending on PS5 hardware fell by 18 percent (although it remained the best-selling platform in December) while Series X/S and Switch declined by 38 percent. This drop, however, was "expected" according to Piscatella, given Switch's substantial time on the market, and PS5 and Series X/S both being "past their selling peaks".
</p><p>
While specific hardware sales figures weren't disclosed, Sony last year revealed, amid declining year-on-year sales, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-totals-61m-units-sold-as-hardware-sales-continue-to-fall">61m PS5s have been shifted</a> since its launch in November 2020. Microsoft does not share sales figures for Xbox Series X/S, but it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-console-sales-decline-continues">also previously confirmed declining hardware sales</a> as it increasingly pushes Xbox as a hardware agnostic brand.
</p>
<p>
Piscatella's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2ddgpqc2n">full summary of Circana's latest report on US games and hardware trends</a> can be found on Bluesky and makes for an interesting read.

The primary reason to interact with this mechanic is to increase how many points your clothing scores during Styling Challenges.</p><p>Each Glow Up will require a certain amount of Bling, Threads of Purity, and Shiny Bubbles. The amount needed for each will increase each time you go through with an upgrade. Furthermore, a piece’s rarity will also affect how many resources are required.</p><h2 id="h164575"><a id="evolution"></a>Evolution</h2><figure id="" data-id="d0788b47e52289dfc8dd7b2ba7954400" data-recommend-id="image://d0788b47e52289dfc8dd7b2ba7954400" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Clothing Evolution screen with the Bubbly Voyage: Spring outfit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Clothing Evolution screen with the Bubbly Voyage: Spring outfit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d0788b47e52289dfc8dd7b2ba7954400" data-recommend-id="image://d0788b47e52289dfc8dd7b2ba7954400" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Clothing Evolution screen with the Bubbly Voyage: Spring outfit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Another method of upgrading is called Evolution, and its sole purpose is to unlock a recolor of an outfit.</strong> There isn’t a gameplay advantage for doing this as stats remain the same as the original look. Any 4-star outfit will only have a single recolor to evolve into, but those with a 5-star rarity have three.</p><p>The requirements to go through an Evolution are dependent on a few factors. Ability Outfits you craft during the main quest line need the following:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>A duplicate of each item that makes the outfit</li><li>Bling</li><li>Threads of Purity</li><li>Calm Thoughts</li></ul><p>Any Ability Outfits you acquire from a banner can also evolve, but they’ll just need a duplicate set. That might sound easy at first, however, you’ll need to get these duplicate items from the banners as well. Time and a little bit of luck will be necessary to get enough of the items. Don’t be surprised if you’re suddenly tempted to fork over a bit of cash to get crystals and make more pulls on the banner.</p><p><strong>Outfits with a 5-star rarity are the most difficult to evolve.</strong> They can go through the process a total of three times, with only the final recolor requiring a set of duplicates. The first two evolutions will instead require a Heartshine to unlock the new duds. Heartshines are solely unlocked through the Deep Echoes mechanic of each banner, which rewards you with items for making various amounts of pulls. You can look forward to getting them after making around 180 pulls. Additionally, Heartshines are unique to each banner. If you complete a 5-star outfit and then decide to go for their evolved versions, you’ll need to grind out or pay for a lot of crystals.</p><hr><p><br><em>Infinity Nikki</em> can be downright overwhelming with its many systems, especially if you’re new to Gachas. Hopefully you have a better understanding of how to upgrade outfits so you can ace those Styling Challenges and look damn good while doing mundane activities. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was a surprise reveal that came alongside confirmation that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-at-microsofts-xbox-developer-direct-2025">Microsoft is set to publish Ninja Gaiden 4</a> across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S (including Game Pass day one) later in 2025. For more, here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-2025-everything-announced">everything announced during Microsoft's Xbox Developer Direct 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb on Ninja Gaiden 2 Black:</p><blockquote>In Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, players assume the role of Ryu Hayabusa, a deadly ninja who wields the legendary Dragon Sword while embarking on a global battle against a series of formidable foes. The beautiful and bloody remaster utilizes Unreal Engine 5 to significantly enhance the graphic expression, elevating everything from character visuals to environmental backgrounds. In fact, the stages, characters, effects, and lighting have all been completely redesigned and remastered to fully immerse gamers into the story’s dark ninja world.</blockquote><blockquote>Gore elements such as dismemberment and blood have also been remastered to enhance the action experience. The high-speed, violent fights play out in brilliant brutality, utilizing a variety of weapons and techniques including Japanese swords, shurikens, Kusari-gamas, and tonfas. Meanwhile, those looking for a more toned-down experience can simply toggle the dismemberment feature on and off in the Options menu.</blockquote><blockquote>In addition, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black includes extra elements from the spin-off titles released after the original game’s debut, including the ability to control three additional characters: Momiji, Ayane, and Rachel. The remaster also includes “HERO PLAY STYLE”, a mode for beginners that provides automatic support in the most difficult situations, making the notoriously challenging title more accessible for those who may not be so confident in their action skills.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/23/ninja-gaiden-4-developer-direct-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Xbox Wire</u></a>, Team Ninja boss Fumihiko Yasuda explained the decision to remaster Ninja Gaiden 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This simultaneous announcement and same-day release alongside Ninja Gaiden 4 might have caught some people by surprise,” he said. “The biggest reason for developing Ninja Gaiden 2 Black was to address the concerns of core fans who might be wondering, ‘What’s going to happen to Ryu Hayabusa?’ We also wanted to give players something to enjoy as they wait for the release of Ninja Gaiden 4. We chose Ninja Gaiden 2 because it stands as one of the most solid action games in the series. We added ‘Black’ to the title to signal to fans that this is the definitive version, much like Ninja Gaiden Black was for the first game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yasuda continued: "This version is crafted to satisfy both those who played the original and newcomers discovering it as a current-generation action game. We’ve meticulously incorporated some of the additions of Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 while staying true to the challenge and feel of the original 360 version, including its signature gore and violence. We’ve also adjusted the weapon upgrade system to more align with the original release.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Ninja’s infamously challenging Ninja Gaiden series has a long association with Xbox. The developer’s reboot of the action series launched first on Xbox in 2004, propelling master ninja Ryu Hayabusa into the mainstream. Ninja Gaiden Black, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-ninja-gaiden-black-is-the-best-pure-action-game-of-all-time"><u>considered one of the greatest action games of all time</u></a>, launched the following year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja Gaiden 2 came out in 2008 published by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox 360. Ninja Gaiden 3 followed in 2012 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Since then, fans have had the critically panned spin-off Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z, and, more recently, Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection, a compilation of Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, and Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The Tomb features a fan-favorite Wonder Weapon, which deals elemental damage and provides an additional way to heal downed teammates.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of the Citadelle des Morts final cutscene, Gabriel Krafft tells the crew to take the amulet they've acquired to an excavation site in France. As seen in the trailer below, the crew finds itself at the dig site, which features underground tombs and a subterranean temple.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlvFuhlYRMg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tlvFuhlYRMg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Gameplay for The Tomb shows off all these various layers of the map, and it gives us an even better look at the map's Wonder Weapon in action. The Tomb features the Staff of Ice Wonder Weapon, which is familiar to those who played the popular Origins map from 2012's Call of Duty: Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">The Staff of Ice is capable of firing icy blasts at enemies, slowing or freezing them in place, as well as dealing a more devastating area-of-effect attack. It also has the ability to heal, and the trailer shows a crew member using the Wonder Weapon to fire a restorative blast to revive a downed teammate.</p><p dir="ltr">Origins is one of the most beloved Zombies maps of all time, and while this is only one of the four elemental staffs featured in the original Black Ops 2 map, it's really nice to see the staff return after all these years. Plus, having another way to heal teammates is always a bonus.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 2 also adds the Death Perception perk from Black Ops 4, and augments will be available to unlock to upgrade the perk. Three more Gobblegums are introduced, including one Whimsical Gobblegum that dresses all the zombies with rubber ducky flotation devices.</p><p dir="ltr">All the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-roadmap-details-terminator-event-new-mp-maps-and-warzone-improvements/2900-6155/#1">highlights of Season 2's content can be found here</a>, which includes brand-new multiplayer maps, a Terminator crossover event, and ninja-themed operators.</p>

Such is the case with the <em>Sniper Elite</em> franchise, which continues to embrace the stealth and sniping experience with increasingly realistic mechanics. If you’re new to the series and want to know what you’ve been missing, here’s a brief rundown of <em>Sniper Elite</em> and all of the games released so far.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195734" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195734,196411,195189" data-current="195734"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21246.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h4074"><a id="expect"></a>What to expect from the Sniper Elite franchise</h2><p>With the exception of two VR titles, the <em>Sniper Elite </em>franchise stars American OSS operative, Karl Fairburne, a deadly sniper with a penchant for getting shit done. As Karl, players infiltrate various Nazi strongholds during World War II in his quests to take out high-ranking officials, gather important intel, and work to stop the Nazis from gaining nuclear power. </p><figure id="" data-id="d89ed65c4400496900964317254b0f10" data-recommend-id="image://d89ed65c4400496900964317254b0f10" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A first-person perspective of a sniper scope shows a soldier getting shot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A first-person perspective of a sniper scope shows a soldier getting shot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d89ed65c4400496900964317254b0f10" data-recommend-id="image://d89ed65c4400496900964317254b0f10" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A first-person perspective of a sniper scope shows a soldier getting shot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Sniper Elite</em>’s gameplay is built around intense stealth, letting players loose in medium-sized sandbox levels where they’re tasked with completing various main and side objectives without being caught by Nazi forces. Doing so requires distracting enemies, knocking out or killing them, and even hiding their bodies.</p><p>And while much of this can be completed with some melee takedowns and a wide selection of traps, sometimes you just have to resort to popping noggins with a sniper. This is where things get the most fun, too, as the franchise takes a relatively realistic approach to sniping, requiring you to mask your shots using lightning or loud nearby events, as well as learn how wind and bullet drop will affect your shots.</p><figure id="" data-id="101b6aad1015d9818363d68608aa16d3" data-recommend-id="image://101b6aad1015d9818363d68608aa16d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An X-ray image shows a bullet entering a soldier's body." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An X-ray image shows a bullet entering a soldier's body." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="101b6aad1015d9818363d68608aa16d3" data-recommend-id="image://101b6aad1015d9818363d68608aa16d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An X-ray image shows a bullet entering a soldier's body." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Perhaps most thrilling of all, though, is the series’ famous X-ray kill cam, which will often slow down time to show your bullet travel from your rifle to its target, then give you a view of their innards as the bullet penetrates their organs in graphic detail. Whether it’s blowing brain matter out of the back of their heads, exploding their kidneys, or (if you’re truly sadistic) even blasting open their testicles, you’re always in for a gory good time.</p><h2 id="h4075"><a id="games"></a>How many <em>Sniper Elite</em> games are there?</h2><figure id="" data-id="abb8bfdbe46bf159f474962b54e646cc" data-recommend-id="image://abb8bfdbe46bf159f474962b54e646cc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sniper fires a gun at soldiers below him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A sniper fires a gun at soldiers below him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="abb8bfdbe46bf159f474962b54e646cc" data-recommend-id="image://abb8bfdbe46bf159f474962b54e646cc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sniper fires a gun at soldiers below him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are eight games in the <em>Sniper Elite</em> franchise as of January 30, 2025. Luckily, <strong>each game has a standalone story, meaning you don’t need to have played any previous titles to understand what’s going on</strong>. A vague reference to past events here or there may catch the ears of the most dedicated fans, but rest assured you’re not missing any pivotal information by jumping into the series wherever you’d like.</p><p>The release order of the mainline series is as follows:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Sniper Elite </em>(2005)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite V2</em> (2012)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite III</em> (2014)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite 4</em> (2017)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite VR</em> (2021)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite 5</em> (2022)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite VR: Winter Warrior</em> (2023)</li><li><em>Sniper Elite: Resistance </em>(2025)</li></ul><p>In addition to the mainline franchise, a spin-off franchise known as <em>Nazi Zombie Army</em> uses similar mechanics (including the beloved X-ray kill cam) while pitting players against an onslaught of zombies. This alternate history series contains four games so far, with the first three being bundled on modern platforms under the title <em>Zombie Army Trilogy</em>. Meanwhile, the most recent game, <em>Zombie Army 4: Dead War</em>, can be purchased separately.</p><p><br>Clearly, there are plenty of games in the <em>Sniper Elite</em> series that are waiting to be enjoyed, but if you just want to dive into the latest and greatest, you can start with <em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em> on January 30. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
