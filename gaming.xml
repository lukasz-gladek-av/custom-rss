			<p>Gaming audio remains a crucial, but often under-appreciated aspect of the experience. That’s downright criminal when composers like Gareth Coker, Bear McCreary and Masayoshi Soken are bearing their souls, but there is a way to make things right. Buy yourself a gaming headset and make sure that audio sounds as good as humanly possible. If we’re getting serious about things, then Corsair’s latest, the Virtuoso Max, should be on your radar, but if you want a serious headset, you’re going to have to pay a serious price for it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing VIRTUOSO MAX WIRELESS - Sounds So Good, It Changes Everything" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bks_UB64Xto?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Virtuoso Max is big. I’d even go so far as to say it’s massive. Over the years I’ve tested a multitude of headsets, and alongside Razer’s Nari headset line, this is one of the largest I’ve used. That’s balanced out somewhat by the amount of tech that Corsair have shoved inside the Virtuoso Max, and the extremely premium feel that the entire headset boasts.</p>


<p>That size begins with the included leatherette case. It’s a wonderful thing for keeping your headset free of dust and damage, but it’s going to take up a large chunk of anyone’s rucksack in return. Inside, the Virtuoso Max is snuggly nestled into specially-designed cavities, while there’s also space for the charging cable, and the removable microphone boom arm.</p>
<p>The leather of the case ties into the external surface of the headband, embossed with some Corsair branding, and immediately setting the tone for the rest of the headset’s build. The joints, sizing spacers and the earpieces are all fabricated from brushed metal, cool to the touch, weighty, and practically indestructible. Each earpiece boasts a moveable dial, one used for controlling the volume and the other chat balance, though you can customise these as you choose. These are so smooth and seamless that interacting with them feels… well, powerful. You have absolute control, and there’s no hint of the cheaper materials that you might find in other headsets.</p>

<p>Three sectors of an RGB circle on each earpiece, and you can alter these to a colour or effect of your choice, or, if you’re a major Corsair proponent on PC, you can sync the lighting up with your PC case and its innards. I loved this feature, not least because I’ve got several Corsair components, and it took mere moments to have rainbow effects dancing across my head, and being reflected onto the walls. My partner will tell you that this is both unnecessary, and visually annoying, but I will tell you it’s cool, and I’m pretty sure I’m right on this one.</p>
<p>Those earpieces are adorned with mesh-covered memory foam pads, and here’s where I’m most torn about the Virtuoso Max. We’ll get to how they sound – excellent, if you want a taster – but, the comfort levels aren’t quite where I’d hoped they would be.</p>

<p>The earpieces are firmer than you’d expect, and given that that’s the primary and most obvious point you interact with the headset, I wanted something softer and more forgiving, like the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/18/nacon-rig-600-pro-hs-wicked-cushions-special-edition-review/">Nacon 600’s Wicked Cushions</a> upgrade, or the still-great Astro A50’s incredibly plush ear cushions. It’s not that the Virtuoso Max are uncomfortable, they’re not, but I expected something more luxurious when they’re sitting at the top end of the premium gaming headset bracket.</p>
<p>The headband padding is a lot gentler though, and thanks to this you can wear the Virtuoso Max through many hours of gaming, without pain or weariness setting in. The premium build does mean that they’re weightier than a number of other headsets, so that’s worth considering if you’re particularly intolerant of a heavier pair of headphones, but I didn’t find it an issue.</p>
<p>The Virtuoso Max comes in an Xbox and PlayStation flavour, but you’ll really want the former if you want to use it cross-platform – this will work with basically everything thanks to a simple double tap of the Custom button switching between PC/PlayStation/Switch or Xbox. Connection is via the 2.4 GHz USB-A wireless dongle or over Bluetooth, and as we’re seeing more and more often, you can be connected to both your mobile by Bluetooth and your gaming device via the dongle at the same time. That means it’s much easier to stay in touch with your real-world life, which may or may not be a benefit for you, or to listen to your own music if you’re set on destroying a game developer’s carefully constructed medieval RPG atmosphere with some K-pop.</p>
<p>Via the wireless connection the audio is simply stunning. It is rich, detailed and enveloping, dragging you to the centre of the action with the sheer clarity the Virtuoso Max offers. I’ve been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor ReFantazio</a> every day for weeks, and the gorgeous vocal-led soundtrack sounded vibrant and immediately affecting, its unusual tones made all the more striking by the audio delivery. Similarly, I’ve also returned to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/22/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review/">Final Fantasy XIV</a>, experiencing Soken’s dramatic compositions with new-found details thanks to the Virtuoso Max. If you’re looking for top-tier gaming audio, the Virtuoso Max handily delivers it.</p>

<p>That’s made all the better with the inclusion of Active Noise Cancellation. The Virtusoso Max eliminates an impressive amount of external noise – helped in part by its firmer ear cushions and already-good passive isolation – and blocks out a good degree of extraneous noise like dishwashers and background traffic. It struggles a little more with percussive noises, like typing on my mechanical keyboard, but overall it helps you to focus in on your game, or to really appreciate the audio design of the game you’re playing.</p>
<p>It deals well with everything, including music, and I’ve spent a great deal of time with both the soundtrack to Arcane’s Season 2, and the new Linkin Park album, both of which were nailed by the Virtuoso Max. The Arcane-specific reworked version of Heavy Is The Crown simply sounds stunning, Emily Armstrong and Mike Shinoda’s vocals carrying power and precision over the atmospheric instrumentation.</p>
<p>That clarity doesn’t quite carry over to the Bluetooth connection, and there’s a distinct step down in terms of audio quality compared to the bespoke wireless option. That’s not surprising in the scheme of things – listening to high bitrate audio over the two different mediums is always going to leave the Bluetooth side of things suffering, particularly when the Corsair Max can only handle basic SDC and AAC codecs – &nbsp;but there isn’t the buoyancy or life that you find via the wireless dongle.</p>
<p>There’s two microphone options, with an in-built mic perfect for picking up a phone call, while the detachable mic arm offers a huge upgrade in terms of performance. Firstly, the mic arm is strong and flexible, attaching via a bespoke USB-C socket, and once attached there’s no chance of it being knocked out. You can then angle the mic into exactly the position you want, where it will then stay throughout your play session until you push it back out of the way or remove it. Its performance is excellent, with teammates commenting on how clear the audio was in comparison to the ageing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/13/razer-nari-ultimate-headset-review/">Razer Nari Ultimate</a> that I often grab.</p>

<p>Corsair have given you a huge amount of control over the Virtuoso Max via their iCUE software, letting you customise your audio via the EQ, tinker with the control setup, and alter the RGB lighting. Pushing the microphone performance even further is the inclusion of NVIDIA Broadcast technologies, and once you’ve downloaded the additional software it adds the option of background noise removal from your input, giving you incremental control over the strength of the effect, and letting you pre-record your voice to see exactly how it sounds.</p>
<p>At £279.99, the Virtusoso Max is well priced amongst the top-end of the premium headset market, and if you’re after one of the best-sounding headsets out there, it’s well worth considering. Alternatively, the Steelseries Arctis Nova Pro (£329.99) and the renewed Logitech G Astro A50 X (£319.99) offer similar multi-platform tech while both being arguably more comfortable. There’s also the Turtle Beach Stealth Pro, which, alongside the Nova Pro, share the very cool dual battery option, but when the Virtuoso Max boasts a 60hr battery life (without RGB), it’s not really something that’s a definitive win for either headset.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-patch-notes-doctor-strange-portal-ult-1851717418<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>is just under a week old and has already got its first big patch. NetEase’s update doesn’t have any balance changes, instead being focused on bug fixes. However, there’s slight overlap, as one glitch the patch fixes effectively gives the Vanguard Doctor Strange a bit of a nerf. That’s because fans had discovered a way to immediately charge the Sorcerer Supreme’s ultimate ability to full with just one well-placed portal.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20241210/41548_1199072.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20241210/41548_1199072.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full patch notes</a></span> run down all the bugs and fixes squashed in the update, several of which are mundane things like players getting caught in a map’s geometry or graphical hitches. But the big one is a change to Doctor Strange’s ultimate charge that specifically addresses any environmental kills the character pulls off. A common strategy for Doctor Strange players is to create a portal in front of an enemy spawn room and have it open up above a hole on the map so your foes fall to their deaths. Due to an apparent glitch, this would boost Doctor Strange’s ultimate charge to nearly 100 percent.</p><p>As a temporary fix, NetEase is disabling the portals’ terrain kill attribution, meaning that the game will not register these deaths as Doctor Strange’s kills. As such, a Strange player will not receive any of the passive benefits like ult charge or scoreboard kills for this strategy. NetEase says it will be reinstating those benefits in a future update, but only after it has been able to address the ultimate charge bug. It’s a slight bummer, but portals are still effective in getting an easy team kill.</p><p>The full patch notes read as follows:</p><h2 id="h540568"><a id=""></a><strong><em>General</em></strong></h2><p><em>· When playing highlights and recordings, crosshair deviation would be significant, and there was a possibility for lag.

This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em> - During matches, disconnecting and reconnecting could cause desynchronization of some doors (i.e., a door looked to be closed, but the player could walk through; a door looked to be open, but the player couldn’t walk through). This issue has been resolved.</em></p><p><em>· Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven - Eldritch Monument:</em><br><em> - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Adam Warlock used his Ultimate, his teammates would potentially revive and be stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform.

<p>It has been officially announced that Conan the Barbarian will join Mortal Kombat 1 on January 21, 2025.</p>



<p>The announcement came from <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1866488904121282808" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ed Boon</a> on X (formerly Twitter), which showed a brief snippet of Conan the Barbarian in action.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>According to leakers, Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 from Terminator 2 are some of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-cancelled-after-poor-expansion-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last characters to be coming to the Mortal Kombat 1 roster</a>. Rumors suggest that Kombat Pack 3 and the second-story expansion for Mortal Kombat 1 have since been canceled due to poor expansion sales. Several Mortal Kombat insiders have since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-mortal-kombat-insiders-say-that-future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-is-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corroborated the claims</a> since the original rumor.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has contacted NetherRealm Studios for comment on the claims.</p>



<p>Will you be playing Conan the Barbarian in Mortal Kombat 1 on January 21, 2025?</p>

                <p>After an 11-year gap between games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/path-of-exile-2-release-date-early-access-and-eveything-we-know/2900-5988/" data-ref-id="2900-5988">Path of Exile 2</a> got off to a hot start earlier this month with its early-access period. Although fans have responded very favorably to the game so far, Path of Exile 2 developer Grinding Gear Games has already taken in player feedback for some post-launch changes.</p><p>In a post on Path of Exile 2's <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611705" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a>, the developer noted that some of the most pressing issues have already been addressed with a new update, while others will be fixed in an upcoming patch. One area that Grinding Gear is moving more cautiously on is item-drop frequency. To give players more rewards, the number of rare monsters is being increased, while more valuable drops can be earned from defeating the extra-difficult rare monsters that appear later in the game.</p><p>Some of the adjustments being saved for a later patch include dodge-roll modifications that will make it easier to avoid being trapped by monsters, the ability to teleport between saved checkpoints, the addition of more checkpoints, and a change to the minimap that will make rare monsters appear when there are 200 remaining, instead of 50 remaining.</p><p>Grinding Gear previously announced that Path of Exile 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-on-ps5-and-xbox-will-have-couch-co-op-with-cross-progression/1100-6523835/" data-ref-id="1100-6523835">features cross-play and cross-progression</a> across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. The publisher also assured players that the sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-wont-replace-the-first-game-after-all/1100-6516398/" data-ref-id="1100-6516398">isn't replacing the original Path of Exile</a>. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-passes-over-1-million-early-access-players-dev-warns-of-server-struggles/1100-6528281/" data-ref-id="1100-6528281">Path of Exile 2 rushed passed the 1 million players</a> mark in early access.</p><p>The notes for Path of Exile 2's 0.1.0c patch are reproduced below.</p><ul><li>Campaign bosses killed after the first kill will now drop less currency items, replacing them with other items.</li><li>Increased the drop rate of Regal Orbs.</li><li>Significantly increased the drop rate of Gemcutter's Prisms.</li><li>A single Gemcutter's Prism also improves the Quality of a Skill Gem by +5% (previously +1%).</li><li>Lowered the drop rate of Chaos Orbs and distributed it amongst the other more valued Currency Items (Like Regal Orbs, Exalted Orbs).</li><li>Lowered the drop rate of Artificer's Orbs and distributed it to Lesser Jeweller's Orbs.</li><li>Disenchanting Rare Items with 6 Modifiers now provides 2 Regal Shards (previously 1). The value displayed will still show as 1 until a later patch.</li><li>Increased the values of all Prefix Modifiers that can roll on Waystones. We've also adjusted the chances of getting the more commonly powerful Modifiers such as increases to Rarity and Pack Size.</li><li>Monster Modifiers now grant higher amounts of Item Rarity and Item Quantity. This is most common on Magic and Rare enemies, but also affects Unique Enemies if applied through various Endgame Mechanics like the Deadly Evolution Keystone.</li><li>Increased the chance for Rare Monsters in Maps to have 3 or 4 modifiers.</li><li>Rare Monsters in Map areas are now revealed on the minimap when there are 200 Monsters remaining (previously 50).</li><li>Fixed a bug where some Persistent Buff Skills, such as Raging Spirits and Mana Remnants, were not working for the Infernalist when in Demon Form.</li><li>Fixed a bug where you could sometimes be unable to interact with the Map Device in The Ziggurat Refuge.</li><li>Fixed a bug where Monsters Shattered in a Blood Circle Ultimatum Encounter were not contributing blood.</li><li>Fixed a bug that could cause the instance to permanently stop time (freeze) when trying to revive a Chronomancer.</li><li>Fixed a bug where Rare Monsters could not be found within the Chimeral Wetlands.</li><li>Fixed a bug where "Move only" was name-locking.</li><li>Fixed three instance crashes.</li><li>Fixed a client crash.</li></ul>

                <p>New information continues to come to light about the suspect in the brazen killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, including a connection to the world of video games. The suspect, 26-year-old Luigi Mangione, worked at Civilization studio Firaxis Games, a spokesperson confirmed to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/493418/uhc-shooter-shooting-suspect-luigi-mangione-arrest-firaxis-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>.</p><p>What appears to be <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luigi-mangione/details/experience/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mangione's LinkedIn page</a> states that he worked as a UI programming intern at Firaxis from May 2016-August 2017; he said he fixed more than 300 UI bugs in the game. Also in 2016, Mangione's alleged LinkedIn page says he was the founder and president of <a href="https://pennupgrade.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Upgrade,"</a> a game development and research team at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Following his Firaxis internship, Mangione's subsequent career roles were seemingly outside of the game development scene.</p><p>Mangione was arrested on Monday, December 9, after he was spotted at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He was later charged with the murder of Thompson in Manhattan on the morning of December 4. Mangione is currently detained in Pennsylvania; he is expected to be extradited to New York to face charges.</p><p>According to a law enforcement source talking to <a href="https://apnews.com/live/unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-updates-day-6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Associated Press</a>, Mangione was in possession of a three-page, handwritten letter that said in part, "I state plainly that I wasn't working with anyone." The note reportedly added, "I do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites had it coming."</p><p>Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks said in a court appearance that Mangione had $10,000 in cash when he was detained, including $2,000 in foreign currency. Police said they found a black, 3D-printed pistol and a 3D-printed black suppressor in Mangione's backpack. Police documents said Mangione "became quiet and started to shake" after being asked if he had been in New York recently.</p>

            <p>
A maker of gaming hardware accessories has removed a trailer that showed the blurry outline of what was clearly intended to be Nintendo's under-wraps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
Accessories manufacturer Satisfye is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">next company to begin selling peripherals for Switch 2</a> - even though Nintendo is yet to formally announce the Switch successor or detail how it'll look. 
</p>
<p>
Product <a href="https://www.satisfye.com/products/zengrip-2-bundle">pages</a> for the ZenGrip 2, a Switch 2 console grip, and a carry case for Nintendo's next console are still live. (Neither specifically use the name "Switch" anywhere, though state they are "Made for Next Gen Console" with the image of a current-gen Switch.)
</p>
<p>
However, a trailer for the products which featured hardware docked into the Switch 2 grip has now been removed - although not before the internet took notice. 
</p>
<p>
It's worth noting that the ZenGrip 2's product page states that it is an "Expected Design" and that the accessory "will be tuned to final specifications". That said, now only three months (at most) away from Switch 2 finally being shown, the device's form factor is fairly well known.
</p>
<p>
While some console companies do share product specifications with third-parties ahead of launch to speed up peripheral production, it's likely we've already seen a relatively-final version of Switch 2 via previous leaks. 
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Purported images of the Switch 2 shell have been floating around online for several months, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">Digital Foundry dubbed as "almost certainly real"</a>. These show a console almost identical in form factor to the current Switch, albeit with a larger screen size, a second small button on the right Joy-Con,  and what look to be magnet attachments on each Joy-Con's side.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-designs-posted-by-3d-model-enthusiast-setting-internets-tongues-wagging">3D-printed plans for Switch 2 based on leaks</a> also exist, which fans have been 3D printing versions of for months just for kicks.
</p>
<p>
Has ZenGrip 2 got insider knowledge? Is it simply trying to get ahead of the competition with a neat stunt to gain attention? Or why not both?
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is yet to announce any details of its next console, other than to confirm it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">will announce Switch 2 properly before 31st March 2025</a>, the end of its current financial year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/astrometica-early-access-preview-empty-space-in-more-ways-than-one<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Space survival crafting title&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55334a98-ed16-459b-82d9-b2284972d02a" href="https://techraptor.net/games/astrometica" rel="nofollow"><strong><em>Astrometica</em></strong></a>&nbsp;has launched into Early Access, letting us explore what it has to offer the genre. A well-polished game, it centers around a survivor of a large spaceship explosion. Crashing into an asteroid belt, you're looking for other survivors, a way to remain alive, and a way home. There are signs of humanity left behind, but no one else is seen throughout your time floating through space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My favorite part of&nbsp;<em>Astrometica</em>&nbsp;is the music. Going through space and listening to ethereal vibes that brought me back to my childhood days in the 90s really hit a high note. It feels like space, the largeness, being full and empty all at once. I could sit there and just listen to the music for hours as it fully enhances the gameplay experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astrometica-mining-tool-space-view.jpg?itok=GmWZfz5C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astrometica-mining-tool-space-view.jpg?itok=wje8krdd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That feeling of empty space is prevalent in&nbsp;<em>Astrometica.</em>&nbsp;While this lends itself to the feeling of being alone and without aid, it also works against the game. There's simply not enough to explore or do. You can fully explore the available area, visit the story locations, build a base and vehicles, and still be done in about 10-15 hours. This includes the many, many deaths&nbsp; There are multiple areas labeled WIP, including the two warp locations you discover.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even the story feels empty. You've crash-landed in an asteroid belt. There's another group of survivors from the same ship. While you find one of them, you don't find the other two or learn what happened to them. Along with the notes they've left behind, there are logs from the original miners of the asteroid belt. This story points towards a mysterious force and alien invasion. You encounter some of these aliens in one location, but beyond that, there's only one other enemy to watch out for. There's no conclusion to either storyline, no solution to the mystery, nothing. This will hopefully be wrapped up as more content is added during early access.</p>

<p>These logs and messages are left behind in the locations you explore. If you don't pay attention to them, however, you can easily forget there's even a storyline pushing you forward. This isn't that unusual for survival titles that focus on crafting, but crafting in <i>Astrometica</i>&nbsp;is basic, with few variations in modules you can build, vehicles, and crafting devices. There's a single plant you can grow, basic combinations for cooking, and a limited number of upgrades for equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astrometica-base-building-build-tool.jpg?itok=iye50Ikd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astrometica-base-building-build-tool.jpg?itok=wdwMqPZz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It seems like the focus of BeryMery was on fine-tuning and polishing the experience, instead of shoving in a bunch of content that may be buggy. There was a single bug that I experienced during the course of the preview, where a gold bar turned into a tool. This happened one other time when collecting ore, but it didn't affect the overall gameplay. Music didn't cut in and out, items worked as intended, and crafting was simple and didn't result in a janky base with pieces clipping into one another. There was no clipping, so much so that I died multiple times from running into asteroid pieces, part of my base, and even my vehicle.&nbsp;That polish is great for an Early Access game that's expected to be buggy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm hoping that further development of the title with access to WIP areas will expand upon the story and available activities. As it stands,&nbsp;<em>Astrometica</em>&nbsp;feels like an addition to another title versus a main game. There's nothing that drew me to keep playing, nothing that stands out as a wow factor differentiating it from the competition. It is an extremely well-crafted game, but that's simply not enough for me to consistently follow and play an Early Access title among a sea of games.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-seasons-ending-in-january-offline-mode<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rocksteady and Warner Bros have announced that&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>'s fourth season will serve as its last, and that you'll be able to play the superhero third-person shooter offline starting from today.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-4-deep-dive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Season 4 deep dive blog post</a> on the game's official website, Rocksteady says that Season 4's eighth episode, which will debut in January, will "serve as the last seasonal Episode" for&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>, and that "the Suicide Squad's crusade against Brainiac is drawing to an end".</p>

<p>Although seasons are ending, there is a silver lining.&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s offline mode, which Rocksteady <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-offline" rel="nofollow">confirmed would eventually happen back in December last year</a>, is being introduced today as part of Season 4's seventh episode.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasons-ending-deathstroke.jpg?itok=TpPGMxq1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasons-ending-deathstroke.jpg?itok=5oevYSej 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Suicide Squad</em>'s fourth season brings an offline mode, and it also brings Deathstroke.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Suicide Squad</em>'s offline mode will let you experience everything that's been released for the game without needing to be connected to the internet, and you'll even be able to copy over your online profile to create a new offline file.</p>

<p>What's more, all of your cosmetics and the other content you've purchased will be available via the offline mode. You can check out <a href="https://dcgamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/36119520746515-OFFLINE-MODE-FAQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rocksteady's FAQ</a> if you want more info about how&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s offline mode will work.</p>

<p>A new playable character is also being introduced in this season in the form of Deathstroke, who has three distinct playstyles: Assassin, Mercenary, and Strategist. As you'd expect, each carries its own Talents to distribute as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasons-ending-tentacle.jpg?itok=6NYzU9n3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasons-ending-tentacle.jpg?itok=yRjH4k66 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like Rocksteady is ready to move on from&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>'s demise probably shouldn't come as a surprise. Back in February, Warner Bros admitted that sales of the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">had been disappointing</a>; in fact, it was the major contributing factor to a $200 million writedown for the studio's gaming division.</p>

<p>In September, developer Rocksteady was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs</a>&nbsp;mainly focused on the QA division, with Rocksteady employees reportedly directly citing&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s underperformance as the reason for the layoffs.</p>

<p>As for what Rocksteady's up to now, the studio is apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report" rel="nofollow">helping out with a Director's Cut version</a> of&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter&nbsp;</em>RPG&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and it's also reportedly looking to pitch a new single-player game. Let's hope it meets with more success than&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/funko-and-brandshield-deny-causing-itch-io-phishing-claim-shutdown.1056699/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/funko-brandshield-itch-io-denial<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Collectible company Funko and "online brand protection" software suite BrandShield have both denied causing yesterday's takedown of Itch.io, which resulted in the storefront being taken offline for several hours.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Itch.io site owner Leaf Corcoran <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itchio-offline-funko-phishing-brandshield" rel="nofollow">said that a "bogus phishing report" had been made</a> on behalf of toy company Funko, with the report apparently coming from an AI-powered software suite called BrandShield, which Funko apparently uses.</p>

<p>Corcoran elaborated that the request pertained to a fan page for action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Funko Fusion&nbsp;</em>on Itch.io, and while a request of this nature would usually take the form of a DMCA takedown, a "fraud and phishing" report was issued instead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/itch.io-funko-brandshield-takedown-denial.jpg?itok=XVcGvsf- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/itch.io-funko-brandshield-takedown-denial.jpg?itok=WG2-GJBd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Both Funko and BrandShield deny taking down Itch.io.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/originalfunko/status/1866255848366039468" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement on social media platform X</a>, Funko says "a takedown request was issued" for the specific&nbsp;<em>Funko Fusion&nbsp;</em>fan page Corcoran referred to, not for the whole site; Funko is adamant that it "did not request a takedown of the Itch.io platform".</p>

<p>For its part, meanwhile, BrandShield <a href="https://x.com/BrandShieldltd/status/1866161489528180988" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a>&nbsp;its AI platform "detects potential threats and provides analysis", and that "an abuse was detected" on an Itch.io page. Like Funko, BrandShield says it requested a "takedown" of the specific URL in question and not the Itch.io domain as a whole.</p>

<p>BrandShield goes on to say that the decision to take down the Itch.io domain as a whole was "made by the service providers" and not by BrandShield.</p>

<p>As readers on X point out, though, the request that was made to Itch.io's domain registrar wasn't a standard DMCA takedown notice; it was a "fraud and phishing" request, which is likely to have different - and probably far more drastic - response protocols from domain registrars.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/funko-fusion-hot-fuzz.jpg?itok=JKnJM0zr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/funko-fusion-hot-fuzz.jpg?itok=5waE8B_Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>All of this apparently started because of an Itch.io&nbsp;<em>Funko Fusion&nbsp;</em>fan page.</figcaption></figure><p>Things get stranger, though, if <a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866239798924763227" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> by Itch.io yesterday is to be believed.</p>

<p>In the post, Corcoran says that Funko "just called [his] mom", sharing a screenshot of a message allegedly from his mother in which she says she received a "strange call from a company about accusatory statements on your social media account".</p>

<p>Corcoran says the message from his mom is "not a joke", and if that's the case, then it's not the best look in the world for Funko, especially since users seem to be rallying around Itch.io in this matter. We'll bring you more as we get it.</p>

<p>In the latest Black Myth: Wukong update, which is being deployed later today, players will be invited to take part in a new ‘boss rush’ challenge mode. This mode is split into two branches, and it’ll see players select former opponents to battle across a range of difficulty levels.</p>



<p>Game Science also revealed a new ‘Journeyer’s Chart’ mechanic, as well as a fresh set of armour, a new soundtrack application, and dozens of bug fixes.</p>



<p>Read on for the full scope of the next Black Myth: Wukong update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-for-a-challenge">Prepare for a Challenge</h2>



<p>Per an update published by Game Science, the new boss rush mode introduces two core challenges:</p>



<ul>
<li>Return of Rivals</li>



<li>Gauntlet of Legends</li>
</ul>



<p>In Return of Rivals, players are invited to fight past opponents, tweaking the difficulty settings to suit their abilities.</p>



<p>In Gauntlet of Legends, players can undertake a journey, fighting multiple boss characters in succession using a series of customised curses to alter gameplay elements. It was noted that some old bosses will appear with fresh movesets, just to keep players on their toes.</p>



<p>By completing the Gauntlet of Legends, players will unlock rare treasures, including curios, medicine, equipment, and up to three new weapons.</p>



<p>The ‘Journeyer’s Chart’ isn’t immediately obvious, but here’s the description <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from the blog update</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A remarkable one has captured these landscapes, organizing them into charts for guidance and marking.</li>



<li>A Journeyer’s Chart can be unlocked when the Destined One first enters Black Wind Mountain and meets the Keeper.</li>



<li>Afterwards, for each new territory reached, a “Journeyer’s Chart” can be purchased at the Keeper’s Shrine.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>Also, Game Science has introduced a new equipment set – the ‘Set of Opulence’, which has been designed to celebrate the impending Chinese New Year. Elsewhere, players can use the Black Myth: Wukong Soundtrack Selection feature to enjoy the game’s OST more intricately.</p>



<p>These updates have been made in addition to dozens of changes and bug fixes, along with further localisation tweaks, such as Turkish language support.</p>



<p>The update – 1.0.12.16581 – is available today on PC and PS5.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the boss rush mode in Black Myth: Wukong? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-may-not-target-4k-1080-resolution/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-likely-use-nvidia-dlss-widely-but-the-most-demanding-titles-may-not-target-1080p-4k-resolution-output.1056666/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-may-not-target-4k-1080-resolution/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 games will likely extensively use NVIDIA DLSS, but the most demanding titles may not be able to target 4K and 1080p output resolutions in docked and handheld modes, respectively, for a few reasons.</p>
<p>Replying to a fan question asking about resolution output on the yet-to-be-revealed console during the latest episode of their podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry made some interesting observations on what should be expected to see on the Nintendo Switch 2. For starters, there's no doubt that NVIDIA DLSS will be widely used as the system will be powered by a mobile chip that will be in no way on par with other current gaming systems, but its actual cost will make a difference in how it will be used. Based on the current version of the upscaler, there's a very good chance that in handheld mode, DLSS will target 720p or 900p resolution output, as the higher the output, the more expensive the upscaler gets. Generally, 900p, 1080p resolution output should be expected for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One ports in handheld mode, and 1440p in docked mode.</p>
<p>With more demanding current generation titles, the Nintendo Switch 2 will obviously struggle more, and developers will have to better balance output resolution and graphics settings. Generally, output resolution should be expected to be 720p or even below in handheld mode, and even in docked mode, it won't be very high, at least for third-party games. For first-party games, there's a good chance Nintendo could go for higher resolutions and simpler game content, an approach that would fit well with the company's current strategy and keep development costs low.</p>
<p>The balancing act mentioned above will be even more required to get Unreal Engine 5 games looking good on Nintendo Switch 2. At very low resolutions, UE5 games look rather bad, as Lumen, for example, gets very noisy. As such, some games will likely go for higher internal resolution at the cost of lower output resolution or significantly reduce visual settings. Given the system's small screen, however, the lower resolution may still look good enough and could not be a massive problem.</p>
<p>This analysis of the Nintendo Switch 2's potential capabilities could change dramatically, however, if the NVIDIA DLSS upscaler it supports differs from the PC version. For example, Hello Games implemented a lightweight version of AMD FSR 2 in the No Man's Sky Switch port, so it wouldn't be impossible for NVIDIA to have developed a lighter version of its upscaler optimized for the Switch 2 hardware.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but it shouldn't take <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-event-may-june-release/">much longer</a> to finally learn what it is actually capable of doing. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more information is available, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>The demo for SNØ: Ultimate Freeriding isn't that new. It actually came out in September, but I'm filing it under the secret best unspoken RPS site category of "News (To Me)", a whizcrack piece of web 3.0 technology that allows us to travel back in time and 'announce' things that don't seem any less noteworthy for their advancing age.</p>
<p>If you think that's a desperately cavalier and confusing way to run a news section, I can only suggest that you email a complaint to our news editor. Spoilers: our news editor is me, and I have already thrown your complaint in the bin. Mate, I don't tell you how to do your job, but I'd be more than happy to, if you let me know what it is. Anyway, what were we talking about. Oh yeah, skiiing!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>SNØ: Ultimate Freeriding is a skiing sim for people who cherish their memories of SSX, Cool Boarders and, well, let's say Santa's Slippery Slope, even though they were terrible at those games at the time of release. Spoilers: those people are also me. As detailed by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943150/SN_Ultimate_Freeriding/">the Steam page</a>, it's a "minimalistic freeriding game" in which you "push your limits for the high score, or simply explore the endless, serene wilderness". Currently, I am just trying to ski in a straight line. It's probably easier on more powerful computers than my work laptop, which struggles to hit 30fps with anything three-dimensional.</p>
<p>Even at this prototypical stage, SNØ has gorgeous powder. It offers up endless rolling slopes of that particular species of untrodden snow that slices like cake frosting and flurries up behind you like excitable wildfowl. Magic snow. Not like the snow we get in the UK these days, which cuts like soup and appears magnetically drawn to the gap between your socks and your trousers.</p><p>There's also a one-button "procedural" trick system, which feels context-sensitive, and "speedriding with a glider", which terrifies me. I'll settle for staying upright, thanks. A small example of the game's chillout vibe: when you collide with a tree at bone-shattering velocity, the game makes a kind of poetical ambient "oof" sound and plays a chime at you as though to end a meditation session. I feel this element is open to ridicule, somewhat. I hit trees at such a frequency right now that the meditative chime has become a full-on town-crier handbell sequence. Just let me sleep in peace, facedown on all that lovely snø.</p>
<p>The full version of SNØ promises "unlimited riding" care of a mountain generator that offers up to 25 biomes, together with first-person and drone camera modes. The demo only lets you roam "a limited space" with just two biomes, birch and pine. It does have unlockable skins and a leaderboard, though, so if you weary of birch and pine forests, you could eke out the playtime by competing for high scores. Alternatively, you could play the surprisingly similar <a href="https://tocogames.itch.io/infinitepizza">Infinite Pizza</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Recently, voice actor Doug Cockle revealed that Geralt would be in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>, but he's now walking back those comments after he was "slapped" by developer CD Projekt Red for saying anything in the first place. At the MCM Comic Con Birmingham event recently, Cockle said his original comments were based on "a rumor," and he claims he doesn't know if Geralt will actually be in The Witcher 4.</p><p>"I did go online and I said something about this, and then I got slapped by CD Projekt because… I don't know how true it is," he said, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-may-not-have-geralt-after-all-his-actor-was-slapped-by-cd-projekt-for-accidentally-sharing-a-rumor-that-hed-be-in-it-just-not-as-the-protagonist/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by GamesRadar</a>. "I went off a rumor--I thought I'd seen somebody from CD Projekt say that Geralt will be in Witcher 4 but he won't be the main character, and I don't actually know if that's true now, because they came back and they went, 'We haven't put anything out there, don't say anything!'"</p><p>Cockle went on to say he doesn't actually know what the story for The Witcher 4 is all about or if Geralt will feature in it. "Witcher 4 is a complete mystery to me," he said.</p><p>Back in August, Cockle <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-is-in-witcher-4-but-the-game-wont-focus-on-him/1100-6525728/" data-ref-id="1100-6525728">very matter-of-factly said</a>, "What we know is that Geralt will be part of the game. We just don't know how much, and the game won't focus on Geralt, so it's not about him this time." In the same interview, Cockle admitted he might be lying through his teeth about everything he said.</p><p>As for what the actual developers have said, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-is-not-witcher-3-in-new-clothing-dev-says/1100-6522306/" data-ref-id="1100-6522306">The Witcher 4 won't just be "Witcher 3 in new clothing,"</a> according to CD Projekt Red joint-CEO Michał Nowakowski. More specifically, Nowakowski said to expect "new gameplay elements and new mechanics" that weren't a part of the original trilogy starring Geralt.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-has-more-than-400-people-working-on-it-full-production-begins-this-year/1100-6522263/" data-ref-id="1100-6522263">The Witcher 4 has over 400 people working on the game</a> and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">now in full production</a>.

Everywhere you look the genre is growing, evolving, and dominating. From Japanese-style RPGs to Western-style ones, retro remakes to open-world sequels, there’s never been more to dig into for fans of exploration, branching dialogue, or just making the numbers go up.</p><p>This year saw the release of ambitious blockbuster RPGs iterating on tried-and-true formulas as well as bold mashups borrowing from the genres’ best to create something new and equally satisfying. The games were also long, from nearly 15 hours to over 65. Finishing every game on this list by focusing on the critical paths alone would take you roughly 513.5 hours, or about three months of treating them like full-time jobs. But of course the real delight of most RPGs is taking your time, exploring every last NPC conversation and dead-end path in a leisurely fashion until you’ve seen everything the game has to offer. And the following games offered a lot. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6aaf323f78be36f4e2ee287738a57a2f" data-recommend-id="image://6aaf323f78be36f4e2ee287738a57a2f" data-format="png" data-width="1849" data-height="1040" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pixel art sprites walk along a sunset.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I confess, the <em>Octopath Traveler </em>games left me a bit cold. I was utterly dazzled by their visuals but, in my estimation at least, they failed to actually capture the spirit of the games to which they were so reverently paying homage. But finally, Square Enix has nailed it by thoughtfully applying the HD-2D aesthetic to one of the actual masterpieces of the pixel art era, <em>Dragon Quest III</em>. The result is one of the best JRPGs of all time, given extraordinary new life through a visual treatment that respects the look and world design of the original game but makes that world newly wondrous to behold, popping with depth, tactility, light and shadow. It’s one of many RPG remakes this year that preserves what makes the original so terrific, enhancing visuals or other elements in such a way that newcomers and longtime fans alike can experience (or re-experience) these exceptional games in a way that feels fresh, contemporary, and alive. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="55c9856e7416822f99c2e438042a40a0" data-recommend-id="image://55c9856e7416822f99c2e438042a40a0" data-format="png" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A tourist looks out at beautiful mountains.

It mixes a contemporary setting with magic and monsters to create an oddly cozy action RPG that is hard to put down thanks to how it constantly builds on itself. The way <em>Hinterberg</em> is structured also helps as it forces you to interact with all of its systems, including the ability to develop friendships with other characters and explore its large maps filled with goblins, treasure, loot, and dungeons. By the end of <em>Hinterberg</em>, I was sad to be finished with it, but happy that I got to experience one of the best RPGs of 2024. — Zack Zwiezen </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="538dc3eadf3f8337b5193512b188759f" data-recommend-id="image://538dc3eadf3f8337b5193512b188759f" data-format="png" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A lion man slays a dragon.

The game is split up into discrete missions designed to be endlessly replayed as you chase better scores, rewards, and end-game resources, and I can’t say the story left a very deep impression on me beyond the broad strokes of its heroic saga about fighting the evil empire and the powerful magic forces maneuvering beneath its surface. And that’s all fine. It nails the vibes and has a grand sense of  scale, all while not getting in the way of the main attraction: big boss fights with slick and rewarding real-time action combat complete with MMO-like party synergies. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1b8cc9ecdea1ee59db03fb27a7c05202" data-recommend-id="image://1b8cc9ecdea1ee59db03fb27a7c05202" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adventurers head into a magical forest.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Secret of Mana</em> is an all-time favorite of mine. I’ve been waiting for a sequel to live up to the series’ SNES-era hype ever since. <em>Visions of Mana</em> is not a top-three <em>Mana</em> game, but it’s still a surprisingly good one. Solid combat and a vibrant if somewhat empty open world are propelled to the next level by wonderful music, old-school dungeons, and a great class-based progression system. <em>Visions of Mana</em>’s uniquely whimsical world was a breath of fresh air that reminded me how much more there can be to modern RPGs than grim sci-fi dystopias, modern schoolyard grinds, and classic medieval dragon slaying. It’s a shame the team behind it, NetEase’s Ouka Studio, was shut down as soon as the game shipped, but I’m hopeful it’s not the last we’ll see of this new era of <em>Mana</em> after the game’s director, Ryosuke Yoshida, joined Square Enix this month. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6c2a8e38c71469c37918a7f4a2453cc7" data-recommend-id="image://6c2a8e38c71469c37918a7f4a2453cc7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mario and a bunch of Yoshis fight on stage.

Like a modern auto chess reimagining of <em>Ogre Battle</em>, <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> takes Vanillaware’s flashy art style and applies it to a dense medieval political epic that plays out across slick 2D battles and top-down real-time strategy maps. It’s like a big bowl of slow-cooked oatmeal: long and repetitive yet rich and filling. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="eda7d45abe4f68b42ba8ba600c3ed6a7" data-recommend-id="image://eda7d45abe4f68b42ba8ba600c3ed6a7" data-format="png" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook and co. prepare to fight the gods.

It eschews the fantasy settings that dominated the genre then (and the sci-fi ones, too—I didn’t forget about you, <em>Phantasy Star</em>) for its own distinctive world, one with archetypes and imagery rooted in Westerns but with some horror-adjacent elements as well. Of course, there are the monsters and demons running rampant in the world, but there’s also the fact that the world’s currency is teeth, a detail which continually unnerved me across my ~15 hours with the game.</p><p>I’ve seen people complain that <em>Grimstone </em>is “poorly designed,” they feel, because it doesn’t tell you what the different items you find throughout do. That’s a valid argument, I suppose, but part of what I loved about <em>Grimstone</em>—and indeed, about <em>UFO 50 </em>in its entirety—was the way I was encouraged to experiment, to push up against the limitations of games and see what the rules of their different worlds were. It’s a type of discovery that once felt common in games—many people my age, I think, know the feeling of encountering an opaque game on a relative’s computer, or being left alone with grandpa’s Intellivision—but that’s become increasingly rare as more and more games build thorough instructions into the games themselves rather than expecting you to keep a manual on hand. That sense of progress and discovery never flagged during my time with <em>Grimstone</em>—finding each new town where I could rest at the inn was always a huge relief; conquering each new dungeon was always a thrill; scoring cool new weapons and spells was always a great reward for my efforts. And while <em>Grimstone</em>’s storytelling is fairly minimal by today’s standards, discovering the truth about its world was exciting, particularly because that world is so distinct from the worlds of the actual 1980s JRPGs I’ve played. Not unlike my time with <em>Final Fantasy I</em>’s pixel remaster a few years back, playing <em>Grimstone </em>was a terrific reminder that distilling the genre down to its fundamental essence and giving us just enough detail for our imaginations to do most of the work of bringing a world to life can still be a wonderfully captivating approach for a role-playing game. — Carolyn Petit </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="30a5312e1ab3f2f9c623f389e2f48d33" data-recommend-id="image://30a5312e1ab3f2f9c623f389e2f48d33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Warriors take on dragons in Wizardry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Warriors take on dragons in Wizardry." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Eclipse</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="30a5312e1ab3f2f9c623f389e2f48d33" data-recommend-id="image://30a5312e1ab3f2f9c623f389e2f48d33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Warriors take on dragons in Wizardry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Oh, what a glorious remake. In 1981, <em>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord </em>was released and changed gaming forever, with its deadly monsters and devious dungeons helping to establish the template for party-based computer role-playing. Still, important as it was, it was hard to go back to that game today; at the time, players’ eager imaginations would fill in the gaps of its wire-frame dungeons, but nowadays, those primitive visuals and the game’s many other inconveniences stood between most players and the excitement and cultural impact of Sir-Tech’s masterpiece.</p><p>Enter Digital Eclipse, who knew exactly what to enhance and what to leave alone in bringing <em>PGotMO </em>into the modern era. Transparently built right on top of the original game, this remake brings the dungeons and monsters to vibrant life with lush, atmospheric 3D visuals and terrific sound effects, while also implementing a slew of quality-of-life improvements that cut down on needless frustration while preserving the original game’s vision and difficulty. In the 40+ years since <em>Wizardry</em>’s release, storytelling in role-playing games has evolved tremendously, but playing it this year reminded me that there’s still no substitute for the thrill of delving ever-deeper into a deadly dungeon, enduring hardship and defeat on the road to conquering its traps and defeating its monsters, and making up a story in your own head about the party of heroes you’ve created to tackle it all. — Carolyn Petit </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="03a44d406d642f689680c468eafbe108" data-recommend-id="image://03a44d406d642f689680c468eafbe108" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A warrior holds up her hands in front of a statue.

And yet there’s no denying that <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is  way more of one of the best games of 2022 without being <em>just</em> more <em>Elden Ring</em>. “<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is nothing short of magnificent,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505">wrote</a></span> former senior editor Alyssa Mercante. “It is both an expansion to and a distillation of what makes the original game so special, offering you a chance to try out new weapons and builds while learning far more about the Lands Between than you might have expected.

With a compelling gangster narrative, fantastic characters, and a thoroughly engaging turn-based combat system, <em>Infinite Wealth</em> is easily one of the must-play RPGs of 2024.</p><p>Though having knowledge of previous <em>Yakuza</em> games will certainly give you some great context, <em>Infinite Wealth</em> tells a focused story you can appreciate even if it’s your first foray into the series. With a plot centered on protagonist Ichiban Kasuga’s search to meet his long-lost mother, as well as on co-protagonist Kazuma Kiryu’s last days as he succumbs to cancer, the narratives in <em>Infinite Wealth</em> are grounded and intriguing. And despite covering such serious ground as estranged family relationships and terminal illness, <em>Infinite Wealth</em> is never afraid to dive into hilarious absurdities, such as a pet crawfish’s search for love. The game also features a ton of mini-games that are naturally embedded in the top-level gameplay, including an entire island-resort management game.</p><p><em>Infinite Wealth </em>tells rewarding stories of relatable human experiences with dozens of hours of engaging side-activities that rarely burden you with busywork. If you tire of fantastical settings that feel too detached from reality and instead want to follow the sometimes-goofy trials and tribulations of troubled-yet-endearing characters trying to make the best of their difficult lives, <em>Infinite Wealth </em>needs to be on your list if it isn’t already. — Claire Jackson</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b2819f83de7a026a9db026167e6a88bc" data-recommend-id="image://b2819f83de7a026a9db026167e6a88bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2946" data-height="1656" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cloud and co. look out at the prison in Corel.

The second chapter in Square Enix’s retelling of its 1997 PS1 hit, it’s way too long and crammed with way too much filler. The endless minigames, distractions, side-shows, and routine overindulgences don’t always hit, but when they do, it makes <em>Rebirth</em> feel like it’s more alive and having more fun than almost any other game other there. Some RPGs are better than the sum of their parts. <em>Rebirth</em> is an epic slog that nevertheless manages to be more interesting, bold, and unforgettable than the average of its many highs and  lows. It’s big-budget gorgeous yet still unabashedly absurd and over-the-top at any opportunity it gets. — Ethan Gach </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> is "not rewarding enough", developer Grinding Gear Games has admitted, amid a plan to "urgently" update the game.</p>
<p>An extensive post on the game's community forum details a number of changes based on feedback from the game's launch weekend last week. Some changes have already been implemented, while others will be deployed in a future patch.</p>
<p>"There are lots more things coming," reads the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611705">post</a>. "The list in this post are some of the things we felt needed to be more urgently addressed."</p>

<p>A major sticking point is that the game is "not rewarding enough", with a plan to alter items, rare monsters, currency, and map mods.</p>
<p>"This is an area that we have to be very careful when adjusting because it's very hard to reduce drops if we increase them by too much," said the developer.</p>
<p>The rewards given for defeating rare monsters have been boosted, which should improve the endgame. Specifically, the rarity bonus per rare mod has been doubled, the quantity bonus per rare mod has increased by 10 percent, and there's an increased chance of rare monsters inherently having more modifiers.</p>
<p>"These changes will cause rare monster rewards to naturally scale up as you get to higher levels because the number of mods a monster can have increases throughout the campaign and into endgame," the post reads.</p>
<p>Further, the drop rates of various currencies have been raised, while the rewards for the added difficulty of map mods have been "significantly increased".</p>
<p>Other changes to Path of Exile 2 include: an improvement to dodging to prevent players becoming trapped as often; new checkpoints have been added to prevent retreading old ground; the 'Move Only' command no longer namelocks to prevent characters attacking in the wrong direction; and rare monsters will appear on the minimap more easily to boost endgame progression.</p>
<p>The full list of changes can be viewed on the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611705">Path of Exile 2 forum</a>.</p>

Despite this, the game got off to a great start on Steam - it reached a peak of 578,569 concurrent players, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2694490/charts/">SteamDB</a>.</p><p>"Path of Exile 2 is flexing its blockbuster chops here, and showing it's worthy of all the expectation heaped upon it, and capable of confronting the biggest action RPG titans head-on," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review-in-progress">Path of Exile 2 early access review-in-progress</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl mod now available for download enhances the game's visuals considerably by improving shadows, lighting, and more.</p>
<p>The True Epic Graphics settings mod,&nbsp;<span>a tweaked configuration file that can be downloaded from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/580?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, not only improves some of the game's visual elements such as shadows, lighting, vegetation draw distance, and reflections</span>&nbsp;but also enables GTAO for considerably better visuals, as showcased in the comparison screenshots below. With the enhancements it features, however, this mod should only be used when running the game on high-end hardware.</p>

<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl finally launched last month, and the long wait was totally worth it, as the latest entry in the series by GSC Game World is as uncompromising and unique as ever. You can learn more about the game by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a worthy successor of the original in every regard, good and bad. The vision is the same: an uncompromising game that will often frustrate you, but also offers a unique experience that can hardly be found anywhere else. It's the classic example where the total is more than the mere sum of its parts. Bugs and balance issues are still very much an issue, but they shouldn't stand in your way of playing, especially if you're willing to wait a while for developers and modders to fix them. If you enjoy open world games and shooters and don't mind a challenge, there's no reason for you to pass up on this game.</em></p>
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl&nbsp;is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. The game is also available as part of the Xbox Game Pass library on PC and consoles.</p>

            <p>Among my last-resort tactics for generating precious PC gaming news is to go on holiday - for as sure as toast lands buttered side down while cats always land on their feet, as sure as the number 13 breeds calamity and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> committing to a release date guarantees a delay, myself going on holiday will always, <em>somehow</em>, conjure a big story from the crevices. It's basic physics. In this case, I was on holiday from Friday through Monday, and this fact and this fact alone appears to have coaxed some toy manufacturer into taking the internet's most cherished indie gaming platform offline by means of a "bogus" phishing report, sent by "AI-powered" brand protection software.</p>
<p>The situation has now been <a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866209409246110126">resolved</a>, thankfully, and you can access Itch.io as normal, but I will never pass up the opportunity to cast shade on Funko Pop, whose <a href="https://digital.funko.com/faq">NFT</a>-garlanded bobbleheads I hate as I do veruccas and forest fires. So here's a quick recap if you, too, missed the drama.</p><!--more-->
<p>The trouble started on Sunday, when Itch.io mysteriously went offline. According to a post from Itch.io's owner Leaf Corcoran on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oy37ivqnriw6nx3lrbcht2u3/post/3lcu6h465bs2n?ref_src=embed">Bluesky</a> (Twitter's relatively unspoilt cousin), the culprit was a phishing (i.e. internet scam) report automatically sent on Funko Pop's behalf to Itch.io's domain registrar, who proceeded to cork this wellspring of arty smallscale game development without due process.</p>
<p>"I kid you not, itch.io has been taken down by Funko of 'Funko Pop' because they use some trash 'AI Powered' Brand Protection Software called Brand Shield that created some bogus Phishing report to our registrar, iwantmyname, who ignored our response and just disabled the domain," reads the post. "I hope you're all having a nice Sunday evening."</p><p>Using my advanced journalist brain, I deduce from this communique that Corcoran was <em>not</em> having a nice Sunday evening, and would strongly prefer that Itch.io stayed online. He had more to say over on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42364033">Hacker News</a>, commenting that the provocation for the BrandShield report was probably a Funko Pop fan project created by an Itch.io user.</p>
<p>"From what I can tell, some person made a fan page for an existing Funko Pop video game (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/funko-fusion">Funko Fusion</a>), with links to the official site and screenshots of the game," the message reads. "The BrandShield software is probably instructed to eradicate all "unauthorized" use of their trademark, so they sent reports independently to our host and registrar claiming there was "fraud and phishing" going on, likely to cause escalation instead of doing the expected DMCA/cease-and-desist. Because of this, I honestly think they're the malicious actor in all of this.</p>
<p>"About 5 or 6 days ago, I received these reports on our host (Linode) and from our registrar (iwantmyname)," the post continues. "I expressed my disappointment in my responses to both of them but told them I had removed the page and disabled the account. Linode confirmed and closed the case. iwantmyname never responded. This evening, I got a downtime alert, and while debugging, I noticed that the domain status had been set to "serverHold" on iwantmyname's domain panel. We have no other abuse reports from iwantmyname other than this one. I'm assuming no one on their end "closed" the ticket, so it went into an automatic system to disable the domain after some number of days."</p>
<p>Funko Pop leapt into action following these complaints. They've seemingly clarified the situation with iwantmyname, hence Itch.io's return to the web. They also agree with Corcoran's assignation of blame to BrandShield, though they're more diplomatic about it.</p>
<p>"Recently, one of our brand protection partners identified a page on http://itch.io imitating the Funko Fusion development website," reads <a href="https://x.com/OriginalFunko/status/1866255848366039468">a Xitter post from last night</a>. "A takedown request was issued to address this specific page. Funko did not request a takedown of the @itchio platform, and we're happy the site was back up by this morning. We have reached out to @itchio to engage with them on this issue and we deeply appreciate the understanding of the gaming community as the details are determined."</p>
<p>The real shocker here, of course, is that Funko Pop has fans. Who are you people, and why do you covet shrunken petroleum-derivative incarnations of popular entertainment characters with eyes as blank and pitiless as the Mariana Trench?</p>
<p>Don't those hideously swollen heads balanced atop wasp-thin necks make you wince? Why would you permit such creatures near your children? And have you thought of the plastic waste? Funko Pop recently consigned <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/dumping-30-million-funko-pops-landfill">$30 million's worth</a> of these malevolent garden gnomes to landfill. Picture it: somewhere in the world, thousands of unblinking chibi abominations lie in shallow graves, hidden from the world of light only by a perilously frail layer of miscellaneous rubbish. Spill a vampire's blood or some nuclear isotopes in the wrong place, and who knows what might emerge. We should deploy warning pictograms and apocalyptic sculpture near the burial site, to keep our ignorant descendants at bay.</p><p>More immediately and practically, we could ask why it's so easy for some digital watchdog to auto-nuke a whole independent gaming community over a fan project, especially given that fan projects abound on Itch.io. Hopefully it's a one-off. Imagine if Sega had similar protections in place for Sonic.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a recent interview, Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle revealed that CD Projekt Red was unhappy with him for stating that Geralt will be a part of Witcher 4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During a conversation with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WiKrmDmyL8&amp;t=1161s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Geektown</a> on YouTube (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/the-witcher-4-polaris/220849/news/doug-cockle-got-slapped-by-cd-projekt-for-saying-geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-but-not-as-the-main-char" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), Doug Cockle revealed how he “got slapped by CD Projekt” for stating Geralt was in The Witcher 4. Cockle added that he wasn’t sure about “how true it is” and “went off a rumour”. He thought that he had “seen somebody from CD Projekt say that Geralt will be in Witcher 4, but he won’t be the main character”; however, he wasn’t sure how true this was. CD Projekt Red came to him stating, ‘We haven’t put anything out there, don’t say anything.’</p>



<p>Cockle explained that he doesn’t know “what it’s going to be” he thought he had an ‘idea’ about what it was, but then he was told by CD Projekt Red, ‘We haven’t put anything out there, don’t say anything.’ He also pointed out that his information might be “from a really really old statement that somebody who no longer works for CD Projekt actually put out about three years ago”. Currently, Witcher 4 is a “complete mystery” for the Geralt voice actor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s some context for those wondering what Cockle had stated about Geralt and Witcher 4. During an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkl5T0pMFb4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fall Damage</a> on YouTube about four months ago, Cockle stated, “Geralt will be part of the game.” He wasn’t sure how prevalent his role would be, but he knew the game wouldn’t focus on the character. Cockle also added that he hadn’t seen the script yet and could be lying through his teeth.</p>

Chief among them is the feeling that Path of Exile 2 isn’t rewarding enough, something GGG acknowledged is a problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the major problems that players have been experiencing is feeling that the game is not rewarding enough,” it said. “This is an area that we have to be very careful when adjusting because it's very hard to reduce drops if we increase them by too much.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, GGG felt that rare monsters were not rewarding enough, especially in the endgame where unique monsters are less common. GGG also saw that the reward players received for the increased difficulty of rares wasn't lining up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, it's doubling the rarity bonus per rare mod, increasing the quantity bonus per rare mod by 10%, and increasing the chance of rare monsters inherently having more modifiers as players progress through endgame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These changes will cause rare monster rewards to naturally scale up as you get to higher levels because the number of mods a monster can have increases throughout the campaign and into endgame,” GGG explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In addition, many other forms of map juicing will indirectly cause rare monsters to have more mods as well, increasing the rewards of these other mechanics too.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, GGG is changing the game to make sure each map has a minimum number of rares, which will also increase the average number of rare mods and thus increase drops further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another major issue GGG has identified is outlier "unlucky" drops. “A single unique boss dropping badly, especially early on can significantly affect your character,” GGG admitted. Changes here include no more than 50% of a unique monster’s drops can be gold, and act bosses and map bosses will now always drop at least one rare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, GGG is making dodge roll changes after players complained about being trapped in by monsters. “While it is intended that monsters are able to trap and kill you, we felt that the frequency of this was a little too high,” GGG explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GGG has posted <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611708" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the first set of patch notes for these changes</a>, with more to come as they’re rolled out.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-patch-5-makes-big-balance-changes-completely-reworks-blocking-weapons<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Patch 5 is out now across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, and it makes a number of significant balance changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot to pick through, but the highlight here is a complete rework of Blocking weapons, which were deemed useless by players ever since Space Marine 2’s record-breaking September launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, by blocking enemy attacks, the player accumulates up to three stacks of melee damage buffs. Attacking while having those stacks of buffs will spend them and will result in massive AoE Damage discharge. Check out the patch notes, below, for more detail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/128-patch-5-0-obelisk-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on publisher Focus Entertainment’s website, game director Dmitriy Grigorenko explained that Fencing weapons will remain good versus limited numbers of enemies, Balanced weapons will be good versus big crowds, and Blocking weapons are now “damage dealer” type weapons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Accompanying this change is a buff to all melee weapons, with normal melee damage increased across the board. Developer Saber Interactive hopes this change will give combat less reliance on the Parry -&gt; Gun Strike flow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s a big one: Space Marine 2’s Operations mode now has an Extermination Bonus, which increases the amount of XP players get in PvE missions “if they are zealously exterminating enemy waves.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea here, according to Grigorenko, is to incentivise players to not skip encounters (Space Marine 2 Operations players have a habit of skipping entire chunks of the PvE missions to finish as fast as possible and get on with the grind), without punishing those who want to skip, and make the game less grindy in preparation for new features coming down the line, such as Prestige Ranks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I’d like to pick out this one change I am particularly happy about: Shielded Zoanthrope will now attack much less frequently. Praise the Emperor!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Saber has said it’s happy with firearm balance, but promised minor tweaks in Patch 6. Importantly, a big rework of weapon perks is coming with Patch 7. “Weapons perks are underwhelming compared to class Perks right now, and the issues with some weapons are actually a result of them having a bad Perk tree rather than their basic stats,” Grigorenko explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grigorenko admitted a lot of the Class perks are not as good as we wanted them to be, and some Perk tree choices are really more efficient than others.” Patch 6 will “massively rework” a bunch of lacking Perks to make more builds viable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a big problem with the Grenade Launcher that makes it overpowered, so Saber will look to make changes there in a future patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a big day for Warhammer 40,000 fans, with Henry Cavill’s Amazon film and TV series based on Games Workshop’s grim dark universe finally proceeding to production, and the release of the Space Marine 2 animation as part of Amazon’s Secret Level anthology series. Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-level-review-prime-video-tim-miller"><u>Secret Level review</u></a> for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Saber Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>how the breakout success of Space Marine 2 had “changed everything” for the company</u></a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-spot-chapter-all-but-confirmed-to-get-cosmetic-pack-after-the-dark-angels"><u>Eagle-eyed fans have spotted the Space Marine chapter now all-but confirmed to get a cosmetic pack after the Dark Angels</u></a>, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Update 5.0 patch notes:</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">NEW FEATURES</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>New Operation: Obelisk</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">In this new Operation, you’ll be sent to Demerium and your mission is to rotate a replica of the obelisk to disrupt the flow of energy protecting the Aurora device. This operation takes place in parallel to the final events of the campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To reach the console control of the obelisk, you’ll have to make it through a tomb plunged into darkness.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>New Enemy: Tzaangor Enlightened</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A new Majoris enemy can spawn in all Operations featuring the Thousand Sons.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Note from our Game Director: <em>“The Tzaangor Enlightened is a disk-flying, melee/ranged-hybrid unit.

However, catching them after parry or during a long animation makes them an easy target.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>We strongly advise you to use Target Lock to face this enemy!”</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>New Season Pass Content: Dark Angels Chapter Pack</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Added</strong>: Dark Angels Successor Chapters cosmetics </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Added</strong>: Dark Angels Champion skin (Bulwark)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Added</strong>: Dark Angels–themed weapon skins for:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Auto Bolt Rifle</li><li>Plasma Pistol</li><li>Power Sword</li><li>Bulwark’s Storm Shield</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">GAMEPLAY &amp; BALANCING TWEAKS</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Melee</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Note from our Game Director: <em>“The melee system has been our main focus recently. The issue that we saw is that, on higher difficulties, the melee combat relied too heavily on the “Parry -&gt; Gun Strike” flow. This also made Fencing Melee Weapons a universal choice for almost all situations, and we want to give players more options. To try and achieve that, we’ve made the following changes.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>First, </em><em><strong>normal Melee Damage has increased across the board</strong></em><em>, so there will be more options instead of just Parry -&gt; Gun Strike.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Second, </em><em><strong>we are drastically changing how Blocking Weapons work</strong></em><em>. In short, by blocking enemy attacks, the player will accumulate up to 3 stacks of Melee Damage buffs. Attacking while having those stacks of buffs will spend them and will result in massive AoE Damage discharge.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>With these changes, Fencing Weapons will still be great versus limited numbers of enemies, Balanced Weapons will be good versus big crowds, and Blocking Weapons will become ‘damage dealer’ type weapons.”</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Perfect Block</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>All Block Weapons have been reworked with a new mechanic: </strong><em><strong>Perfect Block</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>Adrenaline Surge</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perfectly timed blocks grant up to 3 <em>Adrenaline Surge</em> stacks. <em>Adrenaline Surge</em> stacks greatly increase Melee Damage and are consumed after the next melee attack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Attacking with 3 stacks of <em>Adrenaline Surge</em> deals massive AoE Damage, staggers enemies, and restores 1 Armour Segment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note that the right wrist glows in yellow after the Parry, which signifies that the Adrenaline Surge is ready to use. When used, a red explosion detonates on the enemy hit, deals AoE Damage, and regenerates an Armour Segment.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fencing Weapons:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Perfect Parry AoE stagger radius slightly reduced.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Balanced Weapons:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Perfect Parry AoE stagger radius greatly increased.</li><li>Master-crafted versions: Damage increased by 10%.</li><li>Artificer versions: Damage increased by 10%.</li><li>Relic versions: Damage increased by 10%.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Blocking Weapons:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Master-crafted versions: Damage increased by 20%.</li><li>Artificer versions: Damage increased by 20%.</li><li>Relic versions: Damage increased by 20%.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Unarmed/Firearm Melee:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Stomps can now be chained indefinitely.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Firearms</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Note from our Game Director: <em>“We are quite happy with recent updates to firearms. Pretty much all firearms are viable on the hardest difficulties now, and our win rate/pick rate data shows drastic improvements.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Still, there are a few weapons that are better than the others, and </em><em><strong>minor tweaks will be coming with Patch 6.</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Further into the future, </em><em><strong>with Patch 7</strong></em><em>, we are planning to focus on </em><em><strong>reworking Weapons Perks</strong></em><em>. Weapons Perks are underwhelming compared to Class Perks right now, and the issues with some weapons are actually a result of them having a bad Perk tree rather than their basic stats.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The other big outstanding problem that we have is the </em><em><strong>Grenade Launcher</strong></em><em>. There are quite a few bugs/misconfigurations that make it the way it is.</em></p><ol data-cy="list"><li><em>Due to a bug, a certain Perk restores its full Ammo when it shouldn’t.</em></li><li><em>Due to a misconfiguration on our side, its Artificer and Relic versions deal 4x more damage than the Master-crafted version, which was not intended.</em></li><li><em>Due to a bug, Perks that increase Auspex Scan damage stack buffs inconsistently.

                <p>Next year will mark the 10th anniversary of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-hearts-of-stone-review/1900-6416268/" data-ref-id="1900-6416268">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, CD Projekt Red's smash hit that has spanned two console generations. Even during The Witcher 3's development, CD Projekt Red was paving the way for its futuristic follow-up title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review/1900-6417622/" data-ref-id="1900-6417622">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. Now, a new report suggests that The Witcher 3 almost had a direct crossover with Cyberpunk 2077 in a quest that would have temporarily sent Geralt of Rivia to Night City.</p><p>This revelation comes from a new eBook series, <a href="https://github.com/glassfish777/WhatLiesUnseen/tree/main" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">What Lies Unseen</a>, a multi-volume chronicle of the development of The Witcher 3 by modders and data miners Crygreg, Ferroxius, and Glassfish. According to the first volume of the book, the quest called Through Time and Space originally had Geralt and his ally, Avallac’h, appear in Cyberpunk 2077's Night City during their journey into the multiverse for answers about the Wild Hunt.</p><p>In one of the lost lines of dialogue, Avallac'h describes Night City as "technologically advanced, but broken... dying." Geralt initially wonders if the city is in the afterlife before expressing his disgust for the stench and the noise. Intriguingly, Geralt would have inadvertently left his mark on the city by giving some coins to a beggar who he took pity on. Those coins would have proven more valuable than Geralt realized, as the initial plan was reportedly for the character to reappear in Cyberpunk 2077 as a wealthy individual.</p><p>While that crossover didn't ultimately take place, Geralt has appeared in games outside The Witcher's universe including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-world-review-deadliest-catch/1900-6416842/" data-ref-id="1900-6416842">Monster Hunter: World</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/soulcalibur-6-review-the-new-legend/1900-6417012/" data-ref-id="1900-6417012">Soulcalibur 6</a>. Presumably Geralt will also return in some fashion in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>, which recently began its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">full-scale production</a>. That sequel may be several years away, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witchers-gwent-card-game-is-heading-to-the-real-world/1100-6528284/" data-ref-id="1100-6528284">a physical version of The Witcher's Gwent card game</a> will be released in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-movie-actor-who-leaked-role-in-first-film-hasnt-heard-anything-about-returning-for-sequel<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
An actor who leaked his obscure role in Nintendo's then-top-secret Super Mario Bros. Movie has said he's yet to hear whether he's coming back for the sequel. 
</p>
<p>
Actor and comedian Sebastian Maniscalco played Mario's foreman boss Spike in the Super Mario Bros. Movie - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-bros-animated-movie-actor-lets-slip-his-obscure-role">a fact he let slip more than a year before the film was released</a>, before Nintendo had shown anything of the project publicly.
</p>
<p>
The random announcement by Maniscalco - and the deep cut nature of the character's inclusion (Spike appeared in NES game Wrecking Crew back in 1985, and little else since) made headlines. Perhaps Nintendo is keen to keep things more tight-lipped this time around?
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Maniscalco says he doesn't rate his chances for a return in the Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel - though not because of his previous statements. Instead, he says, it's because there's yet to be a stuffed toy of him.
</p><p>
"We went to Universal Studios and they had a Super Mario store with all the merchandise," Maniscalco recently told <a href="https://screenrant.com/super-mario-bros-movie-2-foreman-spike-return-sebastian-maniscalco-response/">ScreenRant</a>. "I was with my kids, I go, 'Guys, come on. I'm going to show you daddy's character in a stuffed animal.' No Spike, no nothing. It stopped at me. It was every other character, and then me, I have no animal, no stuffy, no nothing. 
</p>
<p>
"So, the fact that I didn't have a stuffed animal is not giving me a lot of confidence that I'm coming back for the sequel," he continued. "I haven't heard anything, so your guess is as good as mine."
</p>
<p>
Spike could easily be featured in a sequel should Nintendo want to. After all, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-bros-movie-post-credit-scene-hints-at-potential-sequel-chris-pratt-says">post-credits teaser was set back in Mario and Luigi's native Brooklyn</a>, where Spike lived. 
</p>
<p>
But, as yet, Nintendo is still to say exactly what its plans for the next Mario movie are. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">Due to launch in April 2026</a>, rumours abound that the sequel will focus on Donkey Kong this time around - although, as Eurogamer previously rounded up, there are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-the-mario-movie-series-may-go-next">plenty of dangling plot threads from the Super Mario Bros. Movie which could point to sequels</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[As expected, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League support will end with Season 4]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/as-expected-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-will-end-with-season-4/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/as-expected-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-will-end-with-season-4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It comes as absolutely no surprise that Season 4 of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> will be the end of the game’s support as a live service.</p>
<p>Rocksteady has revealed that Season 4 will feature Deathstroke joining the roster, introduce a new Elseworld to explore with a medieval theme, and have some new narrative content attached to that, with Episode 7 arriving on 10th December. The second half of the season will arrive in January in Episode 8, rounding out Warner Bros. and Rocksteady’s obligation to support the game with new content and fulfil the promises of paid battle passes and content road maps.</p>


<p>The update for Season 4 Episode 7 will also introduce an offline mode, allowing all game content (both in the main game and seasonal) to be played without an internet connection – you’ll either have to start a new character profile or duplicate your online profile. See the <a href="https://dcgamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/36119520746515-OFFLINE-MODE-FAQ">offline play FAQ here</a>.</p>
<p>However, the game servers will remain live and active for the foreseeable future, maintaining the possibility to play the game in online co-op. WB has also stated in <a href="https://dcgamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/36121518094995-SEASON-4-FAQ">a Season 4 FAQ</a> that they are not planning to remove the game from sale, and that the LutherCoin premium currency will also remain available.</p>
<p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was one of the biggest video game flops in recent memory and could have been the most ignominious entertainment industry disasters of the year, were it not for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> and maybe the Joker film sequel. Warner took to discounting the game to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/28/steam-autumn-sale-black-friday-best-deals/">just £3 in the recent Steam Sale</a>.</p>

<p>After years of delays, Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League finally released on February 2nd, 2024 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Was it worth the wait? Well, in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/">Suicide Squad review</a>, Gamoc said, “Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a perfect example of how live services can sap all the energy out of a game experience. The story, the character and gameplay all range from good to fantastic, but the missions grow stale before too long, the loot system’s few bright spots are tarnished by the chore of everything else you earn, and the story and characters all but evaporate once you reach the endgame.”</p>
