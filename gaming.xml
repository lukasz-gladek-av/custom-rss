            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>CAPCOM has officially opened pre-orders for its highly anticipated game Resident Evil Requiem. You can now purchase the ninth mainline installment of the beloved horror franchise across all platforms: PC (Steam and, for the first time, Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>All pre-orders will include “Apocalypse,” a freebie costume for protagonist Grace, as a pre-order bonus. The Standard Edition is priced at $69.99, while the Deluxe Edition adds the Deluxe Kit for $10 more. The Deluxe Kit includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Five costumes, including Grace's Costume: Dimitrescu</li>



<li>Two filters, including Filter: Apocalypse</li>



<li>Four weapon skins, including S&amp;S M232 Weapon Skin: Apocalypse</li>



<li>Two charms, including Charm: Mr. Raccoon</li>



<li>Audio Pack: Raccoon City Classic</li>



<li>Files: Letters from 1998</li>
</ul>



<p>To celebrate the aforementioned debut of the Japanese publisher on the Epic Games Store, players who get Resident Evil Requiem on this platform will receive special Resident Evil-themed collaboration items in Fortnite, like the Grace skin. These items will be distributed in Fortnite following the game's release, which, as a reminder, is set for February 27, 2026.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>CAPCOM also unveiled a special edition Resident Evil Requiem Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, featuring art from the game and styled in gunmetal-inspired black. It will be available from Nintendo on launch day. Lastly, it was revealed that Grace will become the first-ever Resident Evil amiibo, available sometime in Summer 2026.</p>



<p>Following the opening of pre-orders, the publisher also shared the minimum and recommended system requirements for the PC version. These are surprisingly accessible.</p>



<p><strong>MINIMUM:<br></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>OS: Windows 11 (64-bit required)<br>Processor: Intel corei5-8500 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: GeForce GTX 1660 6GB / Radeon RX 5500 XT 8GB<br>DirectX: Version 12</p>



<p><strong>RECOMMENDED:<br></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>OS: Windows 11 (64-bit required)<br>Processor: Intel Core i7-8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 5500<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: GeForce RTX 2060 Super 8GB / Radeon RX 6600 8GB<br>DirectX: Version 12</p>



<p>Of course, should you wish to play Resident Evil Requiem <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with path tracing on PC</a>, you'll need a lot more than a GeForce RTX 2060. Still, optimization was already in a good place <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">based on what we played at Gamescom 2025</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><strong>Update: ARC Raiders is out now!</strong></p>



<p>ARC Raiders is out today, October 30, bringing the most highly anticipated extraction shooter ever made to the global market. It has been pieced together by Embark Studios, of The Finals fame, and it offers a unique perspective and take on a typically gruelling and super-challenging genre.</p>



<p>In this guide, we’ll break down the official launch times for ARC Raiders, letting you know when in your region ARC Raiders will be released. It’s being opened up to the world on a simultaneous basis, so that means it goes live for everyone at the same time.</p>



<p>What time does ARC Raiders go live? Find out below.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-arc-raiders-live">When is ARC Raiders Live?</h2>



<p><strong>ARC Raiders will go live at 02:30 AM PDT on October 30, which is today. </strong>It’s available for preload on all platforms, but there’s not that long to wait before it kicks off.</p>



<p>Here are all the time zones for the ARC Raiders launch:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Timezone</th><th data-align="center">ARC Raiders Launch Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">PDT</td><td data-align="center">02:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">MDT</td><td data-align="center">03:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CDT</td><td data-align="center">04:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">EDT</td><td data-align="center">05:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">UTC</td><td data-align="center">09:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GMT</td><td data-align="center">09:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CET</td><td data-align="center">10:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">IST</td><td data-align="center">3:00 PM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CST</td><td data-align="center">5:30 PM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">JST</td><td data-align="center">6:30 PM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">AEST</td><td data-align="center">7:30 PM</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p>It’s safe to expect some kind of technical or network issues, which are typical when a game has a global launch like this. With the launch not being staggered by local time, it means that everyone who wants to play this game will be jumping online at the same time, which inevitably causes some issues, and there might be some kind of server queue system arranged.</p>



<p>However, that’s what the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/has-arc-raiders-server-slam-playtest-been-extended-playtest-end/">recent server slam</a> was supposed to iron out.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-preload-arc-raiders">How to Preload ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>If you want to get ready for the launch of ARC Raiders, you can preload the game on your platform of choice after purchasing it.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is available on PS5, Xbox Series, Epic Games, and Steam, and every storefront has mostly the same process for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/preload-arc-raiders-file-sizes/">preloading the game</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Head to the storefront you want to use</li>



<li>Complete your purchase</li>



<li>Find the game in your library and hit the option to preload or pre-install</li>



<li>Wait for the download to finish</li>



<li>Sit back and wait for the ARC Raiders launch time to come around</li>
</ul>



<p>You won’t need to soak up much storage space with ARC Raiders either, as the game has a relatively small install size:</p>



<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5 – 16.19 GB</li>



<li>Xbox Series – 27 GB – 32 GB</li>



<li>PC – 29.05 GB</li>
</ul>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord</a> which ARC Raiders launch time you’re preparing for, and we’ll see you in Speranza!</p>

If you are wondering why Nintendo hasn't added this album to its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> service just yet, we've now got an official response.</p>
<p>During a chat with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/10/29/breath-of-the-wild-vinyl-nintendo-music/">The Washington Post [paywall]</a>, Nintendo's Bill Trinen acknowledged fan requests for this particular album, which is "particularly robust", and mentioned how soundtracks "actually take time and work" to prepare. It's also apparently about lining it up on the calendar and seeing if it fits. Here's what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I can’t go into too much detail, but I can say that it does actually take time and work to prepare soundtracks for Nintendo Music. And that soundtrack is particularly robust. It’s a matter of looking at the calendar and saying whether something might fit in or not. We’ve certainly heard that people are eager to see that on Nintendo Music.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Mario Kart World's album isn't available on this subscription service just yet, you can listen to existing Mario Kart soundtracks. It's now also been one year since this music app was released for mobile devices, and during this time, Nintendo has bolstered the service with all sorts of retro albums, as well as some sample collections for Switch 2 titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>.</p>
<p>If you would prefer something more physical, Nintendo yesterday announced it was teaming up with Laced Records to release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-soundtrack-is-scoring-a-gorgeous-vinyl-release-next-year">soundtrack on vinyl</a>. You can find out more in our previous post. Earlier this week, it also updated its digital music app with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/new_super_mario_bros">New Super Mario Bros.</a> soundtrack.</p>

<p>In response to this, a response has been issued about the "current known issues and planned fixes" on the way. The fixes will be rolled out in a "future update" that's currently planned for November. For now, this is what you can expect, courtesy of the official Pokémon Legends Z-A news page.</p>
<p>One issue is tied to Pokémon Boxes, and the other is linked to side missions. Here's the rundown:</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59zusthn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<h3>Pokémon Legends Z-A - Current Known Issues and Planned Fixes (November, 2025)</h3>
<p>We have confirmed the following issues and plan to fix them in a future update.</p>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>If your Pokémon Boxes become full before the first Rogue Mega Evolution battle and the Boxes menu had not been opened at any point prior to being filled, Pokémon catch attempts will always fail. Additionally, if a side mission that allows you to receive Pokémon is attempted under these conditions, the mission will be completed without granting the Pokémon.<br></li>
<li>In certain side missions, if the time of day switches between daytime and nighttime at the exact moment that a move hits its target, it will become impossible to hit the target afterward, rendering the side mission incapable of being progressed further.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Planned Fixes</h3>
<p>These issues are scheduled to be fixed in the update planned for release in November.</p>
<hr>
<p>When this update and the patch notes are released, we'll provide an update. In some other Pokémon Legends Z-A news today, the second Ranked Battle season has been announced. This event will run from 6th - 26th November. You can find out more in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-legends-z-a-ranked-battles-season-2-start-date-and-rewards-revealed">our previous story</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pre-orders for Resident Evil Requiem, which launches on February 27th, 2026, are now live. Furthermore, a showcase including the upcoming title will air closer to release.</p>



<p>Celebrating the 30th anniversary next year, Resident Evil Requiem is the next big title for the iconic horror franchise. Following Grace Ashcroft, daughter of Outbreak’s Alyssa Ashcroft, you’ll survive horrors beyond compare in the now-desolate Raccoon City. Story details are under wraps but, assuming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-story-details-leaked-by-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some leaks are true</a>, it’s sure to be quite the journey for new and returning fans. Earlier this month, details about its pre-orders came out, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing an October 29th date</a> with a special video. Now, the content in question is out and holds another surprise: a new Resident Evil Showcase.</p>







<figure><p>
<iframe title="Resident Evil | Road to Requiem" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SQODLCylKbM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQODLCylKbM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the 10-minute video</a>, narrated by Lady Dimitrescu herself Maggie Robertson, we see a flashback to how the Resident Evil series got to where it is today. From the original 1996 title to the latest mainline entry, Resident Evil Village, it’s all there and connected with Requiem.</p>



<p>While there isn’t any new footage of the upcoming game, you won’t have to wait long to see more. Towards the end of the video, <strong>a Resident Evil Showcase is announced</strong>, and is planned to release <strong>early 2026</strong>. While there’s no specific date, it’s likely taking place in January as Requiem releases in February. As for what we can expect, more gameplay will probably be shown, but there’s a chance we could see the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-0-remake-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored Resident Evil 0 remake</a>.</p>



<p>The biggest announcement was the fact that <strong>pre-orders for Resident Evil Requiem are now live</strong> on all storefronts. The game is available for <strong>$69.99</strong> for Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. A Deluxe Edition is also available, costing <strong>$79.99</strong> and including the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Five costumes, including one of Grace as Lady Dimitrescu</li>



<li>Four weapon skins</li>



<li>Two screen filters</li>



<li>Two charms</li>



<li>One Audio Pack (Raccoon City Classic)</li>



<li>One File (Letters from 1998)</li>
</ul>



<p>The physical Deluxe Edition will also come with a Steelbook casing featuring a limited edition lenticular card. Also announced during the video is a Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller adorned for Resident Evil, coming out at launch, as well as a Grace Ashcroft Amiibo, releasing in Summer 2026. Furthermore, Grace Ashcroft has been revealed to be going to Fortnite as a skin, though no date is given for that.</p>

              <p>Budget earbuds often disappoint with tinny sound and uncomfortable fits, leaving people wondering if they should have spent more on premium brands. The Soundcore P20i by Anker changes that calculus entirely, delivering features and sound quality that rival earbuds costing ten times more while earning an impressive 4.4-star rating from nearly 80,000 reviews. Amazon has slashed the price from $39 to just $19, hitting an all-time low that makes these earbuds an absolute steal for anyone who needs reliable wireless audio without breaking the bank. This deal has already attracted over 10,000 buyers in the past month alone, speaking to the value proposition these earbuds represent.</p>

<h2>Oversized Drivers Deliver Surprising Bass Performance</h2>
<p>The 10mm drivers in these compact earbuds outperform expectations and <strong>deliver bass that rivals earbuds priced at $100 or more</strong>. The size of the drivers affects bass reproduction because larger diaphragms move more air and it creates low-frequency sounds that make music feel immersive instead of flat. The larger drivers follow the 16-ohm impedance specification for efficient power use. The sound signature highlights bass without drowning out mids and highs: You get a satisfying thump in hip-hop and electronic music, while vocals remain clear and instruments distinct. <strong>Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity provides stable audio transmission</strong> with minimal delay and prevents annoying audio-video sync issues that come with cheaper wireless earbuds.</p>



<p>The Soundcore app takes these earbuds from good to exceptional: <strong>It includes 22 preset EQ profiles</strong> designed for various music genres and listening preferences. Presets for rock, classical, jazz, podcasts and bass boost adjust frequency response to enhance sound for different types of content. You can customize tap gestures to control functions, such as skipping tracks, adjusting volume or activating voice assistants based on how you like to use them.</p>
<p>Battery performance is impressive as it offers <strong>10 hours of continuous playback on a single charge</strong> which is enough for multiple workdays or long flights without needing the case. The<strong> charging case extends total playtime to 30 hours</strong>, and gives you nearly a week of typical use before you have to charge it again. Fast charging technology provides 2 hours of listening from just 10 minutes in the case which is helpful if you forgot to charge overnight.</p>



<p>The compact design, complete with an attached lanyard, makes these earbuds extremely portable: They are <strong>small enough to fit in pockets or clip onto bags and keys</strong> without taking up much space. Their lightweight design keeps you comfortable even during extended use and prevents ear fatigue that heavier earbuds can cause. Water resistance protects against sweat during workouts and light rain while commuting but they are not rated for swimming or heavy water exposure.</p>
<p>Call quality is enhanced by <strong>dual microphones that work with AI to isolate your voice from background noise</strong> in phone conversations. The system filters out distracting sounds, such as traffic, wind, or office chatter, ensuring the person on the other end hears you clearly. This AI processing occurs in real-time without creating the robotic voice quality typical of simpler noise reduction systems. The microphone placement captures your voice naturally while minimizing wind noise during outdoor calls.</p>
<p>At $19, this is one of the best deals you can get.</p>

                <p>The age of AI has barely begun, but there are some in the industry who see it as an absolute necessity for the future. Electronic Arts, for example, has reportedly instructed its employees to treat AI as "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">thought partners</a>" in every aspect of game creation. However, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick isn't buying into the hype, and he doesn't believe AI will ever be able to compete with Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto games.</p><p>"Let's say there were no constraints [on AI]," said Zelnick during an appearance on <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/can-ai-create-next-grand-theft-auto-take-two-interactive-ceo-says-no.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a>. "Could we push a button tomorrow and create an equivalent to the Grand Theft Auto marketing plan? The answer is no. A, you can't do that yet, and B, I am of the view that you wouldn't end up with anything very good. You end up with something pretty derivative."</p><p>Zelnick went on to explain that AI can't innovate, because it's "backward-looking" by design and its predictive models are built on things that have already been created, rather than anything new.</p><p>This isn't the first time Zelnick has shared his feelings about AI, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-true-gta-competitor-wont-be-made-with-ai-take-two-boss-says/1100-6511244/" data-ref-id="1100-6511244">he's been fairly consistent over the years</a>. Earlier this month, Zelnick made a point of saying that people <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-says-ai-is-great-but-people-are-overstating-what-it-can-do/1100-6535679/" data-ref-id="1100-6535679">overstate what AI can do</a>.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer recently disclosed that his company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-primarily-uses-ai-for-security-so-far-says-phil-spencer/1100-6535672/" data-ref-id="1100-6535672">primarily uses AI for security purposes</a>, but he didn't rule out its role in game creation. Meanwhile, Microsoft is attempting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wants-ai-and-voice-control-to-be-an-even-bigger-part-of-windows/1100-6535491/" data-ref-id="1100-6535491">to fully integrate AI and voice commands into Windows 11 machines</a>. Video game developers Hideo Kojima and Glen Schofield have both stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">AI tools should be embraced</a> in game creation. A recent survey also found that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-japanese-game-developers-are-embracing-ai-than-ever-before/1100-6535072/" data-ref-id="1100-6535072">over 50% of Japanese game publishers utilize AI</a> in some way.</p>

              <p>Running out of storage space on your phone, Nintendo Switch, or camera creates that frustrating moment where you have to delete old memories to capture new ones. MicroSD cards solve this problem by expanding your device’s capacity and let you hoard thousands of photos or hours of 4K video without compromise.</p>
<p>The Samsung EVO Select with 512GB capacity provides enough room for approximately 124,000 photos or 60 hours of 4K footage, essentially future-proofing your device against storage anxiety. And Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5094/">just dropped the price from $46 to just $37, hitting a new all-time low</a> just before Black Friday.</p>

<h2>Speed Meets Capacity for Real-World Performance</h2>
<p>The <strong>160 MB/s read speed makes file transfers fast and smooth</strong>: Copying a full 4K movie to your card takes less than a minute, unlike slower cards that can take five to ten minutes. Good news is, <strong>write speeds match the demands of continuous 4K video recording</strong>. This prevents dropped frames and stuttering that can ruin important footage when slower cards can’t keep up with the data. The UHS-I interface offers the bandwidth these speeds need and connects through the standard microSD slot found in nearly all modern devices.</p>



<p>The A2 application performance class means <strong>this card can run apps and games directly from its storage:</strong> This avoids the lag that older microSD standards often had. The rating shows minimum random read speeds of 4000 IOPS and write speeds of 2000 IOPS, which results in quick app launches and smooth gameplay on devices like the Nintendo Switch. Games load faster, transitions between levels are smooth, and you bypass the frustrating delays that come from using slower storage.</p>



<p>The i<strong>ncluded SD adapter increases compatibility</strong>: It works with laptops, desktop card readers, cameras and the original Nintendo Switch dock. This simple adapter <strong>changes the tiny microSD size to standard SD</strong> so you don’t need to buy separate adapters or search for specific readers. You can easily insert the card into your computer’s SD slot to transfer files without needing cables or wireless connections that use up battery.</p>
<p>Samsung’s six-proof protection guards <strong>against water, extreme temperatures, X-rays, magnets, drops, and wear from repeated insertion and removal</strong>. These durability features mean the card can survive an accidental trip through the washing machine, withstand desert heat or winter cold outdoors, and pass through airport security scanners without corrupting data. The <strong>10-year limited warranty</strong> supports these protection claims with reliable manufacturer backing that goes beyond standard consumer electronics coverage</p>
<p>At $37, the card costs about seven cents per gigabyte, which is great value for Samsung’s premium EVO Select line.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/london-skyline-lego-set-is-nearly-free-amazon-slashes-price-on-4-8-rated-build-2000640003</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/london-skyline-lego-set-is-nearly-free-amazon-slashes-price-on-4-8-rated-build.1338877/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO Architecture sets rarely go on sale which makes this London Skyline deal something special. The 4.8-star rating (across more than 13,000 reviews) speaks to the quality and satisfaction <strong>this 468-piece set</strong> delivers to builders who want an iconic city skyline on their desk or shelf. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5093/">has dropped the price from $39 to just $31, which marks an all-time low</a> that won’t last long given how quickly these sets disappear during promotional windows.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5093/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Iconic Landmarks Come Together in Miniature Form</h2>
<p>The set captures<strong> five of London’s most recognizable structures</strong> in carefully scaled brick form. It starts with the National Gallery’s neoclassical facade which anchors Trafalgar Square, then Nelson’s Column rises with its distinctive proportions (honoring the admiral who secured British naval dominance at Trafalgar in 1805). The London Eye appears as a functional rotating observation wheel made from transparent and gray elements that showcase its modern engineering style. Big Ben’s clock tower displays the Gothic Revival architecture that makes it easily recognizable in photographs and films worldwide. Last but not least, Tower Bridge completes the collection with its twin towers and suspended walkways.</p>



<p>The Thames river flows through the scene, and uses transparent blue baseplate tiles to create a convincing water effect beneath the landmarks. This smart design choice grounds the buildings in their geographic setting while adding visual depth to the display. The transparent elements catch and reflect light in various ways throughout the day. This gives the model a dynamic quality that shifts with your viewing angle and the ambient light. The <strong>baseplate measures about 11 inches wide</strong> and provides a stable foundation that keeps all elements securely connected during transport or dusting.</p>



<p>The<strong> set includes 468 pieces</strong> and hits the sweet spot between being challenging enough to feel rewarding and manageable enough to complete in one satisfying evening or weekend session. LEGO Architecture sets differ from standard LEGO builds by focusing on architectural accuracy and the proportions between structures rather than play features: Each landmark uses specialized pieces and smart building techniques to replicate distinctive architectural elements at this smaller scale.</p>
<p>Display potential makes this set especially appealing for offices, home libraries or anywhere you want decor that sparks conversation and reflects sophisticated interests. The monochromatic color scheme, using mainly gray, black, and tan bricks, creates a cohesive look that appears professional rather than toy-like in adult spaces. Its compact size means it fits on crowded bookshelves, desks, or window sills without overpowering the area.</p>
<p>The <strong>recommended age of 12 and up</strong> reflects the patience and fine motor skills needed for smaller pieces and detailed assembly steps. However, younger builders with LEGO experience can succeed with adult guidance. This set makes an excellent gift for Anglophiles, architecture enthusiasts, travel lovers reminiscing about London visits.</p>
<p>At $31, it offers great value given the piece count, display quality, and lasting appeal of the Architecture series.</p>

              <p>Smart lighting transforms how you experience your home, <strong>turning ordinary rooms into spaces that adapt to your mood, schedule, and activities</strong> with just a tap or voice command. The<em> Philips Hue</em> starter kit delivers this transformation in minutes and requires nothing more than screwing in bulbs and plugging in the bridge to unlock millions of colors and automated lighting scenes. This bundle includes the <strong>essential Hue brige and two 60W A19 color-changing bulbs</strong> that work in standard E26 fixtures throughout your house. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5091/">has slashed the price from $142 to just $99 for early Black Friday</a>, which marks a new all-time low.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5091/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Bridge Makes Everything Possible</h2>
<p>The Hue bridge acts as <strong>the main hub for your smart lighting system</strong>: It connects your bulbs to your home network and offers features that standard Bluetooth bulbs can’t. This hub creates a special Zigbee network and keeps your smart lights responsive without slowing down your Wi-Fi or hurting connection quality. The bridge also allows for automations: You can set your lights to turn on before you wake up or turn off automatically when you leave home.</p>



<p>The two included A19 bulbs deliver 800 lumens each: This provides <strong>brightness similar to traditional 60-watt incandescent bulbs</strong> while using much less energy. These <em>White and Color Ambiance</em> bulbs cover a range from warm candlelight tones at around 2000K to cool daylight at 6500K,<strong> plus offer access to 16 million colors for fun lighting effects</strong>. The <strong>E26 base fits standard lamp sockets</strong> and ceiling fixtures: You can install them in table lamps, floor lamps, or overhead lights without needing adapters. Dimming is smooth through the app or voice commands, and gives you fine control over brightness levels that wall switches can’t achieve.</p>



<p>Preset scenes take the hassle out of choosing colors: They provide <strong>ready-made lighting combinations tailored for different activities and moods</strong>. The 24-hour natural light scene mimics the sun’s movement throughout the day. It begins with energizing cool tones in the morning and shifts to calming warm hues as evening approaches. <em>Focus</em> modes provide bright, clear lighting to help you concentrate during work hours, while reading scenes offer comfortable light that reduces eye strain. <em>Relaxation</em> and sleep scenes gradually dim to warm amber tones, signaling to your body that it’s time to unwind.</p>
<p>Voice control with Alexa and Google Assistant lets you <strong>adjust your lights without reaching for your phone</strong> or getting off the couch. Simple commands like <em>“turn on the living room lights”</em> or <em>“set bedroom to 50 percent”</em> become routine after a few days. The Hue app guides you through setting up voice control with easy instructions that take only a few minutes. You can also create custom voice commands for specific scenes, like saying <em>“movie time”</em> to automatically dim your lights to theater mode.</p>
<p>At $99, this starter kit is an easy way to enter the Philips Hue ecosystem. It provides everything you need to experience smart lighting in two rooms right out of the box.</p>

<p>A skin for Leon Kennedy in Resident Evil Requiem Deluxe edition has been accidentally mentioned on PlayStation 5’s store page in Portuguese, seemingly confirming the character’s appearance in the upcoming title. </p>



<p>Leon Kennedy’s appearance in Resident Evil Requiem has been a subject of concern since the very start. One of the leakers in this space has been adamant that Leon is indeed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-will-have-3-playable-characters-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of three playable characters</a>. Now, the RE Requiem Deluxe Listing has seemingly confirmed that character’s presence in the latest title. </p>



<h2 id="h-leon-dso-agent-skin-coming-to-resident-evil-requiem">Leon DSO Agent Skin Coming to Resident Evil Requiem</h2>



<p>Spotted by DuskGolem on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1983676774207967556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the pre-order page for Resident Evil Requiem Deluxe Edition on PlayStation Portugal gave away the details of a Leon skin. Just like Grace’s Dimitrescu outfit, which was announced as a pre-order bonus today, Leon Kennedy will get a DSO Special Agent outfit. 5 outfits were mentioned, but only two were revealed: one for Grace and the other for Leon. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sony just accidentally leaked Leon in Resident Evil Requiem. On the official PlayStation 5 pre-order page for RE9 Deluxe in Poruguese, it accidentally lists a Deluxe Costume for Leon. <a href="https://t.co/xKA1Pj0Tm0">pic.twitter.com/xKA1Pj0Tm0</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1983676774207967556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Other Deluxe edition bonuses for Resident Evil Requiem include two filters, one of which is Apocalypse, four weapon skins, which include S&amp;S M232 Apocalypse Weapon Skin, two charms, including the Mr. Raccoon charm, the Raccoon City Classic audio pack, and files: Letters from 1998. The pre-order bonus also includes the Apocalypse outfit for Grace. </p>



<p>Players should note that even though the skin seemingly confirms Leon Kennedy’s appearance in Resident Evil Requiem, Capcom is yet to confirm the arrival of this character officially. </p>



<p>In other news, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiems-first-trailer-featured-leon-leaker-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaker has claimed</a> that Resident Evil Requiem’s first trailer featured Leon. Additionally, the game’s bosses will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-bosses-will-have-players-using-their-wits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">require players to use their wits</a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/runescape-dev-really-really-wants-its-players-to-vote-in-favor-of-removing-the-games-least-popular-microtransactions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/runescape-dev-really-really-wants-its-players-to-vote-in-favor-of-removing-the-games-least-popular-microtransactions.1338859/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">RuneScape developer Jagex is considering removing one of the game's least popular, yet most pervasive, layers of microtransactions. But instead of just making the decision itself, it's letting its entire playerbase vote on whether or not to ditch them entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and the vote is definitely rigged. But it's...rigged in the players' favor?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, the modern version of RuneScape (also known as RuneScape 3) features a number of different types of microtransactions, including a major feature called Treasure Hunter. Very basically, Treasure Hunter allows players to obtain keys in various ways, which are used to open treasure chests and receive items of varying rarity. Though it is possible to obtain small numbers of keys without spending money, far more are obtainable for players who spend money on the game. Over time, this has led to players complaining that Treasure Hunter is essentially a pay-to-win mechanic, since players can obtain items that give them large amounts of experience points through Treasure Hunter, effectively encouraging players to spend more to level up characters quickly.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There have been other issues with Treasure Hunter over the years as well, as well as its predecessor microtransaction "Squeal of Fortune", but the ability to essentially pay to bypass gameplay is by far the most controversial. In fact, Jagex even experimented with removing the feature in part back in July, when it disabled microtransactions for a week. A <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/mtx-experiments-what-weve-learned?_gl=1*1o5v5mz*_gcl_au*MTQyNTk0NDY4MS4xNzYxNzQ3MjE5*_ga*NjU1MTkzMzA5LjE3NjE3NDcyMTk.*_ga_DSN9YBF934*czE3NjE3NTUyMTQkbzIkZzAkdDE3NjE3NTUyMTQkajYwJGwwJGg5ODMxNDE1ODY." data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">follow-up survey run by the studio</a> suggested that 65% of players felt positively or neutral about the change.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So today, Jagex sent out a press release stating that it was launching a community vote to "decide the future of RuneScape's microtransactions." The developer has launched a page on its website that allows players to vote to remove Treasure Hunter from the game entirely, simultaneously removing over 220 associated items, including the experience points boosting items that have caused issues in the past. Jagex says it will remove Treasure Hunter from the game if the poll receives over 100,000 votes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This vote is one of the most important moments in RuneScape’s history," said Jagex CEO Jon Bellamy in a statement. "Starting right now, players will cast the deciding vote on the future direction of the game. Since Squeal of Fortune was introduced in 2012, and subsequently Treasure Hunter in 2014, our approach to monetisation has, over time, eroded some of the integrity at the heart of RuneScape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The most concerning elements of our MTX systems have been those that allowed players to bypass core gameplay, skipping over the depth, challenge, and sense of discovery that make RuneScape truly special. While these systems have helped fund the game, they’ve done so at a cost to something far greater:  the integrity of our worlds. This vote is about correcting that, and taking a step toward designing experiences that are fair, rewarding, and built to last.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's critical to point out though that Jagex's poll really isn't a poll at all. It's a <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=poll/treasure-hunter-poll" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">button players can press</a> if they want to vote in favor of removing Treasure Hunter. There's no option for players to vote "no", Jagex will simply implement the change if 100,000 people total vote in favor. And the page itself makes it pretty dang clear that Jagex wants players to vote for this. Using language such as suggesting those who vote "yes" want to "see an integrity-led RuneScape powered by your own accomplishments" and the presence of multiple green "Vote Yes Now" buttons all down the page are, uh, not exactly subtle. Nor is the fact that Jagex seems pretty ready to implement this, as if it already knows what the result would be.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But while a clearly-rigged non-poll sounds bad, it's <em>also</em> critical to note that players actually do seem to want this to happen. Over on the RuneScape subreddit, players are ecstatic. The top comment on the Jagex mod's official post announcing the vote simply says "Holy based", followed by "I can't believe I lived to see this", and many, many more comments along those lines. In fact, the positivity is overwhelming. While some players seem skeptical that they'll meet the 100,000 vote requirement, others are confident, even suggesting the OSRS (Old School RuneScape) players might support the poll as well, just on principle. It seems as though they needn't worry. At the time this piece was written, the poll had been up for just four hours, and had already reached 50,000 votes. For context, Jagex says on its website that there have been over 320,000,000 RuneScape accounts created over the years...though how many of those are active is a very different question (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/old-school-runescape-is-more-popular-than-ever-breaks-concurrent-player-record/1100-6533697/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Old School RuneScape recently surpassed 240,000 players</a> this past August).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, this seems like a positive, long-needing, and welcome change for the RuneScape community. It's  just a little weird that it's being framed as a poll, when the desired outcome for both players and developer is pretty obvious. There is a potential reading of this as simply a move for positive PR, specifically given that Jagex was acquired just last year, Bellamy was instated as a new CEO just this past March, and he's already had a bad round of headlines over <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/jagex-ceo-wants-studio-s-games-to-operate-as-apolitically-as-possible-" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">canceling annual in-game Pride events</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have until November 12 to vote if they would like to remove the microtransactions, and can continue voting beyond the 100,000 needed numbers to express support for the change. Removing Treasure Hunter won't fully remove all microtransactions from the game, with cosmetics and bonus XP items with set caps to help curb exploits will remain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Early thoughts on Battlefield's free-to-play, standalone battle royale.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After a few long sessions since yesterday’s surprise launch of Battlefield REDSEC, the free-to-play battle royale spin-off of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer">Battlefield 6</a>, it’s clearly coming after other grounded-ish military battle royales like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pubg-playerunknowns-battlegrounds-free-to-play-review-2022">PUBG</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-20-review">Call of Duty: Warzone</a>. Hiding a fun mission structure within its streamlined familiarity — as well as an entire non-BR game mode — I’ve had the most fun when its map, called Fort Lyndon, is used to push the boundary beyond the requisite ever-shrinking storm. I still need some more time in the fray to nail down a final opinion, especially since most of the random squadmates I’ve matched up with in the main BR modes haven’t exactly been playing as a team. But for now, the squad-based, elimination-driven, free-for-all Gauntlet mode has impressed me more than the battle royale option itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With destructible environments, the ultimate buzzword (<em><strong>levelution</strong></em>), powerful vehicles that can alter the tide of battle or serve as fun chokepoints, and a baked-in squad system, Battlefield 6 seems like a perfect fit for a battle royale mode. But so far, REDSEC’s translation of Battlefield’s role-based structure feels like a shallow, if fun, take on the genre. Its hasn’t offered much yet to fully draw me away from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-review-2024">Fortnite</a>’s cartoonish chaos and electrifying events or separate itself from the likes of PUBG or Warzone beyond using Battlefield 6’s weapons and the Frostbite Engine. On the surface, REDSEC seems intent on reviving the rote 360-era conversation about shooters with a washed-out color palette because it seems so similar to its contemporaries.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, REDSEC’s compelling mission structure takes a rewarding cleaver to the otherwise ho-hum military BR doldrums. They’re kind of like the missions and bounties you’d find in Fortnite, but with better rewards and more diverse challenges. Even with otherwise uncooperative squadmates, I found myself planting bombs and capturing waypoints to reap the benefits of well-communicated rewards. That seems to be REDSEC’s secret sauce: each in-game mission pops up like clockwork after a few minutes, only requiring a few button presses to get you to the next simple target.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hinging on classic military FPS objectives like babysitting a planted bomb or picking up an important file so you can transmit its signal back to home base, these smaller sidequests add order to the otherwise chaotic pace of conquering the battlefield. Completing an objective will always come with some kind of supply drop. I really like how these drops are handled, offering a clearly communicated reward before accepting the mission, since some will alert nearby players to your presence.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Charlie's Favorite Multiplayer Shooters</h3><p>I've been playing multiplayer shooters for about as long as I've been playing video games. From Halo and Black Ops II to Kid Icarus: Uprising and Splatoon, I've sunk a ton of time into the genre. Here are some of my favorites!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In contrast, Gauntlet expands each of these extra objectives into full-fledged game modes, pitting a handful of four-player squads against each other to rack up the most points on each objective. The mode and objective will change throughout each of the four rounds, with the lowest-performing squads getting eliminated until only two remain. Rotating through different named locations within Fort Lyndon, each game mode uses a piece of the map and works more like a mish-mash between Fall Guys and a squad-based, free-for-all version of traditional Battlefield that’s easily been my favorite part of REDSEC for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield REDSEC’s slow-rolling storm just hasn’t done much to incentivize me toward a hard objective or new destination, but its mission structure usually got me (and any uncooperative squadmates) moving in the right direction towards otherwise flat attempts at the #1 spot so far. I’ll need more time to complete missions and snipe away at opponents across the map before delivering a final verdict, but for now, REDSEC at least has some unexpectedly interesting things going for it.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-review]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-starts-black-friday-early-this-160w-3-port-compact-usb-c-charger-is-selling-for-peanuts.1338820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Those tiny 20W chargers work fine for a single phone but they crumble under the weight of modern device ecosystems where laptops, tablets, and phones all need power simultaneously. The <strong>Anker Prime Charger delivers a massive 160W across three USB-C ports</strong> while staying roughly the size of an AirPods Pro case, and solves the cable chaos and outlet shortage that plagues anyone who travels with multiple devices. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5020/">early Black Friday deal drops the price from $149 to $109, hitting an all-time low for Anker’s most advanced charging technology</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5020/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>GaN Technology Packs Professional Power Into Pocket Size</h2>
<p>Gallium Nitride technology allows this charger to deliver 1.35W per cubic centimeter of power density. This <strong>figure explains how Anker fits 160W into a size that easily fits in your hand</strong>: Traditional silicon-based chargers would have to be three times larger to provide the same power.</p>
<p>The compact design lets you slip this charger into a side pocket of your laptop bag without the bulk of carrying multiple chargers. <strong>Three USB-C ports eliminate the hassle of managing adapters</strong> for those who need to charge a laptop, phone and tablet at the same time.</p>



<p>The <strong>140W single-port output provides steady power</strong> without reducing speed: This means your laptop charges quickly even when other devices are plugged into the other ports. This feature is crucial during work sessions when you need your MacBook Pro charged up fast before a meeting or flight. Anker claims <strong>you can charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro from empty to 50 percent in just 25 minutes</strong>. Any of the three ports can deliver the full 140W so you won’t have to remember which port is the fastest or worry about plugging into the wrong one. The <strong>charger automatically adjusts power distribution based on the devices connected</strong>&nbsp;so that each one gets the right amount of current without manual adjustments.</p>



<p>The <em>AnkerSense View</em> display <strong>shows real-time wattage for each port</strong>, and allows you to see exactly how much power each device gets at any time. Touch controls on the charger allow you to switch modes instantly between different power distribution settings based on your needs. Bluetooth connectivity links the charger to Anker’s mobile app which offers custom charging modes you can set up for specific device combinations you use often.</p>
<p>Build quality reflects Anker’s reputation for durable charging gear: The sturdy port construction can withstand repeated plugging and unplugging for years of daily use. The 24-month warranty provides solid support coverage and protects your investment. Foldable prongs keep the charger compact during transport and shield the plug from damage in bags. The charger is <strong>compatible with any USB-C device</strong>&nbsp;including MacBooks, iPads, iPhones, Android phones, Steam Decks, Nintendo Switches, and many other gadgets that charge via USB-C.</p>
<p>At $109, this Anker charger is cheaper than buying three separate charging blocks while providing better power density and smart features.</p>

<p>Horrifyingly good</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Capcom has revealed a bunch of new information for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> ahead of its Switch 2 launch next year on <strong>27th February</strong>.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are now live via the Switch 2 eShop, with a standard edition priced at £64.99 / $69.99 and a deluxe edition at £74.99 / $79.99. The latter will grant you the following bonus features, while pre-orders for either edition will bag a special Grace: Apocalypse costume:</p>
<p>- Five costumes include Grace's Costume: Dimitrescu<br>
- Two filters including Filter: Apocalypse<br>
- Four weapon skins including S&amp;S Weapon Skin: Apocalypse<br>
- Two charms including Charm: Mr. Raccoon<br>
- Audio Pack: Raccoon City Classic<br>
- Files: Letters from 1998</p>

<p>That's not all, though. A limited edition Resident Evil Requiem Pro Controller has also been revealed for the Switch 2. Launching on the same day as the game itself, it'll come in a gunmetal colour scheme and boast key iconography.</p>
<p>Later in the year, during Summer 2026, a Grace Ashcroft amiibo will also release for the Switch 2. Functionality has not been confirmed, and nor do we get to see exactly what it looks like just yet, but this is very exciting news for fans of amiibo.</p>

<p>A new Resident Evil Showcase will take place at the start of 2026 offering up a deeper look at Resident Evil Requiem before its launch, so be sure to look out for that.</p>
<p>In the meantime, those who enjoy keeping fancy boxes on their shelves will want to check out the 'Generation Pack', a special edition release containing Requiem alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil: Village</a> on Switch 2. All three games launch on the same day. [Update: The price is $89.99 and all the games are Game-Key Cards.]</p>

<p>So there you have it! Resident Evil fans are eating good, that's for sure. We're certain Capcom will have more surprises in store when the franchise celebrates its 30th anniversary in the new year, so we'll be sure to keep you updated on any developments.</p>

            <p>
For as video gamey a series as The Matrix is, it is a touch surprising there have only been a handful of actual games. Obviously the one that makes most sense is The Matrix Online, what other genre but an MMO could The Matrix could be? Well, there's also Enter The Matrix, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-enter-the-matrix">which is basically Max Payne</a>, but you still have to wonder what else could have been. Especially because The Wachowskis literally pitched the idea of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> creator Hideo Kojima making a Matrix game directly to Konami.
</p>
<p>
Christopher Bergstresser, the former vice president of licensing at Konami Digital Entertainment, recently spoke with <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/no-one-ever-told-me-such-a-conversation-had-taken-place-kojima-wasnt-aware-of-the-wachowskis-matrix-game-offer">Time Extension</a> about this apparent pitch, explaining that "The Wachowskis were big fans of Kojima." He explained, "So Kazumi Kitaue, Kojima, Aki Saito (who still works with Kojima), and I were at the Konami HQ, and we got a call from the Wachowskis, who wanted to come in and meet with Kojima. So they did!"
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I was surprised to see on social media that the Wachowski sisters had “offered me a Matrix game project!” back in 1999. In all these 26 years, no one ever told me such a conversation had taken place. At the time, we were mutual fans and exchanged emails. The Matrix hadn’t been… <a href="https://t.co/4P10P9eEfT">pic.twitter.com/4P10P9eEfT</a></p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1983390844037009907?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
The pair of directors attended the meeting with their visual effects lead, asking if Konami and Kojima would make a Matrix game, to which Kitaue (who went on to become CEO of Konami) apparently plainly said "'No.' We did still get to enjoy the Matrix Japanese premiere and afterparty, though." Except, apparently, according to Kojima himself, he wasn't even aware of such a pitch.
</p>
<p>
After word of Time Extension's report went around, Kojima took to his personal English Twitter account to say that he was "surprised to see on social media that the Wachowski sisters had 'offered me a Matrix game project!' back in 1999. In all these 26 years, no one ever told me such a conversation had taken place."
</p><p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> director went on to explain that he does recall having met the Wachowskis three times, and that they had attended Konami's headquarters, but Kojima only showed up after the meeting with Kitaue had taken place. He also remembers attending the Japanese premiere and party, but "even then, there was no mention of an offer."
</p>
<p>
It's this bit that will leave you with thoughts of what could have been: "At that time, I was already extremely busy with MGS2 and probably couldn’t have accepted the offer right away. But if someone had told me, maybe there could’ve been a way to make it work." Alas, now we'll never know! Which makes me a touch sad, because I would love to live in a world where his hypothetical Matrix game reads your browser history to judge you or something, you know, one of those classic oddball Kojima features.

              <p>Gaming on the go has always meant compromising on screen quality or lugging around bulky equipment, but portable monitors have changed that equation completely. The KYY 15.6-inch portable display solves a real problem for console gamers who want to play their Switch, PlayStation, or Xbox anywhere without hunting for an available TV. This compact screen transforms your gaming setup into something truly mobile, turning hotel rooms, friends’ houses, or even your backyard into viable gaming spaces. Amazon has dropped the price from $99 to just $69, hitting an all-time low that makes this accessory almost too good to pass up for serious gamers who value flexibility.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD Gaming Fits in Your Backpack</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch IPS panel provides a 1920×1080 resolution</strong> with a 178-degree viewing angle: This keeps colors true, even when watching from the side. HDR technology adds depth to darker scenes and prevents bright areas from losing details which is important during intense gaming sessions. The screen measures 8.8 inches tall and 14.2 inches wide, and gives you plenty of space for immersive gameplay without the bulk of a traditional monitor. <strong>Blue light reduction and flicker-free operation</strong> allow for hours of gaming without the eye strain often caused by cheaper displays. This IPS technology ensures consistent color accuracy across the entire screen.</p>



<p>Connectivity meets all your needs with <strong>two full-function USB-C ports and a Mini-HDMI port</strong>. The USB-C ports support Thunderbolt 3 and 3.1, and allows you to power the monitor and send video through one cable from compatible laptops or phones. Your Switch connects directly through USB-C for a clean setup with minimal cable clutter. The HDMI port works with the PS4, Xbox and older devices that lack USB-C outputs. The one-cable solution avoids the hassle of carrying multiple adapters and dealing with complex setups when you just want to plug in and play.<strong> Two built-in stereo speakers and a 3.5mm audio jack</strong> give you sound output options based on your environment and preferences.</p>



<p>The <strong>ultra-slim 0.3-inch profile and 1.7-pound weight</strong> make this monitor very portable: It fits easily into laptop bags or backpacks without adding noticeable bulk. The included smart cover serves as both a protective shell and an adjustable stand. It has two grooves that let you choose your preferred viewing angle. The PU leather exterior resists scratches and bumps during transport, and the frameless magnetic design keeps everything secure without clunky clasps or zippers.</p>
<p>The monitor works in <strong>both landscape and portrait orientations</strong>: This opens up fun possibilities beyond gaming, like reading documents, browsing social media on your phone’s extended screen, or watching movies in different aspect ratios. The premium gray metal finish looks professional enough for work presentations while still keeping the gaming aesthetic that console players enjoy. A simple menu control wheel on the side allows you to adjust brightness, contrast and other settings without navigating complicated on-screen menus.</p>
<p>At $69, this portable monitor costs less than many wired controllers and greatly expands where and how you can enjoy your console games. The $30 discount turns this affordable accessory into an impulse purchase that pays off each time you want to game away from your main TV.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/we-have-never-been-more-12-years-old.1338793/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Monday, we reached all-time-high levels of being 12 years old when several government social media accounts <a href="https://aftermath.site/trump-halo-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a deluge of Trump-themed <em>Halo </em>memes</a>. Unfortunately, today those in the halls of power have raised the bar again, making their past selves look downright 13 in comparison.</p><p>Now we’ve got White House Deputy Press Secretary Kush Desai and the Department of Homeland Security weighing in, both of whom provided comments on the memes to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/exclusive-white-142217261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freelance journalist and Aftermath pal Alyssa Mercante</a>. Desai centered his response around the supposed end of the console wars, which should only matter to you if you died in the 90s while arguing about who’d win in a fight between Mario and Sonic and now haunt the playground you were crawling around on to this day:</p><blockquote><p>“Yet another war ended under President Trump's watch—only one leader is fully committed to giving power to the players, and that leader is Donald J. Trump. That’s why he’s hugely popular with the American people and American Gamers."</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>(With <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-gamergate-ghost-of-yotei-probablymonsters-fired" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loud reactionaries</a>, maybe, but with normal people caught in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a tornado</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of tariffs</a>, almost <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-low-approval-rating-october-b2854656.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">certainly not</a>.)</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security’s media team decided to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alyssamerc.bsky.social/post/3m4dt3spux22d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">go the openly racist and xenophobic route</a>, because of course they did:</p><blockquote><p>"We will reach people where they are with content they can relate to and understand, whether that be <em>Halo</em>, <em>Pokemon</em>, <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, or any other medium. DHS remains laser focused on bringing awareness to the flood of crime that criminal illegal aliens have inflicted on our country. We aren't slowing down."</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Then we have the crown jewel in today’s gold-embossed propeller hat: Vice President JD Vance casually referencing <a href="https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-dog-collar-kaya-nontroversy-twitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the dumbest, most disingenuous Twitch drama yet</a> during <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3m4dyrpqz6k2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an appearance on New York Post’s Pod Force One podcast</a>. Speaking about his own dog, Atlas, Vance voiced his opinion on CollarGate:</p><p>“I kind of obsessively trained him,” Vance said of Atlas. “You could see this: He sits on command, he stays on command. He has this command, place, which is basically if I snap my finger and point, he will run to that place and lay down."&nbsp;</p><p>"You don't have to zap him like Hasan [Piker]?" asked the show’s host, Miranda Devine.</p><p>"Not like Hasan Piker?” Vance replied in a voice that anyone should be disqualified from running for public office simply for possessing. “ No. No electrocution of dogs here."&nbsp;</p><p>"How disgusting is that? What does that tell you about a person?" said Devine, whose unquenchable appetite for boot needs to be studied.</p><p>"Well, I think that tells you that they're bad people,” said Vance, 12, who nonetheless possesses the baby brain of someone who was born yesterday. “If you can actually cause suffering to an innocent animal, you're probably the kind of person who doesn't worry about suffering in people as well. And that's been my experience: If you mistreat dogs, that's almost 100 percent a sign that you're gonna be a really terrible person."</p><p>Tell that to the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/millions-americans-prepare-lose-snap-benefits-states-are-moving-bridge-rcna239159" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">40 million low-income Americans about to lose SNAP benefits</a>. I’m sure they’ll agree with you that the truest measure of a man is his dog, rather than his proclivity for aiding and abetting mass immiseration. Also, I bet JD Vance’s dog hates him, too.&nbsp;</p><p>On the upside, while we’ve never been more 12 years old than we are today, we could not possibly become <em>even </em>more 12 tomorrow. I’m sure this is it, and soon everyone will be grownups again.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-halo-dhs-ice-trump-flood"><h3>Not Commenting Is Commenting</h3></a><p>'Microsoft does not have anything to share on this matter'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/trump-halo-twitter"><h3>The Trump Halo Memes Aren’t Supposed To Make Sense</h3></a><p>It's me, the sucker trying to figure them out anyway</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/us-government-halo-jd-vance-hasan-piker-dog]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-offloads-surface-pro-512gb-ssd-x-plus-at-a-new-low-black-friday-starts-early-2000639973</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-offloads-surface-pro-512gb-ssd-x-plus-at-a-new-low-black-friday-starts-early.1338781/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The laptop versus tablet debate has frustrated professionals for years, forcing compromises between portability and productivity that never quite satisfy either need. Microsoft’s Surface Pro eliminates that choice by delivering a fantastic <strong>2-in-1 device that excels as both a full-powered Windows laptop and a sleek tablet</strong> you can hold with one hand.</p>
<p>Early Black Friday deals have hit the entire Surface Pro lineup hard with discounts ranging from 20 to 30% across all configurations including LCD and OLED displays, Snapdragon X Plus and X Elite processors, and every storage and RAM combination. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5092/">particular model with a Snapdragon X Plus processor, 16GB RAM, and 512GB storage has dropped from $1,199 to $949</a>, which marks an all-time low for Microsoft’s latest Copilot+ PC.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5092/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Snapdragon Revolution Changes Everything</h2>
<p>The <strong>Snapdragon X Plus processor with 10 cores</strong> marks a major change in Windows computing: It offers performance that competes with Apple’s M3 chip while using less power. This ARM-based design runs cooler and more efficiently than traditional Intel or AMD processors. It <strong>leads to a 14-hour battery life</strong>&nbsp;which makes all-day work sessions feasible without searching for outlets.</p>
<p>The integrated NPU processes AI tasks locally on your device: It <strong>handles Copilot+ features without sending your data to the cloud,</strong> and keeps your information private and providing quick responses. Native ARM apps perform well and Microsoft’s updated emulation layer ensures that most x86 Windows software runs smoothly even if it hasn’t been recompiled. With 16GB of RAM, you can multitask easily across many browser tabs, multiple Office documents, and background apps.</p>



<p>The 1<strong>3-inch touchscreen boasts sharp 2880 x 1920 resolution</strong> at a comfortable 3:2 aspect ratio which shows more vertical content than typical 16:9 laptop displays. This extra height is important for reading documents, browsing the internet or working in spreadsheets as vertical space determines how much information is visible without scrolling. The display <strong>allows for use with the Surface Pen</strong> which is great for drawing, note-taking, and precise editing tasks.</p>
<p>The <strong>512GB SSD provides ample storage for your operating system</strong>, applications and files, so you won’t have to constantly manage cloud storage or external drives. This capacity easily holds your entire photo library, video projects, and software installations with extra space for future needs. Its read and write speeds far surpass traditional hard drives, making file transfers, app launches, and boot times feel instantaneous.</p>



<p><strong>Copilot+ PC features</strong> change how you interact with Windows through useful AI capabilities, rather than mere gimmicks: Windows Studio Effects improve video calls by enhancing lighting, canceling background noise and automatically blurring distractions without needing additional software or manual tweaks. <strong>Real-time translation offers subtitles in 44 languages during</strong> video calls or streaming, bridging language gaps for international work or entertainment. <em>Cocreate</em> generates artwork from text descriptions or image prompts, giving creative professionals quick tools for brainstorming and developing concepts.</p>
<p>The <strong>unique kickstand adjusts to almost any angle</strong> from nearly flat for digital art to steep angles ideal for watching movies on a plane tray table. This flexibility allows the Surface Pro to fit whatever space you’re using rather than forcing you to work within rigid laptop constraints. Fast charging through the proprietary Surface Connect port or standard USB-C adds options for power sources, and the 65W power supply can quickly recharge the battery during short breaks.</p>
<p>At a price of $949, this configuration offers fantastic value for early Black Friday shoppers seeking premium build quality and advanced AI features.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nvidia-kicks-off-black-friday-asus-rtx-5070-ti-now-at-its-lowest-price-ever-2000639954</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-kicks-off-black-friday-asus-rtx-5070-ti-now-at-its-lowest-price-ever.1338778/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming has evolved into a visual spectacle where every frame matters and your graphics card is the engine that powers those immersive experiences. The Asus TUF gaming <strong>GeForce RTX 5070 Ti</strong> brings professional-grade performance to your setup, and right now, early Black Friday deals are making this powerhouse more accessible than ever.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4923/">has slashed the price from $999 to $849 which marks an all-time low</a> for this recently launched GPU that’s built on <strong>Nvidia’s cutting-edge Blackwell architecture</strong>. This is your chance to future-proof your gaming rig with 16GB of blazing-fast GDDR7 memory and DLSS 4 technology that transforms how games look and perform.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5090/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Blackwell Revolution Comes to Your Desktop</h2>
<p><strong>Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture</strong> marks a real advancement in graphics processing. The <strong>RTX 5070 Ti uses that power with 16GB of GDDR7 memory</strong>&nbsp;which provides the bandwidth that modern games need. <strong>DLSS 4 revolutionizes gaming</strong> by using AI to generate frames intelligently. This allows you to increase ray tracing settings without seeing a drop in frame rates. The card runs at 2588 MHz in default mode and can reach 2610 MHz in OC mode. This gives you extra performance when you need it. These <strong>specs translate to smooth 1440p gaming at ultra settings and good 4K performance</strong> in most games.</p>
<p>Asus put a lot of thought into the <strong>cooling solution</strong>: They designed a 3.125-slot card with three Axial-tech fans that move a lot of air through a large fin array. The phase-change GPU thermal pad is a smart engineering choice. It lasts longer than regular thermal paste and keeps temperatures optimal, even during long gaming sessions that push the card hard. This design keeps your GPU cool and quiet, and avoid the loud noises that cheaper cards make under load. The extra slot width may seem like a compromise, but it is really an investment in durability. Cooler components last longer and maintain their performance over the years.</p>



<p>Durability is a priority with military-grade components that provide solid power delivery and a longer lifespan compared to standard designs: The protective PCB coating offers another layer of <strong>defense against moisture, dust, and debris</strong> that can cause short circuits. These features matter a lot, especially if you’re building a system you want to keep for several years.</p>



<p>Connectivity is also strong, with <strong>PCIe 5.0 support, multiple DisplayPort 2.1 outputs, and HDMI</strong> for maximum flexibility with monitors and VR headsets. The GPU Tweak III software allows you to control performance easily. You can adjust clock speeds, voltages, and fan curves without getting into complicated BIOS settings. Thermal monitoring helps you keep an eye on temperatures in different GPU areas.</p>
<p>At $150 off, this deal is a real value in a market where graphics card prices can often feel unrealistic.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Xbox sales have been tanking for a while now — and the story hasn’t gotten any brighter. Microsoft just released its Q1 2026 earnings and Xbox hardware revenue was down 29 percent year-over-year. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716191/microsoft-q4-2025-earnings-revenue-profits-windows-xbox-gaming-surface">Last quarter</a>, it was down 22 percent. Down 29 percent in the first two quarters of 2025, down 42 percent in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24209519/microsoft-q4-2024-earnings-revenue-profits-windows-xbox-gaming-surface">Q4</a> of 2024… You get the picture.</p><p>As tariffs and inflation take their toll, Microsoft has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/797023/circana-video-game-consoles-switch-2-tariffs">dramatically increased the prices</a> on its gaming hardware, with the Series X now starting at $599.99. Microsoft’s response has been to deemphasize the console and pursue an “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24067370/microsoft-xbox-playstation-switch-games-future-hardware">Xbox everywhere</a>” strategy. That has yielded some success on the content and services front, though revenue there was largely flat this quarter, only growing one percent year over year.</p><p>Microsoft would obviously like to see more growth there. The company has reportedly been pursuing dramatic <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805280/microsoft-xbox-gaming-profit-targets-layoffs">30 percent profit margins</a> there, leading to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696877/xbox-perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-the-initiative-layoffs">cancelled projects.</a> But the company’s outlook for Q2 isn’t much rosier. It expects Xbox hardware revenue to continue to decline, and content and services to continue low-single digits growth.</p><p>Microsoft did see hardware growth from Windows OEM and Devices, with revenue increasing a modest 6 percent year over year. The company stopped reporting Surface earnings separately, so it’s unclear how those devices are performing. They had been on a steady decline for several years.</p><p>It’s Azure and cloud services that remain the driving force behind Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716783/microsoft-4-trillion-market-cap-valuation">ascent</a>. The growth of its intelligent cloud services is substantial. Revenue increased 28 percent year over year to $30.9 billion, with Azure specifically growing 40 percent.</p><p>More broadly, Microsoft Cloud revenue was $49.1 billion, an increase of 26 percent from Q1 2025. The company’s cloud divisions and Azure have been growing steadily for several years now.</p><p>In total, Microsoft reported $77.7 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 18 percent from the same time last year. And its net income was $27.7 billion, up 12 percent. While those increases are largely driven by the company’s various cloud offerings, its productivity and business processes still account for a significant portion of its income ($33 billion).</p><p><em><strong>Update, October 29th</strong>: This article was updated with details from Microsoft’s earnings call.</em> The headline was also updated to specify that it was hardware sales that were down.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjA5MzU0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Terrence O'Brien</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/809532/xbox-sales-continue-to-tank]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Right, what do we have here, a new game called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-florist">The Florist</a>, 'ey? About a woman delivering a beautiful flower arrangement to a lakeside town? Well, surely this is one of those wholesome, cosy games I've been hearing about! Nope! It is, in fact, a survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>, and not the kind that's trying to trick you like I just made a less than half-arsed attempt at.
</p>
<p>
Those opening couple of sentences weren't lies though, it really is about a woman making a flower delivery in a lakeside town (called Joycliffe). It's just that the town is also suffering from some kind of "lethal affliction" that appears to be of the floral variety. The town is covered in plants and petals of all sorts, this infection turning its inhabitants into almost literally green thumb monsters.
</p>
<p>
So far the reveal is just a bit of a tease, but I must admit I'm quite curious about its approach to horror. Nature is scary! Yet the ways this can be explored in films and games can often lean towards an apocalyptic absence of nature. Here, nature is the thing that is becoming dominant, a force that we're normally quick to kill. Horror is often the genre best suited for looking at the ways people interact with the world, so I'm hoping The Florist pulls it off.
</p>
<p>
Details are generally quite limited, but there are a few to be found on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3152440/The_Florist/">Steam page</a>. The game uses my beloved fixed camera angle, something bigger budget games just seem to be too afraid of using these days. There's puzzles, there's gun-based combat, and perhaps controversially, unlimited inventory space.
</p><p>
Lastly, the world also apparently "grows and changes throughout the game." I think a good survival horror that uses fixed camera angles is one that should force you to get to know a space, so a space that changes and becomes uncertain sounds quite intriguing - if the devs can pull it off.
</p>
<p>
The Florist is currently expected to launch sometime in 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Desktop Defender</em> is a confoundingly compelling mix of <a href="https://kotaku.com/fuck-me-i-cant-stop-playing-cookie-clicker-1847794400"><em>Cookie Clicker</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/castlevania-roguelike-vampire-survivors-steam-itch-io-1848402308"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>. The game sits in a little corner of your computer screen whether you’re emailing people for work or paying your bills for the month. The action consists of a tiny triangle shooting other blips that arrive from offscreen to destroy it. It levels up and earns loot, briefly interrupting your other work as you choose upgrades and look for synergies to help the lo-fi automated ship survive its hostile confines a little bit longer, or at least until you power down your PC. Indie developer Conrad Grindheim made it on a whim in just a month. It wound up being one of the 50 most downloaded games <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-october-2025-might-magic-yapyap-half-sword-2000637407">during the October 2025 Steam Next Fest</a>.</p> <p>“We launched the demo with 200 wishlists and I was hoping for maybe 20 concurrent players,” he told <em>Kotaku</em> over email. “When we reached 36 I was super happy because we had basically doubled our goal. Lo and behold…we ended up reaching over 1,500, landing us in the top 4 most played Steam demos, as well as getting a special commendation and a feature from Steam. To say that this was unexpected would be selling it short, but I could not be happier.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">1 week ago we had 3 players, today I got this e-mail.</p> <p>Thank you all so much ♥️ <a href="https://t.co/AcG7Q9ltXi">pic.twitter.com/AcG7Q9ltXi</a></p> <p>— Conradical (@ConradicalGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConradicalGames/status/1980339314740588692?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Desktop Defender</em> is part of a recent wave of Steam games that mostly play themselves while you do other stuff on your desktop. Some, like <em>Bongo Cat</em>, are minimally interactive. Others, like<em> Bao Bao’s Cozy Laundromat</em>, can be more complex. While some are just fun distractions, others play off the satisfaction many people innately get from watching a fictional measure of progress continually tick upwards. Grindheim wanted<em> Desktop Defender</em> to be slightly more engaging.</p>

 <p>“I made <em><span>Desktop Defender</span>&nbsp;</em>because I really enjoyed this new wave of “screen sitting” idlers, but I hadn’t found one with more integrated long-term strategies,” he said. “I’m thinking more like <em>NGU Idle</em> or <em>Cookie Clicker</em>‘s endgame. In combination with the extra tactility that the shooting tower adds, I felt that I could really bring something new to the genre. To many, the appeal of these games is to see numbers go up while doing something else, but I feel there’s an extra section of the playerbase that also really enjoys strategizing over long periods of time.”</p>

 <h2>Turning idling PCs into productive escapes</h2> <p>Grindheim (who you may remember <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/indie-dev-files-dmca-takedown-against-his-own-game-as-dispute-with-publisher-continues/">trying to DMCA his own game</a> during a public spat with the publisher back in 2023) spends much of his time working on the monster-taming action-RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2421080/Synth_Beasts/"><em>Synth Beasts</em></a> which was Kickstarted with over $20,000 in pledged funds earlier this year. But he also finds time to experiment with shorter releases to try to understand how popular genres and tastes are evolving on Steam. He worked on <em>Desktop Defender</em> solo for about a month, only purchasing some assets for music and icons while making the rest of the UI elements, characters, and enemies in-house.</p>

 <p>“The aesthetics are really inspired by <em>SNKRX</em>, and the gameplay mechanics as well to a certain extent, although the two games still feel very different,” he said. <em>SNKRX&nbsp;</em>uses the elements of <a href="https://kotaku.com/auto-chess-took-over-my-life-in-a-single-afternoon-1835710673"><em>Auto Chess</em></a> to reimagine the classic arcade game <em>Snake</em>, and is a precursor to games like <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. “I really enjoyed playing <em>Rusty’s Retirement</em> and I felt like combining something like that with my interest in games with synergistic loadout building (e.g. roguelikes or RPGs) would make for a super fun time.”</p>

  <p>Where<em> Vampire Survivors</em> demands your full attention, <em>Rusty’s Retirement</em>, in which you occasionally help robots automate a <em>Stardew Valley-</em>like farming sim operation, provides bite-sized bursts of problem-solving nestled neatly beside real-life productivity. “These games can offer a happy medium between not staring at a textbook for eight hours straight and the mental exhaustion that can come with constantly getting ourselves back into the productivity zone,” mental health researcher Natalie Coyle recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/27/arts/desktop-games-rustys-retirement.html">told <em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>

 <p>It’s the natural evolution of brief, session-based buildcrafting grindfests like <em>Balatro</em> which conveniently let players accrue little nuggets of satisfaction while waiting in line at the store or while sitting on the bus during a commute. But instead of punctuating the mundane moments in our lives, games like <em>Desktop Defender</em> interrupt our existing work flows with extra layers of progress.</p> <h2>The game you play while queuing for other games</h2> <p>Think of them as Pomodoro timers that double as Tamagotchi pets you can min-max in-between Excel sheet macros and anxiety-inducing Slack alerts. “I envisioned myself playing an idle game between work sessions or while compiling my games and how fun it would be to have a strategic throughline through that,” Grindheim said.</p> <p>But <em>Desktop Defender</em>‘s 15 minutes of Steam fame also points to the changing ways people play and discover games as the market becomes more and more flooded with them. “You look at games like<a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-vampire-survivors-clone-steam-pc-2000627591"><em> Megabonk</em></a> and while they launched with a sizeable wishlist count, it punched miles above its weight,” he said. “I think we’re seeing that smaller games, if designed well, can achieve more than before if they get that spark of visibility.”</p> <p>Grindheim credits an unexpected micro-community that popped up around the game for helping give it an extra bump, in addition to events like Steam Next Fest. “Tons of players on our Discord server and in community groups are constantly discussing the game’s most optimal builds and there’s a social aspect to that,” he noted. “Because people can play <em><span>Desktop Defender</span></em> and other idle games while in queue for online games, I feel it slots perfectly into how people are playing nowadays.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft says that Xbox hardware sales have gone down 29%, leading to a roughly $113 million revenue loss year over year. The news comes after, earlier in October, the company increased <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the price of Game Pass</a> to much controversy.</p>



<p>Xbox, despite having some well-received titles recently like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-world-record-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> and The Outer Worlds 2, has had a rough time recently. Massive cancellations of Game Pass and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/costco-has-reportedly-decided-to-stop-selling-xbox-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even removal from Costco</a> have not done well for the gaming team at Microsoft. Unfortunately, it seems like it has spread to its sales, as the company reports a 2% loss in total revenue.</p>



<h2 id="h-microsoft-reports-notable-drop-in-sales-for-xbox-compared-to-last-q1">Microsoft Reports Notable Drop in Sales for Xbox Compared to Last Q1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Microsoft </figcaption></figure>



<p>In the Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) Q1 report from Microsoft, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q1/press-release-webcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the company revealed</a> that Xbox did not reach the same heights as it did last Q1 for FY25. Having made $5.621 billion last Q1, the gaming subcompany went down to $5.508 billion, losing around $113 million. This also marks a 2% loss in total revenue, which is not great, but not too bad. The press release does mention the drop, stating,</p>



<p><strong>“Xbox hardware revenue decreased 29% driven by lower volume of consoles sold,”</strong> the company said. <strong>“Xbox content and services revenue increased 1% on a strong prior year comparable with growth in Xbox Game Pass and third-party content, offset in part by a decline in first-party content.”</strong></p>



<p>It’s important to note that the mentioned 1% increase comes from splitting content and services away from hardware, showing how each specific subsector is performing.</p>



<p>Whether Xbox can regain ground from its loss remains to be seen. It recently announced that Halo: Campaign Evolved is coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation</a>, continuing the company’s third-party movement forward. Xbox is planning a big year in 2026 with releases like Forza Horizon 6, Clockwork Revolution, and Fable. It’ll be interesting to see how it pans out and whether it can save face, regardless of how good its new games could be.</p>



<p>Overall, for Microsoft, the numbers aren’t bad as the company announced its operating income was up 24% to $38 billion while it saw a  12% total net income increase to $27.7 billion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> launched on October 10 to <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-steam-record-login-queue-multiplayer-download-issue-2000634042">huge player numbers on Steam</a> and a lot of momentum from a super successful and well-received open beta. It seemed like most people were excited for the game and its future. Now, just a little over two weeks later, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-update-redsec-season-1-download-free-ea-ps5-steam-2000639598">the game’s first season and its battle royale mode have launched</a>, and for many online, the honeymoon is over.</p> <p>There’s no one single issue or change to blame for the angry fans and negative Steam reviews. Instead, it’s a mix of problems. Some fans are disappointed about colorful new skins and the battle pass, claiming it’s ruining the game’s launch vibes. Others are mad that the latest map added to <em>BF6</em>, Blackwell Fields, is yet again a fairly small map, and the new mode added in season one is tiny, too. And then there are the <em>Battlefield 6</em> players who hate the game’s new battle royale mode, which features a big ol’ map, and fear that it might pull resources from the main game and its classic modes.</p>

 <h2><em>Battlefield 6’s</em> season one battle pass and new skins</h2>   <p>Before<em> Battlefield 6</em> even launched, the topic of its cosmetics was a hot one. Many players, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-crossover-skins-rick-morty-call-of-duty-1851786919">myself included</a>, were tired of devs and publishers shoving crossover skins and other ugly cosmetics into nearly every modern online game. And the <em>Battlefield 6</em> devs promised that the then-upcoming game wouldn’t go down that road. This whole skins saga became such a big deal that eventually, <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-skins-black-ops-7-blops-6-carry-over-battlefield-6-2000620379">Activision announced the upcoming <em>Call of Duty Black Ops 7</em></a> would not let players bring skins over from <em>Black Ops 6</em> in order to prevent the FPS from instantly being flooded with goofy crap.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-first-new-map-review-season-1-blackwell-fields-eastwood-update-2000638228">Now, with the launch of season one,</a> <em>BF6</em> players online have access to the game’s first new skins since launch, and the reaction has been mixed. Some find the skins far too colorful or argue they don’t fit the military vibes. There are also some new skins that can be used with every class, which has frustrated players as they fear it will make it hard to quickly identify different classes during combat. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oi9wvl/they_made_the_system_override_skin_more_toned/">EA seems receptive to the feedback</a>, as at least one skin’s bright green details were toned down with the season one patch. Funnily enough, there are also some people who find the new skins boring and ugly, lacking any reason to chase after them via <em>BF6</em>‘s new battle pass. Trying to thread the needle with <em>BF6</em>‘s cosmetics is going to be a nightmare.</p>

 <p>Speaking of the battle pass, a lot of players aren’t happy with it, either. I get the feeling a lot of players online don’t like how it changes the vibes of the game. Now it feels like a real live-service shooter, something more akin to a modern<em> Call of Duty</em>, with ads encouraging players to buy the new battle pass, goals to chase, and limited-time rewards to unlock. And for some, this isn’t what they wanted. A highly rated post on the <em>Battlefield</em> subreddit is a screenshot of a Steam review saying: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oj8hzd/lool/">“This whole season 1 update feels like ad blocker stopped working.”</a></p>

 <h2><em>Redsec</em>, <em>BF6</em>‘s new battle royale mode, has a negative rating on Steam</h2> <p>The biggest new addition in <em>Battlefield 6′</em>s first season is <em>Redsec</em>, EA’s stab at a large-scale free-to-play battle royale game. Anyone can now download <em>BF6</em> <em>Redsec</em> and start playing the game’s new battle royale mode. The general consensus seems to be that <em>Redsec</em> is pretty good. I’ve not played much of it yet, but it does seem fun enough. However, over on Steam, the new <em>Redsec</em> mode <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1983566801913925824">has an overall negative review rating</a>. But a lot of people aren’t mad about the mode; instead, they’re upset about how it has been integrated into <em>BF6</em>.</p>

 <p>You see, the new battle pass brought with it weekly challenges. And some of these challenges require players to hop into <em>Redsec</em> to complete them. This isn’t going over well with some <em>BF6</em> fans who feel like EA is requiring them to play something they never wanted in the first place. While <em>BF6</em> lets you reroll a limited number of challenges, for those never planning on playing <em>Redsec</em>, it means they have to burn all their rerolls on challenges for a mode they have zero interest in. This has led to a lot of anger around <em>Redsec</em> and the new battle pass, too.</p>

 <p>And then there’s the issue of <em>Redsec</em>‘s map. It’s very, very big. This isn’t a bad thing at all. In fact, <em>Battlefield 6</em> players have been longing for bigger maps since the open beta. Battlefield Studios and EA promised bigger maps were coming. And then season one arrives, and the first new map added post-launch is a barren, bland oil field that feels overly cramped and isn’t what a lot of the online community wanted. Meanwhile, the free-to-play <em>Redsec</em> features a massive map. As you might expect, this hasn’t gone over well with many players clamoring for bigger maps.</p> <h2>The new map and mode are small and not very good</h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-is-very-bad-2000639647">The game’s first new map is Blackwell Fields</a>, a not-very-big level that is currently not much fun to play. You’ll likely get killed over and over again by snipers or blown up by AA guns if you try to fly around its limited skybox. Running around on foot is a chore, and the new map lacks any real landmarks or memorable spaces. And for many who were waiting for a bigger map to arrive post-launch, Blackwell Fields has shaken their confidence in the game’s future.</p> <p>A new mode, Strikepoint, also added in season one, is essentially<em>&nbsp;Call of Duty</em>‘s popular seek-and-destroy. Two teams of four compete in multiple rounds to capture an objective. And once you die, that’s it until the next round. This kind of mode can be a lot of fun in shooters like <em>Counter-Strike.</em> But in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, Strikepoint feels out of place. The game already supports some smaller, infantry-focused modes, like team deathmatch and king of the hill. I’m not sure it needed yet another small mode. In a franchise known for big and epic warfare, the new small map and tiny mode feel like misfires and have disappointed many players.</p>

 <p>It might be easy to write off a lot of this as just a small but vocal group of players online being angry about a video game. And that’s certainly part of what’s happening here. But anecdotally, I know some folks who play <em>BF6</em> and aren’t very online. These people don’t troll Reddit or share angry social media posts. Yet even they aren’t sure about this new season.&nbsp; None of them seem to like Blackwell Fields, the new mode, or how the battle pass was implemented. And most of them are confused about <em>Redsec</em>, as they already have a few battle royales they play from time to time. The last thing they needed was one more.</p> <p>So, where does that leave<em> Battlefield 6?</em> There will be those who claim the game is dying and done. That’s not the case. It still has a huge playerbase across console and PC who are playing the game daily. But it’s clear that the mood has shifted. <em>Battlefield 6</em> is no longer a just-launched FPS harkening back to<em> Battlefield 3</em> and older shooters. Instead, it’s now an active live-service game with multiple components, battle pass options, and even a full in-game cosmetic store. That might mean more money for EA, but it also means a lot more criticism and pushback from players. The question now is: Will EA be willing to change its roadmap for <em>BF6</em> to appease these angry players, or will the publisher move forward as planned?</p>
