            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review.1053501/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been over 30 years since I wore out my VHS copy of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Since then the film franchise has been in a state of escalation. Where do you go after uncovering the literal Holy Grail? Aliens, then time machines, apparently. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is the perfect antidote to all of this; one that uses its own figurative Dial of Destiny to propel us back in time to Indy’s prime. The result is easily one of the best Indy stories across both the games <em>and</em> the movies, with painstakingly detailed environments, wonderfully atmospheric tomb raiding and puzzle solving, a pitch-perfect score, and quite possibly the greatest punch sound effect in the business. While it does stumble occasionally as a stealth-focused sneak ’em up, The Great Circle is an otherwise grand and gorgeous globe-trotting adventure that left me giddy as a schoolboy. Yes, it’s true that bringing Indiana Jones back to the big screen (twice) after he literally rode off into the sunset was probably a poor choice. But having MachineGames craft an Indy experience inspired by all the best games in that development team’s past?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda chose wisely.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">MachineGames’ most immediate legacy is the modern Wolfenstein series, and there’s certainly some of that on show in The Great Circle. Like The New Order and its excellent prequel and sequel, The Great Circle is first-person and highly story-driven, and I’d wager if there’s anyone who hates Nazis as much as Indy, it’s the Gestapo-gutting, SS-slaying BJ Blazkowicz. The Great Circle is not, however, a bloodthirsty exercise in double-fisted, lead-flinging fury. Unlike Wolfenstein, The Great Circle’s focus is patient and slower-paced exploration and stealth – where guns are rarely (and barely) a viable option. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, with the founding members of MachineGames all hailing from fellow Swedish studio Starbreeze, MachineGames’ DNA admittedly runs much deeper than Wolfenstein. For many of the team, it dates back to 2004’s outstanding and highly acclaimed The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. Riddick’s first-person fisticuffs and adventure elements appear to have been a huge inspiration on The Great Circle, and it’s refreshing to be playing a game like Butcher Bay again – particularly when it’s done with this much verve and commitment to a storied franchise. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For clarity, I doubt anybody would’ve been shocked to see an Indiana Jones game in 2024 arrive as a clone of the blockbuster Uncharted series. It certainly wouldn’t have been unprecedented. After all, both 1999’s Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine and 2003’s Indiana Jones and the Emperor’s Tomb both followed a fairly strict Tomb Raider template. Pivoting to pay tribute to the man who usurped Lara as the premier grave-robbing vagabond of modern video games would hardly have been surprising – particularly as games today have become increasingly homogenised overall.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Great Circle isn’t an Uncharted clone, and it’s all the better for it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But The Great Circle <em>isn’t</em> an Uncharted clone, and it’s all the better for it. It’s an Indiana Jones game I didn’t even know I wanted, and sometimes that’s the best surprise. I like highly cinematic, quality third-person shooters as much as the next man, but not <em>every </em>game needs to be one. And besides, you can do a lot worse than taking notes from Butcher Bay – another licensed tie-in with the extremely rare distinction of being even better than the film upon which it was based.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Genius of the Restoration</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The first-person perspective blesses The Great Circle with a fantastic sense of scale. Looking up in awe of the Great Pyramid – or staring out at a giant Nazi battleship perched atop a mountain in the Himalayas – simply has a more pronounced effect at eye-level. It also does wonders for immediacy, with puzzle solving in particular benefitting greatly. Picking up and poring over documents and clues, directly manipulating and placing objects, and watching the results unfold in front of your eyes makes it feel like you’re personally inside some of the world’s most expensive escape rooms. Puzzles come regularly, and they’re mostly light lifting, but I’ve encountered at least a couple of slightly curlier ones that left me smugly satisfied that I wasn’t stumped. If you do hit a roadblock, there’s a baked-in hint system that will only interject if you take an extra photo of the offending puzzle with your in-game camera. It’s a smart and courteous way of offering aid only when asked that will keep players off their phones and in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of this, it’s really the best showcase for the incredible amount of granular detail MachineGames has stuffed into seemingly every surface in The Great Circle. From streak marks on freshly wiped glass to the slow trickle of wax from a candle lighting your way down an ancient stairwell, these are things that wouldn’t be noticed from any other viewpoint. Are they entirely necessary to make The Great Circle a great game? Maybe not, but they <em>do </em>paint a picture of a project where no flourish is too small if they make the world look and feel even a <em>fraction </em>more authentic. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After beginning with a short flashback to Raiders of the Lost Ark as a tutorial – one that might’ve been a tad indulgent had it not been so utterly well done – The Great Circle’s second level is a wonderful (and equally nostalgic) trip through Connecticut’s Marshall College. It’s a magnificent rendition and draped in layers upon layers of bespoke details that distracted me constantly on my way to the objective. Busts and other paraphernalia related to the history of the school. Cabinets full of exotic items. Notice boards cluttered with handmade signs. If you’d shown this version of Indy’s famous school to the eight-year-old version of me who cut his teeth aimlessly point-and-clicking his way around Marshall College in 1989’s Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure, I might have had you burnt at the stake. Or at least lowered into a sacrificial lava pit without a heart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The eye-catching environments keep coming: The ornate Italian architecture and crusty catacombs of Vatican City; An ancient town and multiple Nazi dig sites in the shadow of the Egyptian pyramids and the Great Sphinx; Sukhothai’s winding waterways and flooded temples, which are being reclaimed by the jungle. It’s all excellent stuff, and bolstered by exemplary ray-traced lighting to boot. I love the huge contrasts between the levels, and “the great circle” as a fanciful archaeological concept is an admirably effective premise to justify Indy hopping all over the globe during a single story.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>David Shaughnessy's unerring version of Marcus Brody may go criminally unnoticed in Baker’s shadow.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The strength of that story here is one of The Great Circle’s true assets, and it’s been brought to life with some very impressive performances. For the most part, Troy Baker’s Harrison Ford impersonation is close to spot-on, and Baker’s otherwise distinct voice disappears in the role. Credit too must go to voice actor David Shaughnessy, whose unerring version of Denholm Elliot’s Marcus Brody may go criminally unnoticed in Baker’s shadow. This could have very much felt like a gimmick considering Elliot passed away back in 1992, but Brody’s small role feels meaningful and respectful, and not like a stunt. Marios Gavrilis also kills it as the slimy and sinister Nazi archaeologist Emmerich Voss; he spits his dialogue with such venom I imagine his microphone may have required a tiny umbrella. Most of the meaningful conversations occur in well-directed cutscenes, which are on par with those in modern Wolfenstein, albeit punctuated with an appropriate amount of slightly slapstick Indiana Jones humour when the fists start flying. There are basically <em>two movies</em> worth of cutscenes here, but it never felt like too much. This is Indy in his prime, and I’m on board for every extra minute of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a rule, the Indiana Jones series is always at its best when it involves a desperate race to track down an artifact before the Nazis can nab it for what they believe will be an unbeatable, world-conquering advantage. Those movies were video game fetch quests before video game fetch quests, and The Great Circle naturally embraces it, immediately beginning on the right foot by setting its action in 1937 – directly between the events of Raiders and The Last Crusade, as the world simmers towards the Second World War. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s honestly quite remarkable how convincingly The Great Circle fits into the hole between those two impeccable films, successfully exploiting the odd chronology of the original Indy trilogy. That goes far beyond just providing a little extra context on Indy’s separation from Marion Ravenwood, too. In fact, one of the greatest compliments I can pay The Great Circle is that it may well be the best Indiana Jones movie you’ve never seen. The music, too, is a victory on all fronts, and I love how in sync it feels with Raiders and The Last Crusade. I was especially thrilled to see The Great Circle crescendo to a showdown that follows tightly in the footsteps of both of those films – yet still managed to knock me out with a brilliantly unexpected twist.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Aid our own resuscitation</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of knockouts, combat in The Great Circle is satisfyingly brutal without being gratuitously violent, which is in keeping with its family-friendly, swashbuckling adventure serial roots. I love the deeply impressive sound design, which makes every strike sound like a golf club being slammed into a huge bunch of celery, and I love how visceral the fighting is in first-person. You block and parry blows with the correct timing, and deliver quick jabs and loaded up power punches. On top of that, Indy’s bullwhip can be used to quickly disarm enemies, and stun them long enough to either wade in and whack them or scoop up their dropped weapon and bludgeon them with it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I enjoy how Butcher Bay-adjacent the fighting is but I’m a little unconvinced by the stamina system that rules over it, which depletes as Indy exerts himself climbing, sprinting, and throwing hands. It just creates pauses throughout the action where you’ll be compelled to wait for a beat, or jog backwards as a gaggle of goose-stepping morons march towards you with their dukes up. I can’t really detect what it adds other than something to be arbitrarily upgraded to the point where it’s no longer an inconvenience.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat escalates with your actions so, if you do grab a gun and start blasting, expect all armed enemies in your vicinity to respond with hot lead of their own. Indy can’t survive this kind of barrage so, for the most part, the best thing to do is forget the firearms. This does, admittedly, create a bit of silliness if you stir up a large enemy response and park yourself anywhere your attackers need to climb to reach. You can, for instance, stand at the top of a ladder and clobber the crap out of everyone who climbs it for some time, and no one will figure out that they have guns and can simply shoot at you (on regular difficulty, at least). But you’d be colouring outside the lines here, playing like this. Indy doesn’t mind leaving bodies in his wake when necessary, but he’s not some moustache-twirling mass murderer. You can always fire up Wolfenstein if you need to get some of that out of your system.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Indy doesn’t mind leaving bodies in his wake, but he’s not some mass murderer.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of guns, though, Indy’s personal revolver is sadly a big disappointment. I used it all of twice, but both were still total anticlimaxes. The first was an early boss battle where Indy’s pistol really should’ve been written out of the fight before the showdown began. After placing several bullets into a man’s unarmored head, it became clear that shooting this bloke wasn’t the way MachineGames intended me to clear this encounter. The second was late in the story, where I thought, ‘There’s no point rolling credits with revolver rounds in the cylinder!’ and figured I’d quickly plug two Nazis that suddenly appeared ahead of me in an open elevator. They simply took too many shots to go down. It seems like a weird fumble, when the scene of Indy actually using his pistol and taking out the Raiders swordsman in a <em>single shot</em> is one of the most memorable moments in the whole film franchise. Revolver rounds should absolutely remain exceedingly rare, but the pistol itself really should have shipped with the consistent stopping power of its cinematic counterpart. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also rarely feels logical that high-ranking enemies within the levels can automatically see through disguises, particularly in Vatican City. It <em>is </em>a mechanic I’m accustomed to thanks to the likes of Hitman, which I’ll be clear is another game I love, but it’s definitely a little sillier here. It really is total nonsense that a random Italian officer would physically attack a stranger who is, for all intents and purposes, a visiting priest. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is only a mild annoyance though and, to be fair, The Great Circle actually has a very smart approach to difficulty overall. There’s a lot more fiddling you can do than just adjust a single setting from easy to very hard. Enemy attributes are split into several categories, meaning you can tweak it so that there are tougher enemies, but fewer of them. Maybe you want to pump up their awareness, but make them weaker than wet newspapers. (This is something I think I may try for a second run.) It’s good that these options are here because, on regular difficulty, the stealth <em>is </em>quite basic; enemies have pretty limited vision and they’re easier to sneak past than I first assumed. I definitely became progressively less cautious once I realised I could sneak across seemingly dangerously open places as long as I did it fast enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, The Great Circle does allow us to return to previously visited locations to complete all the extra side missions, even after the main adventure is complete, so I may focus on that instead of starting over. I suspect I have many more hours of auxiliary objectives to keep me busy; I only got around to ticking off a handful of them on my first run through the story, which took me about 17 hours. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s based in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> IP and revolves around playing with friends in-person.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Riot said Project K is made by a “small” development team within the company led by game director Dave Guskin and executive producer Chengran Chai. It’s not publishing the game itself; rather, it’s found a publishing partner in China for an initial launch there in early 2025. A global launch is planned, however, and Riot is on the hunt for a publishing partner for the U.S. and other countries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Riot said Project K is not a physical version of its existing digital collectible card game Legends of Luneterra, but "it does inherit some of the rich champion design philosophies of lore," and also benefits from art drawn from other League IP games. Riot added that it wants to create “a thriving community with a competitive ecosystem," and hopes for national and even global tournaments.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Project K Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Project K appears to be Rune Battlegrounds, which was teased earlier this year by Riot’s team in China. A trailer showed off popular League characters such as Darius, Ahri, and Miss Fortune. At the time, Riot said it had no plans for a global release, but those plans have now changed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a busy time for League, which has just wrapped up Netflix animated show <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/arcane-league-of-legends">Arcane</a> with the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arcane-season-2-act-iii-review-netflix-league-of-legends">Season 2</a>.

<p>There is a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) game is on the way. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown is a turn-based strategy game from developer Strange Scaffold, the team behind El Paso, Elsewhere, Clickolding, and I Am Your Beast.</p>



<p>The first turn-based TMNT game, Tactical Takedown follows what happens after both Splinter and Shredder pass away where a new leader has taken over the Foot Clan. The single-player game features 20 levels that are divided into campaigns that each focus on a single character. Each of the levels will also mutate as the turns pass.</p>



<p>Tactical Takedown features a graphic novel art style with figurines and diorama set pieces.  There will also be customizable movesets for each of the Turtles to shape the game how you’d like.</p>



<p>“This is the next step for Michelangelo, Donatello, Leonardo, and Raphael,” the game’s description reads. “…as the Turtles approach adulthood, they’re not just growing up… they’re growing apart.”</p>



<p>A release date will be announced at a later date, but it is available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229100/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Tactical_Takedown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a>, now. You can check out the trailer for the game below.</p>

                <p>In 2019, Fatal Fury's Mai Shiranui was one of the most-requested fighters for Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-me-and-you-and-ev/1900-6417051/" data-ref-id="1900-6417051">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>. She was excluded from the game because "Super Smash Bros.

And it isn't long before their training session is interrupted by some rude ninjas who are out to get Mai for some reason. Those shinobi picked the wrong woman to mess with, as she gracefully dispatches them with precision. </p><p>Mai was actually a guest character in the zombie survival mobile game Doomsday: Last Survivors earlier this year, but Street Fighter 6 will be her first confrontation with the Capcom characters since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/svc-chaos-snk-vs-capcom-review/1900-6110244/" data-ref-id="1900-6110244">SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos</a> in 2003.

Eternal Strands, the fantasy action-RPG from former Dragon Age creative director Mike Laidlaw's Yellow Brick Games studio, has a release date - it's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, PC, and Game Pass on 28th January next year.
</p>
<p>
Eternal Strands follows the adventures of Brynn - a member of a dwindling group of magic users known as the Weavers - who sets out across a fantasy kingdom ravaged by a cataclysmic magical event to uncover its mysteries and recover her people's cultural home.
</p>
<p>
In gameplay terms, all this takes the form of an action-RPG inspired by the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, with a bit of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> thrown in. The latter two games can be seen in the bosses roaming Eternal Strands' "open zone" world - 25-meter-high climbable creatures known as the Arks - and the way defeating them provides resources used to create new weapons and armour back at a base camp.

<p>
As for the Zelda influences, they come in the interplay between Brynn's magical abilities and the environment. Powers are built around flame, ice, and telekinetic force, all of which can be further enhanced in conjunction with the shifting temperatures caused by the world's unstable climate. "Heat spreads, cold chills, and real-time destruction allows for unprecedented reactivity in combat," explains the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491410/Eternal_Strands/">blurb over on Steam</a>. "Create [ice] bridges, burn barriers, or launch Brynn across the world. The next-generation physics system encourages and rewards player creativity in exploration as much as combat." Oh, and every surface is climbable too.
</p><p>
When Eternal Strands arrives on 28th January next year, it'll be available for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. It's also confirmed to be a day one Game Pass release for Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers. Additionally, as per an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1491410/view/4467103536898901921?l=english">FAQ on Steam</a>, free post-launch content is planned, and a demo's also on the way. Yellow Brick Games says more details on the latter will be shared at a "later date".

			<p>You know a character is iconic when millions of people name their pets after them, but there’s something so satisfying about Indiana Bones… I mean Jones, being named after a dog in the first place. It’s just so pleasingly cyclical. Video games also move in circles, and where Indy’s mystical archeological adventures provided the inspiration for Tomb Raider and Uncharted, we’re now completing the loop in a way with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Indiana Jones and the Giant Circle Review –&nbsp;Puzzles and pugilism" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dp32fr7JWOU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Well, kind of, because MachineGames has clearly sought to stand apart from those series in a number of ways, some of which really help make Indiana Jones and the Great Circle feel more like an Indiana Jones’ cinematic adventures than a video game romp.</p>


<p>Set after Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indy gets that adventuring itch after a break in at Marshall College brings him into very close contact with a Latin-speaking giant – a now posthumous appearance from the late great Tony Todd. Figuring out that it’s one of his own recently unearthed finds that has gone missing, he decides to ditch all his marking and classes yet again and hare off around the world following the one clue that he has found, replete with the iconic red line slowly inching its way across a world map to the Vatican.</p>


<p>MachineGames has absolutely captured the look and feel of Indiana Jones, both with the general graphical style, but most particularly in the game’s cutscenes. Troy Baker as Indy puts in a shift mimicking Harrison Ford’s gruff mumbling and mannerisms, and there’s only maybe a dozen instances where I can hear Baker’s natural accent coming through instead. His companion through most of the story is Gina, the Italian journalist, whose backstory is gradually unpeeled, while there’s friends old and new in surprising places that will lend a hand in the race against Nazi archeologist Emmerich Voss.</p>
<p>Add to this the classic 1930s serial style (by way of the 80s), the exact right kind of comedic fight choreography, and the story’s race against time to stop some unknowably powerful artefacts from falling into fascist hands, and this feels every bit an Indiana Jones tale.</p>
<p>They’ve also done a great job of translating the tone and style of Indiana Jones as a character to the gameplay. One of the most intriguing decisions was to use a first-person view for the vast majority of the game. Whether you’re punching fascists, whipping and yanking down on high up pulleys, taking photos of artefacts, or setting light to ancient brush that’s blocking your way, you do so while looking out from Indy’s eyes.</p>

<p>Let’s come back to the Nazi punching, which Indy has always been famous for. This really is the main way that you’ll fight in this game, with actual gunplay generally discouraged by just how quickly you can end up dying. Fisticuffs are fast and ludicrously loud as you can batter most enemies into unconsciousness on standard difficulty, and even quicker if you grab highlighted impromptu weaponry from your surroundings. Higher difficulties will reward you mastering the block, counter and dodge, as well as using the whip to disarm or pull enemies in for a beatdown.</p>
<p>Stealth is an option here, though it’s often more of a prelude to a flurry of fists or sneaky takedown. It feels a little cumbersome, as enemies are both very sensitive to sound if you drop something or bump into objects and very quick to give up. It can be easy to get overwhelmed if you don’t pick your battles and isolate enemies, and at those times it might be tempting to pick up a gun or whip out Indy’s revolver. Ammo is so limited, though, and you can’t take that gun with you – you can, however, use it as a melee weapon when it runs out of ammo.</p>
<p>In fact, you’re constantly dropping things on the floor, whether it’s so you can pull out the camera or lighter, so you can interact with a switch or object, or just any time you clamber over a ledge, it feels like whatever you were holding will be left behind. It’s a shade annoying sometimes.</p>
<p>There are cuts away from first-person to a third-person camera in instances where it makes sense – essentially any time that you’re hanging from or sidling along a ledge, swinging across a gap, or squeezing through a gap in a wall. It’s a pretty sharp cut between views that manages not to be too jarring after the first couple instances, but these moments are generally so short that I do still wonder if the whole game couldn’t have played from the first-person. Certainly, Indy is a slow, grunty kind of manly man climber compared to Nathan Drake, and we’ve seen a number of games where short first-person climbing sections have worked fairly well. The gameplay heritage here, however, is The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher’s Bay.</p>

<p>But that first-person view compared to third-person helps to foster a slower pace throughout the experience, hand in hand with the open locations at the Vatican, the Gizeh dig site and beyond. You’re in areas that are infested with guards, so even if you’re in disguise as a priest, it feels right to walk at a brisk pace and not sprint everywhere, even if you absolutely can without raising suspicion. Admittedly, by the time I got to Gizeh, I was running around like a madman, especially once I had found a guard’s uniform, only to be forced to a slower pace when boating through Sukhothai.</p>
<p>These handful of open locales evoke some of the slower moments from the films, where secrets and clues are hidden away in plain sight. With both the main story thread, significant side missions and more incidental puzzles and mysteries to unravel.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the puzzling throughout Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and the standard setting struck a good balance for me with not prompting too much with clues from Indy or companions talking. Of course there’s these implausibly old mechanisms hidden throughout the world that still, somehow, manage to just about work, if sometimes needing a little persuasion. These are also ancient tombs and temples where shafts of light just so happen to be in the right place when Indy finds hs way in, and there’s so many traps and things that he inadvertently triggers, with a few nice nods back to the films.</p>
<p>Each locale brings with it a new gadget to acquire and use, such as the camera that you use to gather information for the quest, which can be used to gain Adventure Points from snapping interesting views as you explore more generally, and that is all then fed into the character upgrade system, where you find and then spend those points on instructive books. Oh, and you can photograph the cats of the Vatican as well. Sadly there’s no petting the animals.</p>

<p>That camera and all the other clues you find end up wonderfully rendered in Jones’ notebook, filling out with all the details of the journey so far as you go. You don’t need to peel through it too often, outside of checking the mission log and map of an open area (which also briefly reveals a waypoint, if you don’t have those permanently enabled), but it’s nice to flip through the pages and details every once in a while.</p>
<p>On the whole, the game comes together beautifully well, each discovery, each plot beat pushing you on, wanting to see the next. but there are a few rough edges and moments that draw it back down. While it does fit the tone, stealth is undeniably awkward, climbing is slow and ponderous, and the fast beatdowns of ordinary guards become tiresome slugfests for the handful of what are effectively boss fights. The third location of Sukhothai also saps the pace by forcing you into a boat with a maze of waterways to navigate – this is a long game, especially if you do a lot of side tasks. There’s also just a few times where NPC animation and scripting is a bit clunky, which reminds you this is a game, even if not really affecting the experience.</p>
<p>Playing on PC, I felt that performance was generally great on my system – Ryzen 5900X and Radeon RX 6800. Outside of one graphical glitch that’s set to be fixed in a patch – &nbsp;temporary black boxes mainly in cutscenes caused by dynamic resolution scaling – the default High settings and dynamic resolution let me target 1440p with a resolute 60fps. The game still looks pretty great even when tuning things down to ‘Low’.</p>

			<p>Fans of Indiana Jones haven't exactly been swimming in great new entries for many years now. The adventure franchise was created by George Lucas in the eighties with three highly successful movies. Then, all those who loved the scruffy but charming professor of archaeology portrayed by Harrison Ford had to wait for nearly twenty years to get Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It wasn't until last year that another sequel, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, was released. It featured Harrison Ford's final appearance, and the reception wasn't nearly as great as the previous installments.</p>
<p>Gamers have recently suffered from a similar dearth of new productions. Nine original Indiana Jones videogames were released between 1985 and 2009, but there's a fifteen-year gap between Staff of Kings and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Thankfully, Bethesda's Elder Scrolls and Fallout manager Todd Howard is a big fan of the character created by George Lucas. He has sought opportunities to make a game based on Indiana for a long time, pitching a project directly to Lucas himself back in 2009.</p>
<p>Back then, his idea did not take off due to a lack of resources on Bethesda's behalf. He kept trying, though, and eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-great-circle-idea-for-the-indiana-jones-game-was-first-conceived-by-bethesdas-todd-howard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his idea based around the so-called Great Circle</a> (which can be drawn on the world map by uniting the planet's most significant archaeological sites) took off. Howard selected Bethesda-owned developer MachineGames to make the game because of their familiarity with the World War II-adjacent setting and the main enemy, the Nazis. His perseverance is likely the primary reason we have this game now. Having just finished it, I am absolutely glad that it happened, as this might just be the best Indiana Jones game ever made.</p>
<p>Let's get this out of the way: yes, as you may have read, the game is almost exclusively played from a first-person view. This might seem counter-intuitive for two good reasons. First, when you have such a recognizable character as the protagonist, you would want to show him at all times. Second, the two main franchises in this sub-genre, Tomb Raider and Uncharted, have been massively successful with sticking to the third-person.</p>
<p>However, there are other considerations to make. MachineGames have always developed games played in first-person view, not just the Wolfenstein series, but even The Chronicles of Riddick and The Darkness when they were still at Starbreeze. This choice allowed them to do what they know best, though they have added a few concessions. In specific instances, while traversing the maps, the perspective automatically switches to third-person because that's simply the most comfortable way to handle those situations. Moreover, unlike in Cyberpunk 2077 where even the cutscenes are played in first-person, you'll be able to see a relatively young Indiana in all his glory in this game's many cinematics. Beyond these principles, though, what matters is how it plays, and this plays extremely well. The first-person view undoubtedly maximizes the immersion factor and also lets you play more naturally with the environment, both during combat and exploration.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFindianajonesandthegreatcircle5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>From a gameplay standpoint, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle marks a large departure from the studio's pedigree. MachineGames always made shooter titles, and this is anything but. Yes, you do technically have a gun and you can even borrow rifles from defeated enemies, but the game highly incentivizes non-lethal ways to overcome foes. This is one of the main ways it differentiates itself from Tomb Raider and Uncharted. While the games by Crystal Dynamics and Naughty Dog do sometimes offer stealth options, they are usually confined to specific segments; for most of those titles, players must necessarily engage in extensive shootouts where Lara Croft and Nathan Drake mow down countless enemies, creating the so-called ludonarrative dissonance between the murderous gameplay and the narrative that tells us they are heroes.</p>
<p>This would be entirely out of character for someone like Indiana Jones. Sure, he's been known to fire a gun, but he is not a killer. As such, it is perfectly fitting that the best way to progress through the maps and solve the mysteries is through a mixture of stealth, ingenuity, and disguises. That's right, they've taken a cue from HITMAN, and our favorite professor of archaeology can acquire various disguises to blend in and enter environments where he would otherwise be attacked on sight. As HITMAN fans know, you'll still have to keep your distance from certain NPCs (Captains, in this case) who can spot Indiana through disguise.</p>
<p>Disguises aren't always easy to procure, though, so stealth remains the most common way to access areas controlled by Nazis. Here, MachineGames did not see fit to reinvent the wheel, adopting a fairly standard stealth system. When they spot you, a wheel starts to fill, making them more suspicious at a speed that is based on their distance. When the wheel is full, they go on full alert, calling for help from nearby allies.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle isn't winning any awards for its stealth AI. Throughout my playthrough, I've seen several times where the NPCs failed to be alerted when I knocked out one of their fellows not 15 meters away. However, I'm willing to cut the game some slack. Stealth AI is extremely hard to get right; it would be very easy to make it realistic to a degree where it becomes very punishing for players. The purpose of a game like this is to provide a fun experience, though not to be an accurate simulation, and to this degree, the game succeeds.</p>
<p>That's largely due to the great level design that enables many different approaches to the various situations. In this regard, the game reminded me of Dishonored, which placed a similar emphasis on stealth through its amazing level design. Like in those games, exploration is greatly rewarded. There's a ton of notes that not only fill out the lore but also provide maps and clues to solving the various mysteries and side stories that populate Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p>
<p>This is especially notable in the three open maps: the Vatican, Gizeh, and Sukhothai. Here, players can explore largely at their leisure, uncovering artifacts and tombs and discovering adventure books and chests that help with progression. Indeed, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has some RPG-lite elements. By completing main and side objectives as well as snapping pictures of key locations and subjects, the game awards Adventure Points, which can be used to unlock <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-qa-game-features-dozens-of-upgrades-is-absolutely-inspired-by-riddick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dozens of upgrades</a> in the survival, fitness, packing, brawling, combat, and exploration categories.</p>
<p>You will need to obtain the related Adventure Book to unlock an upgrade, though, which is where exploring every nook and cranny becomes highly recommended. There are even secret underground boxing rings where Indiana faces off against up to three foes to earn money and buy more Adventure Books.</p>
<p>By the way, brawling is the main way to resolve combat, and it's well done. You can parry and dodge, as well as use the left trigger to hit with the left hand and the right trigger to hit with the right hand, which is a nuance that most games do not include. Hits are meaty, especially when you grab a shovel or baton to hit the Nazis with. Indiana is not a fighter, though, and at Hard difficulty, you won't want to get surrounded by too many foes - yet another reason to be stealthy.</p>
<p>The difficulty can be set separately for action and exploration, which is a win-win in my book. Every user deserves to tailor the experience to their liking. There are only two exploration options: Light and Moderate. The former lowers the difficulty of puzzles, but rest assured that at least some of the optional puzzles remain not at all obvious. The game even includes a few instances where you'll have to crack a safe code by cross-referencing various tables. Of course, as with Tomb Raider and Uncharted, there are also many enjoyable environmental puzzles, most of which are resolved with the help of Indiana's trusty whip.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFindianajonesandthegreatcircle4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Being a game based on a movie character, the story is clearly very important for this game. Thankfully, this is one of the most exciting Indiana Jones stories yet. It is set in 1937, between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, while the winds of war start gathering across the world. The characters are extremely well portrayed, especially Gina Lombardi (played by a fantastic Alessandra Mastronardi), and more importantly, Troy Baker does an excellent job (despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/todd-howard-initially-didnt-want-troy-baker-playing-indiana-jones-in-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Todd Howard's initial reservations</a>) at mimicking Harrison Ford's voice without being too on the nose. The antagonist Emmerich Voss is a Nazi through and through, which makes him inherently stereotypical as far as villains go, although he does have more interests than just pleasing the Fatherland - he wants to best Indiana and prove he's the finest archaeologist of the two.</p>
<p>Be prepared for the plot to take a bit of a supernatural turn, but then again, it's not unusual within this franchise and genre. Overall, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has a lot of great content; I finished it in 23 hours, and I had to rush for the review, leaving some optional mysteries aside. The side stories tie in well with the main narrative, and you can return to the aforementioned three maps even after the game's ending, which will make completionists very happy.</p>
<p>From a visual standpoint, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is largely great, with the excellent lighting and facial animations being standouts. Powered by the id Tech engine, it is the first game with built-in ray tracing. Unfortunately, path tracing and DLSS Ray Reconstruction will not be available until day one (December 9), so I could not test it. However, the performance at the current max settings allows a Ryzen 7 7800X3D and RTX 4090 to use NVIDIA DLAA while keeping a comfortable and smooth 70-80 frames per second. Stutters were few, usually only appearing briefly during the automatic saves. By the way, you can enable real-time performance analytics in the game settings, at least on PC. Moreover, the game already offers full support for the DualSense controller on PC, coming with all prompts. Of course, there's no haptic feedback or adaptive triggers, as those are likely still being tuned for the PS5 release next Spring.</p>
<p>There are also a few bugs that I have to report on the technical side. Firstly, there's a visual noise bug that showed itself consistently throughout the game. I'm told it is an issue caused by the combined usage of DLSS and HDR and that it will be fixed with a patch shortly. Secondly, for the whole playthrough, I had to contend with a bug where the game would dramatically slow down the frame rate after taking a picture with Indiana's camera, loading a save, or starting a cutscene. I quickly found out a workaround - alt-tabbing and returning to the game completely fixed it, at least until one of the above happened again. I have reported the issue and sincerely hope it will be resolved soon, as it was quite annoying.</p>

His adventures had everything; an earth-shaking mystery to solve, global travels, witty banter, and a likable leading man. While his recent movie exploits have left a lot to be desired for fans of the franchise we're so happy to say that <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> doesn't just meet the expectations of a classic <em>Indiana Jones</em> story, but absolutely blows them out of the water.</p>

<p>After a brief introduction reliving the opening scenes of <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>, boulder chase and all, our story opens with a break-in at Marshall College, a giant man speaking in Latin knocking out Indiana, and a missing Cat Mummy.</p>

<p>This introduction is tight, to the point, and immediately hooked me as a player. Marshall College works equal part as a tutorial, promoting exploration of the world within a small sandbox and introductory puzzle solving, while also generating a number of questions about the plot to start the player's mind racing.</p>

<p>Who was that mysterious 8-foot man? Why was a cat mummy stolen? Why did he have an amulet related to the Catholic Church?</p>

<p>The adventure that these initial questions take Indy on leads him to multiple locations worldwide, including large 'hub' areas such as The Vatican and Gizah, as well as some smaller story-focused locations like the Himalayas and Shanghai.</p>

Progressing through the story, only one of those questions might be answered, but it will always lead to wholly new questions or perhaps reveal a little bit more about other questions.</p>

<p>This created an environment where the next major breakthrough always felt just around the corner, maintaining a strong pace throughout the entire narrative. Even in the later hours of the game, when I feel most games begin to lose some steam, Indiana Jones continued to deliver a blockbuster experience.</p>

<p>Another key element of the story is that each piece of the puzzle reveals a whole other layer to the story. Your idea of where the narrative might be leading, or the scope of the adventure you're on, is constantly being expanded, creating an exciting experience.</p>

<p>An early example of this developing storyline, not wanting to spoil anything too far into the game, is that the amulet that the giant man is wearing indicates he's a member of a secret order that worked with the Catholic Church. That discovery is what helps guide Indy to begin investigating around the Vatican, but throws into the mix further questions about his objectives and why the Catholic Church needed to steal a Cat Mummy.</p>

<p>Every opened door leads to four other closed ones that just made me want to keep going.</p>

<h2><span id="cke_bm_67122S">&nbsp;</span>An Adventure Worthy Of Indiana Jones</h2>

<p>It's so hard to talk about what makes a great mystery so great without spoiling anything, but for fans of the classic <em>Indiana Jones</em> adventures like <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark </em>and <em>The Temple of Doom</em>, you're in for an absolute treat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-under-cover.jpg?itok=RC2hK0zO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-under-cover.jpg?itok=rDXsE9hi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Venture undercover to get to the bottom of the situation.</figcaption></figure><p>The story maintains a lot of <em>Indiana Jones</em> charm with entertaining, bordering slapstick moments, serious archeological breakthroughs, and action-packed set pieces. At times watching cutscenes and the story expand, it truly did feel like I was watching a missing <em>Indiana Jones</em> movie of the '80s.</p>

<p>Indiana Jones uses a variety of tools at his disposal to make his way through the world including disguises, his whip for swinging over gaps and climbing obstacles, a lighter to be able to see through caves, and other elements of the world like ziplines.</p>

<p>First-person gameplay did a great job accentuating the world. Stepping into massive mausoleums or creeping through Nazi bases and seeing the world through a first-person view really did feel like it was enhancing the experience in comparison to the third-person puzzle adventure games that are available.</p>

<h2>A Secret Around Every Corner</h2>

<p>Outside of the main storyline, there's so much else for players to experience and engage with. You'll be able to take photos of interesting people and places, hear remarks from Indy about their content, discover hidden locations filled with ancient relics, and solve smaller mysteries rewarding you with upgrades for Indiana or additional information about the world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-mystery.jpg?itok=ETbxxm7m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-mystery.jpg?itok=qNzvVXyD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A secret might be right in front of your face, you just need to interact with something...</figcaption></figure><p>This feeling of a secret being hidden around every corner is also a testament to the incredible world design of <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>. Even in the largest open-world areas, it feels like no matter where you stop and look around there is something interesting to grab your attention.</p>

<p>These collectibles also don't just stop at the mere collection aspect. There are many that interact and provide context not only to the main quest but also trigger mysteries to investigate. Picking up a note early in the game, there was mention of a secret passage near a fireplace, and by collecting additional clues such as a hand-drawn map, I was able to locate and trigger this chamber to open. It offers something for people who are skimming the surface but also provides more for players who are reading those notes and hunting for more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taking the simple idea of collectibles scattered around a map and turning them into context clues further fuels the experience of stepping into the shoes of Indiana Jones.</p>

<p>A subtle aspect of the different caves and tombs that I appreciated was that these places really did feel like they were being discovered for the first time. If you wanted to be able to see in the deeper tombs then it was on you to light the different braziers dotted through the hallways. There also weren't any rooms with perfectly spaced boxes that you just knew you'd be cover firing from after you obtain whatever idol or relic you're after.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-breakable-wall.jpg?itok=KVix_ViH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-breakable-wall.jpg?itok=Co3yTj9u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Keep an eye out for breakable walls, you'll never know when you might walk by one.</figcaption></figure><h2>Puzzles Are Rewarding</h2>

<p>Puzzle solving is the bread and butter of <em>Indiana Jones,</em> and there are plenty of fun ones to experience. I will say throughout the main story and what side content I did explore, there weren't too many puzzles that stumped me for long, but the act of solving them was fun in itself.</p>

<p>Some of the puzzles included gathering information about different artworks to set a code in a wall, cracking Nazi codes, and placing gears of different sizes to cause a mechanism to rotate correctly.</p>

<p>These kinds of puzzles really reminded me of some of the point-and-click adventure games I used to play and the things they would throw at me. As I write this review I'm rearing to get back into the game to explore how much deeper the puzzles get as you stray from the beaten path.</p>

<h2>The Tools At Your Disposal</h2>

<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> is first and foremost a first-person exploration game, but does also have a fair bit of combat. Routinely you'll find yourself behind enemy lines in Fascist and Nazi bases and while you can power your way through, it's going to be very dangerous.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-stealth.jpg?itok=gY9zxLT- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-stealth.jpg?itok=lTGGYKye 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many non-traditional weapons can be found across your adventure including brooms, brushes, and guitars</figcaption></figure><p>The preferred form of infiltration for Indy is through stealth. Attacking enemies from behind results in satisfying takedown animations, and the ability to carry and dump bodies can help you get as far into a base without being spotted as possible. There isn't too much more depth than 'sneak up behind enemies and wallop them with whatever hammer, broom, or guitar you can find,' but there was never any need for more.</p>

<p>If stealth fails and you don't happen to have a gun in your hand,&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> manages to have one of the best first-person melee combat systems I've ever used. By the end of the game, I can probably count on one hand the number of times I actually resorted to using guns because punching was just so much fun.</p>

<p>Different attack buttons will let out a left or right punch with the option to wind up to break through enemy defenses. Your punches are tied to a stamina bar so you can't just wildly swing and instead need to plan your punches.</p>

<p>This combat system gets even better as you progress through the game as you obtain additional abilities like one that recharges your stamina for a perfect dodge. This really pushed me to learn Indy's combat capabilities and work to read enemy patterns and was absolutely required knowledge for some of the later 'boss' encounters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-upgrades.jpg?itok=-NZO92nw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-upgrades.jpg?itok=vUZSDH5h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Adventure Books let you expand Indy's repertoir of abilities.</figcaption></figure><p>I had honestly expected there to be far more combat, especially gunplay, in the game knowing it was from the team who created <em>The Old Blood </em>and <em>The New Colossus </em>but for a game about an archeologist like Indy this felt like the perfect amount of combat with semi-realistic enemy and player health, and really solid stealth mechanics and takedowns.</p>

<h2><span id="cke_bm_88161S">&nbsp;</span>A Love And Understanding Of The Source Material</h2>

<p>One of the things that impressed me the most about <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> is just how much it understands and loves the source material. From the tone and grandeur of the adventure to the banter between Indy and his adversaries you can tell those involved in creating it understood why Indiana Jones became as popular as it did.</p>

<p>A lot of this is also only possible on the amazing work capturing the tone of Indiana Jones's (and Harrison Ford's) voice by Troy Baker, and the work put into making sure all of the smirks, glances, and general Harrison Ford-isms are just as you would expect from Harrison Ford himself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-jones.jpg?itok=lXMxYmCt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-jones.jpg?itok=0IKl_3-z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Incredible levels of detail.</figcaption></figure><p>While it's a wholly new story it doesn't mean that there isn't also plenty for fans of <em>Indiana Jones</em> to keep an eye out for. The opening scene being a remake of the beginning of <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> is just the surface of some subtle, and some not-so-subtle, nods to the original film franchise.</p>

<p>This love also extends to the game's soundtrack. Much of the score is reminiscent of early John Williams with powerful horns blaring through combat and chase, and whimsical transitional music playing as you stumble upon your next secret.</p>

<p>Each element of this game from the look to the way it feels to play has had the utmost attention paid to it. Not only does <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> accurately portray the IP that it is based upon, but it celebrates and uplifts every aspect of it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-golden-idol.jpg?itok=ip0taVby 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-golden-idol.jpg?itok=rNf7rcRU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Re-experience the opening to <em>Raiders of the Lost Arc</em></figcaption></figure><h2><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>By using that understanding of who Indiana Jones is as a person, and what makes Indiana Jones the IP so beloved, each major gameplay element is not only able to stand on its own as an extremely enjoyable part of the experience but also is grounded through the lens of Indy. The way that you approach exploration through photos and study, engage in combat with a mix of serious and strange weaponry, and are able to become a more proficient version of Indy through exploration creates a complete experience that truly does blow your expectations of this game out of the water.</p>

<p>The story was always engaging, revealing layers upon layers of depth. While the puzzles weren't too difficult they were still rewarding to complete, the stealth and combat segments are engaging and surprisingly deep, and the world is filled with secrets to discover and explore.</p>

<p>One of my greatest regrets as I devoured it over the past week is that I wanted to spend so much more time exploring the world but I needed to reach the credits so that I could get my review submitted in time.</p>

<p>This game isn't just a success for fans of <em>Indiana Jones</em>, but a great success for fans of adventure games. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for an epic adventure to play through this December and I genuinely can't wait for Indy's next outing if this is what we can expect.</p>

I am trying to investigate the Great Pyramid of Giza but it’s currently swarmed by Nazis looking for the same artifacts I am. Some of the lower ranking soldiers don’t pay me any mind as I’m dressed like one of the local workers. However, the higher ups see right through my disguise which causes problems: I’m forced to either run away before they sound the alarm, or fight them and risk bringing a horde of Nazis down on my head.&nbsp;</p><p>But! Through intrepid exploration and stealth I’ve managed to find a newer, better outfit, one that disguises me as a Wehrmacht soldier. Surely those pesky commandants will recognize me as one of their own and I’ll be able to stride through Giza, plundering pharaohs’ tombs unmolested. But within five minutes of donning out my new outfit, I got shot by one of those pesky commandants.</p><p>My time with <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> was filled with similar disappointments. Taken together, those moments coalesced into one prevailing sentiment — this game would be better as a movie.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> takes place within the Indiana Jones canon between <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> and <em>The Last Crusade</em>. In it, Dr. Jones (who I always forget has the given name of Henry <em>not</em> Indiana) is investigating the theft of one of the artifacts he “liberated” from an Egyptian tomb. His search leads him on a merry, globe-trotting chase thwarting the ambitions of Nazis and the designs of an ancient cult of “giants.”</p><div><p><em>The Great Circle </em>is filled with all kinds of references and flourishes that scream, “This is an Indiana Jones movie.”</p></div><p><em>The Great Circle </em>is filled with all kinds of references and flourishes that scream, “This is an Indiana Jones movie!” There’s the fun, John Williams-esque orchestral sting that plays when Indy discovers a secret. The dialogue is chock full of witty repartee and one-liners that sound exactly like something Harrison Ford would say to his co-stars. Even <a href="https://youtu.be/vujiFT4cQm8?si=OBO4kYyX0Zy9XU3d&amp;t=544">the punching sound effect</a> is <a href="https://youtu.be/47nkHeMGsuo?si=hm1_uMgES1TYcJwM">ripped straight from the movies</a>. Those elements are fun, comforting even, since <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23728708/indiana-jones-dial-of-destiny-review-harrison-ford"><em>Crystal Skull</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23779495/indiana-jones-dial-of-destiny-review"><em>Dial of Destiny</em></a> failed to capture audiences the way the original trilogy did. But the developers at Machinegames, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/2/16594166/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-nazi-white-supremacist-political-commentaryhttps://www.theverge.com/2017/11/2/16594166/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-nazi-white-supremacist-political-commentary">the studio best-known for <em>Wolfenstein</em></a>, took their mandate too seriously, making what is essentially a spiritual successor to <em>Raiders</em> and <em>Temple of Doom</em>, instead of a video game that is fun to play.</p><p>The game is played in the first-person perspective. Don’t expect to flip and dip a la Lara Croft or Nathan Drake, though, as platforming is a bunch of ladder climbing and wall-shimmying broken up by occasional bouts of whip swinging. I do appreciate that the developers took the <a href="https://kotaku.com/yellow-paint-debate-ff7-rebirth-demo-resident-evil-4-1851249608">yellow</a> <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/ignore-the-yellow-paint-detractors-visual-cues-are-great-for-games/">paint</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-has-a-special-mode-to-address-that-perennial-yellow-paint-debate">discourse</a> seriously, choosing white as the color to denote a climbable surface. It’s still there as a visual marker in case you get stuck, but because the faded white paint blends in a bit more naturally, you don’t feel condescended to when you notice it.</p><div><p>Don’t expect to flip and dip a la Lara Croft or Nathan Drake.</p></div><p>Like the platforming, puzzles leave a lot to be desired. The puzzles I’ve encountered after roughly 25 hours with the game are wildly inconsistent. Some come pre-solved, requiring you to just press buttons to input the solution, or are the kinds of puzzles you’ve seen in just about every adventure game (use beams of light to unlock doors, for example). Conversely, others are so esoterically constructed that they are simply unsolvable.&nbsp;</p><p>I got so excited when I ran into a locked safe right next to a cryptogram consisting of a poem with certain letters circled, and a key with letters and numbers arranged on a grid. I figured the way it worked was to treat the circled letters as coordinates that would point to the right number on the grid. I tried every permutation of letters and numbers to get to the right combination. Nothing worked. I even Googled the type of puzzle it was, found a website that solved them, and input the letters and the key and still couldn’t get the right answer. With no in-game hints or a way to look up a solution, I was forced to abandon the only puzzle that I felt <em>good</em> about trying to solve.</p><p>With banal platforming and puzzle solving a bit too simplistic, the last gameplay element left is combat and, well, that wasn’t all that enjoyable either. <em>The Great Circle</em> put a lot of emphasis on giving me options. When I encountered an enemy, I could choose to engage them directly, covertly, or not at all. I often chose not at all, sneaking around locations and hiding behind objects until my enemies walked by none the wiser. When forced to confront an enemy, guns were useless if not outright hostile to me as the user.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption>The most action you get in combat is in cutscenes like this.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Bethesda</cite></p></div><p>I get that for stealthy games like <em>The Great Circle</em>, guns are meant to be used sparingly as a weapon of last resort. I did that. I spent every encounter killing enemies with the various blunt objects littered throughout the game. I only started using firearms in one of the game’s later levels where gunplay was all but mandatory because there weren’t very many melee weapons for me to find on my own. I would shoot a Nazi point blank in the face no fewer than three times before they went down, or, as was usually the case, before they shot me once, killing me almost instantly. It felt like I had played the game the way it asked me to, but I was still punished for it.</p><p>That said, <em>The Great Circle</em> isn’t totally joyless. The levels incorporate multiple ways to reach an objective and it is legitimately fun to wheedle around to find the solution off the beaten path. I first found that Wehrmacht uniform behind a locked door requiring a key, and I walked away dismayed because I didn’t have the patience to go rooting around for the Nazi who had it. But I just happened to look up and see this locked room was connected to a tower with an open door; all I had to do was shimmy up there, beat up the lone guard, and the uniform was mine. That was fun. When I noticed the two enemies I had beaten up were standing in a pool of water investigating a broken electrical device, I reloaded the checkpoint just to see if I could electrocute them instead. I could. Well done.</p><div><p>But those little thrills were so few and far between because it felt like Machinegames went topsy turvy with its game design.</p></div><p>But those little thrills were so few and far between because it felt like Machinegames went topsy turvy with its game design. Its most interesting moments, like a knockdown, drag out fight with the main villain that happens midgame, were rendered as cutscenes. Meanwhile the less interesting bits are actions you have to perform. This certainly matches beat-for-beat the kind of stuff Indy gets up to in the movies. But those already exist, and I can watch them any time. <em>The Great Circle</em> is missing something more important: a reason this adventure needed to be a game.</p><div><p><small>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle <em>launches December 9th on Xbox and PC, </em></small><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date"><small><em>with a PS5 version due out in 2025</em></small></a><small><em>.</em></small></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Riot Games announced today that it’s developing a physical trading card game set in the <em>League</em> universe. The game is currently known as “Project K,” and Riot says it’s working with an unnamed partner in China to release the game there in early 2025. As for a global release, Riot says, “We are taking our time to find the right publishing partners.”</p><p>There aren’t a lot of details available about Project K. According to Riot, the game “has unique gameplay and is best when played with friends and in person,” and development is being led by director Dave Guskin and producer Chengran Chai. You can get a sense of the game in the images below:</p><p>Of course, this is far from the first spinoff from <em>League</em>. So far, that has included mobile games like <em>Teamfight Tactics</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Wild Rift</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24291592/arcane-season-2-review-netflix">the Netflix series <em>Arcane</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/22/24079608/project-l-2kxo-fighting-game-league-of-legends">the competitive fighting game <em>2XKO</em></a>, which is expected to launch next year.

In January, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047568/riot-games-league-of-legends-forge-runeterra-layoffs">Riot announced that it was cutting more than 500 jobs</a>, which included shutting down Riot Forge Games, a publishing label for indie games set inside of <em>League</em>. Also impacted was <em>Legends of Runeterra</em>, a mobile card game that launched in 2020, which Riot said “hasn’t performed as well as we need it to.”</p><div><p>The Project K news comes as card games are having another moment, led largely by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248306/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hands-on">the new smartphone version of the <em>Pokémon Trading Card</em> <em>Game</em></a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 official PC system requirements have been shared online today, detailing what players will require to run the second entry in the system at various resolutions, frame rates and quality settings.</p>
<p>To run the game at 1080p resolution, 30 frames per second, players will need an Intel i5-8400 or AMD Ryzen 5 2600 CPU, GTX 1060 (6 GB), or RX 580, and 16 GB RAM. As the target resolution and framerate increase, so do the requirements, and to run Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 at either 1440p at 60 FPS or 2160p at 30 FPS, players will need an Intel i7-13700K or AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU, RTX 4080 or RX 7900 XT GPU and 32 GB RAM. Judging from the system requirements, it definitely looks like the game will be rather CPU-intensive, which is not surprising, considering what its predecessor did.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/KCD-2-Specs-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>However, this is not a betrayal of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-runs-buttery-smooth-on-rtx-3050-wont-have-denuvo-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promise</a> that the game runs well even on low-end hardware. We contacted Warhorse and confirmed that these are the requirements targeting native resolution. Needless to say, everything will run faster when using NVIDIA/AMD/Intel upscalers, which are practically essential these days.</p>
<p>Warhorse Studios also shared today the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 console specs, which highlight how both the base PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X will feature a Performance mode running at unlocked 60 FPS with VRR and upscaled 1440p resolution. On PlayStation 5 Pro, the game will run at upscaled 2160p resolution with PSSR and unlocked 60 FPS.</p>

Descenders Next, the extreme-sports-focused sort-of-sequel to 2018's acclaimed downhill biking hit Descenders, has kicked off its online Test Sessions via Steam, giving players the chance to check out a "huge" build ahead of its eventual release.
</p>
<p>
Developer RageSquid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acclaimed-biking-game-descenders-is-getting-an-extreme-sports-sort-of-sequel">unveiled Descenders Next back in August</a>, explaining its goal was to introduce the "same feel, the same sense speed" as its predecessor, but across as many extreme sports as possible over the coming years.
</p>
<p>
To begin with, though, Descenders Next is focusing on two distinct boarding sports: snowboarding and mountainboarding. There's talk of speed challenges, trick-focused challenges, scavenger hunts, kit upgrades, and more as players careen down procedural off-piste mountains and through "multiple huge biomes".

<p>
Descenders Next is due to release some time in 2025, but players can get stuck in right now courtesy of its previously teased Test Sessions. Details remain pretty vague - there's no word on how Test Sessions will be structured or how long they'll last - but a press release accompanying their launch does note players will have access to a "huge build with many hours of play, showcasing both the snowboarding and the mountainboarding, with full online multiplayer".
</p><p>
Test Sessions (a controller is recommended) are limited to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2375530/Descenders_Next/">Steam</a> at present, and players will first need to <a href="http://descendersnext.com/">follow the instructions over on RageSquid's website</a> to receive then activate their key. The studio says it'll "monitoring the Test Sessions very closely" and wants players to share their thoughts, feedback, and bug reports as they go.

But Stalker 2 released to near-unanimous praise from players in Ukraine, the country in which the game is set and the homeland of its developers. In fact, Ukrainian players were so eager to get their hands on GSC Game World's latest entry in the Stalker series that the game's launch quite literally broke the internet.</p><p dir="ltr">Ukrainian players flocked to the game as soon as it launched, resulting in nationwide internet outages in the hours after its release, GSC creative director and executive producer Mariia Grygorovych said in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delaying-stalker-2-again-not-an-option-studio-says-team-worked-until-it-was-broken-by-marathon-development" rel="nofollow ">a recent interview</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a bad thing because the Internet is important, but at the same time it's like, 'Whoa!'"

Russia's invasion of Ukraine added an enormous amount of strain on the studio and its developers, some of whom ultimately made the difficult choice to leave their home country to continue working on the game in safety. Currently, GSC Game World's staff is split between two locations: an office in Prague, and one in Kiev.</p><p dir="ltr">The complicated (and often heartbreaking) story of Stalker 2's development is detailed in a documentary created by its developers. Entitled <a href="https://youtu.be/28CITqxwNz0?si=RE4PKuM3PZwi8kjd" rel="nofollow ">War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a>, the film documents the immense hurdles GSC devs faced as they fought to finish the sequel to the iconic Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl. But Stalker 2 was a labor of love, and Grygorovych says the sacrifices were worth it.</p><p dir="ltr">"For us and our team, what's most important is [that] for some people in Ukraine, they feel a little bit happier [now] than they were before [Stalker 2's] release," Grygorovych said of the game's significance in Ukraine. "We did something for our home country, something good for them."</p>

		<p>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault has been revealed by Digital Sun, as a sequel to the 2018 game Moonlighter. In Moonlighter 2, players will once again step into Will’s shoes to explore, collect treasure, and run a shop to make some money. Will will be joined by companions to rebuild the village of Tresna, along with his shop, to make it a thriving place again. Will is also working towards getting back home too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZW8MwekNHk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“The original Moonlighter was a pivotal moment for us, marking the growth of Digital Sun as a team. Five years on, Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault showcases everything we’ve learned along the way. We’re channeling all our craftsmanship into creating a game that’s not just better, but brimming with even more charm in every detail”</em>, said Javier Gimenez, Digital Sun CEO.</p>
<p>Will will venture into vaults which become more dangerous the deeper he delves. He will have various gear and weapons available to him, that can be used to ward off enemies and secure treasures. The treasures he sells will fund the growth of Tresna as he supports other businesses. As they grow, Will will get access to more items.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/28/moonlighter-review/">Moonlighter Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Moonlighter review, Jason said, <em>“Moonlighter is an incredibly enjoyable jaunt through some interesting ideas and some fun fights. While the combat gets a little easy as you progress, the fun of watching money pour in as you play is immensely satisfying. It would be nice if there was more reason to play after completion as is normally the case with roguelites, but equally having an actual conclusion is a breath of fresh air for the genre. It is a lot of fun and one that will keep you entertained for a fair while if you want to sink your time into it.”</em></p>

<p>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault will be available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
