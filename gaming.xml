		<p>The unthinkable is happening in Helldivers 2 right now, as the Illuminate invasion has reached Super Earth itself, giving players the daunting task of defending Managed Democracy on its homeworld.</p>
<p><iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Heart of Democracy | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwDx7-HTk0s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“The worst nightmare of all those who fight for Managed Democracy has been made a grim reality,” reads the announcement.</p>
<p>“Despite the valiant efforts of our Helldivers to push back the fleet, the Illuminate have reached Super Earth. Now they are swarming our cities, terrorizing citizens, and destroying our infrastructure. It’s time to rise up and take arms and fight for the precious foundations and soil of Democracy manifest. Helldivers, return to our planet and defend what is rightfully ours.”</p>
<p>While human settlements were featured in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> since the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/helldivers-2-omens-of-tyranny-is-out-now-a-new-faction-and-trucks/">Omens of Tyranny update</a> introduced the first Illuminate enemies at the end of last year, the urban sprawl of Super Earth will take that to the next level. Battles on Super Earth will feature huge skyscrapers, busy streets and even playgrounds that you’ll have to fight the Illuminate scourge from.</p>

<p>The one goal is to repel the Illuminate invasion by fighting to gain ground, battling alongside less elite SEAF troops who will fight autonomously, but can also be ordered to follow Helldivers around – salute them and they’ll join your fight – and activating Planetary Defense Cannons to blast away at the Illuminate fleet.</p>
<p>Players should be more powerful than ever thanks to the primary weapon customisation that was added last week alongside the expanded surplus options. These were already being put to use against new Illuminate enemies including the Crescent Overseer and the freaky Fleshmob.</p>
<p>It’s not clear how long the game’s community will have to try and stave off the Illuminate attack, but should they fail, this will be the end of the first campaign in the game, which started with the launch back in early 2024. Don’t worry, the galactic map will reset if that happens.</p>
<p>The update does also have some fixes and tweaks, so here’s the patch notes for Helldivers 2 version 1.003.002:</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>Crash fixes</li>
<li>Fix for some corpses flinging the Helldivers great distances</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-new-chicago-city/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Cyberpunk 2077 sequel codenamed Project Orion is going to feature a second city to explore besides Night City, according to information provided by the creator of the Cyberpunk universe.</p>
<p>As reported by Polish publication <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/newsy/cyberpunk-2077-tworca-potwierdza-nowe-miasto-w-kontynuacji-to-chicago-ktore-poszlo-w-zla-strone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CD-Action</a>, Mike Pondsmith recently talked with TVGRY during the Digital Dragon 2025 event, revealing that, while he is not as involved in the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel as he was with the original game, he gets to see scripts, check out new cyberwar, and talk with the various departments at work on the game, including the environment design people. From these people, he probably learned that the second entry in the series will feature a second city besides Night City, which he described as having the feel of "Chicago gone wrong", rather than the Blade Runner-inspired atmosphere of Night City. While unable to share more, Mike Pondsmith added that he sees this city working for the game, so it will definitely be interesting to see how it will fit in the story and the universe.</p>
<p>Though we probably won't see the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel Project Orion anytime soon, the franchise by CD Projekt Red entered the spotlight once again last month, when a Nintendo Switch 2 port of the game was announced alongside the Nintendo system. Despite the technical differences with the other consoles, the port seems to be holding up quite well and could offer a much better on-the-go experience than the Steam Deck, judging from some <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-early-comparisons/">recent comparisons.</a> With CD Project Red putting so much <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-run-effort-play-well/">effort</a> into the port, including the entirety of the game on the retail edition's cartridge, it wouldn't be surprising to see the game become one of the most popular Nintendo Switch 2 launch releases.</p>
<p>The Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, Project Orion, is currently in development for yet-to-be-announced systems. A release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/expeditions-developer-campfire-cabal-still-working-on-next-game-in-series.1194111/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/campfire-cabal-expeditions-still-alive<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>franchise steward Campfire Cabal has confirmed that it isn't dead, and that a new game in the series is in the works, despite the past couple of years of "radio silence".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://campfirecabal.com/still-alive/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> rather appropriately titled "Still Alive" on the official Campfire Cabal website, the studio says that it "never stopped" working on the newest entry in the series, but that it did go through some hardships as a result of the turmoil currently facing the gaming industry.</p>

<p>Campfire Cabal says that although it was never shut down, it did have to "say goodbye to many of [its] colleagues", leaving a "compact team" behind to work on the new&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>game, which began production back in 2022.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/expeditions-rome-campfire-cabal.jpg?itok=QEv5XgYq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/expeditions-rome-campfire-cabal.jpg?itok=OrkX9C0d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Expeditions: Rome&nbsp;</em>is still the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>series, at time of writing.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio goes on to say that it "received the green light to scale back up and transition into full production" on the latest&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>game in March this year.</p>

<p>According to Campfire Cabal, the next&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>game will be set in a "new period of our history" and "a new part of the world for the series", and it will represent "another step up in quality" from&nbsp;<em>Expeditions: Rome</em>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Campfire Cabal, the studio was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/campfire-cabal-is-new-development-studio-from-expeditions-rome-developers" rel="nofollow">founded all the way back in 2022</a> to steward the&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>series of historical RPGs, following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/expeditions-rome-developer-logic-artists-closing-down-to-make-nft-games" rel="nofollow">disbandment of original developer Logic Artists</a> to pursue NFT game development alongside new parent Dynasty Studios.</p>

<p>As it stands, there are three games in the&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>series: 2013's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/expeditions-conquistador" rel="nofollow"><em>Expeditions: Conquistador</em></a>, which kicked off the franchise, and its two followups&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/expeditions-viking" rel="nofollow">Expeditions: Viking</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/expeditions-rome" rel="nofollow"><i>Expeditions: Rome</i></a>.</p>




<p>If you're wondering where 2024's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/expeditions-mudrunner-game-announced" rel="nofollow">Expeditions: A MudRunner Game</a>&nbsp;</em>fits into things, well, it doesn't. It's a completely unrelated title, so don't worry about fitting that one into your schedule if you're looking to complete the series.</p>

<p>In any case, it looks like the&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>series will continue its explorations, although we don't know where or when. Stay tuned for more.</p>

While nothing is set in stone, this is a fairly quick turnaround for a new Stellar Blade game, considering that it first launched for PS5 in 2024 and has been supported with several pieces of post-launch content since then.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497706-shift-up.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497706" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497706-shift-up.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497706"></a><figcaption>Shift Up is aiming to have Stellar Blade 2 out by the end of 2026.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497706-shift-up.jpg"></figure><p>The upcoming PC release is also scheduled for June 12, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-on-pc-has-been-blocked-in-over-130-countries-catching-its-developer-by-surprise/1100-6531596/">but the game has been blocked from sale on Steam in over 100 countries</a> for an unknown reason.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-accidentally-leaks-stellar-blade-complete-edition-and-pc-release-date/1100-6531492/">Details on Stellar Blade: Complete Edition were also leaked earlier this month</a>, and we do know that this will be coming to PS5 and PC on June 11.

                <p>Developer Rebellion's newest game, the survival FPS Atomfall, was a big success right away, it appears. <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/rebellion-we-dont-gamble-wildly-weve" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a> reports that the day-one Game Pass launch was "immediately profitable" and that Rebellion is now working on DLC for the game and considering a possible sequel or spin-off.</p><p>No sales numbers for Atomfall have been announced, but the game reached 1.5 million players right out of the gate, later climbing to 2 million. This amounted to Rebellion's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/day-one-game-pass-release-atomfall-is-devs-most-successful-game-in-32-years/1100-6530519/" data-ref-id="1100-6530519">"most successful launch" for any of its games going back 30+ years.</a> The developer has not said how many copies the game has sold, however.</p><p>In addition to being available for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers on Xbox and PC, the game can be purchased outright for $60. It's also available on PS5.</p><p>Rebellion has said that launching Atomfall into Game Pass on day one might have led to lost sales, but the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-dev-discusses-game-pass-launch-and-risk-of-cannibalizing-sales/1100-6530925/" data-ref-id="1100-6530925">received a payment from Microsoft that helped mitigate this.</a></p><p>The post-apocalyptic survival game was inspired by the real-world <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Windscale-fire" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windscale nuclear incident</a> in the 1950s. The game has been referred to by some as "British Fallout."</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/atomfall-review-bunker-thrill/1900-6418348/" data-ref-id="1900-6418348">Atomfall review</a> scored the game a 7/10. Reviewer Mark Delaney wrote, "Atomfall is a good game that sometimes gets in its own way, but it's the process of finding your unique path through its story that will stick with you after the dust settles."</p><p>Atomfall was not Rebellion's only release so far in 2025, as the company also debuted Sniper Elite: Resistance this year, and it was also available at launch on Game Pass.</p>

In roughly one year, it has brought in more than $48 million of revenue for the developer, so it won’t be a surprise that the team is working on a follow-up game. However, according to a <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/irdata.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=254&amp;page=1&amp;code=irdata_eng">Q1 2025 fiscal year presentation</a> from ShiftUp, the developer plans to have a sequel before 2027.</p><p>In the presentation, which is where ShiftUp reveals Stellar Blade has brought in 68.1 billion KRW (or $48 million), there’s a slide titled, “IP expansion on its way with high visibility.” We can see the 2024 release of Stellar Blade on PlayStation 5, additional strategy for ShiftUp’s mobile gacha game, Goddess of Victory: Nikke, and “Platform Expansion” for Stellar Blade. This likely alludes to <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/15/stellar-blade-hits-pc-next-month-pc-specs-and-features-revealed">the upcoming PC release</a>. However, beyond that, the slide also shows “Sequel” for Stellar Blade before the year 2027, which is represented as the cutoff for the slide’s timeline.</p>

<p>Though there aren’t any accompanying details, given the reception to Stellar Blade, it makes sense ShiftUp is planning a sequel for the action game.</p><p>Elsewhere on the slide, there’s mention of something called "Project Witches," which gets its own color and is separate from Nikke and Stellar Blade, as it’s likely a new IP.</p><p>While waiting for a Stellar Blade sequel, potentially next year, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/stellar-blade/more-than-a-pretty-face"><em>Game Informer’s</em> Stellar Blade review</a>.

            <p>Developer Housemarque, known for the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/returnal">Returnal</a> and Nex Machina, has no plans to go down the free-to-play or live-service route any time soon.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer at the developer's 30th anniversary event in Finland last week, studio head Ilari Kuittinen and creative director Gregory Louden said "as long as people are buying premium games", Hoursemarque will remain a studio which provides just that.</p>
<p>"Our philosophy is that [our games] are an experience for a certain time of your life, and you experience that within a few days, or weeks, or whatever," Kuittinen said. The studio head added Housemarque's titles are a bit "like movies or TV series", which are there for a certain "phase" of a person's life. "And I believe that's really cool. You don't need to spend the rest of your free time with our games," he said.</p>

<p>"It's a unique experience," Kuittinen continued. "You have it, you get something out of it. Maybe you come back to it, but you don't need to play it for the rest of your life."</p>
<p>Louden added the studio is currently "fully focused on single player and premium" with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returnal-studio-heads-to-a-hostile-shape-shifting-planet-for-newly-unveiled-saros">upcoming PS5 title Saros</a>, and Housemarque - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-returnal-developer-housemarque">which was acquired by Sony in 2021</a> - aims to make sure it is around for another 30 years by continuing to make "amazing games" and keeping up that "momentum".</p>
<p>"You just need to keep creating special games," the creative director said, before Housemarque's brand director Mikael Haveri added: "We are only as strong as our latest game."</p>
<p>Haveri acknowledged that Housemarque hadn't necessarily had the easiest of journeys to where it is now, and the team is "aware of pitfalls out there", so it needs to keep making "good games" to thrive.</p>
<p>"It's almost like a responsibility, we're very lucky to be in the position we are in, and we should keep pushing the medium and keep showing what we can do and keep pushing our gameplay and our story and our technology, and just keep growing," Louden furthered. "That's the future for the next 30 years - it's just creating better."</p>

<p>Back in February 2022, Sony stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">aimed to launch over 10 new live-service games</a> over the coming years.

<p>Since then the company has dialled back its plans and just this month, the Sony published live-service shooter Fairgames was reportedly delayed, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fairgames-reportedly-delayed-into-next-year-as-haven-founder-jade-raymond-exits">Haven Studios founder Jade Raymond made her exit from the company</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has given us a proper look at a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> game card.</p>
<p>This look at the upcoming cards comes from a video showing off an official Switch 2 carrying case, which was shared on the Nintendo Today app. </p>
<p>As a reminder, this is the app Nintendo announced back in March, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">delivers daily content to its users about Nintendo's events and games</a>. It is where Nintendo first let us all know the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-revealed-by-nintendo-and-its-not-as-far-away-as-you-might-have-feared">release date for its Legend of Zelda film adaptation</a>.</p>

<p>But, I digress. Back to those Switch 2 game cards. Thanks to Nintendo's new video (which you can check out via the embed below), we can see that the Switch 2 cards are, unsurprisingly, very similar in size to the OG Switch's cards.</p>
<p>As we have seen previously, the newer game cards come with a red colour scheme, making the Switch 2 game (in this case, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>) stand out rather boldly against the carry case's black lining. Also, in case you missed it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-games-will-still-taste-so-bad-you-will-want-to-spit-them-out">Nintendo previously confirmed Switch 2 game cards will taste horrible</a>, so don't be tempted to pop one in your mouth.</p>
<p>As for that case, it will be able to house the Switch 2 console itself with two Joy-Con attached, as well as six game cards. There is also a little netted pouch users can slide their Joy-Con 2 straps into for safe keeping. I quite like the colourful zipper pull rings. </p>

How much is a game worth? What qualities or aspects of a game justify a higher price tag, or demand a lower one? Does a game that costs $70 deserve the same critical reaction as the identical game but $30? All this has gone on since time immemorial. But something that seems to rumble underneath so much of the discussion is rich people telling poor people that prices don’t matter. When asked about a potential $80 cost for <em>Borderlands 4</em>, multi-millionaire Randy Pitchford—CEO of developer Gearbox—told a potential customer, “If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen.”</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196163" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Firefight’s Back In Halo!

In 1991 when he had just left high school and was working a minimum-wage job at an ice cream parlor on Pismo Beach, he was able to find a way to pay $80 for <em>Starflight</em> on the Sega Genesis. So, you know, so can everyone else. Pitchford sent the message as a reply on X last week, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/gearbox-boss-randy-pitchford-says-its-not-my-call-if-borderlands-4-costs-usd80-but-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-buy-it-anyway/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/gearbox-boss-randy-pitchford-says-its-not-my-call-if-borderlands-4-costs-usd80-but-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-buy-it-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted by <em>GamesRadar</em> today</a></span>.</p><p>Randy Pitchford grew up in Fairfax, Virginia, then California. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190112044349/https://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/05/randy-pitchford-and-the-perfect-shuffle/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190112044349/https://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/05/randy-pitchford-and-the-perfect-shuffle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">His father worked in U.S. intelligence</a></span> in the 1970s, and his house was filled with all manner of technology throughout his childhood. While I cannot say for sure (although I have emailed to find out), it seems vanishingly unlikely that Pitchford was living off of his minimum wage ice cream job after he’d graduated high school, as his tweet seems to want to heavily imply. Pitchford soon after went to UCLA, so we can quite safely guess that this was a short-term job, one for earning a bit of extra spending money while still living at home with his parents.</p><p>I would suggest that to use this anecdote to explain to all living humans that if they really want a copy of <em>Borderlands 4</em>, they can easily find eighty bucks to spare is grotesque. It kind of makes me sick.</p><h2 id="h1172601"><a id=""></a>Luxury viewpoints</h2><p>“Video games are a luxury.” That’s a point many people want to make in situations like this. “If you can afford the console to play the game on...” people might begin, as they argue that you can’t really be <em>that</em> poor if you can still afford entertainment. All those people living on welfare, but with those giant TVs, etc. It’s a fascinating perspective, almost exclusively proffered by those who <em>aren’t</em> living on welfare, and have rarely truly wanted for anything. Because if there’s one thing that’s pretty damned desirable when you’re living in real poverty, it’s some option for positive entertainment. For so many others, furiously working and saving and scraping together the money to be able to buy their children a games console, to give them that one thing they so desperately want when they’ve had to go without so much else, is not an act of opulence but of enormous sacrifice.</p><p>So no, this isn’t about abstract situations made up by armchair philosophers trying to justify Pitchford’s claim by arguing that any truly poor person have to choose between food or games entirely. This is about reality, where a person might go without so much extra food, or only buy the very cheapest food, so that they can pull together the $60 that year to buy the new entry in their favorite gaming franchise. That little bit of light. And then they find out it’s maybe now going to cost $80 instead.</p><h2 id="h1172602"><a id=""></a>For 37 million Americans, there <em>isn’t</em> an extra $20</h2><p>In 2023 (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-283.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-283.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most recent data</a></span>), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/09/magazine/poverty-by-america-matthew-desmond.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/09/magazine/poverty-by-america-matthew-desmond.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">23 percent</a></span> of Americans worked in low-wage jobs.

Even taking into account that these are averages, it’s pretty obvious that when you’re one of the one-in-nine people living on $1,300 a month, you don’t have a lot of spare piles of $80. In 2012 (soon after the crash), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/08/01/157664524/how-the-poor-the-middle-class-and-the-rich-spend-their-money&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/08/01/157664524/how-the-poor-the-middle-class-and-the-rich-spend-their-money" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it was reported that the poorest people in America spent 98 percent of their income</a></span>, with one dollar per day to save. That study showed this group spends 4.8 percent of their income on “entertainment,” a broad category that even includes pets. An $80 copy of <em>Borderlands 4 </em>is 6.2 percent of $1,300.</p><p>Jump forward to the pre-covid boom in 2019, and on an annual family household income of $25,525, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">total spending is measured to be $25,525</a></span>. Of that, for an average family in this bracket, a total of $1,270 is spent on “entertainment.” That’s roughly $105 a month. But, again, it’s essential to understand that “entertainment” includes all sporting activities, all children’s extra-curricular education, toys, bikes, every electronic item from a TV to a camera, and even musical instruments and pets. If you own a dog, you’ll know that $105 a month could be taken up by it alone.</p><p>For so many of us, finding another $20 to buy a favorite game means grumbling and pulling out our wallet.

It sucks. I’m fed up of it. I’m sick of rich people telling poor people that they can find the money if they just try hard enough. I’ve had my fill of people who’ve never known hunger, never struggled to pay a bill, flippantly dismissing the concept that life is extremely tough for millions and millions of people. It’s the rhetoric that allows for the myth of the “welfare queen” to be so readily accepted, to assume that the poorest people just aren’t pulling their weight or working hard enough, that if these people were <em>really</em> poor, they wouldn’t be playing video games at all. It’s <em>hateful</em>.</p><p>As for whether <em>Borderlands 4</em> will cost $80, Pitchford claims it’s “not my call,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-preorders-randy-pitchford-pax-east-1851780045&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-preorders-randy-pitchford-pax-east-1851780045">having previously said it’s still undecided</a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/meet-the-man-who-designed-pokemons-iconic-logo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When you get a spontaneous call from the president of Nintendo of America, you don’t ask too many questions. You just take the call.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the advice that was given to designer Chris Maple by a fellow designer friend back in 1998, who warned him the call would be coming later that day. At the time, Maple was no stranger to sudden phone calls from company executives. Maple ran his own design business, Media Design, which specialized in last-minute work for companies in emergency, time-crunch situations whose agencies weren’t equipped to handle the speed or size of their request. Though it was rarely, if ever, publicly credited for this type of work, over Media Design’s history, Maple says his company quietly developed a good reputation with clients throughout its local Seattle area. He recalls doing work for (among many others) Boeing, the Seattle Mariners, Holland America Line cruises, and others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maple had been in the business for several years when then-Nintendo of America president Minoru Arakawa’s secretary phoned him and asked him to come visit the office in Redmond. He was told over the phone that the company wanted him to work on a new game, but that was it. Maple, intrigued, accepted the invitation, not knowing he was about to become an instrumental part of one of the biggest cultural phenomenons in the world: Pokémon.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Go West, Pocket Monsters</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I showed up there and I sat in their lobby for about a half hour and stared at this beautiful 21-inch crystal horse in their lobby, a crystal horse head,” Maple recalls of the day he went to Nintendo of America’s Redmond HQ. “And I was like, just staring. You get a sensation. Like I'd have to read a room when I go into these corporate arenas, since I'm the subjective person presenting the aspect of imagery and content behind whatever's bothering them that day or what's broken or what needs to be fixed. You just learn to pick up stuff. So I was sitting there staring at this crystal head, and it was the Nintendo lobby.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, Maple was taken upstairs into a meeting room where a few individuals were sitting, waiting for something. “It looked like the inquisitor was going to come out,” Maple recalls. But when Arakawa entered, Maple says he “was a very magnetic personality. I could tell why he was in the seat.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll let Maple relate what he remembers happening next:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He introduced himself and said that they're going to be launching a game officially in the United States and Europe. Only problem is, the prior agencies they've tried out for the situation didn't quite hit the mark, and they burnt the budget and time element. Are you okay with that? And I go, ‘Yeah, sure. It's going to cost a penny.’</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/pokemon-15-1747669946566.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A photo of Maple and his son in Maple's home office. Photo provided by Chris Maple.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“So this other person, she comes down and she has a little cardboard box, and she dumps all these toys and pieces of paper and weird drawings and things all in front of me on the table, and I'm looking at them, and she's standing there with a smirk on her face holding the box, and I'm looking at Mr. Arakawa, and he's just staring straight at me and I go, ‘What is this?’ And he goes, ‘It's a Pocket Monster.’ And I said, ‘Oh, what's a Pocket Monster?’ He goes, ‘It's Pokémon. We're going to call it Pokémon.’”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>And I said, ‘Oh, what's a Pocket Monster?’ He goes, ‘It's Pokémon. We're going to call it Pokémon.’”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Maple was being asked to make a new logo for Pokémon, which at the time existed only in Japan as Pocket Monsters Red and Pocket Monsters Green. Nintendo wanted to release the game in the West with a Blue version and, later, a Yellow Pikachu Edition. But the company wanted a new logo to fit the rebrand from “Pocket Monsters” to “Pokémon”, and was struggling to find someone to nail the look. Maple wasn’t given any instruction on what Nintendo was looking for though, he says. Just one parameter: he had just one month to make it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Attaching Energy</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Normally, Maple tells me, a logo like this would take something like six months, with lots of back and forth between the designer and client, drafts and redrafts. Nintendo’s one month deadline wasn’t arbitrary, though. The new logo had to be ready for the big unveiling of Pokémon Red and Blue that would take place at E3 1998.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Maple was used to cramming things like this into short spans of time. So he got to work. He drew numerous variations of a Pokémon logo by hand, on a light table, trying different letter shapes until he was happy with something. When he liked a logo, he’d set it aside, and try again to make something different, ultimately creating several variations to present to Nintendo so they could pick which they liked best. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Original Pokemon Logo Sketches by Chris Maple</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there wasn’t much to go on. Maple wasn’t given copies of the games to play, or even a lot of information on what Pokémon was. “We were given nothing but paper and toys,” he says, recalling that one of the toys was a very tiny Pikachu figurine. Nintendo did explain the game a little bit, he says, and he saw some illustrations of both existing and in-progress monsters as well as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/y3rfi/the_pok%C3%A9mon_are_coming_scan_from_may_1998/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an early version of a Nintendo Power magazine</u></a> that discussed the game (the final version of which would be the logo’s actual public debut). Maple was also instructed that the logo would need to be suitable for use on a tiny, pixelated GameBoy screen, and would have to work in both color and black and white.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After coming up with several variations, Maple took his suggestions back to Nintendo to present them. He tells me he opened by presenting a few versions he wasn’t as excited about, and says his audience was relatively unresponsive. But then, he showed his favorite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The room was quiet, Maple says. He stayed quiet too. Then, again from Maple’s own recollection:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then Don James [former Nintendo of America executive VP of operations] speaks up and says, ‘I believe this is the one.’ And he starts shaking his head. He goes, ‘Yep, that's the one. It's the one.’ And everyone, Arakawa's just sitting there. He goes, ‘Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay.’ And Lance [Barr, former Nintendo of America designer] gets up and leaves and Gail [Tilden, former Nintendo of America VP brand management] leaves and then Don looks at me and goes, ‘Produce it.’ I went, ‘Okay.’ So I went back and produced it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so the Pokémon logo was born. I asked Maple why he liked the final version best, and why he thinks Nintendo accepted it. He tells me he can’t fully explain it. It’s vibes, he says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Energy in it. Also, when I was trying to take some of the real rough sketches from the original artists that did it for the person who started the game, I was trying to envision the story. There's a story in everything, the story, brand story, what it possibly could turn into.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/pokemon-12-1747670798361.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Color tests for the Pokémon logo, provided by Chris Maple.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Maple has a similar explanation for why the logo ended up yellow and blue. He tried a bunch of different color schemes. Maple admits it’s possible he was subconsciously thinking about the color-themed naming of the two new games being released in the West: Blue and Yellow. While Pokémon originally released in Japan in Red and Green versions, only Red was brought to global release alongside a slightly different, Blue version. Yellow, focused on Pikachu, came the following year. Maple was told about both Blue and Yellow in his work on the logo. But whether that was part of it or not, he says that the final version just seemed right to him. “It just feels a certain way,” he says. “I know it sounds flaky, but it's true.” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It just feels a certain way. I know it sounds flaky, but it's true.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the logo was finalized, Maple was largely removed from the rest of the process as Nintendo got to work marketing and eventually releasing the games. He says he didn’t think too much of it until one day, a few months later, he took his son to Toys R Us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We walk in the front door and there's a massive display, big arches and everything, and TVs going and noise and the Pokémon logo, and I'm like, ‘Holy smokes. This is crazy.’”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon Forever</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This wasn’t Maple’s final interaction with Nintendo, though, or even with the Pokémon logo. After E3, Maple recalls Arakawa asked him to alter the logo slightly. He doesn’t remember receiving any specific instructions on what exactly Arakawa wanted altered, though he says that clients telling him to “just change it a little” without extra instruction is fairly common in his field. So Maple went back to the drawing board, literally, and made some minor adjustments to the interior of the “P” and the “E”, resulting in the version of the logo we now know today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later, Maple was called back to do some other design work, and remembers assisting with design projects for games like Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr., Mischief Makers, and a Star Wars game he doesn’t recall the name of (possibly the Nintendo 64 release of Star Wars: Rogue Squadron). He also was called upon to redesign the Nintendo 64 box for the console’s Atomic Purple release.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/na-pokemon-1998-1747670431704.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The first final version of the Pokémon logo Maple submitted, prior to the adjustments he made to the P and E.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/international-pokmon-logo-svg-1747670511222.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Pokémon logo with Maple's adjustments, as we know it today.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He did eventually play the Pokémon games, just a little bit, but didn’t get too far. Maple was a busy man. He does remember his son collecting the trading cards when they came out…until they were banned at school.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'd be at a store or something and I'm buying something for my daughter and she'd be jumping up and down. She'd go, ‘My daddy did that logo,’ and a couple of moms would look at me in line and go, ‘Oh, so it was <em>you</em>, was it? You're the guy.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maple’s work with Nintendo eventually ran its course, as the company began hiring more and more in-house artists and designers. That was fine with him, though. He had plenty of other work lined up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For years, Maple never spoke of his work on the Pokémon logo publicly. It wasn’t listed on his website, nor was he credited anywhere as the designer. He says that at the time, he wasn’t allowed to talk about it, and it’s fairly normal in his industry not to credit individual logo designers. But now, Maple’s started talking about it. He’s <a href="https://chrismaple.com/pokemon" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">put the logo up on his website</a>, alongside some newly-designed T-shirt mock-ups and other images, to showcase the massive project he took on all those years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why now?, I asked. Maple says a lot of it stemmed from conversations with his son, who urged him to come forward about his role and take credit where it was due. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's just after years, it didn't matter…So 27 years later, I thought I'm going to be changing what I do more and more, and I thought, why don't I just, if I'm going to put this as one of my accreditations, I should have some kind of validation to it and move on. For all the people that are interested in the games, you, IGN, wouldn't you want to know what really happened?”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Chris Maple Modern Mock-up Logo Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I ask Maple if there’s anything he would do differently if he had the opportunity to do the logo now. He says he’d probably revert it back to the original logo that was accepted in 1998, before Arakawa had him adjust it slightly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The other thing I would probably do, I would feel kind of almost responsible about and maybe a little bit strong about, is when Pokémon turns 30 next year, they'll probably try to do some celebration around that and whatever, and I know how things go, but they're going to dig an artist out of the woodwork and he's going to put 30th across that logo somewhere and it's not going to be right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know it won't be right because all the base, all the foundational thought that went into creating it in the first place to survive the way it did and for us to be talking to one another today, there is an energy and a skeleton in there, and to even add another component, like the word 30th or two numerical characters, TLC [tender loving care], big time. Don’t just get it done. It's going to be TLC. So I would hope that Pokémon International would ring me and say, ‘Hey, this would be great PR. The guy that did the logo gets to put the 30th on for us. Good PR for us.’ That would be smart of them to do. Of course I'm pitching for myself here.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In some way I feel responsible about all the children and the other people that have grown up that take ownership of this.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Maple’s work with Pokémon only spanned a few months, and only one image, that effort has since been replicated across everything Pokémon. Aside from perhaps Pikachu, the Pokémon logo is the most well-known and iconic symbol of the global phenomenon that’s only grown in popularity in the years since Maple unwittingly stumbled into the process of its creation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So then, does he feel he had a hand in Pokémon's ultimate success? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I would say that in some way I feel responsible about all the children and the other people that have grown up that take ownership of this,” he says. “I feel really... I feel good about, that I did the thing responsibly for them. I teach children in challenged areas…And when I teach the children, they just go nuts. Once the teacher leaks the fact that I did this, I can't get a word in edgewise because they're saying, ‘Draw the characters for us, please.’ So I put it at the end of the lesson and I'll do a couple characters and I'll put the giant logo across the big white board in the classroom, and that became pretty popular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Some of the experiences you get are just priceless. But I'm just happy that it's doing well…Yeah, I love it, and that's why I work still today.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Recent datamines of Space Marine 2 itself may hold clues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Potential spoilers for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 follow:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with perhaps the biggest question Space Marine 2 fans have right now: what is the new class? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1jsr0k7/major_spoilers_for_upcoming_content_all_of_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Datamines suggest it is the Techmarine</a>. Why? Because in the files was mention of a perk called ‘shoulder gun bolter,’ which is a clear indication that Techmarines are finally in play.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For the uninitiated, a Techmarine is a Space Marine engineer-type class who’s a big fan of the Cult Mechanicus as well as their Chapter. They’re big on technology and specialize in fixing and maintaining vehicles and other big stuff, such as Dreadnaughts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see how a Techmarine might slot into a Space Marine 2 squad, which currently lacks a class of this type. And this ties into another datamined detail: the apparent ability to “summon” a Dreadnaught in Horde mode. Dreadnaughts are a part of the Space Marine 2 campaign (one viral moment involves a Dreadnaught being particularly heroic and badass), and you also fight alongside one in a PvE Operations mission. Could you earn the right to summon a Dreadnaught and, as a Techmarine, keep it alive, in Horde mode?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now onto the promised new melee weapon. Datamines suggest Space Marine 2 will finally get a Power Axe, which again, makes sense in the context of Games Workshop’s big Space Wolves push for the tabletop game. And let’s remember, in December, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-modders-put-the-axe-from-secret-levels-warhammer-40000-episode-into-the-game">IGN reported on <u>Space Marine 2</u> modders who put the axe from Secret Level’s Warhammer 40,000 episode into the game</a>.</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>THIS is why I’m a fan of Warhammer 40k!

As discussed in a recent video by Warhammer 40,000 YouTuber <a href="https://youtu.be/Emh-Qq-UNnE?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chapter Master Valrak</a>, dataminers recently unearthed evidence of a Grav-cannon in Space Marine 2. This is, typically, a big gun used by Space Marines that manipulate gravity to cause a target to crush itself to death. Could the Techmarine class, should it be a genuine upcoming arrival, exclusively wield the Grav-cannon? If so, I imagine there will be many players who gravitate towards it with the release of Patch 8.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that Patch 8 remains under wraps for now, but we’re expecting Space Marine 2-related announcements during the upcoming Warhammer Skulls livestream this Thursday, May 22. Perhaps we’ll find out more there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot happening in the world of Space Marine 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive"><u>despite the surprise announcement that development of Space Marine 3 development had begun</u></a>.

Now, a Koei Tecmo studio head has pulled back the curtains on what players can expect from the narrative of this game, revealing Age of Imprisonment will show how the people of Hyrule defeated Ganondorf before the events of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/such-great-heights">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p><p>In a new Creator’s Voice behind-the-scenes video for Age of Imprisonment called “Beyond the Legend,” Koei Tecmo producer Ryota Matsushita and Koei Tecmo triple-A games studio head Yosuke Hayashi discuss the upcoming game, what’s to unfold in the story, and how the Switch 2 makes it possible.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/20/sea-of-stars-throes-of-the-watchmaker-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>How do you add a new story to a sweeping RPG? That’s the tricky conundrum that faced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/31/sea-of-stars-review-a-love-letter-to-jrpgs-of-the-past/">Sea of Stars</a> developer Sabotage Studio. Some games choose to continue the story, bolting it onto the back of the game and giving you new hyper powerful abilities at the same time, or it’s joined on at the side and has to face the tricky balancing act of creating new progression that doesn’t impact too heavily on the tail end of the main story. Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker straddles this divide, coming as both a post-game adventure and branching off to explore a separate, miniaturised clockwork world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker DLC | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgFi2jXwzVI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That’s right, we’re getting all Honey, Shrunk the Kids for this one. Answering the call for help from the crew of The Verspertine, and with Keenathan in a particular kind of existential crisis, the one person who can help them solve Keenathan’s troubles seems to be the Watchmaker. Once you arrive at her Clockwork Castle, she agrees to help, but only if you help her first to resolve a fearful state of affairs in the miniature world of Horloge that she created.</p>


<p>You see, this charming little world, filled with clockwork denizens, has been twisted and corrupted, brought under the power of an evil twin to the Watchmaker, known as The Puppeteer, making her fearful ever to return. It’s up to Valere and Zale to shrink themselves down and head into this clockwork circus world of Horloge to free it from The Puppeteer’s rule.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long to run into The Puppeteer and her comedic clown duo of goons, Pif &amp; Pouf, doing battle and discovering, not only that the Solstice Warrior abilities of Valere and Zale have next to no power here, but also that this power can simply be whisked away from them and transformed into evil twins of themselves. It takes the Artificer’s new beam abilities to release everyone from their imprisonment, becoming a new playable character and permanent battle companion in the process, and it takes a fellow prisoner to explain that Valere and Zale will need to lean in and play some new circus-like roles in order to succeed.</p>


<p>Valere becomes an acrobat and Zale a juggler, with Arty bringing their own spin on circus acts alongside. Zale’s juggling attacks deal fire damage with a side helping of “bonk”, which is represented by a rubber mallet symbol, while Valere’s bonk comes with a side of magic, and Arty has beam attacks. Of course, there’s also all of the special abilities and combo attacks, and it’s here that the circus flair really comes to the fore. Valere launches herself into the sky on a pole vault, Zale juggles flaming balls off enemy faces, Arty bounces cannon balls or Valere and Zale of a trampoline, and there’s all the restorative properties of a cream pie to the face if you want Zale to heal an ally… or himself, I guess.</p>
<p>There’s the same rhythm to the turn-based combat here, where timing button presses increases the damage of an attack or extends the move for successive hits. At the same time, there’s a strategic layer of attacking certain enemies that have damage type ‘locks’ that can knock them out of turn order if you hit them with the right damage types enough times.</p>
<p>As a post-game addition, this is intended to be more challenging than the base game, making the importance of timing hits, blocks and breaking enemy locks all the more important. However, you do still have the Relics system that can tweak and modify the difficulty and certain other game elements. This can give you additional health, restore HP after battle instead and/or after levelling up (which is on by default), add a timing success indicator, and more. I do, as someone that’s not played an awful lot of the main game, wish that timing indicators were more deeply ingrained, perhaps giving a measure of whether you’re early, late or on time, but I can appreciate the game not wanting to hold your hand too much.</p>

<p>The clockwork world is quite delightfully realised by Sabotage Studio, really leaning in on this being a miniaturised land. All of the denizens have a wind-up key spinning from their backs, the town of Horloge is filled with circus tents that have a handful of circus minigames in them –&nbsp;such as needing to pole vault through large hoops against the clock –&nbsp;and as you explore you now gather restorative items from little milk tubs and cobs of corn that become popcorn.</p>
<p>There’s the same style of free traversal through the maze-like environments as well, clambering up ledges and ladders, grappling and leaping across gaps, and following paths that wrap around, through and under other parts of the scenery. It makes finding secrets and solving environmental puzzles satisfying and engaging.</p>

<p>And all that care and attention paid once more to the pixel art world is complimented by a bunch of catchy bops from Sabotage’s composer Eric W. Brown and guest composer Yasunori Mitsuda, and more gorgeously animated cinematics – Sabotage say these had the same budget as the main game.</p>
<p>Honestly, all of this could easily have been paid DLC, but for the fact that this was promised as a stretch goal from Sea of Stars’ original crowdfunding campaign. That it is a free addition to the game, coming after major updates that added 3-player co-op (which is playable throughout this DLC), overhauled combat and more, just makes it all the more special.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clash-of-clans-tv-show-in-the-works-for-some-reason.1193979/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clash-of-clans-tv-show<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has announced that a&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans</em> TV&nbsp;show is in the works, so now you have to reckon with that being a thing in the real world as much as I do. Sorry about that.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/netflix/status/1924804801616871741" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Netflix says that the "world" of&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>is "coming to life as an animated series on Netflix", although the streaming giant doesn't provide any kind of time frame for the series' arrival, nor does it specify what the story will be about.</p>

<p>However, if the mobile game is anything to go by, the series will probably revolve around chiefs trying to defend their village against attacks from other clans. I'd assume there will be a hefty dollop of self-referentiality and pop-culture gags, too, for such is the way these things often go.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clash-of-clans-netflix-series-characters.jpg?itok=acCTnHEP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clash-of-clans-netflix-series-characters.jpg?itok=Uq5lMiI4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>is getting a streaming series courtesy of Netflix.</figcaption></figure><p>In the (admittedly rather amusing) trailer announcing the&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>series on Netflix, Supercell staffers describe how there's at least one comment asking for a&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>show under every video made about the game by the studio "since 2012".</p>

<p>The video's description merely promises that the&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>show will star "your favorite moustachioed Barbarian and his high-pitched, hog-riding friends", so I guess if you were worried the show wouldn't be true to the game, you can put those worries to rest.</p>

<p>It sounds like we're going to have to wait quite a while for more information about the&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>series, so for now, you can content yourself with Supercell's announcement trailer. Even I, swinging brick of a heart and all, can admit it's quite funny.</p>




<p><em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>will follow in the footsteps of other video games to get animated Netflix adaptations, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season" rel="nofollow"><em>Devil May Cry</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-edgerunners-is-anime-set-in-cyberpunk-universe" rel="nofollow"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>, among others.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what kind of direction Netflix is going in with the show, as well as when we can expect it to launch. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Samsung was competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to secure the Nintendo contract, and the Korean company will reportedly produce a customized Nvidia chip for the Switch 2. Samsung has worked with Nintendo in the past to supply it with memory chips and displays, and the company can reportedly ramp up production further if necessary. Sources told Bloomberg that Samsung is also pushing for OLED panels to be used for a potential Switch 2 hardware refresh in the future.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 – Official System Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Switch 2 preorders have sold out at several retailers across the globe, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-warns-switch-2-lottery-will-leave-significant-numbers-of-fans-disappointed-in-japan/1100-6531049/">Nintendo recently apologized for being unable to meet demand in Japan</a> through its official store. The company received 2.2 million applications to purchase the console, but it warned customers that a "significant" number of them will not be selected as winners of the My Nintendo Store lottery sale.</p><p>In the US, Switch 2 preorders officially opened up on April 24 after weeks of uncertainty regarding tariffs. While the price of the console hasn't gone up yet--$450 for the base model, $500 for the bundle that includes Mario Kart World--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-accessories-will-be-more-expensive-than-originally-announced/1100-6530965/">first-party accessory prices have increased</a>. The Switch 2 will feature several hardware upgrades when compared to its predecessor, and there'll be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/">strong selection of third-party games available on launch day</a>.</p>

                <p>Former Battlefield producer David Goldfarb has reacted to a newly emerged clip of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6 </a>gameplay footage, saying it's giving off Bad Company 2 vibes. For what it's worth, the game isn't necessarily called Battlefield 6, but that's what we're using until EA gives it an official title.</p><p>"Oh the BC2 vibes this is giving me," Goldfarb <a href="https://x.com/locust9/status/1924703470713516520" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, adding that the footage (below) is giving him flashbacks to the first time DICE playtested Bad Company 2's much-loved <a href="https://battlefield.fandom.com/wiki/Arica_Harbor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arica Harbor map. </a></p><p>Goldfarb added that the player movement in the leaked Battlefield 6 clip looks "a little weird," adding that the character design <a href="https://x.com/locust9/status/1924705092432785470" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"seems very generic." </a> The gameplay footage shows a player fighting through buildings and squaring off against a tank down on the ground that blows away their cover. It's trademark Battlefield stuff.</p><p>Goldfarb left DICE in 2012 after working on Mirror's Edge, Battlefield: Bad Company 1 + 2, and Battlefield 3. He then moved to Overkill to become the game director for Payday 2. He is now the studio creative director and CCO at the Funcom-owned developer The Outsiders.</p><p>The footage stems from the Battlefield Labs testing program, so what we're seeing is unfinished and was never meant to be seen publicly anyway since the Labs tests forbid people from sharing footage. Despite that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-landing-roll-but-it-might-give-you-motion-sickness/1100-6531523/" data-ref-id="1100-6531523">numerous gameplay videos from the Labs program have emerged over the weeks and months.</a> You can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a> to give yourself a chance to get into a future test.</p><p>EA will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-fully-revealed-this-summer-launching-by-march-2026/1100-6531349/" data-ref-id="1100-6531349">officially unveil the new Battlefield game this summer</a>. As for when it may launch, it's due for release by the end of March 2026, but now that GTA 6 has been delayed, some are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">theorizing it may come out this fall.</a></p>

However, it’s clear season two will leave us with a lot of story left when it’s over. While many fans predicted that a third season, which has already been greenlit, could finish the story, showrunner Craig Mazin alludes to needing a fourth season to wrap up the events of The Last of Us Part II.</p><p>In a new interview with <a href="https://collider.com/the-last-of-us-series-length-season-3-showrunner-craig-mazin/"><em>Collider</em></a>, Mazin explains, “there’s no way to complete this narrative in a third season” when asked about a theoretical fourth season.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QtmC_0dTaKk"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QtmC_0dTaKk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><span><strong>Spoilers For Season Two Of HBO's The Last Of Us</strong></span></p><hr><p>“I think there’s a decent chance Season 3 will be longer than Season 2, just because the manner of that narrative and the opportunities it affords us are a little different,” Mazin, who is also a director and writer on the show, told <em>Collider</em>. “The thing about Joel’s death is that it’s so impactful. It’s such a narrative nuclear bomb that it’s hard to wander away from it. We can’t really take a break and move off to the side and do a Bill and Frank story.</p><p>“I’m not sure that will be necessarily true for Season 3. I think we’ll have a little more room there. But certainly, there’s no way to complete this narrative in a third season. Hopefully, we’ll earn our keep enough to come back and finish it in a fourth. That’s the likely outcome.”</p><p>Though it seems like Mazin and the team behind the show are still waiting to see if a fourth season will be greenlit, which likely depends on the reception of season three, it’s clear he believes a fourth season is needed to finish the story of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review-a-perfect-circle">The Last of Us Part II</a>. It also sounds like we can expect a Bill and Frank-style episode in season three.</p><p>Regardless, this theoretical fourth season is years away.
