<p>Forza Horizon 6 could be set in Japan, following a fresh leak that seemingly confirms the location for the title, which has yet to be officially confirmed.</p>



<p>With Forza Horizon 5 now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on PlayStation 5</a>, and Forza Motorsport studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-motorsport-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turn 10 suffering huge layoffs</a>, all eyes are cast towards Horizon 6 as the next entry in the beloved franchise, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-forza-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phil Spencer confirmed would release in 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Since first releasing in 2012, Playground Games has brought the Horizon Festival to Colorado, Southern France, Northern Italy, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Mexico. Now, it appears the franchise is heading to Japan.</p>

<p>In a now-deleted post, which was shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mvq1t0/australian_car_import_company_cult_classic_may/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, Australian car import company Cult &amp; Classic posted an image of someone, said to be from the Forza Horizon team, down under, scanning Kei cars to feature in the series.</p>



<p>Kei cars are the smallest approved in Japan to drive on expressways and are rarely seen outside of the Far East, hence why someone from the Horizon development team would need to fly out to scan them.</p>



<p>If the setting is indeed in Japan, having an accurate representation of Kei cars would be needed for accuracy, as it would be weird to drive on the roads without seeing them, and it could tease that they will be purchasable in the game.</p>



<p>Of course, take this all with a significant pinch of salt as it is far from an official confirmation, but Japan has long been requested by the Horizon community, so it would be a perfect choice for Forza Horizon 6.</p>



<p>Japan is iconic in the street-racing scene, having been the location for The Fast &amp; Furious: Tokyo Drift movie.</p>



<p>Is Japan top of your wishlist as a location to play host to the Forza Horizon series? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3356/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Each aspect feels authored and prescribed to a clear vision — a piece of playable art that is as fun to wield as it is to watch (I should know, the gamescom queue was very long)," IGN's Simon Cardy wrote. "It may have been the shortest of demos, but so far, Silksong is very much singing to me, maybe even more than the original."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Kirby Air Riders – The First Preview</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">its big Nintendo Direct,</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-the-first-preview">we had the chance to play Kirby Air Riders at gamescom.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The maximalism of Kirby Air Riders is its core charm; it feels brewed from impish, chaotic-neutral alchemy," our previewer, Leanne Butkovic, said. "Even Nintendo is calling this a “vehicle action game,” not a kart racer, which honestly seems apt – a silly genre distinction for a purposefully unserious game. It might not have been the sequel the people were clamoring for, but I’m glad that it exists."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil Requiem Hands-On Preview</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's Dale Driver had a chance to play <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-hands-on-preview">a 20-minute demo of Resident Evil Requiem,</a> and one of the biggest things we took away from playing the game is that a new, unstoppable stalker could be the scariest one yet.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil: Requiem Trailer Shows Fresh Look at Grace Ashcroft's Backstory, But Where's Leon?</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-shows-fresh-look-at-grace-ashcrofts-backstory-but-wheres-leon">Resident Evil: Requiem showed up in a big way at ONL</a> with a new story and gameplay trailer that dives deep into our protagonist, Grace Ashcroft.

It's a fresh take, but is it a good thing? After playing the Pragmata demo at gamescom 2025, IGN's Matt Purslow and Dale Driver have some mixed feelings, enjoying the innovation but with slight concerns that the process could wear thin over a full game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Onimusha: Way of the Sword Skillfully Sharpens a PS2 Classic for a New Generation</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-skilfully-sharpens-a-ps2-classic-for-a-new-generation-gamescom-2025">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> brings back the franchise for the first time since the PS2 days, and we walked away from playing this new game in a very positive way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The gamescom demo may have been short – little more than some winding paths and a boss fight in a temple – but it’s more than enough to convince me that Onimusha: Way of the Sword is built on rock-solid swordplay fundamentals," IGN's Matt Purslow said.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Onimusha Could be as Sharp as Sekiro Without the Soulslike Difficulty</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Is Onimusha: Way of the Sword a triumphant return for the long-dormant franchise? IGN's Matt Purslow and Dale Driver got to play the demo at gamescom 2025 and share their thoughts about the supernatural samurai fighting demon combat and the inevitable Soulslike comparisons. How does Onimusha compare to the obvious Ghost of Tsushima and Sekiro comparisons? Let's find out.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">LEGO Voyagers Might Already Be My Favorite LEGO Game Ever</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's Ryan McCaffrey said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-voyagers-might-already-be-my-favorite-lego-game-ever">Lego Voyagers just might already be his favorite LEGO game of all time.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Will LEGO Voyagers have some poignant moment waiting for players near the end like fellow dialogue-free physics puzzle platformers Limbo and Inside? That remains to be seen, but even if it doesn’t, it’s clear that Voyagers intends to make its memories along the journey if not the destination.

handheld mode on Switch 2 and came away very disappointed with the game's performance, especially when in the open areas like Limgrave. Frame rate drops were significant when turning the camera whilst exploring outside of the tutorial area, and this, combined with a confusing button layout on Switch 2, made combat confusing and exploration fairly dispiriting. We weren't allowed to record gameplay at the booth, probably due to this fact, but you can hear our thoughts on Elden Ring Switch 2 handheld gameplay in this video. Elden Ring Tarnished Edition releases in 2025, so hopefully there's time for Bandai Namco to work on its performance.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Borderlands 4 Has The Weirdest Weapons You'll Ever See</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Harlowe is the latest exciting addition to Borderlands 4's vault hunter line-up.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is edging ever closer to release, and now the game has received an ESRB rating ahead of launch.</p>



<p>The ESRB rating follows on from receiving a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-rated-for-switch-2-by-south-korea-classification-board/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rating from the South Korean Rating Board</a> last month, with the game ticking yet another box ahead of a 2025 release window, which has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-reconfirms-2025-release-window-for-metroid-prime-4-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reconfirmed by Nintendo</a>.</p>



<p>While a precise release window has not been shared, the news must surely be on the horizon, given that ratings from two separate regions have now been confirmed.</p>



<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond-rated-t-by-esrb">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Rated T by ESRB</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s coming. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/metroid-prime-4-beyond-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo store</a> has revealed the rating for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond issued by the ESRB is T for Teen, with the game featuring animated blood, violence, and in-game purchases.</p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is currently playable at Gamescom with a demo, further indication that a release is edging closer, and Nintendo could now be diverting attention toward the release following the recent Nintendo Direct focused on Kirby Air Riders.</p>



<p>Since the launch of the Switch 2, Nintendo has adopted an approach of handing big releases their own Direct show, having done so for Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and Kirby Air Riders—the latter of which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releases November 20</a>.</p>



<p>While Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, unlike the other three titles, is not a Switch 2 exclusive, it is still one of the biggest Nintendo releases set for this year, alongside the likes of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releasing October 16</a>.</p>



<p>Release date details for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond should now be on the horizon, given the ESRB rating, with only a few more boxes left to be ticked.</p>

<p>Prologue demo also announced</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Falcom and GungHo have today confirmed the upcoming title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> will be getting a Switch 2 Edition.</p>
<p>This particular version will be a digital release and includes higher resolution and frame rate "for sharper" and "smoother graphics", along with reduced load times. This is part of a paid upgrade path for existing Switch owners and is priced at <strong>$1.00 USD</strong> (or your regional equivalent).</p>
<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2dcd98f04fd51/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter.large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>As you can see in the fine print above, to "play Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, you must purchase the paid Upgrade Pack" and this "Upgrade Pack alone" does not give you access to the full game. A standard physical release will be available for the Switch as well as a 'SteelBook' and 'Bracer Edition'.</p>
<p>Along with this news, a <a href="https://trailsfirstchapter.com/trial/">prologue demo has also been revealed for Switch</a> and other platforms. Players will be able to carry over their save data to the full version, when it arrives next month on <strong>19th September 2025</strong>. The demo is now live in Japan.</p>

<p>After a restart, delays and an incredibly long wait, it appears Retro Studios' anticipated release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> may have <em>finally</em> been rated by the Entertainment Software Rating Board.</p>
<p>A rating has recently been spotted on Nintendo's website in the US, taking it from "Rating Pending" to a 'T' for "Teen" classification.</p>
<p>The currently attached description on the same page references animated blood and violence. As noted by <a href="https://shinesparkers.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-has-been-rated-by-the-esrb-what-it-means/">Metroid fan site Shinesparkers</a>, this age rating would be consistent with the main <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> games <em>before</em> the fourth entry.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here is ESRB's basic summary of this age rating, describing what a game under this classification may contain. The guide on its <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">website also goes into detail</a> about "interactive elements" referenced by the rating above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Teen - content is generally suitable for ages 13 and up. May contain violence, suggestive themes, crude humor, minimal blood, simulated gambling and/or infrequent use of strong language."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ratings for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>, 2 and 3 in this same region contained "animated blood" and "violence". The classification and "rating summary" for Beyond has not gone live on ESRB's official website yet, so if there are any changes or updates, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>This discovery follows the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/metroid-prime-4-beyond-rating-spotted-fuelling-nintendo-direct-hopes-again">game being rated in South Korea</a> by the Game Rating and Administration Committee in July, so hopefully, all this recent activity means an official release date isn't too far away. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is currently targeting a <strong>2025</strong> launch and the Switch 2 version will include enhanced resolution and frame rate as well as Joy-Con 2 mouse support.</p>
<p>Nintendo's lineup of games for the remainder of this year is already looking quite busy, with the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a> game scheduled for October and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> now locked in for November.</p>

There were six seats, a small table, and a television showcasing Keeper, the upcoming adventure game from Psychonauts developer Double Fine Productions centered around a walking lighthouse and a bird. Oh, and the studio's CEO and games industry legend, Tim Schafer.&nbsp;</p><p>Nobody told me the person showcasing Keeper would be Schafer, and it's kinda wild to walk into a room and be surprise-greeted by a developer you massively respect. Of course, Schafer is a true gentleman, kind, and genuinely hilarious, so the nerves quickly disappear as he walks me through three previously recorded gameplay segments of Keeper.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cTjCk55-Dg4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cTjCk55-Dg4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>I promise I'll talk about those segments, but everything Schafer told me beforehand was just as interesting (possibly more). First off, it's his first time doing press since 2021 with Psychonauts 2, so Schafer explains that <em>he's</em> nervous – ahhh, even ground – and his first time at Gamescom in 16 years! Though he was here in person to talk about Keeper, he mostly speaks about Lee Petty, the game's director (and Brutal Legend and Broken Age art director) and the person behind the wild idea that is Keeper.&nbsp;</p><p>Schafer says Keeper wouldn't exist without Double Fine becoming an Xbox studio. "Around the time we had just joined the Xbox family, we were wondering what we should make next," Schafer says. "We have support; we have money; and we don't have to worry about going out of business every day, and we don't have to pitch to publishers, 'Please make our game, it's very commercial.'"&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, Petty was busy thinking about his time during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. He was locked in his home like the rest of us, but he found solace in nature hikes amongst the hills around San Francisco. He couldn't get an idea out of his head: what if humanity didn't survive this, but nature did and took over in our place? It's here that Schafer explains Petty is a "weird dude who loves strange images, and grew up loving <em>Dark Crystal </em>and Salvador Dali."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The result of all that pondering is Keeper – weird and chill, like Petty and his interests, Schafer says. He then describes the game as an adventure game with puzzles – light puzzles, though, because Keeper is about the "atmosphere and vibes and companionship between these two." The two he's talking about are Twig, a sea bird, and an unnamed lighthouse. After a violent sea storm isolates Twig from her flock, she perches on a lighthouse. For some reason, this awakens the lighthouse, it tips over, and in the resulting crash, it grows legs. Typical lighthouse behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>Awakened and the new owner of legs, this lighthouse feels immediately called to a giant mountain peak atop the island it's on. So, it begins heading that way, with Twig in tow. Controlling the lighthouse consists of moving through surrealist and fantastical landscapes and shining your beam on things. You can shine your beam on plants and sometimes they'll grow; you can shine your beam on gears and sometimes Twig will fly to them and rotate them to unlock gates; you can shine your beam on strange pot creatures that crash to the floor beneath them, sometimes revealing objects for Twig to interact with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your primary method of interacting with this world is your beam, and second to that is Twig. This might just be a me thing as someone who lives a couple hours away from Disney World and has a fondness for the technology of animatronics, but Keeper most reminds me of a Disney dark ride. If you're unfamiliar with that term, dark rides include Pirates of the Caribbean and The Haunted Mansion. It's less about thrills and more about experiencing the things around you, watching animatronics move to tell a story, and soaking in the vibes. That's Keeper.&nbsp;</p><p>I love that shining your light on objects causes them to emote or come to life with animation. It might not affect your journey forward or be part of a puzzle every time, but that's okay – it's about the vibes! It's about watching the animatronics of this world, as it were, do things that make the surrounding area feel real, like it has its own story to tell.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The puzzles I see seem simple and quick, but I can't help keeping an eye on the things outside the primary focus of these gameplay videos. I see sunflowers dance as light grazes over them, carrots come to life and dive bomb into the soil below, and more. It really feels like a Double Fine dark ride in the most complimentary way.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, I see some other things that catch my eye. At one point, Twig becomes a giant egg atop the lighthouse for some reason. I see a village of tiny lil guys that are rusty watches. I see the lighthouse prance through pink pollen that gives it a light, low-gravity effect when it jumps. Everything I see looks vastly different from what I witness moments before, but it's all oozing with Double Fine and surrealist Salvador Dali-inspired charm.&nbsp;</p><p>Some areas are more linear, designed around puzzles, Schafer says. Other areas are more open, prime for exploration. Regardless of where you are in the lighthouse's journey to the mountain peak, Schafer says Keeper is ultimately about change; how nature changes, how Twig changes, how the lighthouse changes. Every character, including Twig and the Lighthouse, has a story arc, he adds.&nbsp;</p><p>When I ask Schafer why Petty decided to have players control a lighthouse, Schafer laughs – he doesn't actually know. He says the lighthouse was one of the game's side characters, but when he saw it walking with legs, he told Petty that needs to be the game. "It was compelling," Schafer says. "It really looked like something from a surrealist painting."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Schafer ends my presentation further explaining Double Fine's love of nonsense and the bizarre, the type of work directors David Lynch and David Cronenberg are interested in making, he says. I see the vision.&nbsp;</p><p>Keeper is a weird game, but it has that undeniable Double Fine charm. I can't wait to actually play it when it launches on October 17 on Xbox Series X/S and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/20/keeper-is-a-salvador-dali-inspired-surrealist-adventure-with-no-dialogue]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new Unreal Engine 5-powered horror game based on 1978’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/retrorealms-halloween-ash-evil-dead-horror-16-bit-retro-1851620847"><em>Halloween</em></a> from director John Carpenter is in the works and will launch next year. It’s titled <em>Halloween: The Game,</em> and will feature iconic slasher Michael Myers killing people on the night he returns home.</p> <p>Announced on August 20, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219630/Halloween/">Halloween: The Game</a>,</em> which isn’t the most creative name, will be heavily inspired by the original movie and will feature a “one-versus-many stealth horror experience.” The game will let players put on Michael’s mask and stab their friends online in multiplayer or run away from the killer as a civilian of Haddonefield. IllFonic, the team developing <em>Halloween: The Game, </em>is a studio that has become well-known for its focus on asymmetrical online games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/predator-hunting-grounds-is-only-fun-when-the-predator-1843181244"><em>Predator: Hunting Grounds</em></a> and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/rest-in-pieces-friday-the-13th-the-game-1827582283">now-defunct<em> Friday the 13th</em> game.&nbsp;</a></p> <p>Here’s the official trailer for <em>Halloween: The Game:</em></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Halloween The Game - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NFfhM1Jxqds?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>In a press release for the newly announced horror game, it was confirmed that <em>Halloween</em> will include a story mode and the ability to play against bots, too. As someone who has been disappointed by so many <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game">horror movie franchises</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-game-review-crossplay-ps5-1850752842">getting video game adaptations</a> that are purely online-only, this is good news. And I imagine many other players will agree. <em>Halloween: The Game</em> will also feature “multiple maps” and a soundtrack “inspired by” that of the original <em>Halloween</em> movie. Interestingly, the original film’s director, John Carpenter, is credited as an executive producer on the upcoming game.</p>

 <p>“Working with Compass International Pictures and Further Front has been a dream,” said Charles Brungardt, CEO of IllFonic. “As rights holders of the film and producers on the game, they’ve shared incredible insights to help us stay true to the soul of the 1978 film. Their tremendous passion for Michael Myers has pushed us to craft something that fans of the franchise will truly appreciate.”</p> <p><em>Halloween: The Game</em> is set to launch on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC in 2026. <em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Illfonic to see if this project is the same one <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-ign-halloween-games-michael-myers-john-carpenter-1851619732">teased back in 2024.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview-the-game-you%E2%80%99ve-been-waiting-for-is-worth-the-wait.1276527/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Like you, I’ve been waiting what feels like years for Hollow Knight: Silksong. I take that back, it HAS been years waiting for Silksong. The Metroidvania sequel was first announced in 2019, and we barely had a sniff of the game for years. Trailers and talk intensified this year, and it culminated with my special hands-on preview of Hollow Knight: Silksong, in the flesh at Gamescom 2025.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-website-receives-big-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight</a> was utterly captivating. Yes, it was <em>another </em>Metroidvania title, focusing on backtracking and acquiring new abilities to further progression. But its sweet and innocent art style, its cutesy main character, and punishing combat are juxtaposed wonderfully. It was celebrated on launch and continues to be heralded all these years later.</p>



<p>Its legacy can only last so long before people want more—cue Silksong.</p>



<h2 id="h-sing-me-a-sweet-silksong">Sing me a Sweet Silksong</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s real, I saw it. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Don’t adjust your TV set, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-demo-confirmed-by-xbox-for-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was indeed playable at <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamescom 2025</a>. I endured a savage queue of over 2 hours to get a sniff of Silksong. As I’ve said, I love Hollow Knight, but you won’t see such fevered hype and excessive waiting for an ‘indie’ game like this for a while.</p>



<p>The demo build offers two entry points, with one being the beginning of the game and one much further in. As a Metroidvania master (I wish) and someone well-versed in the genre, I did what I didn’t see many other people do, and that’s jump straight into the deep end—was it ego or stupidity, I’ll let you be the judge.</p>



<p>Within seconds, it felt like Hollow Knight. Ori is possibly the only other game that rivals Hollow Knight in terms of presentation. It’s just breathtaking with stuff happening off-screen, and each mini-scene boasts a rich palette of shades and colors. I’ve played mechanically functional titles that looked dull and washed out, whereas Silksong’s verdict is in its name: Silky.</p>



<h2 id="h-crushing-combat-will-question-your-ability">Crushing Combat Will Question Your Ability</h2>



<p>There’s nothing fundamentally different from a movement standpoint. Hornet handles as smoothly as our predecessor, and within minutes, I was slashing away at rocks, piling up my currency, and finding secrets, shortcuts, and nearly drowning in lava-adjacent substances.</p>



<p>It’s not long until I’m thrust into a mini-boss encounter. I’ve had no time to prepare, I’ve quickly familiarized myself with the controls, and I’m met with a gradually building enemy rush of increasing difficulty. Miraculously, I prevail and feel smug—this is likely an encounter you’re not supposed to face until a handful of hours in. I land precise attacks with Hornet and quickly work out the enemy’s attack patterns. Doubt turns to confidence, and I’m ready to take on whatever boss this side of the demo possesses.</p>



<p>The gameplay loop is back. The slick dashes, jumps, and swipes are a key part of Hornet’s arsenal. Tactical jabs and prods, using Hornet’s agility and nimble frame to evade attacks; these are hallmarks of what made the original so special and accessible. I feel unbeatable, and after finding a key and unlocking the path ahead, I come to the boss—Lace.</p>



<p>I’ll cut to the chase: I die multiple times, and my demo session ends abruptly. I could not match the pace of Lace, and like many Hollow Knight bosses, her attack patterns aren’t ludicrously difficult and staggered like in various <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-non-fromsoftware-soulslike-games-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soulslikes</a>, but you’ll spam buttons and flail more than a medieval weapon.</p>



<p>Each death brought me closer to a winning effort, and with a few more goes, I think I would’ve overcome the character’s might. But that’s the hook, right? Hollow Knight bosses don’t drag on for 5-10 minutes, but you still feel satiated in your hunger for victory, and you keep going. Ultimately, I walked away from my Silksong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025</a> preview with a smile. </p>



<p>If you’re a Hollow Knight fan, chances are, you’re going to love Silksong. Team Cherry, a release date, please?</p>



<hr>



<p>On a scale of 1-10, how much are you looking forward to Hollow Knight: Silksong? Do you think Hollow Knight is an all-time indie great? Can Silksong better it?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-demo-at-gamescom-2025-is-a-shinier-silkier-version-of-the-same-demo-from-e3-2019.1276524/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A higher threadcount, you might say.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There's been lots of excitement over the presence of a Hollow Knight: Silksong game demo on the show floor at Gamescom this year, in both the Xbox and Nintendo booths. And by all accounts, the demo seems pretty great. Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-we-played-it-gamescom-2025">own previewer said</a> it's "a piece of playable art that is as fun to wield as it is to watch." But some Silksong superfans hoping for new story, new bosses, or new content to reveal themselves in this demo might be a little disappointed, because the Gamescom demo is the same demo from six years ago at E3 2019. But shinier.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We first noticed this when reading through our previews of the demo from today alongside our preview from 2019. It's more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/21/hollow-knight-silksong-feels-wildly-different-and-incredibly-familiar-e3-2019">discernable when looking at 2019's video footage</a>, but both demos cover the same two areas - the early game Moss Grotto, and the later Deep Docks. They cover the same encounters and bosses as well. We've been able to comb over some other footage posted by other individuals from Gamescom and yup, looks like an updated version of the same demo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, that's not necessarily a bad thing. If anything, it shows how far the game has come in six years. Looking at similar clips from both demos, and there are very clear signs of polish. Lighting and backgrounds have been adjusted, platforms have been moved around slightly. Fans have even spotted the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1mvp03b/a_piece_of_dialogue_between_hornet_and_lace_was/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">teensiest, tiniest dialogue change</a> between the two demos. It's also not surprising that neither area has undergone massive content changes in six years. If these two levels were ready for prime time in 2019, they were likely the closest to "done" at the time that Team Cherry had ready, and thus wouldn't need developers to spend years tweaking them infinitely. And for what it's worth, this is also the first time we've seen the game on both an Xbox Series console, and the Nintendo Switch 2, as the E3 2019 demo was only on Nintendo Switch 1.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The only real disappointment to be had here is that we're not actually seeing any new content after such a long wait - no new bosses or enemies or characters or stories. So anyone looking to scour this new demo for clues as to what Silksong will be when it finally releases is probably not going to come up with much that we don't already know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, that probably won't be necessary either. Team Cherry has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-developer-teases-special-announcement-later-this-week">announced an announcement</a> of some sort for tomorrow, and after a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oh-boy-geoff-keighley-is-teasing-hollow-knight-silksong-for-gamescom-opening-night-live">rash</a> of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-shows-up-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-with-almost-30-seconds-of-new-gameplay-as-a-treat">teases</a> around Gamescom and the demo finally re-emerging after a six year cocoon, it seems likely that a release date is imminent. (Silk)soon, we won't need to scour tidbits of footage for a crumb of new Silksong info. We'll just be able to, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-the-story-behind-the-insanely-long-wait-clown-meme">finally, play the long-anticipated </a>sequel to Hollow Knight for ourselves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Gameplay (Pre-Alpha Build) | gamescom 2025</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">At first, Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight looks to be an anthology of various Lego-ized Batman movies similar to Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, but even that isn't quite right. It would be more accurate to call it a <em>fusion</em> of Batman movies, alongside other influences and stories, to build something new and original from all of its various parts. In that way, it's perfectly Lego.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, the story mission I played at Gamescom took place in Axis Chemicals, which fans of the 1989 Michael Keaton movie will immediately recognize as the birthplace of the Joker. But instead of gangster sociopath Jack Napier being dispatched to destroy incriminating evidence in the chemical plant (but with the situation becoming a setup to kill him for sleeping with the boss' moll), it's Red Hood #1, leader of the Red Hood Gang, as we've seen serve as the Joker origin story in some comic iterations. Red Hood is using the factory to manufacture a strange new compound that makes its victims laugh uncontrollably until they die. Under the hood is an unmistakable (and very passable) Jack Nicholson impression, so the character is not <em>not</em> the Batman '89 Joker, but he's been blended with other stories.</p><p dir="ltr">Likewise, the Batman who confronts him, at least in this demo, was the Robert Pattinson iteration of the character, accompanied by a Jim Gordon who looks very much like a Lego Jeffrey Wright, each of them from the 2022 film The Batman.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4553511-lego_batman_gothamcity.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553511" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4553511-lego_batman_gothamcity.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553511"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4553511-lego_batman_gothamcity.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This mixing and matching of various great moments from Batman cinematic history is core to the spirit of Legacy of the Dark Knight, which sets the ambitious target of weaving elements of all of the Batman movies with other media into a single coherent story. When asked what that means for recurring characters played by different actors like the Joker, TT Games' Jonathan Smith told GameSpot that perhaps some terrible things will happen to the Joker that will make him even more sinister and--presumably, but left unsaid--more like Heath Ledger's incarnation in The Dark Knight.</p><p dir="ltr">That same sense of playfulness extends to the Easter eggs, which have always been a Lego staple but feel more focused here. Rather than collecting a hundred doodads to unlock 200 different but mechanically identical characters, you're unlocking deep-cut styles for Batman and Commissioner Gordon. Those include some you'd expect, like iconic movie appearances, alongside some you might not. Batman looked especially great in his Brave and the Bold costume modeled after the 2008 cartoon show.</p><p dir="ltr">Both Batman and Gordon have looks based on their very first comic appearances, including Bats' dopey big cowl ears and Gordon's white suit and wispy mustache. The most surprising was <a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Detective_Comics_Vol_1_241" rel="nofollow ">Batman's Rainbow Suit</a>, a fully rendered Lego version of a classic and extremely goofy Silver Age comic book that has received iconic camp status.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4553510-lego_batman_batmobile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553510" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4553510-lego_batman_batmobile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553510"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4553510-lego_batman_batmobile.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But not content to borrow solely from great Batman movies, Legacy of the Dark Knight also borrows from great Batman games. The combat is clearly inspired by the Arkham series, as Batman can perform stealth takedowns of unsuspecting Lego enemies or jump into the middle of a brawl with timing-based combat. This is simplified in some ways--the timing windows are wider and the visual indicators are bigger than in the Arkham games, and you only have two gadgets to use in fights. But it feels like an affectionate homage to mechanics that have become as central to the character as any movie, in the minds of Arkham fans. Legacy of the Dark Knight also introduces difficulty levels, letting younger or less-experienced players THWACK and POW like Batman, while giving more experienced Arkham fans more and tougher enemies to fight and, for the first time I remember, a limited pool of lives to spend on encounters.</p><p dir="ltr">And like the later Arkham games, the hub world is a wide-open Gotham City that can be explored freely. You can stop crimes, find Bat caches, smash collectibles like Penguin rubber duckies, and skulk along the rooftops or gracefully glide between them. You can zip-line your way up to gain speed and then float, and if you've built up enough energy from beating down thugs, you can launch even higher into the air to get a birds-eye view of the city. If going ground-level is more your style, you can summon a Batmobile anywhere in the open world. I only saw the Robert Pattinson muscle car iteration from The Batman in my demo, but TT Games has already teased many more Batmobiles to come, and they can be freely equipped like Batman and Gordon's costumes.</p><p dir="ltr">I didn't really know what to expect next out of TT Games after The Skywalker Saga, but Legacy of the Dark Knight is such a pleasant surprise. When you're finished building a Lego set, you might take it apart and see what else you can make from all the pieces. TT Games looks to be doing that with the Batman mythos, and I can't wait to see what they build out of it.</p>

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Framework, the modular computer company, just released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/749404/framework-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-max-385-395-plus-review">its first delightful tiny desktop PC</a>, on top of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/688959/framework-laptop-12-review-modular-touchscreen-intel">smallest laptop yet</a>. But it’s already teasing its next big live announcement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZRG7Og61mw">on YouTube</a> for August 26th at 8am PT / 11am ET, saying it’ll reveal how “something big just got better.”</p><p>While that may seem like a vague phrase, it might narrow things down quite a bit! Framework only has one existing “big” product other than the Framework Desktop, the one that mysteriously <em>didn’t</em> get an update at its last event in February.</p><div><p>I’m talking, of course, about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24047424/framework-laptop-16-review">the Framework Laptop 16, the most ambitious and most modular laptop ever made</a>. When I tracked down Framework CEO Nirav Patel in February, he told me that the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619586/framework-laptop-16-update-one-key-but-not-done">was “nowhere near done”</a> with the laptop just yet.</p></div><p>Or, maybe Framework will help fisherman change how they catch fish in New England? That’s what Google Search tells me, anyhow:</p><p>I think the Framework Laptop 16 is a safer bet, though.</p><p>I’ve been quietly frustrated that I haven’t been able to give the Laptop 16 my full recommendation yet — because I want products like this to exist! — partly because of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24185827/framework-laptop-16-six-months-later-review">early cooling and build quality</a> deficiencies, and partly because Framework has never truly promised that you’ll be able to actually upgrade its GPU to a more powerful one down the road.</p><p>But with Framework’s Laptop 13, the company has proved again and again that truly modular and upgradable laptops can be a reality, and it’s ironed out many issues along the way. Here’s hoping August 26th is the day it fulfills the promise of modular gaming / creator laptops as well.</p><div><p>BTW, in case you missed it: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast/623633/james-bond-amazon-framework-laptop-desktop-vergecast">We had Nirav on <em>The Vergecast</em> in March</a> to chat all things Framework.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/763037/framework-is-teasing-a-big-update-for-august-26th-could-it-be-framework-16]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Xbox's Design Head <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7361111873749991426/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on LinkedIn</a> about the current generation of Xbox wrapping up. That could mean a lot of things, so we can't read much into it. Given the timing though, it makes sense that Microsoft is thinking about what's next. Here's what was said, and what's happening with Microsoft's gaming division these days, to help us make sense of the situation.</p><p>"As we wrap up this journey with the Xbox Series X and Series S, the mission behind these consoles echoes everything I’ve learned over 30 years--to create technology that’s powerful, purposeful, and beautifully integrated into people’s lives,” wrote Carl Ledbetter, Partner Head of Design at Xbox.</p><p>"Xbox is about fun and playing games," he continued. "The console, the controller, the headset, all of the devices become a reflection of the people who make them, but more importantly, of the people who choose to purchase and use them. These products matter to people."</p><p>This isn't exactly big news if you've been paying attention to the clues Microsoft has been sprinkling around, but it's the first time someone from Xbox has specifically spoken about sunsetting the consoles. Microsoft has spent the better part of the last year insistently telling us that "<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">This is an Xbox</a>," while holding up various household appliances and electronics to show us how broad--or meaningless--the definition of the word Xbox is.</p><p>Microsoft also talked in June about how it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">partnering with AMD</a> to "co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices, including future first-party consoles and cloud."</p><p>For a good 25 years or so, there was a pretty steady cadence of consoles releases every five-or-so years. When a new one came along, it felt like a big deal, especially during the days when a new released doubled gaming's available bits, or unlocked a then-unexplored third dimension. But console generations have been getting longer and longer since the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. That generation and the next both lasted about seven years each.</p><p>And indeed, it feels like console makers have barely tapped the power of their consoles. Games take longer to make, and are increasingly made using similar development tools, so innovations don't come as quickly as they used to. But Microsoft has also been at a significant disadvantage this generation, the same way it was with the Xbox One; information pieced together from Sony's advertised sales numbers and analyst estimates of sold systems suggest Sony has moved twice as many PlayStation 5s as Microsoft has sold Xbox Series X and S consoles.</p><p>With Microsoft lagging in sales and broadening the definition of what it wants players to consider an Xbox portal, it seems like the company is downplaying the importance of a core first-party console moving forward. Even its announced partnership with AMD, which mentions first-party consoles, also mentions a "portfolio of devices." Former PlayStation exec <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-at-a-sega-like-fork-in-the-road-and-may-stop-making-consoles-ex-playstation-boss-says/1100-6533966/" data-ref-id="1100-6533966">Shawn Layden</a> said just last week that Microsoft "is in that same sort of fork in the road" that Sega reached toward the end of the short life of the Sega Dreamcast.</p><p>With all that said, "wrap up" is a pretty difficult phrase to define here. Microsoft has made an effort to make its software cross-generational since the Xbox One. Announced games will still be compatible with the Xbox Series consoles, and future, unannounced ones likely will, too.</p><p>Wrapping up a console generation is also a thing that takes years. From the perspective of a Head of Design like Ledbetter, there's probably not much to do with the Xbox Series consoles at this point. After all, they're already designed. New chips and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/" data-ref-id="1100-6534059">consoles</a>, on the other hand, take years to design, and Ledbetter, who wrote his "journey is far from over," probably has a lot more to do with that unannounced hardware right now.</p>

			<p>Grinding Gear Games released <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-the-hunt-qa-throw-everything-you-knew-in-the-bin/">Path of Exile 2 </a>in early access last December, and hardcore ARPG fans have praised it for fulfilling their desire for a challenge that Diablo IV has been unable to satisfy. Today, in an <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pathofexile">extensive live stream</a>, the studio delved into the many changes coming in its Third Edict update, which goes live at the end of this month on August 29, 2025.</p>



<p>It'll also be going live as part of a free weekend promotion, so if you've been curious about trying Path of Exile 2 for yourself, you'll be able to jump in alongside veterans of the game's early access period when the new update goes live.</p>



<p>Some of the biggest changes in this update include the removal of the Cruel difficulty level, with the studio introducing three interlude acts that players can go through as part of changes to the endgame experience. The introduction of trading is also, of course, major news for the player base.</p>



<p>The introduction of a new act, however, with Act IV being added to the game with this update, is the headlining addition for most players.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside the Third Edict is the addition of a new league, Secrets of Abyssal, which introduces a number of cool features for how players can adjust and re-adjust their character builds. </p>



<p>The full patch notes will reveal all of the specifics that hardcore fans of the series will want to dig into, but those won't arrive until a bit closer to the update's launch next week. For now, you can pore over the live stream and look forward to what's to come in Path of Exile 2 next week.</p>

			<p>The legal battle around Subnautica 2 between Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill and their former parent company KRAFTON continues, as the studio that Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire all co-founded, Unknown Worlds, has now <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/904055347/Unknown-Worlds-Entertainment-v-Cleveland-McGuire-and-Gill-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=tUP1182XR5apSqla4qJM">filed a lawsuit against Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire</a>.</p>



<p>This comes <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-fires-back-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-subnautica-2/">a little more than a week after KRAFTON filed its own lawsuit</a> against Gill, Cleveland and McGuire, and since Unknown Worlds is wholly owned by KRAFTON, it appears that this suit is meant to pile on even more pressure on the three co-founders.</p>



<p>This new suit also includes what appear to be Slack messages meant to back KRAFTON's claims that Cleveland and McGuire were no longer working on Subanutica 2, and that they had moved on to personal projects while the rest of the team was left to pick up the pieces.</p>



<p>Since <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">filing their lawsuit against KRAFTON</a>, Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire haven't added anything to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">long list of events </a>that encompass this story, and it's worth asking where this suit from Unknown Worlds originates.</p>



<p>It carries many of the same allegations that KRAFTON already laid out in its own filing, that Cleveland and McGuire allegedly "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles at Unknown Worlds, which impacted development on Subnautica 2, and that the co-founders were prepared to release a sub-standard version of Subnautica 2 in the interest of earning the <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">$250 million bonus</a> that has been at the centre of this entire dispute.</p>



<p>"<em>Acting out of pure self-interest, the Key Employees pushed to release any game - even one that was underdeveloped and had received a litany of disappointing reviews - into circulation on a timeline that maximized their earnout, even if it meant disappointing Subnautica's devoted fans and damaging the franchise</em>," the suit reads. </p>



<p>Is this just KRAFTON adding more pressure and filing a second time under the Unknown Worlds name, because it can, or does the driving force of Unknown Worlds filing its own lawsuit stem from members of staff genuinely taking umbrage with their former bosses? The truth of the matter is unclear, and though we tried asking KRAFTON about the intentions behind this suit and if it aligns with the views of Unknown Worlds staff, we received no response prior to publication. We'll update this story if we do hear back.</p>



<p>In the meantime, what is clear is that we are in the long haul for this dispute, and there are some questions about this situation that we may never learn the real answers to.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-switch-2-erderee-expansion-open-world-rpg-1851774222"><i><span>Elden Ring</span></i></a> <span>is one of the most exciting </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-elden-ring-gtav-final-fantasy-1851745512"><span>third-party games coming to Nintendo Switch 2</span></a><span>. Who among us doesn’t want to get our shit rocked on the go? Well, according to folks who have played FromSoftware’s action RPG at Gamescom in Cologne, the system is apparently struggling to run the game in handheld mode, and to make matters more worrisome, Bandai Namco is reportedly not letting people record footage of it.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hq3m8UwhGM"><i><span>Nintendo Life</span></i></a> <span>posted a video on its YouTube channel discussing the port and said that while they only played the Switch 2 port for about 15 minutes, the game looks pretty good visually, but leaves a lot to be desired in terms of performance. The tutorial ran pretty well at a locked 30fps. Once they reached the open world, everything changed.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s really bad, and I understand why they don’t want you to see this, because wowie zowie, it is terrible,” </span><i><span>Nintendo Life </span></i><span>video producer Felix Sanchez said. “Of course, you’re never going to see the light of this—maybe it will just release in that state, but I can’t imagine they will do that—It was like playing </span><i><span>Ocarina of Time</span></i><span>. It was like 20 frames per second, sometimes I was like, ‘This has dropped [to] 15 frames per second.'”</span></p>

 <p><span>Sanchez says that in the Switch 2’s handheld mode, the game was “incredibly unstable” in the open-world segments, even in surprisingly static areas where few enemies were on screen at once. You can hear his full impressions below:</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="We've Played Elden Ring on Switch 2 and Have Concerns" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Hq3m8UwhGM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>So if you’re wondering why </span><i><span>Elden Ring </span></i><span>footage is conspicuously absent from the internet’s Gamescom coverage, now you know that Bandai Namco has prohibited it. The game is supposed to launch on the Switch 2 this year, but it doesn’t have a release date at the moment. It’s entirely possible the game could be delayed into 2026 to fix things up, or that things could turn around by the time it finally comes out. Whatever the case, it sounds like </span><i><span>Elden Ring</span></i><span> on Switch 2 has not made the best first impression.</span></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a> won't be leaving early access and launching in full this year, according to game director Jonathan Rogers.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with GameSpot ahead of the reveal of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-path-of-exile-2s-huge-third-edict-update-looks-to-deal-with-every-problem-upsetting-fans/1100-6534132/" data-ref-id="1100-6534132">Path of Exile 2's huge The Third Edict update</a>, which adds the ARPG's fourth campaign act, new temporary interlude acts, its first seasonal league, and more, Rogers said that despite his hopes earlier in the year, Path of Exile 2 won't fully release in 2025. That also means the game won't be going free-to-play anytime soon.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiA_IFmidOQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KiA_IFmidOQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"I definitely don't believe that's possible anymore," Rogers said. "Things have taken a bit longer than we'd hoped. Ultimately, there's two things that need to happen before we can leave early access. One of them is that we obviously need to finish the campaign. I don't think that will take too much longer. But the other one is we have to get to the point of balance where everyone is actually happy with how things are. The general opinion needs to be that we've actually got it locked in. Obviously we can't go into full release until we've sorted that out. Once those two things are true, then we'll release."</p><p dir="ltr">While The Third Edict update adds Act IV of Path of Exile 2's campaign, developer Grinding Gear Games still needs to release Acts V and VI. Rogers said that while Act V will definitely come as part of early access, it's possible Act VI's arrival would coincide with the game's full launch.</p><p dir="ltr">There are still five classes yet to be added to Path of Exile 2 as well--the Templar, Druid, Shadow, Marauder, and Duelist. One nearly made it into The Third Edict, Rogers said, but ultimately didn't make the cut.</p><p dir="ltr">"We still intended to get a class out for this one, we just didn't quite finish it in time," Rogers said. "There will definitely be a class in the next update, I'd say. I say definitely even though I probably shouldn't, but the classes unfortunately have a bit of unbounded amount of time. You can go into them thinking you know what they are and then by the time you're actually done, you've refactored a bunch of things a bunch of times and it's way harder than you expect. We had a class in mind, we did a lot of work on it. We realized, 'You know what, if we're going to finish off all these bosses and things, we can't quite finish the class,' so it ended up not happening, but we'll get there."</p><p dir="ltr">GGG has previously said it expected Path of Exile 2 to be in early access for "at least" six months. Towards the beginning of this year, GGG announced it was putting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-is-throwing-a-wrench-into-updates-for-poe-1-we-were-fooling-ourselves/1100-6529154/" data-ref-id="1100-6529154">major update on hold for the original Path of Exile</a> in order to work on updates for Path of Exile 2. At the time, Rogers said the studio "still had a lot to learn about how to run two games simultaneously."</p><p dir="ltr">For those who want to dive into Path of Exile 2 but don't want to pay for early access, the game will be holding a free weekend August 29-September 1 to coincide with the launch of The Third Edict update.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Halloween The Game - Official Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>In Halloween: The Game, players will take on the roles of either residents of Haddonfield, Illinois or The Shape himself, Michael Myers. As residents, players will need to survive, stick to the shadows, warn other residents, and hopefully reach the authorities before Michael gashes them up.</p><p>The game will offer a single-player story mode, offline bots mode, and online asymmetrical PvP. It will also include multiple maps and "authentic locations" pulled from the classic film. Last October, GameSpot spoke to several creators working in the space of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-hollywoods-iconic-monsters-kicked-off-a-horror-game-revolution/1100-6527506/" data-ref-id="1100-6527506">adapting horror movies into games</a>. Gun Media CEO, Wes Keltner, told me at that time that he wanted "to work with [Illfonic] again, 100%. So I'm hoping that we can find something that is a good fit for both our teams at the right time."</p><p>At that time, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-halloween-game-powered-by-unreal-engine-5-is-in-development-gamer-john-carpenter-is-involved/1100-6525712/" data-ref-id="1100-6525712">Halloween project built in Unreal Engine 5 had already been teased by Boss Team Games</a>, a publisher that also operates in the horror movie-to-game pipeline, having previously worked on things like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/evil-dead-the-game/" data-ref-id="5000-523752">Evil Dead</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halloween-ash-vs-evil-dead-retrorealms-double/" data-ref-id="5000-639530">RetroRealms</a>. It's unclear at this time whether this is that same Halloween game. It seems to be, in which case it would seem Boss Team is no longer involved, and instead, the Friday The 13th duo has achieved their reunion.</p><p>In the time since Friday The 13th, Illfonic has gone on to make other licensed multiplayer games such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game/" data-ref-id="5000-570897">Killer Klowns from Outer Space</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/predator-hunting-grounds/" data-ref-id="5000-496361">Predator: Hunting Grounds</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghostbusters-spirits-unleashed/" data-ref-id="5000-561168">Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed</a>. Meanwhile, Gun put out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre/" data-ref-id="5000-547380">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a>.</p><p>Stay tuned to GameSpot for much more on this upcoming horror project. </p>

<p>Is it tarnished?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has a pretty big booth at Gamescom this year, with a large chunk of areas dedicated to the glut of third-party ports coming to (or are already out on) the Switch 2.</p>
<p>One of those upcoming titles is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a>, which brings the highly-acclaimed open-world RPG from FromSoftware to Nintendo's new console. This rerelease includes the base game, the <strong>Shadow of the Erdtree</strong> DLC, new weapons, classes, and armour. So we knew we had to try it out on the newer console.</p>
<p>And, after spending time with the game in handheld mode, our man on the ground Felix has <em>some</em> concerns about performance. Unfortunately, we weren't allowed to capture any footage, including over-the-shoulder footage (Both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDiSIezfsrw&amp;ab_channel=GVG">GVG</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/elden-ring-on-switch-2-is-a-disaster-in-handheld-mode-gamescom-2025">IGN corroborate this</a>), so you'll have to use your imagination.</p>
<p>Felix talks about experiencing multiple instances of frame drops and stuttering while out in the open world, particularly after leaving the tutorial area. Of course, the demo is likely based on an earlier build of the game, so that's worth keeping in mind.</p>
<p>He also got to try out one of the new classes and explore part of the early-game map, Limgrave. So while we can't show you any footage, it's worth listening to what Felix has to say — and the lovely Alex's curious questions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just yesterday, at the time of this writing, before the Gamescom ONL 2025 craze started, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reported that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-cloud-chamber-developer-suffers-layoffs-diablo-rod-fergusson-studio-head/">BioShock 4 developer Cloud Chamber was suffering layoffs</a> and letting go of an unspecified number of staff. At the same time, we learned that former Diablo general manager, Rod Fergusson, would be taking over as the new studio head. </p>



<p>Today, Take-Two confirmed the cuts, but it was Schreier who added that the cuts would affect 80 members of Cloud Chamber's 250-person team. What's more, this <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/take-two-guts-bioshock-studio-after-a-decade-of-development?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTcxNDU0NSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzE5MzQ1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUIxVEZHUFFRN1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.zVepbosqQPRpkHaMvUcaBAlKk73_0IkMGOvNKaKU6mE">new report from Schreier</a> also reveals that BioShock 4 might not arrive until mid-to-late 2027.</p>



<p>An internal email from 2K president David Ismailer was shared with Bloomberg, in which Ismailer commented on the decision-making process behind the layoffs, but stopped short of directly saying how many people were impacted. </p>



<p>Ismailer wrote, "<em>While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a </em><em>BioShock</em> game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development."</p>



<p>"<em>I know this is tough news for everyone. If your role is being affected, you'll hear from your manager or studio leadership today with details on severance, career services and support resources. There is no easy way to do this, but we hope to do whatever we can to support you through this. I want to thank each of you for your dedication and hard work."</em></p>



<p>According to the sources Schreier spoke to, BioShock 4 had an internal release target of "<em>late 2026 or early 2027</em>," but thanks to this restructuring, that timeline has been pushed back further, and now the game might not arrive until sometime in mid-to-late 2027, if it arrives in 2027 at all. And even if it does make a 2027 release window, that'll still mean the game was in development for over a decade.</p>



<p>Schreier's report goes on to discuss a number of the issues Cloud Chamber has faced in that time, including a challenge that we've seen other studios fail to overcome, which is attempting to build a big-budget, triple-A game while also building up a new studio at the same time.</p>



<p>It's unfortunate, to say the least, to see what has become of a game that, more than a decade ago, players were extremely excited to play. It's worth wondering whether BioShock 4 will have the same impact in 2027 that it would have had in, say, 2016, which would have been three years after BioShock Infinite's launch. </p>



<p>At this point, Take-Two has far too much invested to stop now, or at least it definitely feels like we're past the point where the game could just be killed without ever launching. Hopefully, Fergusson and the remaining team can pull something together. </p>
