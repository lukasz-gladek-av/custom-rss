<p>To send off Nintendo's recent Partner Showcase, Square Enix announced some new projects, and one of them happened to be the brand new HD-2D title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>.</p>
<p>This is an action RPG where the combat will take place in real-time instead of the usual turn-based battles you might be used to in certain other titles. It's also developed by Team Asano (the developers behind series like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/bravely_default">Bravely Default</a>).</p>
<p>In case you missed it, a demo is now available on the Switch 2 and multiple other platforms, and Square Enix has issued a reminder about this along with some information about what to expect if you haven't already played it:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pivgmz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This ‘Debut Demo’ is designed to give you a sense of the exploration and action you’ll experience in the game, so expect plenty of crunchy combat, spooky caves and all kinds of secrets hidden around.</p>
<p>See a crackable wall? Blow it to smithereens with a bomb and you might discover a Secret Treasure Route- a small dungeon you can explore for valuable rewards.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ll find a Shrine of Life - these optional challenges put your combat and traversal skills to the test. Perhaps you’ll find valuable loot like magicite or money. Always remember - this is a game that rewards the curious.</p>
<p>Or, you could follow the quest markers and delve into a deadly swamp, and the Unexplored Ruins beneath. This multi-level dungeon is full of dangers - so be sure to use everything you’ve learned to find your way through.</p>

<p>There's also a <a href="https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/8393249/AoE-Demo-Survery-2025">survey where you can share your thoughts</a> about what you've experienced so far, which the developer will use to "help make the final game even better". It includes questions like why you decided to play the game, how you found out about it, the difficulty you played on, and there are also some written responses.</p>
<p>You can find out more about this new game in our previous post here on Nintendo Life. The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales launches in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-leapmove-is-a-gamified-camera-designed-to-get-kids-off-the-couch.1259286/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>LeapFrog has announced a new electronic learning system that swaps controllers for a camera. In fact, the LeapMove looks like an oversized, kid-friendly webcam, but is designed to connect to TVs like a console and get kids off the couch using educational games that require full-body movements to play. It’s reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/638490/microsoft-kinect-ghost-hunting">Xbox Kinect</a> or the PlayStation 2’s EyeToy, but simpler and much cheaper than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/705269/nex-playground-kid-friendly-gaming-console-amazon-prime-day-deal">competitors’ products</a> like the $249 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Playground-AI-Powered-Transforms-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0D2JGYX3F/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Nex Playground</a>.</p><p>The LeapMove will be available through retailers including Target, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMAGIC-CAM%2F14840114967%3F" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and Amazon for $69.99, and comes with 25 motion-based games designed for kids aged 4 to 7. It might be hard to pull the older end of that demographic away from games like Roblox, <em>Among Us</em>, and even <em>Fortnite</em>, but in addition to motion detection, the LeapMove uses its camera to make players appear as themselves or “whimsical characters” in several games, which may appeal to younger kids.</p><p>The games cover “foundational school subjects” including math, reading, and spelling, and require players to do everything from dancing around to waving their arms and even attempting to catch on-screen objects. The LeapMove connects to a TV over HDMI, and instead of rechargeable batteries it needs access to a power outlet. It can be used either sitting beneath a TV or perched atop it like a webcam using a fold-out support.</p><p>LeapFrog says additional games will be made available for the LeapMove at a later date, which can be loaded by connecting the device to a computer and using the company’s <a href="https://www.leapfrog.com/en-us/support/connect">LeapFrog Connect</a> desktop app. They won’t be free, but unlike the Nex Playground, the LeapMove doesn’t come with any subscription fees.</p><p>Parents concerned about privacy, particularly with devices that rely heavily on a camera, may appreciate that the LeapMove has no wireless connectivity. In 2018, VTech, LeapFrog’s parent company, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/8/16865652/vtech-connected-toy-ftc-fine-child-privacy">agreed to settle for a $650,000 fine</a> after the FTC alleged it collected kids’ personal information, including names, emails, and genders, through its <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.vtech.mobile.kidiconnect.useng" rel="sponsored">KidiConnect mobile app</a>. The LeapMove is completely standalone and keeps track of up to three players’ progress locally.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/717018/leapfrog-leapmove-motion-detection-gaming]]></content:encoded>

<p>Switch update confirmed</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Bandai Namco officially lifted the lid on Switch and Switch 2 versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</a> in this week's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase.</p>
<p>This game will be coming to Nintendo's platforms later this year on <strong>14th November 2025</strong> and pre-orders are available now. It follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-has-been-rated-for-switch-2">a rating for this platform earlier this year</a> in Saudi Arabia. This latest game is powered by Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>It's also mentioned in the PR how these versions of the game will come with local multiplayer and motion controls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO takes the legendary gameplay of the Budokai Tenkaichi series and raises it to whole new levels. Become a super warrior and experience the earth-shaking, limit-breaking power of Dragon Ball battles!</p>
<p>THE BIGGEST ROSTER IN HISTORY Unleash the strength of over 180 fighters from Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball Super, Dragon Ball GT, and selected Dragon Ball movies, all in the base game! Each character comes with their own signature abilities, transformations, and techniques.</p>
<p>BREATHTAKING 3D FIGHTS Engage in heart-pounding, high-speed 3D battles that stay true to the anime and video game series, with breathtaking visuals and authentic combat moves like beam clashes, rush attacks, movements too quick for the eyes to see, and planet-razing ultimate attacks.</p>
<p>RIVALS MAKE YOU STRONGER Challenge players online to test your skills, enjoy local multiplayer with up to six players on a single console, or connect multiple consoles for wireless play. Experience intense battles and become a Super Warrior with immersive motion controls using the Joy-Con™ controllers.</p>
<p>BLAZE A NEW PATH Conquer the action-packed battles from the beloved original story, or discover and unlock new encounters for your favorite Z-Fighters and more. Relive your favorite moments from the series through cutscenes you can experience from the perspectives of eight characters!</p>
<p>CREATE, PLAY, AND SHARE Recreate your favorite battles from throughout the Dragon Ball story, or set up your dream story battle with your favorite characters! Share your creations with other fans and experience the battles brought to life by imaginations around the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This title is available for <strong>$59.99</strong> digitally on the Switch and Switch 2 (or the regional equivalent), and pre-orders are once again live. There are also Deluxe and Ultimate Editions featuring Season Pass content and DLC.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the video above, there will also be an update for the Switch physical and digital versions of this game, allowing users to experience an "enhanced" version on the Switch 2 console.</p>

But later this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-multiplayer-trailer-shows-off-chaos-and-destruction-with-limp-bizkit-too/1100-6533607/" data-ref-id="1100-6533607">Battlefield 6</a> will take things even further with an overhauled map-creation toolset for the upcoming shooter. Now, DICE and EA have shared a video that offers a brief glimpse at the new Portal mode and what it's bringing to the table.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92CHDiFW0wA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/92CHDiFW0wA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The new Portal mode allows players to build, share, and play their custom maps with more options than ever before. One of the new tools is a spatial editor powered by Godot that gives creators the chance to spatially edit maps and move around preexisting elements at will. Portal also includes custom and AI scripting that lets players create unique UI and direct NPC combatants on their battlefields. Any experience made with Portal will be available to other players through the community section.</p><p dir="ltr">Portal will also include modifiers that let players change the rules of the game. That includes the ability to set up one-shot kills, closed weapons, and many others. More intriguingly, player progression and XP gain are fully enabled during Portal mode.</p><p>EA and DICE also indicated that there will be several maps added to the game post-launch. But for now, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-maps/2900-6834/" data-ref-id="2900-6834">there are nine maps</a> that will be available at launch. The locations include New York, Egypt, and Gibraltar, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-battlefield-6s-new-destruction-elements-in-action-in-this-video/1100-6530977/" data-ref-id="1100-6530977">with tons of destructible elements</a>. Players won't be able to destroy every building on the map, but there are a lot of structures that can go down and reshape the map during the course of battle.</p><p>There will be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-campaign-teaser-details-a-world-on-the-brink-of-war/1100-6533618/" data-ref-id="1100-6533618">single-player campaign</a> for Battlefield 6, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-class-system-is-a-welcome-return-to-basics/1100-6533614/" data-ref-id="1100-6533614">classic Battlefield soldier classes</a>--Assault, Medic, Support and Recon--will be back alongside class-specific weapons and gadgets.</p><p>Battlefield 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-physical-edition-retailer-bonuses/1100-6533616/" data-ref-id="1100-6533616">preorders are already live</a>, and the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">open beta will begin on August 7</a> and continue during different intervals in the month.

<p>It's scheduled to arrive in 2025</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Masahiro Sakurai's latest project <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> soars onto the Switch 2 at some point later this year.</p>
<p>While we haven't heard all that much about it since the initial announcement in April, the game has reportedly been rated in Saudi Arabia recently – receiving an age rating in this location of "7 and above" (<a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/31/kirby-air-riders-for-nintendo-switch-2-has-been-rated-in-saudi-arabia/">via My Nintendo News</a>).</p>
<p>Sakurai did provide a small update about this title earlier in July, mentioning how it was "shaping up to be something great". This also happened to be timed in with the 22nd anniversary of the original GameCube title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a>.</p>
<p>The classification for this title hopefully means a release isn't too far away. If this new Kirby racer does make its 2025 window, it will join other racing games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>.</p>
<p>Other Nintendo releases coming to the Switch this year include titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, and the Koei Tecmo project <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which was featured during this week's Partner Direct.</p>

<p>The new entry arrives this October</p>

<p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Switch 2 Partner Showcase</a> has just revealed what's ahead for the new hybrid platform in terms of third-party offerings, but it seems one series that won't be showing up any time soon is EA's popular military shooter Battlefield.</p>
<p>Eurogamer spoke to Battlefield's head Vince Zempella as part of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFGEMfyAQtI">multiplayer reveal today</a>, and it's been officially confirmed the company "doesn't currently" have plans to bring the game to Nintendo's new system.</p>
<p>The team is focused on delivering the game where the "core Battlefield audience is present", according to the same story.</p>
<p>EA's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/faq">official FAQ for Battlefield 6</a> further confirms how the new entry, which launches on <strong>10th October 2025</strong>, will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC (including the Steam, EA App, and Epic Games Store).</p>
<p>Although EA won't be delivering Battlefield 6 on the Switch 2, earlier today the third-party giant announced it would be releasing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/plants-vs-zombies-replanted">Plants Vs Zombies: Replanted</a> on the Switch and Switch 2 this October, following a series of rumours. EA will also be bringing the latest entries in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA FC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden</a> series to the new platform as well as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>This news about Battlefield follows on from Microsoft and Activision revealing the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_ghosts">Call of Duty</a> series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/yes-call-of-duty-is-still-on-the-way-to-nintendo-hardware">would be released on Nintendo platforms</a> going forward.</p>

Digital preorders are also available.</p><p>While you can preorder the Octopath Traveler physical standard edition for PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch 2, and Nintendo Switch, it's worth noting that the Switch 2 physical version is yet another Game-Key Card release. That means none of the actual game data is included on the cartridge, which instead works as physical DRM that lets you download and play the digital version of the game to your Switch 2. That said, the other three platforms all include the full game data on their physical media. The Switch 2 can play Switch 1 games, so you can purchase the Switch version of Octopath Traveler 0 if you want the game on cartridge. However, Square Enix is not offering an upgrade path for the Switch 1 version--so if you want the Switch 2 version with better performance and visual fidelity, you're stuck with the Game-Key Card or digital versions of the game.</p></div>                      </div><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Octopath Traveler 0 Digital Deluxe Edition</strong></h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>$60 | Releases December 4</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4541696-ot0_dde_ersb-7it0u0k0v%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4541696" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4541696-ot0_dde_ersb-7it0u0k0v%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4541696"></a><figcaption>Octopath Traveler 0 Digital Deluxe Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4541696-ot0_dde_ersb-7it0u0k0v%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Those who prefer digital games can also grab the $60 <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/games/octopath-traveler-0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Octopath Traveler 0 Digital Deluxe Edition</a>, which includes everything from the base game, plus a bonus pack of helpful items and--for most consoles--a digital art book.

A few weeks later, fans of classic turn-based RPGs can look forward to the Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake, which launches on PC and consoles on, Preorders for all these games are available now.

                <p>Earlier this year, EA showed off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-battlefield-6s-new-destruction-elements-in-action-in-this-video/1100-6530977/" data-ref-id="1100-6530977">some of the destructible elements</a> in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-multiplayer-trailer-shows-off-chaos-and-destruction-with-limp-bizkit-too/1100-6533607/" data-ref-id="1100-6533607">Battlefield 6</a>. That glimpse of destruction you can wreak was amplified in the recently released multiplayer trailer for the game. But if you were hoping to be able to knock down every building on the map, then you may be disappointed, because the game's Tactical Destruction system will only offer so much leeway.</p><p>EA executive vice president Vince Zampella told <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/battlefield-6/destruction-vince-zampella-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a> that the Tactical Destruction system gives player "unparalleled levels of freedom." However, he reasons that if it was possible to completely destroy all of the buildings on the map, then the system wouldn't reflect the original intentions of the dev team.</p>

<p>"We make maps very purposefully for fun, combat sight lines, and performance," said Zampella. "So if you're able to control that destruction, [it can still be] different, because you might blow up this building one time, this building another, or nothing at all. That's where the flexibility comes in. But even when they are destroyed, the map is still full. We guarantee you that the map is still fun to play. So it's about making a map and then making multiple versions of that map that are all equally balanced and fun to play."</p><p>Zampella went on to argue that too much destruction would ruin the gameplay of the map, making it less fun. He reiterated that the developers are primarily concerned with ensuring the game is fun, above all else.</p><p>EA has already revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-maps/2900-6834/" data-ref-id="2900-6834">the nine Battlefield 6 maps</a> that will be available at launch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Matt Ryan, the actor behind <a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-assassins-creed-games-worst-to-best-1844019813?_gl=1*5o1ks5*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjMwOTA2MS4yNDkuMS4xNzQyMzEwMDQyLjYwLjAuMA.."><em>Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag</em>’s</a> main character Edward Kenway, recently told a fan that they <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-voice-actor-teases-remake-1851785327">might have a reason to replay the 2013 pirate game</a>. The <em>Constantine </em>actor said this at a convention signing, and fans took this as a tease of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-4-black-flag-remake-skull-bones-1850596271">potential remake or remaster</a>. However, it sounds like Ryan wasn’t in the clear to even say this much to a fan, as Ubisoft apparently threatened legal action against him after video of the interaction spread online.</p> <p>TikTok user kylo_hd659 posted a video of them meeting with Ryan at Comic Con Manchester at his signing table. When the topic of the <em>Black Flag </em>remaster came up, Ryan explained that he didn’t realize the previous interaction was being recorded, and now that it’s put him in hot water with Ubisoft, he’s keeping his mouth shut on the matter.</p> <p>“The thing is, when that happened, someone was doing this and I was being very free and open and I didn’t know that they were actually recording me on their phone,” Ryan said. “Then the company threatened to sue me. So I say nothing.”</p>

   <p>Ryan points to the camera during this back and forth, so it seems like he’s well aware of it this time. I guess that’s one way to get the word out for people to stop asking about something you aren’t supposed to be talking about. We’ve reached out to Ubisoft for comment and will update the story if we hear back.</p> <p>While Ryan hasn’t returned to <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>or video games since <em>Black Flag</em>, he’s spent much of the decade since playing John Constantine in several DC Comics projects, both in live-action shows like <em>Legends of Tomorrow</em> and in animated shows and movies. Hey James Gunn, if you’re gonna bring the warlock to <a href="https://kotaku.com/superman-israel-palestine-woke-clark-kent-punk-rock-1851786212">the new DC Universe movies</a>, you should bring Ryan back as a personal favor to me. Please, and thank you.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-4-hours-with-battlefield-6-i%E2%80%99m-convinced-it-has-the-juice.1259157/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>My first introduction to <a href="https://kotaku.com/bf6-battlefield-6-leak-october-launch-early-access-beta-1851786824"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> came via a trailer in a large warehouse in Los Angeles. The video featured Limp Bizkit singing about a chainsaw. It was loud, bombastic, and frankly a bit embarrassing. But then I sat down and got to play over four hours of EA’s upcoming military FPS, and somehow, by the end, I was so won over by this new game that I almost forgot about Limp Bizkit. Almost.</p> <p>A lot of ink has already been spilled covering <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-crossover-skins-rick-morty-call-of-duty-1851786919"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a>, from the leaks to the multiple alpha tests to various rumors and reports claiming it might cost over $400 million. This is a game that has four different studios (previously five) working on it. A game that EA is seemingly betting the farm on. A game that is meant to return the franchise to greatness after it stumbled in past entries, like <em>BF 2042. </em></p> <p>And EA and Battlefield Studios’ plan to pull all this off with <em>Battlefield 6,</em> launching this October, is simple, but smart: <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-reveal-trailer-teaser-sp-ea-gameplay-1851786894">Make <em>Battlefield 4</em> again</a>, but with better visuals, improved gunplay, and a few ideas to freshen it up. That’s the fan favorite entry. The one people compare every other installment against. It might seem cynical to frame <em>BF6 </em>as “<em>BF4 Again</em>” but it’s practically what EA said during the on-stage event before I played the game. “A spiritual successor to <em>Battlefield 3 </em>and <em>Battlefield 4</em>” were exact words used by one developer. And as a fan of those games, I’m happy to report they (mostly) nailed it.</p>

 <p>I and a whole army of other journalists, critics, and content creators got to play a handful of maps and modes in L.A. as part of a preview event ahead of the game’s full multiplayer reveal that happened on Thursday. (Travel and accommodation were provided to <em>Kotaku&nbsp;</em>by the publisher.) This wasn’t a finished build, but what I played felt good enough to ship.</p> <p>Set in 2027, <em>BF6 </em>returns the franchise to a contemporary military setting. There are no crazy laser guns or robots. Instead, it’s M4s, Abrams tanks, shotguns, dusty streets, and frag grenades. This is a more grounded and gritty military shooter compared to recent <em>Call of Duty</em> entries.</p>

 <h2>Dangerous guns and different classes</h2> <p>Combat is loud and dangerous. The time to kill is fairly short, and headshots are extremely lethal. Every gun I used packed a punch and felt destructive. <em>Battlefield 6</em>, more than anything else, nails its gunplay and combat. Firefights are chaotic, but moving around the very dense but easy-to-navigate maps is a breeze thanks to improved controls.  You can jump out windows, slide, roll when landing, sprint while crouched, and even shoot guns while lying on your back. Even when I was getting my ass kicked by some popular streamer, I still had a good time when playing the franchise’s famous Conquest mode because moving and shooting in <em>BF6 </em>is a joy. But like in <em>BF4 </em>and <em>BF3</em>, you move slowly and deliberately in <em>BF6</em>. Characters feel heavy, as do vehicles, making combat feel less like a twitchy arena shooter and more like a digital simulation of a real war.</p> <p>Adding to that feeling of chaotic, gritty combat is the ability for any player to grab a downed player and drag them to safety before reviving them. I did this many times in my time with the game, often pulling fellow squad members out of harm’s way or out of the scope of a pesky sniper. It’s a small, simple, but surprisingly engaging mechanic that everybody I spoke to after the event loved. I expect some other games might steal it from <em>BF6 </em>in the future.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000614036" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614036"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614036">Screenshot: EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>Classes return to <em>Battlefield </em>after being absent from <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-the-kotaku-review-1848123654"><em>2042</em></a><em> </em>at launch (and then later shoved back in via a post-launch update), and they work like they did in <em>BF3/BF4</em>. You can play as Assault, Support, Engineer, and Recon. Each class has a few key abilities and traits that help make them feel different during combat.</p> <p>For example, the Assault trooper takes less fall damage and readies assault rifles quicker than anyone else, helping give them the edge in one one-on-one fights. Meanwhile, the Support trooper—my favorite—can place down chest-high bulletproof walls to provide cover, and can also provide ammo refills to teammates. They can also instantly revive players, which is faster than dragging them out of combat, but not as fun.</p> <p>Having the traditional classes return in <em>Battlefield 6 </em>is both a nostalgic return to what I loved before and also a great reminder that, yeah, this is the best way to do a class-based shooter. However, one big change here from <em>BF4 </em>and <em>BF3 </em>is that classes can now spawn with any weapon. While there are some advantages for picking the specific weapon type suited to each class—like snipers getting to reload scoped rifles without leaving aim-down-sight—this new open weapon system does rob the classes of some individuality.</p>

 <p>This is extremely noticeable in the smaller, more combat-focused modes that take place on specific sections of the larger maps. Here, a sniper becomes less useful, but the Recon troopers’ motion sensor is still nifty. So many players I fought during the event just swapped out a scoped rifle for an SMG. It ended up feeling less like <em>Battlefield 3</em> and more like a <em>Call of Duty </em>clone. Thankfully, EA says <em>BF6 </em>will ship with playlists that feature locked class weapons, which is nice, but I worry how that will split the game’s fanbase in the weeks and months after launch.</p> <h2>Lots of destruction, but smaller maps</h2> <p>On the plus side: <em>BF3 </em>tank lovers, rejoice. Your armored mechanical beasts are very powerful in <em>Battlefield 6.</em> When an enemy tank would appear, I’d panic and dive for cover or try to get as many walls between me and it as possible. And thanks to <em>BF6 </em>bringing back <em>Battlefield’s </em>beloved destruction, tanks and other vehicles can quickly turn the tide of battle by ripping holes in walls or even demolishing sections of buildings. One of the funniest moments involving destruction that I experienced involved someone using a tank to knock out the wall and floor of a building I was camping in, sending me falling below into debris and enemy gunfire.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000614037" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614037"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614037">Screenshot: EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>This is what EA is calling “Tactical Destruction,” which is the idea that levels should be extremely breakable and that destruction should not only look cool (which it does) but that it should serve a purpose. A single grenade or rocket can alter a shortcut or change up a hiding spot. I’ll need to see how other maps feel, but so far, what I’ve played has me excited to see how EA and Battlefield Studios design maps to be destructible in tactical ways.</p> <p>Speaking of maps, all of the ones in <em>BF6</em>‘s preview were smaller than what was found in <em>BF 2042</em>. This is a good thing. It means you spend less time looking for action and more time fighting other players in chaotic shootouts. The maps also look gorgeous, with lots of lovely details, most of which get destroyed by the end. I also felt like they all funneled players into firefights efficiently and didn’t feel too barren or busy.</p> <p>The devs at the event said they went back and got inspired by some of the classic maps fans love, and I can feel it. And all but one of the nine maps launching with <em>BF6 </em>are new. (The one exception is the return of Operation Firestorm.) This strikes me as the <em>BF6 </em>devs feeling confident in what they have made, and they should feel that way. These are some damn fine <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-bf2042-season-7-last-ea-motive-future-1851397390?_gl=1*au54e4*_ga*MjA2NzM0ODM3MS4xNzQ5ODUxOTU4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM5Mzg3MzEkbzE1JGcxJHQxNzUzOTQwNzgwJGoxMyRsMCRoMA.."><em>Battlefield</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>maps.</p> <p>I was sad when my four hours with <em>Battlefield 6 </em>were over. As someone who played way, way too much <em>Battlefield 3</em> and<em> Battlefield 4</em>, <em>BF6 </em>is exactly what I wanted. It’s a return to the slower, grittier, louder, and smaller digital battles I (and other fans) prefer. It’s not a confusing and overly large mess, like <em>BF 2042</em>. Instead, <em>BF6 </em>feels like a refined, improved, and perfected version of a game people already loved. It might not be the most original or fresh spin on <em>Battlefield</em>, and that might limit how many new players it brings in. But what’s here is <em>really </em>good, and I can’t wait to play more when <em>Battlefield 6</em> arrives on October 10. Hopefully, I won’t have to listen to Limp Bizkit before I play again.</p> <p>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-key-cards-persona-3-octopath-1851787455</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-game-key-card-showcase-leaves-fans-severely-underwhelmed.1259151/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The line between a bad video game showcase and a great one can be exceedingly slim. Often it only takes one or two surprise reveals targeting the right genres and nostalgia centers for most players to come away with generally positive vibes. The July Nintendo Direct failed on that count. It didn’t help that a fresh flood of Switch 2 game key cards is sapping even some of the most diehard fans of any surplus enthusiasm.</p> <p>The<em> Mario</em> maker’s revelation that Thursday’s presentation would be a “Partner Showcase” instead of an all-out Nintendo Direct was the first blow to ambient online hype levels. Okay, no new 3D<em> Mario</em> announcements or<em> Metroid Prime 4</em> release date. But hey, at least fans could count on some major third-party reveals, including another raft of big ports. Surely Microsoft, rumored to be bringing the big guns to Switch 2 any day now, would show up.</p> <p>Alas, no. Instead, the July Direct offered only a few smaller new game announcements—<em>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection, Octopath Traveler 0</em>, and <em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em>—and mostly spent its time rehashing stuff we already knew about like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>Borderlands 4</em>, <em>Madden 26</em>, and <em>FC Sports 26</em>. Even a quick look at the next <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> felt thrown together and supremely underwhelming. And there was no big “oh shit!” moment like, say, <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> also coming to Switch 2.</p>

   <p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1me1wgt/gotta_say_that_rat_game_dont_look_half_bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">litany of Switch 2 fan wish-casting</a> prior to the showcase had gotten out of control, but not even one of the numerous highly anticipated third-party updates made it into the showcase. No more footage of<em> Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, no release date for <em>Hades 2</em>, and no mention of the rumored <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> port. Switch 2 versions of other recent blockbusters were also MIA. No surprise port of <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, or <em>Lies of P</em>. There weren’t even updates on when players will be able to get their hands on the Switch 2 versions of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> or <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p> <p><em>Chillin’ by the Fire</em>, one of the more unusual games announced during the Direct, now serves as the unlikely encapsulation of this disappointment. It’s a multiplayer game where you sit around a campfire with friends. “Your goal: Campfire Level 10,” reads the description. “The sense of accomplishment you feel when the firebed turns into bright red embers and the pillars of flame illuminate the night sky is more powerful than any scoreboard.” The gimmick is that it works with webcams to put players’ faces around the campfire. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1me35oe/peak_nintendo_switch2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fans were not impressed</a>.</p>

 <p>A Switch 2 port of last year’s <em>Persona 3: Reload</em>, one of the better pieces of news from the event, highlights the other prong of player disappointment. Diehard Nintendo fans like their physical games, RPG players more than most, but the physical version of<em> Persona 3</em> is the latest to rely on a game key card instead of an actual cartridge with the game on it. It was far from the only game key card game announced during the Direct.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo Game-Key Card Partner Showcase 😭 <a href="https://t.co/EUdnlDWPrq">pic.twitter.com/EUdnlDWPrq</a></p> <p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1950954931621630231?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> is key card only too, as well as <em>Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac</em>. <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is a game key card on Switch 2, but fortunately it’s also coming to the original Switch where it will have a standard cartridge. Unfortunately, that version of the game <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lvbir7e7lc2l" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will not have an upgrade path</a> to the Switch 2 version, so anyone who opts for the only physical version of the game on a Nintendo platform won’t be able to take advantage of any upgraded performance from the Switch 2 version.</p>

 <p>There are still notable exceptions when it comes to the third-party publishers opting to cut corners with game key cards. At launch, the big one was<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em>, which fit the entire base game and its massive expansion on a 64GB card. <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> is another, as is <em>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion </em>which arrives in September. It can be done, and it’s unfortunate to see many of the publishers of games whose audiences care the most about that sort of the thing being precisely the ones to opt out. No one cares if<em> Madden 26</em> comes on the cartridge, but why is <em>Final Fantasy Tactics </em>on Switch 2 <a href="https://store.jp.square-enix.com/item/NXS_J_A43UA.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just a download code in a box</a>?</p> <p>Does any of this matter to the average Switch 2 owner? Probably not. The console is good and there will be no shortage of games to play this fall. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/708909/nintendo-switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-exclusive-release-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo’s slow-drip strategy</a> is, all things considered, probably the smart thing to do. God knows there are more than enough games to keep everyone busy until long after they become worm food. But the last few years of the Switch 1 weren’t exactly blowing fans’ lids off, and the Switch 2’s first summer, with the notable exception of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, has been a bit of a snoozefest. The first Nintendo Direct since the Switch 2 launched could have jolted fans back awake. Instead, the post-launch lull continues.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The upcoming remake of <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em> is certainly ambitious. Taking one of the most elaborate gaming projects of the early 2000s and sprucing it up with modern third-person stealth and shooter mechanics along with a fresh coat of graphical paint is no easy task, and the challenges involved go well beyond the technical. The <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> games are pretty sacred works of art in gaming history, so diehard fans are certain to shine a critical eye on this game once it releases. But there’s another person who may also be interested in what’s going on with this project: Hideo Kojima, the man who wrote and directed the original game. Well, if you thought Kojima was going to be all in on sneaking around in the jungles and chomping on snakes in 2025, you’re wrong.</p> <p>Speaking with writer Kevin Nguyen in a piece for <a href="https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canadian fashion retailer Ssense</a> (<a href="https://www.ssense.com/en-us/women/product/alexander-mcqueen/black-cobweb-lace-miniskirt/17724101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1700 bucks for a miniskirt</a>, anyone?) Kojima discusses a range of topics, from needing eye surgery right as the pandemic hit to gaining inspiration from art installations and what he thinks of modern games, which overall he seems to find very predictable. One notable modern game that gets a mention is the upcoming remake of <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>. Asked point blank if he’ll play it, Kojima is reported to have laughed before saying, “No, I won’t.”</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Metal Gear Solid Δ: Snake Eater - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sKMayCD1u3w?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Now to be clear, in the same interview, Kojima also expresses that he simply doesn’t have time to play many games right now. The dude’s busy being the enigmatic creative wildman that he is, and so time he could spend playing games is spent seeking out fine art and, naturally, watching films. He’s also critical of the industry in general, noting we’re in a period of perpetual studio closures and even taking a shot at Summer Games Fest, which he describes as endless reels of the same “visuals and systems” to portray a power fantasy of fighting monsters, aliens, and unnamed soldiers in a perpetual war. To make things worse, Kojima is somewhat unimpressed with the experience (or lack thereof) some studios have with military weaponry. Conducting research for his own games about war and violence, Kojima “learned so many ways to kill people,” he told Nguyen. So for Kojima, it’s not just that most games these days are just power fantasies; they’re also seemingly not interested in learning from what real war and violence tends to look like.</p>

 <p>It’s not surprising that Kojima doesn’t seem too excited about playing <em>MGS3</em>’s upcoming remake. In fact, the interview speculates that the legendary game developer is still affected by the rough split between himself and Konami. The piece describes <em>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</em>, which was developed in his final years with the publisher, as “pushed out” and “unfinished,” something fans have long debated based on the odd narrative structure of <em>The Phantom Pain</em> and the presence of <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/metal-gear-solid-5-new-leak-reignites-chapter-3-mission-51-theories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unfinished third chapter</a> which might’ve tied up some ill-fitting loose ends presented to the player at the game’s conclusion. Then again, maybe it was simply something Kojima chose to leave on the cutting room floor. We may never know.</p> <p>Kojima’s a serial internet poster, quick to share many opinions on films, games, and other creative works. But it looks like he probably won’t be talking up the upcoming <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> on his Bluesky timeline.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dead-take-ben-starr-neil-newbon-live-action-horror-game-1851785456"><em>Dead Take</em></a>, a horror FMV game from <a href="https://kotaku.com/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-release-date-abubakar-salim-1851426666"><em>Tales of Kenzera</em></a><em> </em>developer Surgent Studios, starts with a disclaimer that its story of unbridled Hollywood ego taken to its most terrifying extreme is a “work of fiction not intended to reference or depict any actual people, places, events, or other entities in the real world.” This is the same legal ass-covering that many artistic works employ to avoid lawsuits in the event that someone out there thinks the story reflects their own actions or experiences a little too closely, but it stuck with me when I played through the six-hour escape room psychological drama. Its tale of the cutthroat, vindictive side of the entertainment industry may be oozing true crime flair, but outside of the jump scares and darker turns, is the story it tells really <em>that </em>different from any real-life horror story you might have heard about the challenges struggling artistss sometimes face when they’re trying to make it?</p> <p>If you want a game to talk about the trials and tribulations of actors, it’s worth having some incredible talent to get the message across. <em>Dead Take </em>stars <em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> lead Ben Starr and Astarion from <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> himself, Neil Newbon, as two struggling(?) actor friends(?), Vinny Monroe and Chase Lowry. Both actors auditioned for a role in the latest movie by visionary director Duke Cain, but Vinny was the one who landed the job. While Chase is clearly not thrilled by this turn of events, he and Vinny seem to still be on good terms, up until Vinny stops answering his phone after a party at Cain’s luxurious mansion. Chase, in an effort to find his friend, goes to Cain’s home and finds only the aftermath of a party long over.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614055" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614055"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614055">Screenshot: Surgent Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Most of <em>Dead Take </em>plays out as a kind of large-scale escape room. Cain’s mansion is full of locked rooms with mysteries and unpleasant answers on the other side. The game is a mostly solitary affair, as Chase seems to be the only soul in the building, but Starr, Newbon, and a few other surprising big actors in the video game space get some real face time through found footage. So even if Chase is alone, every supporting character’s presence is still felt in their absence. There are plenty of text logs and environmental cues that give you a sense of what’s going on, but the bulk of the story is told through FMV video files you search for and watch in Cain’s lavish home theater. There are some puzzles even within that, some requiring you to use video editing software to find hidden footage within the files you’ve already discovered. It’s nothing as demanding as what you find in a Sam Barlow game like <em>Her Story </em>or <em>Immortality</em>, but it’s just enough to make you feel like even the videos you find aren’t the full story, and that there are hidden meanings to be found within even the most innocuous footage.</p>

 <p>Starr’s performance is the standout for me. Vinny is a driven but privileged nepo baby who is drinking Cain’s Kool-Aid as if the man’s films were plopped into theaters by Christ himself. But that’s not even a character flaw that’s specific to him. Everyone<em> </em>in <em>Dead Take </em>is lapping up everything this man puts down, and they’re willing to sabotage others to bask in his light.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614056" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614056"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614056">Screenshot: Surgent Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>We’re seeing this all through Chase’s eyes, and his voyeuristic role in this whole ordeal means we see more of Vinny’s character than probably anyone else, with much of the footage we see of Chase being taken from his initial, unsuccessful audition. <em>Dead Take </em>has the perspective of someone who has been pushed out or denied entry into a sacred, elite space, and by god, it sure speaks to the feeling of trying to break into a competitive artistic field where certain auteurs are put on a pedestal by just about everyone. Yeah, this is the kind of shit Hollywood has to deal with, but it’s also universally applicable to most creative industries. Whether you’re an actor, an artist, a musician, or hell, even a journalist, there’s a perception that there’s an in-crowd and that some people are so legendary that they cannot be so much as be questioned. To say a word against them is to incur their wrath, and that of the people who stand to gain something by being in their proximity. <em>Dead Take</em>’s horrific vision of these ideas is extreme, but it’s rooted in something so real that I had as much of a visceral reaction to the notes I found as I did to any of the more straightforward horrors I encountered in the self-aggrandizing museum Cain calls a home. I won’t spoil some of the mysteries I uncovered, but suffice it to say, <em>Dead Take</em>’s rancid vibes don’t just come from the tense, isolating atmosphere.</p>

 <p>All that being said, the more straightforward scares are my biggest issue with <em>Dead Take</em>. I can handle a jump scare. I can handle two, even. My problem is that <em>Dead Take</em>’s use of them feels incredibly cheap and artificial. I know it’s currently in vogue to point out that “good” or “elevated” horror doesn’t rely on loud bangs and creepy monsters jumping out of walls to scare a viewer or player. While I think those critiques are often overblown and can carry an air of pretentious elitism, almost all of <em>Dead Take</em>’s jump scares are sudden distorted visions of Starr’s screaming face that appear on the screen without warning or any real diegetic context. This happens over and over, with increasing frequency as the game goes on, and I got pretty sick of it by the time I reached the final sequence. Sure, I could charitably read these as manifestations of Chase’s gradually decaying psyche, but they become so frequent and yet impossible to anticipate or connect to anything specific happening in the game that eventually, they no longer feel like real scares rooted in the world you’re moving through. All they did for me was disrupt my nervous system to the point where I had to brace myself every time I walked into a room, and eventually, I had to pause the game before I moved on because I knew I’d probably get a random bit of Starr screaming at me while I’m just trying to find a key or a USB stick.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614057" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614057"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614057">Screenshot: Surgent Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s a shame those stuttering screams are littered throughout a game I was otherwise drawn into. If you have the tolerance for jump scares, especially ones that have no real basis in the world, have at it. For everyone else, you might need to take some breaks walking through Cain’s mansion like I did, but once you’re past them, there’s a pretty compelling escape room mystery here, elevated by great performances from its two leads. <em>Dead Take </em>is scariest when it’s rooted in something real, and even if there’s a disclaimer assuring everyone it’s not based on anyone specific, know that Duke Cains walk among us.</p>       </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dead-take-review-ben-starr-neil-newbon-horror-game-1851787439]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Square Enix lived up to its reputation <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-square-enix-octopath-traveler-2-forspoken-1849531112">for terrible game names</a> during <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-july-2025-octopath-elliot-star-wars-1851787392">the July Nintendo Direct</a>, but somehow an action-RPG titled <em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em> wasn’t the most absurd part of the showcase. That came when the publisher revealed the name of the world in which the HD-2D adventure takes place: “Philabieldia.”</p> <p>They even made some <a href="https://youtu.be/gZoLrfLcIVg?t=1411" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poor presenter</a> say the name out loud. “This is Philabieldia, a continent overrun by beast tribes,” she said with gusto. Square Enix has really come out of the gate swinging on Switch 2.<em> Bravely Default: Flying Fairy</em>, an HD remaster of <em>Bravely Second: End Layer</em>, was a launch game for the new console. Now it’s back with <em>The Adventures of Elliot</em>, which already has a demo free to try on the eShop.</p> <p>But “Philabieldia” takes it to another level. As a native of the City of Brotherly Love’s greater metro area, I feel personally attacked. And confused. Are we being trolled or are the Square Enix localizers for real right now? I am not the only one with questions.</p>

I mean, it’s not just that Philabieldia looks like someone said “this edible ain’t shit” moments before trying to explain who won the Super Bowl last year. It’s also, on its own, completely divorced from the real-world context, just an awful thing to try and pronounce.</p> <p><em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em> looks like a cool game even if it doesn’t <em>sound</em> like one. I can’t wait to meet its final boss who’s probably a boxer named Ricky or something.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-ii-impressions-rpg-partitio-osvald-1850179725">A third <em>Octopath Traveler </em>game</a> is on the way and the Square Enix JRPG series looks as stunningly retro as ever. This one is called <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> and includes a bunch of new features. It also looks perfectly positioned to once again trick me into thinking I will fall in love with these games.</p> <p>Revealed during today’s Nintendo Direct, <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> will hit Switch 1 and Switch 2 on December 4 and tell the story of a world on the brink of collapse that must be rebuilt (and which is seemingly <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/octopath-traveler-0">based on the 2022 mobile spin-off <em>Champions of the Continent</em></a>). Players will still go around collecting party members and grinding through turn-based battles, but this time their own personalized character will be the star of the show. New base-building mechanics will also add some light life management sim aspects to the formula, it seems.</p> <p>Most importantly, however, the HD-2D pixel art still looks incredible. Here’s the trailer:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0 – Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase 7.31.2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ENHXHzvMx-g?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><em>Octopath Traveler </em>should be the prefect series for me. I grew up on 8-bit and 16-bit games. I was obsessed with SNES RPGs. I’ve played <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, the most direct inspiration for the <em>Octopath games</em>, at least a dozen times. But try as I may, my appreciation, admiration, and respect for the <em>Octopath</em> games has never given way to being truly in love with them. I play a bunch, mostly out of a feeling of duty, and then eventually bounce off. They can be nice JRPG comfort food but never felt like anything more to me.</p> <p><em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is definitely going to be the one to fix that though, I can feel it. This it the one that will convert me into a true believer rather than just a sympathetic skeptic. I will definitely <em>not</em> buy <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em>, play it for 10 hours, and then never put the game back in my Switch 2. This time will be different. <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> will fix me. I can’t wait to order it, gift wrap it, and leave it under the Christmas tree just waiting to not break my heart on Christmas Day.</p>

              <p><em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, the from-the-ground-up remake of the original PS2 RPG, is <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-elden-ring-gtav-final-fantasy-1851745512?_gl=1*xmp4lt*_ga*MTMxODc3NjkwMi4xNzI1Njc2NzM3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM5NjU5OTAkbzM4MCRnMSR0MTc1Mzk2Njg5NyRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">coming to Switch 2</a>. Atlus announced the port on today’s Nintendo Direct partner showcase, and it’s coming to the system pretty soon. The port will launch on Nintendo’s system on October 23, with both physical and digital versions.</p> <p>Pre-orders for <em>Persona 3 Reload </em>will begin later today, but at the moment it’s not entirely clear if the Switch 2 version will also include <a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-answer-episode-aigis-review-dlc-1851643562"><em>The Answer</em></a>, the playable epilogue starring the Persona-summoning android Aigis. The trailer shown during the Direct only contained footage of the base game, but I imagine we’ll know more later when pre-orders go live.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Persona 3 Reload – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hVcHF5_UtM0?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>When I first played the original <em>Persona 3</em>, I did so on my PlayStation Vita by playing the <em>Persona 3 Portable </em>edition. While I adored <em>Reload </em>on PS5, I was constantly yearning for a Switch version that would let me play it in bed or on the go. These games are really suited for handheld play, but we haven’t had a mainline <em>Persona </em>game launch on a handheld since <em>Persona 4 Golden</em>, though plenty of spin-offs have come to mobile, Switch, and Vita. <em>Persona 5 Royal </em>was eventually ported to the Switch, and I still recommend people play it there if they have a chance. It’s just easier to chip away at a 100-hour game if you’re not tethered to a TV or your PC. Now, <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-demo-akihiko-junpei-social-link-1851160706">“definitive” edition</a> of the best game in the series, is coming to Switch 2. If you’ve been waiting to jump on the remake, this will hopefully be the place to play it.

              <p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> is effectively <em>Budokai Tenkaichi 4</em>, bringing the hit manga and anime to modern consoles with better graphics and fresh levels of fan service. It seemed like only a matter of time <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-is-almost-certainly-coming-t-1851778176">before it arrived on Switch 2</a>, but I didn’t expect to see it on Nintendo’s older hardware as well.</p> <p>The company announced in its latest Nintendo Direct that <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> will arrive on both Switch consoles on November 14. That includes single-player story campaigns, online battles, and the scenario creator mode where fans cook up their own wild battles for one another to play. I’m still curious to see how it runs on the hardware considering some of the framerate and graphical issues that exist even on PS5 and Xbox Series X.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO –Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch &amp; Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bx1bXpseMas?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>While <em>Sparking Zero</em> was one of last year’s bestselling games, fan energy around the game has cooled in recent months <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1k1cb7c/if_this_is_the_real_dlc_then_i_really_dont_see/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as they wait on delayed DLC</a> and grapple with the ongoing shortcomings in the base game, including a somewhat shallow and frustrating branching episode battle mode. Plus, despite the gargantuan roster, there are still plenty of fan favorite characters and transformations that haven’t yet made it into<em> Sparking Zero</em>, if they ever will.</p> <p>Even so, it’ll be nice to finally have the game on Nintendo’s handheld hybrid system and, perhaps even more importantly, a fresh influx of new and non-jaded players into the online battle mode. A lack of balance has led ranked play to stagnate, but having more players in casual quick matches who just want to have fun and mess around with all of <em>Sparking Zero</em>’s myriad matchups will be great. Even better would be seeing the game get some features unique to Switch 2, like local wireless GameShare with other nearby Switches.</p>
