                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>'s Festival of the Lost 2024 is right around the corner. Arriving a bit later than usual, Halloween's celebration across the solar system promises some interesting surprises, from new masks to a slight rework of the event compared to previous years. If you're wondering what the armor ornaments look like, developer Bungie <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid_10_24_2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has shared details</a> about them, too.</p><p>Here's everything you can expect from Festival of the Lost 2024 in Destiny 2, including start times, masks, and the available rewards. We can't guarantee you'll be safe from jumpscares, though.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_start_date">Festival of the Lost 2024 start date</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_start_Festival_of_the_Lost_2024">How to start Festival of the Lost 2024</a></li><li><a href="#Do_you_still_need_Spectral_Pages_in_Festival_of_the_Lost_">Do you still need Spectral Pages in Festival of the Lost?</a></li><li><a href="#Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_masks_list">Festival of the Lost 2024 masks list</a></li><li><a href="#What_else_is_new_in_Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_">What else is new in Festival of the Lost 2024?</a></li><li><a href="#Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_rewards">Festival of the Lost 2024 rewards</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_start_date">Festival of the Lost 2024 start date</h2><p>Festival of the Lost 2024 is kicking off after the weekly Destiny 2 reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET on October 29. The event comes to an end with the weekly reset on November 12.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390894-fotl_eva_compressed.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390894" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390894-fotl_eva_compressed.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390894"></a><figcaption>Don't miss Destiny's annual Halloween party.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390894-fotl_eva_compressed.jpg"></figure><p>It's a bit later compared to last year's edition, which started on October 17, but the scary vibes are the same.</p><h2 id="How_to_start_Festival_of_the_Lost_2024">How to start Festival of the Lost 2024</h2><p>Eva Levante will return to Festival of the Lost. As in previous years, you'll stumble upon her in the Tower. After a quick introductory quest and some candy delivery, you'll be all set to start earning rewards and wearing some cool masks.</p><h2 id="Do_you_still_need_Spectral_Pages_in_Festival_of_the_Lost_">Do you still need Spectral Pages in Festival of the Lost?</h2><p>If you were used to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-how-to-farm-spectral-pages-quickly-during-festival-of-the-lost/1100-6518479/" data-ref-id="1100-6518479">farming Spectral Pages</a>, well, that's in the past. Bungie has announced that players no longer need to collect the item to complete chapters of the Book of the Forgotten. You only need Manifested Pages.</p><p>Alongside chests in Haunted Sectors, Manifested Pages will drop from "many different sources while you're wearing a mask," said Bungie. We'll have to wait until the event kicks off to confirm what the developer is referring to, although it's safe to assume it might be related to other activities aside from Haunted Sectors, which will come in handy.</p><h2 id="Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_masks_list">Festival of the Lost 2024 masks list</h2><p>It seems the celebrations around the release of Destiny 2 The Final Shape are still ongoing, as this year's Festival of the Lost is debuting seven new masks. Bungie also mentioned that masks found from Haunted Sectors will roll with higher stats, while the ones from Expert Haunted Sectors will have both high stats and "spikey rolls" with them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390893-destiny2festivalofthelost2024guide.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390893" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390893-destiny2festivalofthelost2024guide.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390893"></a><figcaption>Festival of the Lost 2024 masks</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390893-destiny2festivalofthelost2024guide.jpg"></figure><p>Below is the list of masks in Festival of the Lost 2024 (official names TBC):</p><ul><li>Cayde-6 Mask</li><li>Witness Mask</li><li>Tower Staff</li><li>Kadi 55-30 Mask</li><li>Thrall Mask</li><li>Runner Mask</li><li>Nezarec Mask</li><li>Ghost Mask</li></ul><h2 id="What_else_is_new_in_Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_">What else is new in Festival of the Lost 2024?</h2><p>Alongside the removal of Spectral Pages, there are a few tweaks and additions worth considering before diving into Festival of the Lost 2024.</p><p>Like in previous years, in order to earn Eerie Engrams, Haunted Sectors are your best bet. Keep in mind that you'll be able to grab more Eerie Engrams in Expert Haunted Sectors, as they know have a chance to drop an additional engram.</p><p>In the weapons department, you can expect a familiar lineup of Festival of the Lost guns, only with updated perk pools. Bungie doesn't want to share too many details, except for a few perk combinations as a tease:</p><ul><li><strong>Mechabre (Aggressive Arc Sniper Rifle):</strong> Lone Wolf in column 3, Closing Time in column 4, and Search Party as the origin trait.</li><li><strong>Jurassic Green (Rapid-Fire Solar Pulse)</strong>: Loose Change in column 3, Incandescent in column 4, Search Party, Field Tested as origin traits.</li><li><strong>Braytech Werewolf (Precision Kinetic Auto Rifle)</strong>: Rewind Rounds in column 3, Onslaught in column 4, and Search Party as the origin trait.</li><li><strong>Acosmic (Rapid-Fire Void Grenade Launcher)</strong>: Withering Gaze in column 3, Bait and Switch in column 4, and Search Party, Nadie as the origin traits.</li></ul><p>Also, you're now able to buy an Exotic class item directly from Eva, basically avoiding the need to complete the Dual Destiny quest in Destiny 2. For this, you'll need to own The Final Shape expansion, but know that you won't be able to attune the class items you buy from Eva. Unless you complete Dual Destiny, you'll only get random rolls. But hey, luck might be on your side.</p><h2 id="Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_rewards">Festival of the Lost 2024 rewards</h2><p>Your candy-gathering efforts won't be for naught, as there'll be quite a few rewards to earn during Destiny 2's Halloween event.</p><p>Below are all of the Festival of the Lost 2024 rewards:</p><ul><li>Wizard Armor Ornaments for a scary vibe.</li><li>The return of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-the-superblack-shader-in-destiny-2/1100-6522602/" data-ref-id="1100-6522602">Superblack shader</a>.</li><li>Arcane Embrace as a new weapon: The shotgun has Arc element and a Heavy Burst subtype, so it fires a hard-hitting, two-round burst while slightly reducing flinching from incoming fire while aiming. As teased by Bungie, a potential combo for the weapon is Fourth Times the Charm in column 3, Precision Instrument in column 4, and Search Party in origin trait.</li><li>Lost Memento is also returning as a reward, and you'll be able to hold up to three at a time. You can earn it from completing the Twilight Triumph or as a random drop from focusing any items.</li><li>You can also earn the new Spectral Carapace emblem for completing the Twilight Triumph.</li></ul><p>Have fun in this year's Festival of the Lost!</p>

However, unlike the massive overhauls seen in those other remakes, this new version of Resident Evil 4 is a much more faithful adaptation.</p><p dir="ltr">In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/" data-ref-id="1900-6418047">GameSpot's Resident Evil 4 review</a>, Kurt Indovina awarded the game a 10/10, saying that the remake "stands as a re-envisioning of its past rather than a replication of it. In doing this, it raises the bar for what a good remake is and at the same time, preserves Resident Evil 4's legacy as a genre-defining experience and one of the greatest games of all time."</p><p dir="ltr">It was the first of Capcom's Resident Evil remakes to receive a physical release for PS5, but soon it will have company.

But if you're specifically interested in picking up a Call of Duty-themed controller, the most notable new release is the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGY5KCYL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Victrix Pro BFG's new Call of Duty Field Op Edition</a></strong> for PlayStation and PC. This is the latest special-edition variant of Victrix's superb modular controller, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-ps5-controller/1100-6494188/" data-ref-id="1100-6494188">our favorite third-party gamepad for PS5</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGY5KCYL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Victrix Pro BFG Field Op Edition</a> is available for $200 at Amazon, but you'll also want to check out last year's <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Triggers-Joystick-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CKH24NK4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Midnight Mask Edition</a></strong>, as Amazon has knocked $20 from its price to celebrate the launch of Black Ops 6. If you're interested in the Pro BFG after reading this article, it's worth noting the standard colors of the Pro BFG, white and black, are available for even less right now. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Triggers-Joystick-Gaming-Console/dp/B0B9LDPXBF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original black edition is only $145</a>, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Triggers-Joystick-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CRZ7KFKZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white is $155</a>.

With the included tool, you can quickly remove the faceplates covering the controls and shift the layout around. This allows you to have aligned analog sticks (PlayStation style) or offset (Xbox style). It also comes with four thumbstick caps, four stick grates, and three D-pad styles, including the solid square design shown above as well as more traditional eight- and four-way styles.</p><p>The right analog stick and face buttons can be swapped out for a six-button microswitch fight pad. Naturally, this won't be helpful for Call of Duty, but if you like fighting games, it's a great inclusion. It's worth noting Victrix also released a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Triggers-Joystick-Gaming-Console/dp/B0D7WYPB3V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tekken 8 Edition of the Pro BFG</a> in July.</p><p>The Pro BFG also has four built-in back triggers that can be remapped on the fly and trigger locks for R2 and L2 with five different stopping points. You can save up to three custom profiles that can be cycled through on the fly.</p><p>You can also remap inputs using the Victrix Control Hub on PC. You have more control over your experience with the app, but unfortunately it's only available for PC. That said, adjustments save to the controller, so as long as you have a PC, you can still take advantage of features such as tweaking stick and trigger sensitivity, setting up analog stick dead zones, and adjusting the sound profile. The Pro BFG has built-in audio that gives you in-depth control over your headset audio experience. Keep in mind you'll need to connect your headset to the 3.5mm jack on the bottom of the controller.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390887-victrixcustomization.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390887" data-ratio="1" data-width="710" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390887-victrixcustomization.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390887"></a><figcaption>Victrix Pro BFG comes with hot-swappable components</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390887-victrixcustomization.jpg"></figure><p>The caveat to opting for a third-party PlayStation 5 controller is that you lose PlayStation's adaptive trigger and haptics tech as well as motion controls. If you're not okay with those losses, the only pro-style controller for you is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense-Edge-Wireless-Controller-5/dp/B0BSYFB99D?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation's DualSense Edge ($200)</a>. Some PS5 games make the DualSense's unique features a core component of the experience, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Astro-Bot-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B0D5SM3K4Q?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Astro Bot</a>--you definitely want to play the PS5's wonderful platformer with a DualSense controller.</p><p>The Pro BFG offers <em>substantially </em>better battery life than DualSense controllers, though. You can get close to 20 hours on a full charge in our experience. And if you want a PlayStation controller with the ergonomics of an Xbox controller, the Pro BFG is the best option.</p><p>It syncs wireless to your PS5, PS4, and PC with a 2.4GHz USB dongle. Alternatively, you use the lengthy, braided USB to USB-C cable for a hardwired connection. All of the Pro BFG's accessories have dedicated slots inside the included hardshell carrying case.</p><p>The Pro BFG is also available in white and black models for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ3NL4QG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC for $180</a>.

			<p>PlayStation 5 Pro patches for the two games released so far on the base model by Insomniac introduce graphical toggles that allow users to customize their experience further in the vein of PC gaming.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro patches for Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart and Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which both went live today, introduce new Performance Pro and Fidelity Pro modes, which provide, respectively, 60 FPS gameplay with the same image quality of the standard fidelity mode through PSSR and all ray tracing features, and 30 FPS gameplay and new ray tracing features, which can be tuned individually to reach higher intermediate frame rates when using VRR and 120 Hz Display mode.</p>
<p>The new ray tracing options introduced by the PlayStation 5 Pro Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart patch are RT Reflections and RT Ambient Occlusion, while Marvel's Spider-Man gets RT Key Light Shadows, which uses ray tracing to calculate sun shadows at mid- to distance, replacing cascaded shadow maps, RT Reflections and Interiors, and RT Ambient Occlusion. More details on the patches and the new options they introduce can be found <a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/31344384505101-Version-1-005-000-Release-Notes">here</a> for Rift Apart and <a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/31344021452941-Version-1-004-000-Release-Notes">here</a> for Spider-Man 2.</p>
<p>The two Insomniac-developed games aren't the only ones that received PlayStation 5 Pro patches ahead of the system's release on November 7th. Other games that were already patched include <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-ps5-pro-patch/">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-playstation-5-pro-ray-tracing/">Alan Wake 2.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-version-1004000-adds-new-graphics-modes-and-ray-tracing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac Games has published an update for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 that allows players to take advantage of the graphics and performance options for the upcoming PlayStation 5 Pro.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sony developer announced <a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/31344021452941-Version-1-004-000-Release-Notes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the update</u></a>, along with <a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/31344384505101-Version-1-005-000-Release-Notes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a similar update for 2021’s Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</u></a>, on <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/1849857089495265401" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>social media</u></a> today. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 patch 1.004 is almost entirely focused granting owners of the soon-to-release console additional visual options to ensure they are either swinging through New York City with improved graphics or a higher framerate.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/09/09/screenshot-43-1631220042144.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Insomniac deploys PS5 Pro updates for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac says that the default will be set to Performance Pro mode, which targets 60fps “while retaining the image quality of the standard Fidelity mode through use of PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR).” This is the setting that the team recommends, as it also toggles on all ray-tracing (RT) features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the flip side is the 30fps Fidelity Pro mode. Insomniac says this is the visual option for those looking to “experiment” with some of the new ray-tracing features offered by the PS5 Pro, which can be tuned to each player’s preference. With Fidelity Pro, you may also notice that pedestrian and traffic density may be increased in a few locations in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, with hair detail also getting a bump.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Update 1.004 also comes with a trio of new graphical toggles: RT Key Light Shadows, RT Reflections &amp; Interiors, and RT Ambient Occlusion. All three tools are for those who like to tailor their gaming experiences right down to the finest details, though Insomniac warns that you’ll notice changes in certain portions of New York more than others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect many of the same PS5 Pro enhancements if you check out Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart update 1.005, too, including a default Performance Pro mode and Fidelity Pro mode. This patch also fixes “missing fur wetness” in some of the cinematics that take place on Corson V.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PS5 5 Pro won’t be out for another few weeks, but it’s still caused quite the stir among fans of Sony’s gaming endeavors since the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-officially-revealed-gamescom-2024"><u>pulled back the curtain last month</u></a>. The device was revealed to cost <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/poll-is-the-playstation-5-pro-too-expensive"><u>a steep $700</u></a>, drawing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/internet-reacts-to-ps5-pro-700-price-point-with-shock"><u>criticism from those who believe the upgrade isn’t worth the price</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note: This review specifically covers the Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. For our thoughts on the other modes, see our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review"><em>single-player campaign review</em></a><em> or our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review"><u><em>multiplayer review in progress</em></u></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You ever wonder how we got here? Not in an existential, “where did we come from?” kind of way, but more specifically “how did a one-off, co-op survival mode in a video game that used to put quotes about the horrors of war on screen when you died turn into <em>this</em>?” 16 years on, it’s hard to reconcile what the original Nazi Zombies mode from 2008’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/11/12/call-of-duty-world-at-war-review"><u>World at War</u></a> used to be with the outrageous, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/01/resident-evil-6-review"><u>Resident Evil 6</u></a>-inspired campfest I spent several red-eyed hours playing late last night. I’m not saying any of this in a bad way, mind you; Black Ops 6’s take on the mode is thrilling and unique thanks to all new movement mechanics and good map design. Zombies hasn’t been the thing it was in World at War for a while, and I still have a lot more of this year’s version to play before I am ready for my final review, but that one thought has still hit me pretty hard so far: How did we get here, man?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s carve out the bloody guts of this thing, shall we? Black Ops 6’s Zombies mode features two all-new maps: Terminus, a prison complex-turned-bio-research-station, and Liberty Falls, a small town in West Virginia whose slice of quaint Americana is about to test itself against The Worst Day Ever (spoiler: it doesn’t seem to be going well for the Americana). The story itself is a direct sequel to the Zombies campaign in 2020’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-zombies-review"><u>Black Ops Cold War</u></a>, and if you, like me, have largely forgotten what happened in the intervening four years, there doesn’t seem to be much attempt to catch you up. That means you’re going to hear a lot of proper-noun-filled dialogue that <em>could </em>be important or fun references, but instead had me going “I vaguely remember that person,” a little too often. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mostly, I wanted the voices in my ear (and the characters I was playing) to shut up. They have what I’m going to call The Modern Video Game Character Problem™, which is to say they all talk too much – especially since half the time they’re just broadcasting their thoughts out loud. I’m not saying each and every one of them is a deeply annoying, terminally unfunny, outrageously unlikeable person, but I’m not <em>not</em> saying that, either. Their mid-combat banter is like something compiled from a Schwarzenegger film penned by ChatGPT – I’m not expecting poetry here, but at least give me Gears of War-level banter, you know? I can only hear lines like the one where someone is complaining about how the zombies make them so mad they “boil their piss” or how we need a mop to clean up all the brains we’re splattering everywhere so many times before I want to turn my gun towards my allies instead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the story is a mixed bag so far, but you know what isn’t? The gameplay. The biggest change here is Omnimovement (Zombiemovement?), Black Ops 6’s complete overhaul of Call of Duty’s basic movement mechanics. You can sprint, slide, and dive in every direction, even chaining these moves together. You’ve also got a full 360 degrees of motion, which means you can do sick stuff like sprint backwards, pull off a retreating dive, mow down the zombies approaching you from every angle, and then get up and keep moving before they even get close. We haven’t seen zombie-killing moves like this since Resident Evil 6, minus a few suplexes here and there. (Dear Treyarch, please add suplexes. Love, Will.) Even if Treyarch misses what might be the easiest post-launch, patch-introduced layup with that, though, the point I’m making is that this <em>feels good</em>, and I like it. I like it a lot.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The story may be a mixed bag so far, but the gameplay feels <em>good</em>.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I also like the maps themselves. I think I prefer Liberty Falls over Terminus so far because I dig its height, with extremely entertaining ziplines that let you zoom from roof to roof. I also enjoy its more traditional structure of “pay Essence to open doors and access new places” over Terminus’s “restore power to the generators and defend them from zombies so you can earn the ability to open doors” twist, but that’s not to say Terminus doesn’t do anything cool. At one point, I found a little outboard-powered raft that allowed me to venture to the smaller islands around the main area. I died pretty promptly, because when I landed on a beach a horde of zombies popped out of the ground like a bunch of really angry, undead cabbages, but c’est la vie, right? C’est la undead? I don’t speak French.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m a bit more mixed on the way the maps handle progression through the story. Based on what I’ve played so far, you don’t really do much “defending” in Black Ops 6’s version of zombies. Instead, you’re constantly moving, unlocking new areas and trying to complete that map’s Main Quest during rounds. You can pretty much do this however you want. In my experience, that means a lot of running for your life and trying to earn enough Essence (which you get from offing zombies) to open the way to the next area, buy a new weapon, or upgrade a gun you like at a Pack-a-Punch Machine, which does exactly what it sounds like. Treyarch plans on providing an optional, more guided, story-focused version of the mode later on to preserve the sanctity of the Easter Egg hunt (whatever that means) – that will disable Easter Eggs and Side Quests, but I kind of wish it was here now so I could see the difference it makes. These maps are really big, and as someone with an absolutely terrible sense of direction, I’d just like to get a feel for where I’m <em>supposed </em>to go and how to get there before I focus on optional stuff.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing I really don’t like, at least so far, is the meta-progression. You don’t unlock the ability to make your own loadouts until you hit level four, and even then, you probably haven’t unlocked anything fun to customize on any of the guns you have yet. What’s more, progression feels painfully slow; I hit level four after an hour and a half of game time, which feels too long to wait for that basic functionality. I’ve only played by myself as of now, which I’m sure has slowed me down, but the delay still doesn’t feel great. What’s more, the lack of customization in the early going made my runs (two on Liberty Falls, one on Terminus) feel samey in a way I didn’t like. Hopefully, playing with friends will solve this problem, but it’s something I’m wary of as I continue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot I haven’t touched on yet, like in-map progression and upgrades (my early impression is actually “there might be too many mechanics here”), so I want to spend more time with this year’s Zombies mode before I finalize this review and put a score on it sometime next week. For right now, I’m excited to play more, and still kind of in awe at how we got here. Undeath sure is strange, huh soldier?</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
As Cities: Skyline 2 continues its attempts to recover from last year's disastrous launch, Paradox Interactive has announced and released a fresh batch of paid DLC for the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a>, some 18 months after delivering what was supposed to be its final major update.
</p>
<p>
Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-reveals-details-of-final-cities-skylines-dlc">concluded Cities: Skylines 1's release roadmap</a> in May last year with the launch of its final mini-expansion, Hotels &amp; Retreats. At the time, it said developer Colossal Order would continue general support through to the end of 2023 as it shifted its focus to Cities: Skylines 2.
</p>
<p>
But Cities: Skylines 2's launch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">went poorly</a>, resulting in multiple delays to Paradox's post-launch DLC plans while Colossal Order continued to improve the base game. An early attempt to foist DLC on the Cities: Skylines 2 player base was so badly received, Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">vowed to postpone</a> all future paid DLC "indefinitely". Then, in September, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-dlc-gets-further-delays-as-developer-priorities-assets-editor-for-mods">announced further DLC delays</a> so Colossal Order could complete work on a "crucial" assets editor.

<p>
And now, amid a string of other major misfires for Paradox, the publisher has decided to return to a well most assumed had finally run dry. 18 months after wrapping up support for Cities: Skylines 1, it's launched three new paid DLC packs for the game, all themed around mountain peaks and alpine terrain. There's the Mountain Village Pack and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEzJ2wmUPYQ">Map Pack 3</a>, both part of Cities: Skylines' Content Creator range, plus the Radio Station Alpine Tunes music pack.
</p><p>
"This content has been in the works for some time as we know many of you still love building and expanding your cities in the original Cities: Skylines," Paradox wrote in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/255710/view/4505380959139397651?l=english">DLC announcement</a>. "No resources were diverted from Cities: Skylines 2 for this," it continued, noting the new DLC has been created in partnership with developer Tantalus. "Our friends at Colossal Order remain fully focused on developing and improving Cities: Skylines 2."
</p>
<p>
All three new Cities: Skylines 1 DLC releases are available now on PC, and arrive ahead of <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/modding/cities-skylines-ii-region-packs">eight free community created region packs</a> inspired by the architecture of iconic cities around the world that'll launch for Cities: Skylines 2 starting next week.
</p>
<p>
All this comes at a challenging time for Paradox, which has faced a string of high-profile set-backs over the last few years. Alongside Cities: Skylines 2's disastrous launch, Prison Architect 2 has now been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-2-indefinitely-delayed-by-paradox">delayed indefinitely</a> after Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">split with developer Double Eleven</a> earlier this year, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> (which was almost cancelled before The Chinese Room <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-chinese-room-is-developing-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">took over its troubled development</a>) recently saw its release pushed back from "late 2024" into 2025. That's on top of Paradox's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sims-like-rival-life-by-you-has-been-cancelled-after-indefinite-delay">decision to cancel promising life sim Life By You</a> in June, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">commercial failure</a> of last year's The Lamplighters' League, which resulted in Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-and-harebrained-schemes-parting-ways-following-the-lamplighters-league-flop">parting ways with developer Harebrained Schemes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer about the company's troubles earlier this year, Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-ceo-admits-it-made-the-wrong-calls-in-several-projects-following-cancellation-of-life-by-you">admitted</a>, "It is clear that we have made the wrong calls in several projects, especially outside of our core, and this must change."

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/cattle-country-preview-tootin-time</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cattle-country-preview-a-tootin-time.1019856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/cattle-country-preview-tootin-time<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Farming (or in this case, ranching) simulators are a dime a dozen now, and <em>Cattle Country</em> doesn’t quite do enough to stand out in the nearly oversaturated genre despite doing a few things pretty well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cattle-country-character-creator.jpg?itok=_aQyarBh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cattle-country-character-creator.jpg?itok=OYCtY4qe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The character creator in&nbsp;<em>Cattle Country&nbsp;</em>isn't complex, but the outfits and customization options were cute.</figcaption></figure><h2>Welcome to Cattle Country</h2>

<p>In <em>Cattle Country</em>, players are moving to a small, Western settlement to start up a ranch. I got my hands on the preview, which features the first week of play. The playable week highlights the Welcoming Committee, a group of townspeople who will introduce you to areas around town. At the end of the week, there’s a festival to close the chapter.</p>

<p>That’s where the beta ends (although, I was able to restart the festival over and over again as it was quite buggy and would restart instead of ending).&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the most part, <em>Cattle Country</em> plays like what you’d expect. A day consists of taking care of your plants and livestock, talking to the village people, exploring, and mining.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cattle-country-morning-on-the-ranch.jpg?itok=5R3ORnQu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cattle-country-morning-on-the-ranch.jpg?itok=WrHc8Zb_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The aesthetics of&nbsp;<em>Cattle Country&nbsp;</em>are so adorable.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Good Side of the Western Front</h2>

<p>The aesthetics of <em>Cattle Country</em> are cute, especially on the actual farm. Decorating and designing were some of the highlights of the game for me, though the <em>Cattle Country</em> beta gives players quite a bit of indoor and outdoor items to decorate and build with right from the start.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another aspect of gameplay that stands out is the mining. It’s very unique for the genre, with a vertical, blocky design that’s more reminiscent of <em>Terraria </em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/minecraft-dungeons-review"><em>Minecraft</em></a>&nbsp;than any popular farming sim. This wasn’t a bad thing, and it’s a big bonus for the other vanilla parts of <em>Cattle Country</em>.</p>

<p><em>Cattle Country</em> is also very solid about its theme. The Western font is impossible to ignore, and every player has a heavy accent and lingo to match. While this could be a bit overdone, I liked the fact that it stayed true to what it aims to be.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mining-in-cattle-country.jpg?itok=16EoLZMk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mining-in-cattle-country.jpg?itok=DFbHKGTi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Surprisingly,&nbsp;<em>​​​​​</em>the mining in&nbsp;<em>Cattle Country&nbsp;</em>was one of the best parts.</figcaption></figure><h2>Cattle Country’s People Were Interesting, But Sparse</h2>

<p>The biggest problem with <em>Cattle Country</em> was easily the village. Indie farming sims are largely beloved because of the people within them. The most successful titles understand and utilize this, and <em>Cattle Country</em> doesn’t hit the mark.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nearly every NPC in the beta is a romanceable NPC. It feels like a spot for the hot singles to migrate to, and there are very few people outside of them. This makes the town feel really shallow and like it’s built around the player instead of a place the player is moving to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It doesn’t help that the NPCs don’t really go anywhere. They mostly stood around and didn’t feel like they had any purpose in the game except to exist for the player to talk to. It doesn’t feel like you’re part of a community at all, and it really hampers how immersed you can get.</p>

<p>However, the Welcoming Committee of characters who players can spend time with throughout the week was very well-written. It’s unfortunate that the town feels so shallow when the writing of the characters feels so deep.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/opening-scene-in-cattle-country.jpg?itok=np0uQXDi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/opening-scene-in-cattle-country.jpg?itok=XN8acYuO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The start of&nbsp;<em>Cattle Country&nbsp;</em>with Jeb was really cute, and it reminded me of several well-loved games.</figcaption></figure><h2>Overall, Cattle Country Has Some Major Beta Woes</h2>

<p><em>Cattle Country</em> is still in beta, so there’s a good chance that the issues can be worked out. Considering the high parts of gameplay, it would be really great if <em>Cattle Country</em> felt more immersive by launch – cozy farming sims might be around every corner, but those of us who love them will keep playing them.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p><em><strong>Cattle Country</strong> was previewed over approximately 3 hours of gameplay on PC with a key provided by developers. All screenshots were taken during the preview process.</em></p>

          <p>Earlier this year, we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/can-an-online-library-of-classic-video-games-ever-be-legal/">reported</a> on the video game archivists asking for a legal DMCA exemption to share Internet-accessible emulated versions of their physical game collections with researchers. Today, the US Copyright Office announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/gaming-trade-org-for-dmca-theres-no-such-thing-as-an-obsolete-game/">once again</a> that it was denying that request, forcing researchers to travel to far-flung collections for access to the often-rare physical copies of the games they're seeking.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2024/2024_Section_1201_Registers_Recommendation.pdf">announcing its decision</a>, the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/newsnet/2020/857.html">Register of Copyrights for the Library of Congress</a> sided with the Entertainment Software Association and others who argued that the proposed remote access could serve as a legal loophole for a free-to-access "online arcade" that could harm the market for classic gaming re-releases. This argument resonated with the Copyright Office despite <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/87-of-classic-games-are-out-of-print-thats-a-problem-for-gaming-history/">a VGHF study that found 87 percent of those older game titles are currently out of print</a>.</p>
<p>"While proponents are correct that some older games will not have a reissue market, they concede there is a 'healthy' market for other reissued games and that the industry has been making 'greater concerted efforts' to reissue games," the Register writes in her decision. "Further, while the Register appreciates that proponents have suggested broad safeguards that could deter recreational uses of video games in some cases, she believes that such requirements are not specific enough to conclude that they would prevent market harms."</p>

<p>A DMCA exemption for remote sharing already exists for non-video-game computer software that is merely "functional," as the Register notes. But the same fair use arguments that allow for that sharing don't apply to video games because they are "often highly expressive in nature," the Register writes.</p>

<p>In an odd footnote, the Register also notes that emulation of classic game consoles, while not infringing in its own right, has been "historically associated with piracy," thus "rais[ing] a potential concern" for any emulated remote access to library game catalogs. That footnote paradoxically cites Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) founder and director Frank Cifaldi's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/03/how-the-demonization-of-emulation-devalues-gamings-heritage/">2016 Game Developers Conference talk</a> on the demonization of emulation and its importance to video game preservation.</p>
<p>"The moment I became the Joker is when someone in charge of copyright law watched my GDC talk about how it's wrong to associate emulation with piracy and their takeaway was 'emulation is associated with piracy,'" Cifaldi <a href="https://x.com/frankcifaldi/status/1849870320339124340">quipped in a social media post</a>.</p>
<h2>The fight continues</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://gamehistory.org/dmca-2024-statement/">a statement</a> issued in response to the decision, the VGHF called out "lobbying efforts by rightsholder groups" that "continue to hold back progress" for researchers. The status quo limiting remote access "forces researchers to explore extra-legal methods to access the vast majority of out-of-print video games that are otherwise unavailable," the VGHF writes.</p>
<p>"Frankly my colleagues in literary studies or film history have pretty routine and regular access to digitized versions of the things they study," <a href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/laine-nooney">NYU professor Laine Nooney</a> argued to the Copyright Office earlier this year. "These [travel] impediments [to access physical games] are real and significant and they do impede research in ways that are not equitable compared to our colleagues in other disciplines."</p>

<p>Speaking to Ars Technica, VGHF Library Director Phil Salvador said that the group was "disappointed" in the Copyright Office decision but "proud of the work we've done and the impact this process has had. The research we produced during this process has already helped justify everything from game re-releases to grants for researching video game history. Our fight this cycle has raised the level of discourse around game preservation, and we're going to keep that conversation moving within the game industry."</p>

"We really gave it our all, I can't see what else we could have done. This fails the needs of citizens in favor of a weak sauce argument from the industry, and it's really disappointing."</p>

<p><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/kalbert">Lawyer Kendra Albert</a>, who argued vociferously in favor of the proposed exemption earlier this year, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kendraserra.bsky.social/post/3l7e2nsbukw2s">wrote on social media</a> that they were "gutted by the result... Speaking on behalf of only myself, and not any of my clients, I do believe we made the best case we could that scholarly access to video games <em>that are not commercially available</em> does not harm the market. I do not believe that this evidence was seriously engaged with by the Copyright Office."</p>
<p>Albert argued that the Register of Copyrights seems to have disregarded on-the-record comments from publishers of video game re-releases, who argued that remote scholarly access to library holdings would not harm their business. "It is not fair to video game scholars and preservationists to pretend that this is about creating sufficiently stringent exemption rules when the Copyright Office seems to have ignored the evidence that contradicts their prior beliefs," they wrote.</p>
<p>Today marks the fourth time the Copyright Office has rejected arguments for remote access to library game collections <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/gaming-trade-org-for-dmca-theres-no-such-thing-as-an-obsolete-game/">since 2015</a>. The office will consider arguments for and against the exemption again in 2027 as part of its triennial rulemaking process.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-announces-da-red-gobbo-2024-bringing-holiday-cheer-to-warhammer-40000<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has revealed Da Red Gobbo 2024. The tabletop publisher has a tradition of releasing Christmas novelty miniatures for Warhammer 40,000, and this year's miniature continues it proudly, sporting a red coat and a snowman with a deadly surprise.</p>

<h2>Da Red Gobbo 2024 Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/uzmeyw69/have-a-blast-with-the-red-gobbo-in-this-years-christmas-commemorative-miniature/">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop shows off photos and features of Da Red Gobbo 2024. Referred to as the A-Bomb-inable Snowman, the miniature, much <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/da-red-gobbo-returns-this-holiday-season" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like last year's</a>, is a gretchin unit for the Ork army.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/da-red-gobbo-2024-snowman-bomb.jpg?itok=ra5AfyF8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/da-red-gobbo-2024-snowman-bomb.jpg?itok=9wVfIqmy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As the name implies, the miniature depicts a gobbo in a red coat, a smaller gobbo in an elf outfit, and a happy looking snowman wearing the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ork-goff-rocker-brings-moozik-to-warhammer-40k" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Goff Rocker's</a> top hat.</p>

<p>That snowman contains a surprise. You can pop the snowman's head off, revealing the snowman's body is built around a gigantic bomb. This destructive mischief is compounded with a pile of snowballs next to the gobbos. Snowballs that are barely concealing what appear to be live grenades.</p>

<p>Da Red Gobbo 2024 is a great continuation of the Ork's farcical nature in the world of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>. The grimdark sci-fi setting is mostly characterized by the bleak and grotesque. Interdimensional demons, torturous death cults, fascistic authoritarian states enforced by religious zealots.</p>

<p>By contrast, the Orks are inherently absurd creatures. Battle-obsessed meathead warriors whose simplistic reductive perspective, referred to by the fans as "Ork logic," can subtly break physical reality.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/da-red-gobbo-2024-snowball-grenades.jpg?itok=eqiDtNZW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/da-red-gobbo-2024-snowball-grenades.jpg?itok=HlZbD186 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Battle vehicles can drive through a warzone despite having no engine or fuel. Guns that fire hundreds of rounds despite being just twisted pieces of metal. A giant hunk of space junk becomes space-worthy because Orks drew red spikes on them. The list goes on.</p>

<p>In that context, a gretchin unit showing up with snowball grenades and an explosive snowman is absurd, but does remain in line with the lore of the setting and its maximalist design sensibilities.</p>

But the most interesting bit of news was the confirmation that a secret, previously unknown <em>Predator </em>movie is going to arrive sometime next year before <em>Badlands</em>. </p><p>“After <em>Prey </em>became a success, Dan [Trachtenberg] came back and said he didn’t want to do <em>Prey 2,” </em>said Asbell,<em> “</em>And we’re like, ‘What do you want to do?’ And he rattled off a bunch of ideas that were really crazy but really cool.”</p><p>“We’ve actually done two of them. Two are coming out next year. One I can’t talk about yet, but the other one is the live-action <em>Predator </em>film with Elle Fanning that just wrapped in New Zealand. That’ll be out theatrically sometime next year. It’s titled <em>Badlands </em>and it is an absolutely bonkers idea. It is a sci-fi thing, but it’s not what everybody thinks it is. And I mean, it’s awesome. It is so nuts. But in Dan, we trust.”</p><p>Asbell didn’t say much about the other <em>Predator </em>movie, but did suggest it won’t be released in theaters and confirmed Tractenberg also directed it. </p><h2 id="h157847"><a id=""></a>An animated <em>Predator </em>movie and more <em>AVP</em></h2><p>On Friday<em>, </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/secret-predator-movie-dan-trachtenberg-badlands-prey-2000516609&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/secret-predator-movie-dan-trachtenberg-badlands-prey-2000516609"><em>IO9 </em>further reported</a></span> that they had heard from sources that the surprise <em>Predator </em>movie is an animated anthology featuring three different stories involving different warriors throughout history fighting Predators.

Disney didn’t provide a comment to the outlet before publication. </p><p>Still, an animated <em>Predator </em>anthology about various warriors from the past taking on the intergalactic bounty hunter sounds similar to <em>Prey </em>and would likely be something released only on Hulu and not in theaters, which lines up with what Asbell told <em>THR</em>. </p><p>Meanwhile, in that same interview with <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>, the 20th Century Studios boss also said it was likely we would <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/predator-movie-an-alien-sequel-speed-3-1236042464/#:~:text=Fine.%20Will%20we,But%20we%20haven%E2%80%99t&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/predator-movie-an-alien-sequel-speed-3-1236042464/#:~:text=Fine.%20Will%20we,But%20we%20haven%E2%80%99t" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eventually get another <em>Alien Vs Predator </em>movie</a></span>, but “it wouldn’t be in the way you think.” </p><p>“That’s the thing.

But we haven’t gotten to that point. And we’re not just going to bang it out.”<br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are two maps to choose from, with Liberty Falls being a more casual map and Terminus being a larger and more hardcore Zombies experience. No matter which map you choose, you'll want to make sure you're well-equipped. Here we explain everything you need to know when building a custom loadout.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How custom loadouts work in BO6 Zombies</h2><p dir="ltr">Custom Zombies loadouts return. Just like in Black Ops Cold War, you'll load into matches with a weapon and equipment of your choosing. However, the loadout customization is a bit different than recent years.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll get one primary weapon slot. You can custom-build this gun with up to five attachments, assuming you have already leveled up the gun a bit and unlocked them.</p><p dir="ltr">Your loadout also comes with a dedicated melee slot. There are only two melee weapons in the game at launch. So, you can choose between a knife and a baseball bat.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, you can choose one piece of tactical equipment, lethal equipment, a Zombies field upgrade, and a pack of Gobblegums.</p><p dir="ltr">The actual guns you bring into the game won't be very powerful after the early rounds, and it costs a lot of points and salvage to level up that weapon's rarity and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-how-to-unlock-and-use-pack-a-punch-on-liberty-falls/1100-6527380/">Pack-a-Punch</a>. This is mostly a starter weapon, and thus the specific gun builds don't have to matter too much here.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll be better off investing in Wall Buys with higher rarities, Mystery Box guns, or even Wonder Weapons like the Ray Gun.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to unlock Augments</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390839-augmentresearch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390839" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390839-augmentresearch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390839"></a><figcaption>Zombies Augment Research</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390839-augmentresearch.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Originally introduced in Black Ops Cold War, Augments are ways to make your field upgrades more powerful for your loadout, and they do the same for perks and ammo mods you purchase in-game.</p><p dir="ltr">Zombies matches get increasingly more difficult after round 25. The waves are more intense, and there are plenty of armored zombies that start to feel like bullet sponges. This is where Augments will become most beneficial. They'll give you added benefits such as extra health, increased movement speed, and immunity from fall damage.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll need to unlock Augments by completing Augment Research, which is a menu you won't have access to until you reach level 11. You'll want to <strong>make sure you start researching Augments as soon as you unlock the feature</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">There are 108 total Augments in the game, with multiple major and minor Augments available for every perk, ammo mod, and field upgrade in the game. You can only research one Augment at a time, and unlocking them is painfully slow.</p><p dir="ltr">The <strong>Stamin-Up perk is a good starting point</strong>, as most of the powerful Augments are locked until you've researched a set amount of Augments. This includes the helpful Juggernog Augments that require you to research eight Augments before unlocking access to this research. Juggernog Augment research will be something you'll want to prioritize once you've unlocked it.</p><p dir="ltr">The full list and in-depth breakdown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-all-perks-ammo-mods-field-upgrades-plus-how-to-use-augments/2900-5875/#18">all the Augments in the game can be found here</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Field Upgrade recommendations</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390840-allfieldupgrades.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390840" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390840-allfieldupgrades.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390840"></a><figcaption>All Zombies field upgrades</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390840-allfieldupgrades.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At launch, Black Ops 6 includes the following field upgrades:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Aether Shroud: Phase into the Dark Aether, becoming hidden from enemy detection</li><li dir="ltr">Frenzied Guard: Repair armor and force all enemies in the area to target you. During this time, kills repair a portion of your armor</li><li dir="ltr">Healing Aura: Summons beams of energy down on yourself and allies to instantly revive and heal to full health</li><li dir="ltr">Energy Mine: Create a mine of pure energy that detonates in rapid succession, dealing lethal electric damage</li><li dir="ltr">Dark Flare: You generate a massive energy beam that deals lethal shadow damage. The beam penetrates everything in its path</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There are a few really solid options here, depending on your playstyle and if you're playing with friends. It's usually good to have a mix of field upgrades for a full team.</p><p dir="ltr">For example: A medic role is important, so you probably want to have at least one player with <strong>Healing Aura</strong>, and <strong>Frenzied Guard</strong> is for the teammate who likes to be aggro and pull all the zombies towards them.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Aether Shroud</strong> is also a good choice for team play or solo matches, as going invisible for a short time can let you escape a sticky situation.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dark Flare</strong> isn't the most team-friendly perk, but it is a lot of fun to use and deal out a ton of damage. <strong>Energy Mine</strong> is the least helpful and enjoyable option, so this is a bottom-tier pick that I wouldn't invest much in.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Gobblegum recommendations</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390841-gobblegums.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390841" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390841-gobblegums.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390841"></a><figcaption>All Black Ops 6 Gobblegums</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390841-gobblegums.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Gobblegums return in Zombies, and these are powerful but temporary effects you can use. These are extremely optional. Some players prefer not to even use Gobblegums or things like Augments to make the game feel like a more classic Zombies experience.</p><p dir="ltr">However, here are some tips for making the most of your Gobblegums. Your loadout lets you customize a pack of five gums of various rarities, and you can earn more unique gums just by playing and completing rounds. You'll see an in-game popup every time you earn a new one.</p><p dir="ltr">I'd recommend grinding out some Zombies matches and saving up any powerful ones you earn for later matches, such as going for high-rounds or attempting an Easter egg.</p><p dir="ltr">These will be gums such as:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Perkaholic: Gives you all the perks on the map</li><li dir="ltr">Phoenix Up: Revives all downed teammates and lets them keep their perks</li><li dir="ltr">Wall Power: The next weapon you buy off the wall comes Pack-a-Punched</li><li dir="ltr">On The House: Spawns a random perk power-up that benefits you and your teammates</li></ul><p dir="ltr">For more on Zombies, make sure to check out our Liberty Falls guides.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-fledgling-manor-reality-tv-survivor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For better or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/dec/12/viewers-enjoy-seeing-people-suffer-reality-tvs-desperate-struggle-to-be-more-ethical" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worse</a>, reality TV is everywhere, a continent-sized chunk of the modern media landscape. But even though shows like <em>Survivor</em>, <em>Too Hot To Handle</em>, <em>Love Is Blind</em>, <em>The Circle</em>, and so many more are glorified games, there are only a <a href="https://aftermath.site/crush-house-impressions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">handful</a> of games that explore the format (outside occasional licensed efforts like the well-liked but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fuseboxgames/comments/18abvi1/love_island_app_season_13_going_to_be_unavailable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now-discontinued</a> <em>Love Island</em> mobile game or the <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/netflix-stories-love-is-blind-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small interactive fiction game</a> Netflix released to promote <em>Love Is Blind</em>’s sixth season). What gives? On the latest Aftermath Hours, we answer that question.</p><p>This week, we’re joined by special guest <a href="https://x.com/hunktears" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LB Hunktears</a>, formerly of Fanbyte and <em>Blaseball </em>fame, who is now working on a reality show queer romance horror comedy game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3238510/Fledgling_Manor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fledgling Manor</em></a>. We discuss the reality TV shows that inspired it, as well as the strange lack of games about reality TV, given just how game-y those shows’ structures tend to be. We also rank every season of <em>Buffy The Vampire Slayer</em>, a show that has aged like a fine wine if the bottle contained a tiny man named Joss Whedon who you kept learning new terrible things about, and who you had to nudge aside every time you wanted to take a sip.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we talk about Twitch’s recent string of gaffes involving Israel, including its “<a href="https://x.com/TwitchSupport/status/1848191418377830708" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inadvertent</a>” failure to re-enable sign ups in Israel and Palestine for a whole year, as well as its very advertent decision to <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-israel-palestine-frogan-ban-h3h3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ban several Arab streamers</a> for a month following spurious claims of antisemitism. Lastly, we discuss the best fall flavors and conclude that apple beats the shit out of pumpkin spice. Sorry, but it’s not even close.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we don’t have to find ever-lasting (read: entirely contrived, but contractually enforced) love on a reality show to promote Aftermath.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Reality shows often have a lot of gamified elements, and yet I feel like – short of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2337820/The_Crush_House/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Crush House</em></a>, for example, which just came out recently – we haven’t seen that many games based on reality TV. What do you think the sticking point is there? Why isn’t this more of a thing?</p><p><strong>LB:</strong> That’s a good question. I was really excited to see <em>Crush House</em>. I’m excited to start playing games again when this game is done, because I think [<em>Crush House</em>’s] mechanic is really interesting and cool. I think the transmedia thing – transmedia as in making a game about a different kind of media – presents a challenge to people in general. It’s one of the many, many reasons I thought <em>Immortality </em>was so interesting. I also don’t see a lot of games about, like, making movies; there’s an element of imagination that needs to happen. In general with games, though, there’s an element of imagination that needs to happen around just not running around and jumping – which is my least favorite kind of game, which is why I said that.</p><p>But reality shows, there’s an element of people thinking they’re too smart for them – that [reality shows] are stupid – but also a lack of understanding of those gamified elements and a lack of appreciation for how complicated and insane some of those gaming elements are. I’m currently doing some contract consulting work for KO_OP, the game studio, and they do a show-and-tell thing. Somebody did a whole presentation mostly about the game elements of certain Korean reality shows and variety shows and how interesting they are in terms of game design.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve watched a lot of those kinds of shows, and even as someone who’s been in games for over ten years, it never occurred to me to make those connections. Hopefully people are starting to have those conversations now. Someone did!</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I know that [Dropout CEO] Sam Reich has talked about watching <em>Survivor</em> and other reality shows for Dropout. I started watching <em>Game Changer</em>, and that is a game show about games, and so they do sometimes tap into the gamified elements from reality TV shows because they’re also improv comedians in a studio. It does not feel cross-media, but it does become cross-media when you add that sort of metatextual element to it.&nbsp;</p><p>I feel like games are a particularly good device to call attention to the artifice of reality television because in a game you are sort of a god. In any kind of a game, you have to make choices about how much agency you give to the player. There’s two ways to do a reality television show and have it be fun: One is that you’re a contestant, and you have to survive, which is the <em>Fledgling Manor </em>approach. The other is where you’re the producer, and you have to make something compelling – which is kind of the game I’m waiting for. And that is the thing that’s interesting about <em>Immortality</em>; it gives you a timeline and the ability to edit a huge amount of video into something.</p><p><em>Crush House</em> sort of gets there in that it introduces you to the concept of reality TV as though every element is a game. So you do get to understand more cleanly that these are just minigames. They’re making [the contestants] do real-life minigames. When Tyra Banks shows up and she has some ridiculous runway with, like, moving platforms, and they’re all unstable and floating on the water – which is something that she made these girls do, in high heels, in constricting outfits that were difficult to walk in – [it becomes obvious that it’s a game]. Nobody is ever going to make you walk a runway like that! But she did on [<em>America’s Next Top Model</em>].</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Nobody except Mario in <em>Mario Party</em>. He would have you do that. He’d be right there with you, though.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> He’d be like [Mario accent] “Oh no, so scary!”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>[Mario accent] “WaaaaAAAAaaaaAAAh”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Twitch campaign runs until November 13, with four items up for grabs, including a weapon blueprint. In order to get these drops, you will need to watch Twitch streams of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 where the creator has enabled drops.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 Twitch Rewards</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4390713-blopstwitchdrops.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390713" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4390713-blopstwitchdrops.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390713"></a><figcaption>It takes four hours to earn all four items from Twitch drops.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4390713-blopstwitchdrops.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are four items up for grabs: the XMG Get Wiped blueprint, Never Broken calling card, Azurite Vision charm, and the Deflected emblem. Most of these rewards are purely cosmetic, although the XMG blueprint can be used in-game, letting you access attachments for the weapon before you might have unlocked them by leveling up. Each of these items has a specific hour count you need to hit.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Deflected emblem - 1 Hour</li><li dir="ltr">Never Broken calling card - 2 Hours</li><li dir="ltr">Azurite Vision - 3 Hours</li><li dir="ltr">XMG Get Wiped blueprint - 4 Hours</li></ul><p dir="ltr">You can check your progress by navigating to your profile icon on Twitch and going down in the drop menu to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/drops/inventory" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drops and Rewards</a>, which is also where you can claim these items once you earn them. Before you can start earning these drops, you need to make sure your Twitch account and Activision account have been linked. If your account isn't connected, there is a connect option in the Drops and Rewards screen under the Black Ops 6 campaign, which will take you to the Activision website, where you can log in and connect the two accounts.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you have successfully connected your accounts, the connect link will no longer be on that page. From there, just head to the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> category on Twitch and look for the tag DropsEnabled to find a stream to watch. <strong>You will need to collect your rewards from the Drops and Rewards menu once you have met the time requirements.</strong></p><p>For more help with Black Ops 6, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-weapon-loadouts/2900-5892/">Best Weapon Loadouts</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-perks-and-wildcards/1100-6527396/">Best Perks</a> guides.</p>
