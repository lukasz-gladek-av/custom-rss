            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Katsuhiro Harada has bid farewell to more than thirty years of working under the Bandai Namco banner, moving on from Tekken after decades of developing the series. In a new social media post, Harada ushered in 2026 by stressing that he’s ‘no longer a developer/creator of the TEKKEN series’.</p>



<p>At the start of December 2025, Harada and the Bandai Namco team shared the news that the legendary developer would be parting ways with the firm after 31 years.</p>







<h2 id="h-katsuhiro-harada-has-moved-on">Katsuhiro Harada Has Moved On</h2>



<p>In a new post on social media, Katsuhiro Harada shared the following message:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I’m no longer a developer / creator of the TEKKEN series.</p><p>Harada_TEKKEN is completely dead.</p></div>— Katsuhiro Harada (@Harada_TEKKEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/2006390358859809229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The iconic developer was quick to update his bio, writing, ‘Former Game Director and Chief Producer of action and fighting games.’</p>



<p>On December 8, Harada shared the revelation with fans worldwide that he would be stepping down from his tenured spot at Bandai Namco:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans shared their sentiments in the comments under Harada’s post. One drew comparisons to the series that Harada was pivotal in creating, saying, ‘Heihachi ‘died’ like 4 times. Kazuya came back from a volcano. We know how this works in the Tekken universe. See you in the next patch notes, boss.’</p>



<p>Others offered more simple, heartfelt messages: ‘We will always think of you, Harada-san, thank you for everything.’</p>



<p>Harada worked in production and direction roles on the Tekken series since Tekken 3 debuted in 1997, and was a driving force in the space ever since. He’s set to appear one last time in the Tekken space at some upcoming esports events, but then the world afterwards is his oyster.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#935)—Clues and Answers for Thursday, January 1]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-1-935/</link>
            <guid>1395343</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I haven’t seen you since last year! It’s 2026, and it’s time to keep moving forward with stacks of NYT Connections hints, solutions, and tips. If you’ve burst into 2026 with a desire to keep your NYT Connections streak running, I’m here to help you achieve that resolution. Below, you’ll find the solutions for today’s puzzle.</p>



<p>Let us know in the comments below what your resolutions are for 2026 and how you plan to hold yourself to them!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-1">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 1)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #935:</p>



<ul>
<li>SHUCK</li>



<li>SCOTCH</li>



<li>HEAD</li>



<li>RAT</li>



<li>CURSE</li>



<li>SKIN</li>



<li>NUT</li>



<li>FLY</li>



<li>HOUND</li>



<li>FINGERS</li>



<li>SPELL</li>



<li>SHELL</li>



<li>CHARM</li>



<li>BUFF</li>



<li>PEEL</li>



<li>HEX</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think about the small, concentrated forms of supernatural influence — the kind of mystical actions that show up in fairy tales, fantasy novels, or folklore.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Imagine you’re prepping food in a kitchen — or working with anything that has a natural outer layer</em>.</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are the words you attach to someone who is REALLY into a topic — the kind of person who knows every detail, every fact, every obscure bit of trivia.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Picture the word “butter” followed by another word to form a familiar phrase or compound.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 1:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-january-1-935">NYT Connections Answers for Today, January 1 (#935)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CHARM, CURSE, HEX, SPELL</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – PEEL, SHELL, SHUCK, SKIN</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BUFF, HEAD, HOUND, RAT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – FINGERS, FLY, NUT, SCOTCH</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

		<p>It is the start of a new year which means one thing! That thing is the annual ceremony of an NBA 2K servers being switched off. From now on, January 1st 2026, all online functionality for NBA 2K24 has been switched off. That means no more multiplayer, MyCareer or MyTeam but modes that don’t require an internet connection like MyNBA and Play Now are still playable. NBA 2K24 was released on September 8th, 2023 and was removed from sale in October 2025.</p>

<p>NBA 2K’s support page states, <em>“As of January 1, 2026, you’ll no longer be able to play multiplayer games or access any online game modes. MyCAREER and MyTEAM will no longer be available, and it will no longer be possible to earn Virtual Currency (VC). While you will still be able to enjoy Play Now, MyNBA, The W, and MyWNBA, any features that require a connection to 2K servers will be unavailable. This includes multiplayer, Online Leagues, and community sharing. We thank you for being a part of our community and hope you continue to enjoy&nbsp;NBA 2K!”</em></p>

<p>In our NBA 2K24 review I wrote, <em>“Regardless of what this review says, NBA 2K24 will sell millions of copies, and generate millions of dollars through VC. That is because basketball fans who want to play a basketball game have nowhere else to go. The on court action is really good, but without competition to keep them honest, 2K’s monetisation has got out of hand and made modes like MyCareer near unplayable without extra investment from players.”</em></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/01/happy-new-year-2026/</link>
            <guid>1395253</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Once more around the Sun we go, starting a fresh circuit from this fairly arbitrary starting line. It’s a time that many of us pick to be a symbolic fresh start, to tackle the upcoming twelve months with a renewed vim, vigour and determination that it’s going to be “my year”. Will it be? I certainly hope so!</p>
<p>Looking back on the video games of 2025, and had a pretty great year of play, didn’t we? There were plenty of pleasant surprises in the first half of the year, from the brilliant and unique puzzling of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/07/blue-prince-review/">Blue Prince</a> to the incredible&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which easily stood shoulder to shoulder with much bigger budget games and immediately became a Game of the Year contender.</p>



<p>But then there was all the build up to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Nintendo had remained rather tight-lipped over the successor to the sensationally popular Nintendo Switch, finally revealing the Switch 2 in January to be a….. well, another Switch-style console. By the time they revealed the launch line up and pricing, the general sentiment was muted at best. Could a new Mario Kart, some upgraded Zelda games and the Joy-Con now having a mouse mode <em>really</em> propel this to success? Turns out, yes, it really could! The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/the-switch-2-sold-over-10-million-consoles-in-just-4-months/">Switch 2 has become the fastest-selling console in history</a> through its opening months, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World</a> has been hugely popular, and there’s been enough upgrades and fresh ports of games (once again getting a surprising amount of performance from modest specs) to keep us interested.</p>


<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">GTA 6 facing a delay to next year</a> (<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/gta-6-has-been-delayed-again-to-november-2026/">twice</a>!), the back half of 2025 opened up to the battle of the first person shooters. Within quick succession, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/battlefield-6-review/">Battlefield 6</a> arrived to grab the attention of long-suffering Battlefield fans and disaffected Call of Duty players alike – which was only strengthened when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/25/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/">Black Ops 7</a> did arrive to prove everyone’s fears about the campaign true. Sandwiched in the middle was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/26/arc-raiders-review/">ARC Raiders</a>, arriving with a wave of interest in the best-looking example of the extraction shooter yet.</p>
<p>But there was still plenty of space for&nbsp;quirky indie titles, like the thoroughly silly <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/megabonk">Megabonk</a>, long-awaited indie sequels getting surprise releases in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/26/hades-2-review/">Hades 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>.</p>
<p>While these were all highlights, 2025 still felt like a real struggle for many. As featured in our yearly Biggest Disappointment award, the wash of redundancies, game cancellations and studio closures continued, and while thankfully not to quite the same extent as in 2024, it still saw <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/25/warner-bros-shuts-down-monolith-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Warner Bros. gutting a bunch of their studios</a> (it’s got to the point that Netflix considers them worthless in their company takeover bid), and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-by-xbox-the-initiative-shutdown-rare-turn-10-affected/">Microsoft closing down The Initiative and cancelling Perfect Dark, Everwild and ending support of Forza Motorsport</a>.</p>
<p>On to 2026 and… well, it could be a great year for games. Will we actually see <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">GTA 6</a> released this year? Who knows, but I’d put money on Insomniac meeting their launch target for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/24/wolverine-ps5-trailer/">Wolverine</a>, there’s firmer release dates for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/new-resident-evil-requiem-trailer-leon/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>, and plenty more besides. We’ll be featuring all of these and more in our Most Wanted list.</p>

<p>You don’t have to dig too deeply to find spreading diseases lurking behind the surface. Generative AI has helped to feed the fire of some of the layoffs in the last couple of years, and there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/28/electronic-arts-saudi-investment-fund-trump/">the looming buyout of EA by the Saudi PIF</a> which is banking on this to enable a restructuring plan.&nbsp;The obsession with generative AI is also now sucking up all the world’s RAM supplies which is already hitting the wider tech industry, both for PCs and broader integrated electronics, and GPU makers are shifting focus to meet that currently oh-so-lucrative bubble.</p>
<p>Still, we can try to remain hopeful and optimistic, support the developers and ventures that we like as we go, and enjoy the gaming highlights as they come.</p>
<p>And with that, it’s just left to me to wish you once again a very Happy New Year from the entire TSA team, to thank you for visiting our humble gaming site through the year, and to say we hope you’ll continue to join us for all your gaming news and reviews in 2026!</p>

However, the most interesting spin-off is arguably <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-5-tactica">Persona 5 Tactica</a>, a strategy-based spin-off that is similar to XCOM.

One day, the party is transported away to an alternate reality called a Kingdom, and these worlds are where Tactica takes place. DLC was also made available for Persona 5 Tactica, in the form of Repaint Your Heart, which brought back familiar faces Goro Akechi and Kasumi Yoshizawa.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In each Kingdom, you control up to three characters and move them around a grid-based map to take down enemies. Many of Persona 5's unique combat mechanics are implemented here in familiar ways, such as the 1 More mechanic when attacking an enemy and knocking them to the ground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

            <guid>1395142</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/woodkid-hideo-kojima-death-stranding-soundtrack-1235357959/"><span>a June interview with </span><i><span>Rolling Stone</span></i></a><span>, the musician Woodkid spoke about working with Hideo Kojima to create the soundtrack for this year’s </span><i><span>Death Stranding 2</span></i><span>. Asked what he’s learned from his time with the veteran game director, Woodkid shares an illuminating anecdote about a time when Kojima approached him with a concern. According to the singer-songwriter, Kojima said, “I’m going to be very honest, we have been testing the game with players and the results are too good. They like it too much. That means something is wrong; we have to change something…If everyone likes it, it means it’s mainstream. It means it’s conventional. It means it’s already pre-digested for people to like it.”</span></p> <p><span>I’ve been thinking about this quote now for months. As a player, as a reader, as a movie lover, I value work that has some integrity to it. I don’t like it when I’m playing a game and I can </span><i><span>feel </span></i><span>the designers straining to make it all as convenient and frictionless and pleasant as possible. That doesn’t mean that I like having my time wasted either, or that I don’t value good design. I just don’t like it when things feel focus-tested, sanded down, made all glossy for the masses. Sometimes I will think a popular, mainstream work is very good, but it won’t be </span><i><span>because </span></i><span>of the ways in which I sense it calibrating itself for mass appeal. It will be in spite of them.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This year, I played a number of games I thought were fine, and a few I didn’t like very much. I didn’t play many that I found really special or exciting, so this list is a top five, not a top ten. That’s not a commentary on the overall quality of the year’s games. It’s just a reflection of the fact that I played fewer games overall this year than I sometimes do–I’m trying to make more time for books, movies, and so on than I have in the past, and to spend more time with people I care about, too–and that, of the games I happened to play in my limited time, not all of them were winners. But I did still play some very good games this year. Let’s get on with it, shall we?&nbsp;</span></p>

 <hr> <h2><b>Honorable Mention: </b><b><i>Death Stranding 2</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Man, what a frustrating game for me to grapple with. The original </span><i><span>Death Stranding </span></i><span>is an all-time favorite of mine, a bold, bracing experience that was truly unlike anything I had played and that has only become more strangely resonant in the years since its release. This sequel, despite that secondhand Kojima quote I shared above about him apparently not wanting it to be too “mainstream,” felt to me very safe, leaning into conventional combat and away from the kinds of environmental friction that made forming connections in the first game so rewarding. It also, as Maddy Myers so effectively noted in </span><a href="https://www.avclub.com/the-women-of-death-stranding-2-are-stuck-in-a-sad-cycle"><span>a piece for </span><i><span>The A.V. Club</span></i></a><span>, exemplifies Kojima’s tiresome tendency toward gender essentialism.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But amidst the typical AAA gunfights and deeply disappointing narrative decisions, there were still some cool discoveries and memorable moments. I loved it when I hopped in a hot spring only to find that taking a bath in one can transport you to another; this felt to me not like another “quality of life”-oriented fast-travel option, something non-diegetic you select in a menu, but a feature of the world, the way Warp Zones used to be. And as I wrote about in our piece on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-game-moments-scenes-2025-clair-obscur-ending-2000655769"><span>the year’s best moments</span></a><span>, the game’s big reveal near the end is goofy, exuberant, and audacious, a reminder of what Kojima can do when he’s truly willing to take risks.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Honorable Mention: </b><b><i>Avowed</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Obsidian’s first-person fantasy RPG was refreshingly distinctive, with a world recalling that of </span><i><span>Morrowind </span></i><span>in its originality rather than more traditional swords-and-sorcery settings. I enjoyed wandering around and seeing who and what I would find more than I have in a game like this in a long time. It also tells a tale in which, depending on your actions, some pretty major events </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-steel-garrote-cave-fior-mes-iverno-burns-1851767974"><span>can happen or not happen</span></a><span>, and I appreciated that it found ways to confront some pretty big themes and incorporate some impactful choices while working within some clear limitations of budget and scope. </span><i><span>Avowed </span></i><span>punches above its weight and proves that big mid-budget adventures still deserve a place in today’s gaming landscape.</span></p>

 <h2><b>#5: </b><b><i>Absolum&nbsp;</i></b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656282" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656282"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656282">©DotEmu</figcaption></figure> <p><span>2020’s </span><i><span>Streets of Rage 4 </span></i><span>was the best damn beat ‘em up I’d played in a long time. With it, co-developer Guard Crush demonstrated a real knack for the fundamentals of the genre, delivering clobbering action that was accessible, nuanced, and so, </span><i><span>so</span></i><span> satisfying. This year’s </span><i><span>Absolum </span></i><span>sees them take all that savoir-faire and apply it to fantasy beat ‘em up action with roguelike elements, and it works as well as ever.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I really dig a good fantasy beat ‘em up (Capcom’s </span><i><span>D&amp;D </span></i><span>games of the ‘90s are particular favorites), and </span><i><span>Absolum </span></i><span>makes great use of its setting, peppering in just enough lore to tell us what we need to know about its central conflict and to understand the personalities of its four terrific playable characters. It also benefits from a striking art style that had me feeling like I was playing a lush fantasy cartoon from the 1970s. Random events and hidden secrets keep the world feeling lively, and going toe-to-toe with its terrific bosses is as enjoyable on your 20th run as it is on your first.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>#4: </b><b><i>Despelote&nbsp;</i></b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656283"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656283">©Panic</figcaption></figure> <p><span>When you have a passion for something, especially when you’re young, it stays with you everywhere. It’s with you when you’re wandering the halls of your school, when you’re hanging out with your friends, when you’re lying in bed at night. Some passions separate you from others; my high school obsession with Peter Gabriel wasn’t something I could really share with my friends who were into Nirvana and Pearl Jam, for instance. But sometimes, a passion binds you with others. Sometimes, it binds a whole nation together.</span></p> <p><i><span>Despelote </span></i><span>is a slice-of-life game about an Ecuadorian boy named Julián and the weeks surrounding the country’s qualifying run for the 2002 World Cup. Julián loves soccer. At home, his parents make dinner and talk about the changing state of the world and the latest challenges in their careers, but Julián just wants to play the soccer game on his console and hog the family TV. During recess at school, he and his classmates immediately seize the opportunity to kick the ball around. Everywhere you go in </span><i><span>Despelote</span></i><span>, soccer is woven seamlessly into life. People are still going on dates and exercising and walking their dogs, but soccer is in the air, inescapable. The game doesn’t need to didactically explain to you what qualifying for the World Cup would mean to the country, to these people. Thanks to </span><i><span>Despelote</span></i><span>’s brilliant blend of realism and surrealism, you’re there, in that space, living it. You can feel it yourself.</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s a common misconception about “relatability” which says that the more generic a work is, the more relatable it is because it means that we’ll all be more readily able to project ourselves onto its characters and connect to its situations. I find it’s almost always the opposite that is true. The more specific something is, the more precisely it captures an experience that is not my own, the better I’m able to feel connected to it as well, to appreciate both how it differs from my own experience and how it reflects the things that bind us all together. I’m not a soccer fan, and I’m sorry to say that I know woefully little about the history of Ecuador. But when I reached the game’s incredible climactic moment, which I wrote about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-game-moments-scenes-2025-clair-obscur-ending-2000655769"><span>here</span></a><span>, I practically stood up and cheered. I get it now. Sometimes, soccer really is life.</span></p> <h2><b>#3: </b><b><i>Terminator 2D: No Fate</i></b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000653424" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653424"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653424">© Bitmap Bureau</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Finally, we have the game that James Cameron’s seminal sci-fi flick has always deserved, a game that truly captures the movie’s pulse-pounding action and distinctive visual sensibilities. More than just a good licensed game (which is rare enough in itself), </span><i><span>No Fate </span></i><span>immediately establishes itself as one of the best arcade-style run-and-gun action games of all time.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I’ve heard a few people criticize the game for its brevity. It certainly is short, but I wouldn’t want it to be longer. A full playthrough of </span><i><span>Contra III: The Alien Wars</span></i><span>, one of the other greats in the genre, takes maybe 30 minutes, but it’s so jam-packed with showstopping setpieces and memorable moments that half an hour feels like a perfect length to me; after that, I’m ready to try for a higher score or tackle a tougher difficulty. The same principle applies here; a runthrough of </span><i><span>No Fate </span></i><span>might take 45 minutes or so (there are three possible routes through the game and some are longer than others), and when it’s over, I’m ready to catch my breath and then give it another shot. </span><i><span>No Fate </span></i><span>makes repeated attempts rewarding with a scoring system that sees you keep building up a multiplier as long as you don’t take damage; I’ve already seen some </span><a href="https://barbarian.men/macaw45/2645969570#24130"><span>amazing efforts to get high scores</span></a><span> that show off some really skilled, high-level play. </span><i><span>No Fate </span></i><span>also makes harder difficulty options worthwhile, changing enemy placement and behavior to make the game tougher in an interesting way rather than just going the route of giving enemies more health.</span></p> <p><span>But ultimately it’s the stage design, pixel art, and wonderfully precise controls that make this game a masterpiece. It constantly keeps you on your toes, tossing you from future war run-and-gun scenarios to breathless vehicle chases to stealthy prison escapes, all animated beautifully and moving along at an exhilarating pace. A number of fairly high-profile games this year tried to recapture and build on the excitement offered by some of the best 2D sidescrollers of the ‘80s and ‘90s, but for my money, this is the only one that really knocked it out of the park. It’s a total banger.</span></p> <h2><span>&nbsp;</span><b>#2: </b><b><i>Blippo+</i></b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656284" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656284"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656284">©Panic</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I watched some crap on TV when I was young of course, </span><i><span>He-Man </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Knight Rider </span></i><span>and whatnot, but TV also often felt like a way to broaden my horizons. In the ‘90s, I think channel surfing and stumbling on cool, random shit was a pretty common experience for people, and it was certainly one I had time and again. I liked venturing into the world of TV without consulting a </span><i><span>Guide</span></i><span> and just seeing what I’d find. Maybe </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKl6B2CX2tY"><span>Huell Howser</span></a><span> would show me some aspect of California history I was unfamiliar with, or I might catch the end of an R-rated movie, all the swears </span><a href="https://youtu.be/H-y1PAUtv3k?si=lHDS0sJOocQwJqpq"><span>hilariously dubbed over</span></a><span> for broadcast TV, that blew my mind. TV was a gateway to learning about nature, </span><a href="https://youtu.be/Zr3JfDYpjt0?si=gNvo77FQdI-PseKL"><span>being exposed to art</span></a><span>, and sometimes just seeing human beings doing weird and interesting things.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Blippo+ </span></i><span>recaptures that feeling of just flipping through the channels and stumbling on good stuff. Its varied assortment of programs–ostensibly signals from an alien planet much like our own–includes game shows, talk shows, cooking shows, science shows, news programs, and more, each with its own distinct vibe, yet united by a cohesive aesthetic that gives the whole thing the fuzzy warmth and genuine humanity of, say, old Bob Ross episodes or other PBS programming funded by viewers like you. But </span><i><span>Blippo+ </span></i><span>is more than just a collection of TV shows, it’s also a fascinating narrative experience that immerses us in a culture on the brink of potentially radical change. A better world is possible, and the revolution just might be televised.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>#1: </b><b><i>Shadow Labyrinth</i></b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656287" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656287"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656287">©Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Okay, I need you to understand something. I was very young when Pac-Man became the world’s first video game superstar, but I do remember it. And look, Pac-Man was everywhere; in cartoons, on t-shirts and magazine covers, in hit pop songs. But here’s the thing: there was no one singular image of Pac-Man. On arcade cabinets, he looked like an armless yellow blob. In </span><a href="https://www.gamesdatabase.org/media/atari-5200/artwork-box/pac-man"><span>the box art for the Atari 5200 version</span></a><span>, he looked like a sleek floating sphere. In </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/9blzq0/my_coworker_worked_at_atari_in_the_80s_heres_her/"><span>this stunning envisioning</span></a><span> by Japanese artist Hiro Kimura, apparently rejected by Atari due to its terrifying rendition of the ghosts, Pac-Man is a little metallic robot man gobbling wafers and wearing track shorts and a Pac-Man t-shirt.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000656285" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656285"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656285">©Atari</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Nowadays, established video game characters often have their appearance totally standardized, and every incarnation of them has to be “on-model.” Earlier this year, for instance, when Donkey Kong started </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-mario-kart-9-nintendo-switch-2-new-design-1851742086"><span>sporting a slightly altered look</span></a><span>, we all took notice, and knew that this decision had been made and approved by Nintendo on high. But when I was young, video game characters were in flux. I was free to imagine Pac-Man in any number of ways, none of them “canonically” accurate but all of them feeling like they reflected, in some way, the strange, abstract experience of playing </span><i><span>Pac-Man</span></i><span>. I miss the feeling that game characters exist as much in the realm of the imagination as they do on the screen.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Now I need you to understand something else. When I was young, the world was just trying to figure out what video games </span><i><span>meant</span></i><span>, how they might function as part of our society and our artistic landscape. </span><i><span>TRON</span></i><span>, a formative viewing experience for me, imagined worlds within our computers in which these games actually played out, while </span><i><span>The Last Starfighter </span></i><span>suggested that an arcade cabinet could be an intergalactic test of skill, a way to find the fighter pilot who could accomplish in real life what the game asked them to do onscreen. And I was a kid with a very overactive imagination. My home life was, shall we say, not great, and at school I mostly felt like a weirdo who didn’t really understand how to interact with the world around me. But in games, I could be capable, heroic even. And so, at six or seven, I would sometimes imagine that, as in </span><i><span>TRON</span></i><span>, whatever I was seeing on my screen was actually happening in some other realm somewhere, and that maybe my actions were making a difference.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>A link to the past</b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656277" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656277"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656277">©Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p><span>When you first fire up </span><i><span>Shadow Labyrinth</span></i><span>, the start menu screen shows a figure in a city on a rainy night, sitting on a bench and playing a gaming handheld. As soon as you launch the game, the figure disappears, their device abandoned on the ground. The game’s intro, a cavalcade of over-the-top anime nonsense, shows a human soul being summoned from beyond into the body that will serve as the game’s player character. To me, the implication seemed clear: the game is suggesting that we and the player character are literally one, that we have been summoned into the world of the game to help right whatever might be wrong in this strange world. And though I no longer give myself over to my imagination the way I did when I was six, I enjoyed the imaginative playfulness of this choice, the way it seemed to ask me to remember that part of myself that once believed that video games were one part technology, one part magic. Games don’t always activate that part of me anymore. It’s a nice surprise when they do.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>From that point on, </span><i><span>Shadow Labyrinth </span></i><span>continued to surprise me. I went in expecting a modest game, one that might take me 12 hours or so and offer some standard Metroidvania enjoyment. Instead, its world kept expanding beyond my expectations, surprising me both with its scale and its strangeness. Not since my first time playing </span><i><span>Symphony of the Night </span></i><span>has a game’s world impressed and bewildered me so much.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And now I want to go back to that Kojima quote I kicked things off with. At no point, in any way, did </span><i><span>Shadow Labyrinth </span></i><span>ever feel “pre-digested” for my enjoyment. Its moment-to-moment gameplay felt fine, but it didn’t have that luscious quality that so many games strive for. And I </span><i><span>like</span></i><span> this about it. If you transport me to some other world, I’m not gonna be some badass ninja. It felt like some situation I had stumbled into and was making the best of; what I never felt was the concern of the developers, obsessing over some need to make the game feel the way games like </span><i><span>Hades </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>do. It felt as if the controls simply…were.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000656286" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656286"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656286">©Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Similarly, </span><i><span>Shadow Labyrinth </span></i><span>never seemed concerned with me understanding exactly what I needed to do next, or with me being able to conveniently find a save spot, or with me understanding its strange story. It all felt, top to bottom, like a true journey of </span><i><span>discovery</span></i><span>, in ways that games, in my experience, so rarely do these days. I loved simply stumbling upon references to Bandai Namco properties other than Pac-Man. (The first time I found myself in an area with the enemies from </span><i><span>Dig Dug</span></i><span>, I gasped in delight.) I loved needing to remember for myself where I might find some type of enemy I needed to fight to acquire some item. I loved figuring out for myself how to hunt down and defeat a boss who looked like a physical manifestation of </span><i><span>Pac Man</span></i><span>’s famous killscreen glitch.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I’m very well aware that </span><i><span>Shadow Labyrinth </span></i><span>was made by developers. But I admire this game so much more because they worked so hard to make it feel as if it </span><i><span>wasn’t</span></i><span>, as if this really is just a strange, hostile world that we’ve been thrust into. The part of my imagination that this game reawakened likes to think that perhaps this game is the “true story,” the real place where games like </span><i><span>Pac Man </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Galaga </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Dig Dug </span></i><span>all come from, and those arcade games were little echoes of this world, little dreamlike manifestations of it, brought into our world by the Namco game designers of the 1980’s.</span></p> <p><span>With </span><i><span>Shadow Labyrinth</span></i><span>, Bandai Namco eschewed the tendency toward safety and standardization that sometimes limits games themselves and how we allow ourselves to imagine them. I never once felt the developers looking over my shoulder, worrying about whether I was getting frustrated or finding it all “well-designed” enough. This is a game in which the rules that say a character needs to be a certain thing or look a certain way don’t apply at all, an expression of that wild range of possibility that surrounds games when we set them free from specific ideas of appearance or genre and let them coalesce into something strange, risky, and new. </span></p>

Between these events, you must gather food, craft tools and weapons, and consult shamans for guidance. Once these events happen, break out the miniatures and the dice. These skirmishes and hunts are resolved using a d10-based alternating activation system.</p><p>The core experience of <em>Hide, Stone, and Bone</em> is its detailed campaign system. The ultimate goal is survival. This means, even if the dice are against you while fighting other tribes, your group can still thrive in the long run.</p><p>The game is the tabletop debut of Austin Hunt.

            <link>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/31/why-im-excited-for-capcoms-weird-and-charming-buddy-action-game-pragmata</link>
            <guid>1395106</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Pragmata captured my attention way back in *checks notes* 2020 (wow). I finally played Pragmata earlier this year at Gamescom and walked away both thoroughly impressed and annoyed with Capcom for making my demo only 20 minutes long. Following a new trailer at The Game Awards 2025, which showed off new gameplay in New York City, an engaging reprieve from the lunar station that’s been heavily showcased so far, Capcom released a demo for the game; it’s basically what I played earlier this year and I can’t recommend it enough. It quickly highlights how unique Pragmata’s gameplay is, which mixes third-person gunplay with real-time hacking minigames.</p><p>“From the start, the core vision was a buddy-action experience where you would control two distinct characters with a single controller,” Pragmata director Yongchee Cho tells me. The team explored giving protagonist Hugh a small drone that aids him in combat, but once the developers landed on the android Diana as a second protagonist, this idea evolved into the hacking system. This created various layers of gameplay that all happen at once, and when coupled with the mysterious narrative and various locales warped and twisted by Luna Filament, the name Pragmata makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The word comes from Greek, meaning things, actions, or facts, and in philosophy, it connects to pragmatism,” Cho tells me. “A single word carrying so many layers of meaning felt like the perfect fit for the story and world of this game.”&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of that Luna Filament, it's the stuff that's causing New York City's Times Square to look so different in the latest Pragmata trailer, and that's not the only location that will be transformed by this mysterious substance. Cho says it's key to the sci-fi world Capcom is creating in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>"We want players to enjoy diving into the unique sci-fi world that defines Pragmata, and not just the protagonists and their interactions," he says. "You'll come across areas warped by Luna Filament, where strange reactions and irregular structures create an atmosphere that feels both alien and intriguing. The game is full of moments and locales that spark curiosity, whether you're into sci-fi or not, and those surprises run throughout the game.</p><p>"Personally, I can't wait to see the incredible, super-plays players pull off once they get their hands on it."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkP_YZxuP1s"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkP_YZxuP1s" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Those super-plays will be performed throughout Pragmata by the two unlikely protagonists, Hugh and Diana. Cho says Hugh tends to be laid-back and reluctant, but has a strong sense of responsibility. It's no surprise, then, that he teams up with Diana.&nbsp;</p><p>"At first glance, he might seem distant, yet deep down, he's a kind person," Cho adds. "Diana might have felt like a burden early on, but through their explorations of the space station, he gradually starts to see her as someone he truly wants to help. We worked hard to express that side of Hugh's character, not only in dialogue, but also during combat throughout the game."&nbsp;</p><p>On the flip side, Cho describes Diana as an android girl with vast AI knowledge but little real-world experience, making her a perfect fit for Hugh. "She's full of curiosity about a world she knows almost nothing about," Cho says. "She originally intended to stay on the Moon, but meeting Hugh gives her a new purpose, and she chooses to travel with him. As they journey together, learning from Hugh's experience, Diana becomes increasingly fascinated by Earth and eager to discover more."&nbsp;</p><p>The Moon, Earth, and other settings we'll visit in Pragmata are inspired by all manner of media, Cho tells me. "The character-driven story takes cues from human drama; the visual world borrows ideas from animation and Hollywood films; and the mechanical design and presentation are influenced by Japanese animation," he says. "Of course, it's not just about inspiration. We've blended these influences while preserving the unique atmosphere that makes Pragmata stand apart."&nbsp;</p><p>Pragmata launches in April, so we don't have to wait long to see whether it really stands out from its inspirations. If what we've played so far is any indication – and don't forget, you can check out a Pragmata demo right now – Cho and team are on the right track.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/31/why-im-excited-for-capcoms-weird-and-charming-buddy-action-game-pragmata]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-platformers-of-2026-new-adventures-in-familiar-worlds/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If Hollow Knight Silksong was the only platformer released in 2025, that alone would make 2025 a great year for platformers. Thankfully, as you'll know by checking out our picks for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-platformers-of-2025-jumping-and-smashing-to-victory/">Best Platformers of 2025</a>, there was more than Hollow Knight Silksong to be excited about.</p>



<p>Now that Silksong is out, we platformer fans can stop waiting for its release and look forward to what's coming in 2026. Here are Wccftech's picks for the Most Anticipated Platformers for 2026.</p>



<p><em>Other Wccftech's Most Anticipated 2026 Games per category:</em> <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-role-playing-games-of-2026-legends-and-legacies/">Role-Playing Games</a></strong></em>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2026/">Indie Games</a></em></strong></p>



<h2 id="h-tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Tomb-Raider-Legacy-of-Atlantis.png"></a><figcaption><em>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis. Image credit: Amazon Game Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lara Croft is making yet another comeback, and this time, Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog Studios are bringing players back to how things were when she raided tombs on the original PlayStation in 1996. Legacy of Atlantis is a reimagining of the original game, in all of its adventuring and 3D platforming glory, with a massive visual upgrade to go along with it.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-2026-tomb-raider-catalyst-new-entry-in-2027/">reveal at The Game Awards</a> showed off a small clip of gameplay, which showed that while you'll definitely spend a fair amount of time shooting raptors while duel-wielding pistols, you'll also be jumping to avoid traps and clear obstacles like you would have back in the 90s. Obviously, at this point, we don't know how much of the gameplay will focus on platforming, but it doesn't seem to be tossed to the side. There's definitely more than a small chance that it is one of the more engaging platformers in 2026, and hopefully it lives up to that expectation.</p>



<h2 id="h-bloodstained-the-scarlet-engagement-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Bloodstained-The-Scarlet-Engagement.png"></a><figcaption><em>Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement. Image credit: 505 Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>All of the Bloodstained games are 2D platformers, but within them are two different art styles. The Curse of the Moon games are both pixel art, more classic-era Castlevania-looking games, while the Ritual of the Night and one of our picks, the Scarlet Engagement, have a more modern, 2D/3D style with more detailed character models.</p>



<p>Hundreds of games have tried to capture the magic of the original Castlevania games, but Bloodstained has been consistently successful at presenting Castlevania nostalgia while still maintaining its own flavour. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-the-night-is-still-young/">Ritual of the Night is arguably one of the better</a> of the three currently available Bloodstained games, and by the time The Scarlet Engagement arrives, it'll have been seven years since it came out on PC and last-gen consoles. </p>



<p>Hopefully, The Scarlet Engagement can pick up where Ritual of the Night left off and deliver a platforming experience that can stand amongst the best of its contemporaries.</p>



<h2 id="h-yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book-spring-2026-nintendo-switch-2">Yoshi and the Mysterious Book (Spring 2026 - Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoshi-and-the-Mysterious-Book-Announced.png"></a><figcaption><em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book. Image credit: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Platforming fans everywhere are still waiting for their <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-will-cost-70-wont-get-another-delay-ex-rockstar-animator-says/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> reveal (a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-fans-stay-tuned-future-nintendo-directs-hints-miyamoto-mobile-focus-done/">new 3D Mario platformer</a>), but Yoshi's Island fans are in good shape because we have Yoshi and the Mysterious Book to look forward to.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book-nintendo-switch-2-spring-2026/">upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive</a> is the first new Yoshi game since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yoshis-crafted-world-crafty-business/">Yoshi's Crafted World in 2019</a>, making this the second game on this list that'll have a seven-year gap between its most recent series entry. We haven't seen too much of the game, but its likeness to Yoshi's Island is undeniable. If that inspiration follows through to its gameplay, then we'll have one of the better 2D platformers Nintendo has put out in a while on our hands.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-may-29-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch-2">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight (May 29, 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/LEGO-Batman-Legacy-of-the-Dark-Knight-Release-Date-1.png"></a><figcaption><em>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight. Image credit: Warner Bros.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The LEGO games have always been a mix of puzzle-platforming with some light combat and adventuring, and even though LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight looks like it'll be the most expansive, most open-world-like game in the modern era of LEGO games yet, there's no reason to believe it won't include plenty of 3D platforming.</p>



<p>It seems like it'll have a bit more of an Arkham-style focus on combat and open-world mechanics, but it's still a LEGO game. There's a good chance some of the combat focus the Arkham games have will be swept away for more platforming, and TT Games has more than proven capable of creating some excellent platforming adventures. It's good to have a Batman game we can actually look forward to, instead of one where no one is all that convinced it'll be worth checking out, only to be proven right (looking at you, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gotham-knights-batfamilys-competent-but-no-batman/">Gotham Knights</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/">Suicide Squad</a>).</p>



<h2 id="h-darwin-s-paradox-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch-2">Darwin's Paradox (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Darwins-Paradox.png"></a><figcaption><em>Darwin's Paradox. Image credit: Konami</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Our last but in no way least pick of our most anticipated games, Darwin's Paradox, is a real fish-out-of-water scenario as you take on the role of a blue octopus that is quite literally out of his natural habitat. Getting back to the ocean and getting back home is the ultimate goal, and along the way you'll be put into what looks like more than a few tricky platforming situations.</p>



<p>Darwin's Paradox looks like it'll be a strong spectacle when it comes to its visual presentation and a few core set-pieces throughout the game's story, and hopefully, it's able to lean on the squiggly and sticky nature of the octopus to create some inventive platforming scenes.</p>



<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>



<p>As is the case with every category, not everything we're looking forward to in 2026 can make our main list. The following are our honourable mentions for our most anticipated platformers for 2026.</p>



<p>But before that, a huge asterisk on our main list. Our top honourable mention is an Unannounced Mario 3D platformer, because when it launches, it'll likely be the most significant game for the genre since Super Mario Odyssey. But without any actual announcement, it didn't feel right having it take the place of another game that we actually know will arrive this year. </p>



<p>It was already a shock that the Nintendo Switch 2 didn't launch with a new Mario platformer, so we can't exactly bet on it happening in 2026. So if you felt its absence from the main list, that's why. With that out of the way, here are our honourable mentions.</p>



<ul>
<li>Unannounced Mario 3D Platformer</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/reanimal-release-date-tarsier-studios/">Reanimal</a></li>

            <p>Sony has unveiled its PS Plus monthly game offerings for January.</p>
<p>The three games below will be available to all PlayStation Plus members regardless of tier subscription from Tuesday 6th January to Monday 2nd February.</p>
<ul>
<li>Need for Speed Unbound | PS5</li>

<p>We didn't review Core Keeper, I'm afraid, but Matt thought the Epic Mickey remaster was "transformative", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-mickey-rebrushed-a-flawed-fascinating-curio-transformed">writing</a>: "In its original guise Epic Mickey was a bit of a disappointment, its clever design, admirable ambition, and a bold approach to its source material undone by just a little too much mechanical awkwardness."</p>
<figure>

<p>Former editor-in-chief Martin similarly had a good time with Need for Speed Unbound, stating in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/need-for-speed-unbound-review-the-best-need-for-speed-in-a-generation">2022 'Recommended' review</a> that "Criterion takes the reins once more for an arcade racer that's capable of going toe-to-toe with the all-conquering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a>."</p>

<p>Awards for individual genres are amazing, and recognition for one game conquering a whole field of gameplay. However, this is the big one. There have been so many elite contenders for the 2025 Game of the Year accolades, and Insider Gaming has selected the one deemed the best.</p>



<p>12 months of video game releases have led to this big moment. Top-level developers have worked hard, and publishers have put their faith in games in the hope of being acknowledged as the best. 2025 has emptied wallets and consumed hours with amazing Roguelikes, RPGs, Action-Adventure games, and more.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a> has crowned a winner.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-game-of-2025-winner-hollow-knight-silksong">Best Game Of 2025 Winner—Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s a testament to numerous games that a few releases could be in this spot. If you can overlook the dastardly difficulty of Hollow Knight: Silksong and ignore the elitist conversation of a AAA game needing to be GOTY, then Silksong is a worthy winner, and the Insider Gaming team has spoken!</p>



<p>This year has seen Silksong go from being barely a figure in the shadows to receiving a launch date soon after it reemerged at Gamescom 2025 in August. It’s rare for an indie game to have the levels of hype it did, but that’s exactly what happened. It single-handedly took the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-xbox-eshop-offline-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam, Xbox, and eShop stores offline once downloads went live</a>, due to demand, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-beat-hollow-knight-all-time-peak-player-count-in-15-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decimated the original’s all-time peak player count in minutes</a>.</p>



<p>It’s one of the highest-rated games of 2025, and it’s a breathtaking adventure from start to finish. You’ll struggle to find indie games this beautiful and carefully manicured—there are no ugly edges to be found. The gameplay and depth of quests and things to do have been greatly expanded, and every locale feels unique. Combat is a steep learning curve, but there’s nothing wrong with that, and owners will receive the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow-dlc-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sea of Sorrow DLC</a> for free.</p>



<p>Silksong suddenly ended up being one of the year’s most anticipated games, and in Insider Gaming’s opinion, the best, without question.</p>



<h2 id="h-insider-gaming-game-of-the-year-2025-runner-up-clair-obscur-expedition-33">Insider Gaming Game of the Year 2025 Runner-Up—Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Another accolade. Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>So many turn-based RPGs successfully execute one or more aspects of a game: Gameplay, Story, Performances, Music, and Art. Very few dare to tackle them all head-on and nail it! Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 wasn’t as hyped as Silksong was, but it emerged as one of the most must-play RPGs of the modern era.</p>



<p>Yes, Sandfall Interactive’s first game was created by world-class developers with years of AAA experience. It didn’t mean Clair Obscur would work by any means. The odd design choice here and there could maybe have used some more work, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI controversy</a> does leave the slightest of sour tastes in the mouth.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is an easy runner-up. With other games like Hades 2, Blue Prince, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 all delivering their own serving of excellence, respect needs to be put on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s name.</p>



<p>This is one of the best games in years.</p>



<p>It’s likely many of you would swap our winner and runner-up around—or omit Hollow Knight: Silksong altogether! If you have thoughts or your own winner, head to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> to discuss them.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/need-for-speed-unbound-ps-plus-essential-january-2026/">Shortly after the headlining game for January's PS Plus Essential titles leaked</a>, PlayStation has come out and <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/31/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-january-need-for-speed-unbound-disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-core-keeper/">announced the full PS Plus Essential lineup</a> for the first month of 2026. Not only does it include Need for Speed Unbound, but all PS Plus subscribers will be able to enjoy Epic Mickey Rebrushed and Core Keeper.</p>



<p>It's back to the three-game norm, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-five-games-december-2025-lego-horizon-adventures-neon-white/">December 2025's lineup of Essential titles</a> included five games total. While Need for Speed is the headliner, it's arguably <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/disneys-epic-mickey-rebrushed-what-could-have-been/">Epic Mickey Rebrushed</a> that's the most exciting title of the bunch. Core Keeper isn't a slouch either, as the 1-8 player co-op game is a good option to cozy up with as we get into the cold of January.</p>



<p>All three titles will be available for players to redeem as of January 6, 2026, which means that you'll have until January 5, 2026, to redeem the five games that were made available to players in December 2025.</p>

Strangely, despite its impressive performance in the sales stakes, <em>PUBG </em>isn't the most-played game of the year; that honor goes to <em>Grand Theft Auto V </em>(and, by extension, <em>GTA Online</em>).</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>GTA V</em>, and thus presumably <em>GTA Online</em>, has made it onto Steam's Best of 2025 list.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's a real live-service jamboree in the top sellers list; other titles include <em>Arc Raiders</em>, which also managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-sales-4m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="08dd5792-c4a8-4824-90f6-27b50a7dc7fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hit a pretty impressive sales milestone</a> in its first couple of weeks, as well as <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, <em>Battlefield 6</em>, and <em>Apex Legends</em>.</p><p>The first non-multiplayer title on the list after <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II </em>is the drug-dealing simulator <em>Schedule I</em>, followed by <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which is arguably on the borderline given its cycle of frequent updates (although it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3047bd12-37c9-4b65-bd39-064968be79fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">certainly is a big seller</a>).</p><p>When it comes to the Steam Deck, the most-played games of the year skew much more towards time sink-style single-player adventures, including the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-v-has-sold-over-195-million-units-red-dead-redemption-2-at-61-million" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="79f14bf8-3a01-4742-90f0-f879fca71b70" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Red Dead Redemption II</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-has-way-over-10-million-players-mod-support-has-been-in-works-since" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a6faddb2-01d3-46aa-a769-c7be021e6a4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, and <em>Hollow Knight </em>(although two of those do indeed support multiplayer).</p><p>The list even tracks the games most often played with a controller, and it won't shock you to learn that the likes of <em>Split Fiction</em>, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, and, yes, <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em>figure heavily on that particular list.</p><figure role="group">

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> was Steam's biggest-selling game over the holiday period.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4777282/view/502844844914248084">SteamDB</a>, which revealed that the biggest-selling games by revenue on the digital platform from 23rd-30th December were Arc Raiders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>Interestingly, if you look at all <em>products</em> sold on Steam, not just games, Steam Deck takes the runner-up spot, but given this chart organises top-selling games by revenue, not unit sales, that shouldn't be a complete surprise.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-is-offloading-14%e2%80%b3-laptop-bundle-to-its-lowest-price-now-cheaper-than-an-entry-level-ipad-2000654516</link>
            <guid>1395025</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You don’t have to spend thousands on a new laptop, especially if you’re just after an everyday machine for casual work and home use. If you’re shopping for one today, we’ve got great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6631/">Amazon, very generously, has dropped the price of the 14-inch HP computer in Silver to just $300, after taking a massive 35% off its usual price.</a> Your purchase will come with a free 8-in-1 hub, as well as a one-year subscription to Microsoft Office 365; both of which add even more value to the current offer. It’s one of the lowest we have seen this model drop to, but as you’d expect, the discount ends soon. Be sure to snap it up fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6631/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Decent Performance for Regular Tasks</h2>
<p>We won’t sugarcoat it; this laptop is not a powerhouse. It’s appropriate for home use like simple browsing, streaming, video calling, and some basic work tasks. We won’t exactly recommend it to work professionals, but it’s a good pick for seniors who want their own device or kids who are just getting started. You’re getting a modest 14-inch HD display that delivers decent visuals for all your needs. The anti-glare coating makes it easy on the eyes and keeps the picture quality consistent across all lighting conditions. You can view the screen comfortably in daylight (while soaking up some sun), as well as in dim settings after the shadows fall.</p>
<p>The 4GB DDR4 RAM isn’t made for heavy-duty multitasking, but it does a good job of keeping everything running smoothly, as long as you’re not trying to push some creative boundaries. There’s 128GB flash storage, which is nicely paired with a 128GB Micro SD to give you a total of 256GB space to save all your files, content, and programs. It’s more than enough to house hundreds of photos, a ton of videos, a few movies to stay entertained on the go, all your favorite songs downloaded, and more. Power comes from the 4-core Intel N150 processor, which hits up to 3.6 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost Technology.</p>



<p>Wireless connectivity comes from Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.4, while ports like USB Type-C (10Gbps), two USB Type-A, HDMI 1.4b, and an SD card reader make it easy to connect other peripherals without feeling limited. Windows 11 S also comes pre-installed, so the laptop will be ready to go right out of the box. The highlight here, however, is the one-year subscription to Microsoft 365 Office. This gives you access to premium apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, OneDrive, Teams, and more. You can use these to create documents, be creative with presentations, work on large spreadsheets, and communicate with teams around the world remotely. The subscription typically costs around $100 a year, but you’re getting it here for absolutely free!</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to grab a new everyday laptop for regular use, this Amazon deal lets you pick one for basically nothing. Again, it’s not made for heavy-duty work, creative projects, or gaming. It’s designed for basic use, and it does that job quite well. Getting your orders in now will help ensure they reach you before Christmas, which is great if you’re planning to surprise a loved one with a new laptop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6631/">Additionally, shipping is free, so $300 is all you’ve got to pay today.</a></p>
