                <p>Former Sony Online Entertainment chief John Smedley and his new team at Distinct Possibility Studio have unveiled their first game, Reaper Actual. And while some aspects of this first-person shooter may seem very familiar to CoD fans, it's set in a very large-scale persistent online open-world with a map that's bigger than anything in Call of Duty Warfare. Up to 200 players can join a single server in some of the epic battles teased in the announcement video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_Jb0jjlS4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XC_Jb0jjlS4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>At least for now, Reaper Actual is strictly for PC, and it's essentially the fusion of an MMO and a FPS. The game is set on an island called Marova, which is overrun by rival factions vying for control. As a Reaper, players can sell their services to the various factions on the island, and use all manner of vehicles and weapons to achieve their goals.</p><p>Because the factions are already at odds with each other, the enemy AI characters will wage war with or without players' involvement. Players can choose to take sides or take advantage of the chaos for their own purposes. Players can also create their own bases to defend, and raid the bases that belong to other players or AI. In turn, AI characters and rival players can invade your base as well.</p><p>Control of the island will fluctuate depending upon which factions claim victory in battle. Players can choose to engage each other in PvP fights or to team up and take sides. The game will also feature a crafting system and a player-driven economy for the gear and items that they create.</p><p>Reaper Actual doesn't currently have a release date, but players can <a href="https://reaperactual.firstlook.gg/signup/foundationplayer/eligibility" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for testing at the game's official site</a>.</p>

<p>He said "I've been to the year 3000"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Sega has shared the opening theme to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> and, rather than pulling in familiar faces such as Crush40, Kellin Quinn, or Madeline Wood, there's a very familiar voice to a certain generation of people from the UK.</p>
<p>James Bourne of the British pop-punk band <strong>Busted</strong> — yes, really — is the lead vocalist on <strong>Cross the Worlds</strong>, the upcoming racer's opening song. We haven't heard the name Buster for a <em>long</em> time. Pinch us.</p>
<p>Composed by Takahiro Kai — one of the composers on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_superstars">Sonic Superstars</a> — the theme itself is very upbeat and pop-rock flavoured, not a million miles away from what we've come to expect from Sonic. A little cheesy? Maybe. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though.</p>
<figure><a title="Sonic Racing - Cross the Worlds - (Opening ver.)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d24338987dbb7/sonic-racing-cross-the-worlds-opening-ver.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Just in case you need to triple-check — <em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR9FGj1Bj70&amp;ab_channel=SonictheHedgehog">Sega</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're not sure just how well-known Busted are outside of the UK; the band was formed in 2000 and released two hit albums during their five-year tenure. "What I Go to School For" and "Year 3000" are probably their most well-known hits — the latter of these was covered by the <strong>Jonas Brothers</strong>, and Busted then re-recorded the song with the boy band in 2023.</p>
<p>The band broke up in 2005 so the members could pursue solo projects. Bourne is also the lead singer of the band <strong>Son of Dork</strong> and also had a brief solo career under the name <strong>Future Boy</strong>Future Bo, before supporting fellow British band <strong>McFly</strong> and forming <strong>McBusted</strong>. Busted reunited in 2015 and are still going.</p>
<p>So... there you have it! Not the collaboration we were expecting, and a bit of a blast from the past for many Brits, we're sure. Whether Bourne appears on other tracks in-game, we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds launches on Switch on 25th September, with a Switch 2 version following later. While the game will feature plenty of Sonic characters, we're also getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/sonic-racing-crossworlds-switch-2-version-announced-alongside-paid-upgrade-for-switch">Hatsune Miku, Ichiban Kasuga from Like a Dragon, Joker from Persona 5, Steve from Minecraft</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/sonic-racing-crossworlds-officially-reveals-nickelodeon-collaboration">Nickelodeon characters</a> as DLC racers.</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of Cross the Worlds in the comments</em>.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-hands-on-preview-a-crpg-full-of-potential/">New Arc Line</a>, a new cRPG from Fulqrum Publishing and developer Dreamate that launched in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458310/New_Arc_Line/">early access last November</a>, is getting its first major update later this month on July 17, 2025, with its Smoke &amp; Mirrors update. </p>



<p>Smoke &amp; Mirros will add a new playable race to the game as Dwarves get introduced, along with two new playable classes that'll be exclusively available to Dwarves before being made available to players playing as Humans or Elves. The update will also add a new questline for players to dig into called 'Step Behind the Curtain,' that'll also introduce a new location for players to explore called the Sacred Tree.</p>

</figure>



<p>The two new classes being added are the Hellfire Mage and the Steam Mechanic. The Hellfire Mage is pretty self-explanatory. It's the class to play if you want to inflict immense amounts of damage with fire attacks that can really burn anyone who tries to get in your way.</p>



<p>The Steam Mechanic relies on their equipment and ability for invention with steam-powered exoskeletons that help them deal with their foes. As stated previously, both the Hellfire Mage and Steam Mechanic classes will be exclusive to Dwarves before they're available for Human and Elf players sometime in the future. According to a press release from Fulqrum and Dreamate, they'll be available for other races "<em>through subsequent updates</em>."</p>



<p>When New Arc Line launched in early access last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-hands-on-preview-a-crpg-full-of-potential/">Wccftech checked out the release</a>, which showed potential, but as is the case with any game in early access, New Arc Line had plenty of room to grow. "<em>You can see the amount of love and effort that has gone into the game's worldbuilding to provide the balance between dystopia and utopia. I'm eager to see how New Arc Line develops throughout its early access journey.</em>"</p>

That makes attempts to shoehorn it into Xbox—whether through hallucinating gameplay prototypes or efforts to solve backwards compatibility woes—come off as particularly out of touch.

          <p>Two key writers of HBO's series&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em> are moving on, according to announcements on Instagram yesterday. Neil Druckmann, co-creator of the franchise, and Halley Gross, co-writer of <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em> and frequent writer on the show, are both leaving before work begins on season 3.</p>
<p>Both were credited as executive producers on the show; Druckmann frequently contributed writing to episodes, as did Gross, and Druckmann also directed. Druckmann and Gross co-wrote the second game, <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>.</p>
<p>Druckmann said in his announcement <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLnTt7ZPVbJ/">post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve made the difficult decision to step away from my creative involvement in <em>The Last of Us</em> on HBO. With work completed on season 2 and before any meaningful work starts on season 3, now is the right time for me to transition my complete focus to Naughty Dog and its future projects, including writing and directing our exciting next game, <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em>, along with my responsibilities as Studio Head and Head of Creative.</p>
<p>Co-creating the show has been a career highlight. It’s been an honor to work alongside Craig Mazin to executive produce, direct and write on the last two seasons. I’m deeply thankful for the thoughtful approach and dedication the talented cast and crew took to adapting <em>The Last of Us Part I</em> and the continued adaptation of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>And Gross <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLnVeDnPz9B/">said</a>:</p>

<section><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's massive success will likely influence future RPGs, but not every aspect should be taken as inspiration.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> took the gaming world by surprise when it became one of the best reviewed games of 2025 so far, and sold over 3.33 million copies. It hit levels of online conversation and praise often reserved for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Rings</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" data-ref-id="5000-497748">Legend of Zeldas</a> of the world. Part of that praise has described Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 as revitalizing the turn-based genre, something that isn't really true unless you only play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi/" data-ref-id="5000-519018">Final Fantasy</a> games. But with the high praise from critics and positive reception from fans, it seems likely that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 will influence future RPGs, and that can have both positive and negative repercussions. There are some aspects that maybe shouldn't be taken for other games, but there are systems in here that other RPG developers absolutely should learn from.</p><h2 dir="ltr">RPGs should steal character-specific combat mechanics</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4526273-claircharactermechanics.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526273" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4526273-claircharactermechanics.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526273"></a><figcaption>Sciel's foretell system creates a simple loop to build more complicated builds around.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4526273-claircharactermechanics.jpg"></figure><p>On paper, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's use of character-specific combat mechanics just feels like a different version of classes or jobs in turn-based combat, but it goes beyond that. While a knight will excel at different aspects of combat than a mage, the flow of combat for each is typically either the same or has small differences, like the type of buffs and debuffs you can apply to each character.</p><p dir="ltr">The combat differences in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 go far beyond class differences, and allow for great class building as a result. For example, the way that Maelle's stance changing works encourages far different Lumina builds compared to Monocco or Lune, creating five characters that feel like distinct individuals, and not just class archetypes.</p><h2 dir="ltr">RPGs should avoid parrying (yes, really)</h2><p dir="ltr">Parrying is fundamental to both Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's combat and success, as it offers an engaging way to actively participate in turn-based combat. Yet part of the reason that it works <em>is because it's</em> <em>fundamental</em>--the entire game is built around parrying enemies. Enemy movements, combat difficulty, and entire aspects of character builds are designed entirely around this system.</p><p dir="ltr">Due to the popularity of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice/" data-ref-id="5000-483352">Sekiro</a> and other FromSoftware games, parrying has become fairly commonplace in video games of late. This not only makes the mechanic feel far more stale than it should, but it has also made it easy to identify the two types of parry games. There are parry games like Sekiro and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, that are built around parrying, and there are games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-first-berserker-khazan/" data-ref-id="5000-561804">The First Berzerker: Khazan</a>, that have parrying, but aren't reliant upon the mechanic.</p><p dir="ltr">Sekiro and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 require parrying, and are designed around that. Enemies attack in ways meant to confuse your ability to parry, but always follow the same attack patterns, so they can be learned. In other experiences, parrying is a tool in your tool belt, and because you don't have to use it, enemy attack patterns can't be built with that in mind. It often becomes the most powerful move in that kind of game, since parrying deflects away attacks and will offer an opening for a strong attack. In those cases, parrying actually takes away from the other aspects of combat.</p><p dir="ltr">What RPG makers should take from Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is that they should invest in combat systems that feature aspects that add depth and dynamism to turn-based games, and build around those features--not that they should just copy Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's homework. Turn-based RPGs have been utilizing active elements for decades with games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-rpg-legend-of-the-seven-stars/" data-ref-id="5000-17691">Super Mario RPG</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-2004/" data-ref-id="5000-20445">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>, and the best examples share that purposeful use of active elements. Another turn-based game could use parrying successfully, but if it's just being tacked on because it's popular, the results won't be anywhere near as successful.</p><h2 dir="ltr">RPGs should steal more impactful equipment</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4526276-clairparry.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526276" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4526276-clairparry.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526276"></a><figcaption>Weapons having such impactful passives makes each one feel more unique than equipment in some other turn-based RPGs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4526276-clairparry.jpg"></figure><p>Weapons, Luminas, and Pictos are some of the more underrated aspects of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, as those systems allow for creative (and busted) combat builds. While I don't need these specifically lifted, nor do I need every RPG to allow me to break the combat with a busted build, I find that many RPG's equipment feels so simple that it's not worth thinking about beyond the numbers getting bigger.</p><p dir="ltr">Weapons in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 all have unique passive abilities that drastically change how you play. For example, the weapon I used with Sciel always applied the maximum amount of Foretell, instead of the amount listed on a skill. That allowed me to use skills with lower costs to apply Foretell, since I would always get the max, so I could use the savings to afford higher-cost abilities that apply extra damage based on Foretell, maximizing my damage. If I used a different weapon, I would have had to completely change my battle strategy. The way these aspects can drastically change your approach even to a single character offers so much more depth than many RPGs.</p><h2 dir="ltr">RPGs should avoid a complete lack of map markers</h2><p dir="ltr">The pushback against game world maps covered in objective markers has been going strong, reaching a fever pitch with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" data-ref-id="5000-107502">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> in 2017, which opted to have few objective markers on its massive map. People against objective markers argue that they turn any amount of story-telling or exploration that could happen into you just going from one objective to the next, not engaging with the spaces in between.</p><p dir="ltr">The argument has been that not having map markers encourages exploration and discovery, and when implemented well, like in <em>Elden Ring</em>, it works wonders. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 does not have level design, nor overworld design, that works well with a lack of objective markers. The most successful examples are open-world games, but Clair Obscur features small, mostly linear levels. Even the side areas are usually short, winding areas, so instead of a lack of map markers leading to engaging exploration, it leads to you getting lost in these areas, as you can't always identify which way leads forward and which leads back once you get turned around.</p><p dir="ltr">The overworld map suffers not because it's easy to get lost, but because so many areas are best left to come back to. But once you reach the point where you want to go back, you'll realize you aren't sure which areas you've explored, and which ones you haven't. Without an in-game tracker, or even something as simple as stamps for the map, you're left to your memory or a checklist outside of the game, which can take you out of the story.</p><h2 dir="ltr">RPGs should steal fast intros</h2><p dir="ltr">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has received high praise for its shorter runtime, clocking in somewhere between 24-60 hours, shorter than other high-profile turn-based RPGs, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metaphor-refantazio/" data-ref-id="5000-590950">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth/" data-ref-id="5000-590944">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>. While I think there is a place for RPGs of all lengths, there is an aspect of Clair Obscur's shorter run time that I do think other RPGs should steal.</p><p dir="ltr">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 hits the ground running. You get a brief but really effective walk around the city of Lumiere at the start that provides tons of world-building to chew on, before quickly sending you out into the world. Turn-based RPGs can often spend a ton of time at the start, front-loading a ton of world-building, resulting in it taking a few hours to actually get into the rhythm of the game. Clair Obscur's fast intros not only provide a more enticing hook to stick around, but the faster pace also means that it doesn't have the time to overwhelm you with backstory and proper nouns. The slow introductions in other RPGs are often used to do a large amount of exposition and world-building, which can not only make for a slow start to the story, but can also overload you with information, making it difficult to actually digest.</p><p dir="ltr">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 will continue to be a hot topic when it comes to games, especially in conversation with other RPGs. It has a great shot at making an appearance in many outlets' game of the year conversations, so it's likely to be on the mind of other developers for a while, too. But while there are plenty of great aspects of Clair Obscur to take inspiration from, hopefully not every element will make an appearance in future turn-based RPGs, and developers will put ingenuity first.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, independent developer Distinct Possibility Studios announced REAPER ACTUAL, an open world persistent first-person shooter game. The studio is led by a trio of former <a href="https://wccftech.com/planetside-2-interview-its-back-and-here-to-stay/">PlanetSide 2</a> developers: Matthew Higby, Trammel Isaac, and John Smedley. Indeed, the game seems to carry forward some of that game's unique MMO-like features.</p>



<p>Just like in PlanetSide 2, victories and defeats in PvP fights will reshape control of the game's island map in real time, but in REAPER ACTUAL, there are also NPCs to contend with. Players have a progression and crafting system to build the best gear, which stays in the world. There will be player-controlled strongholds that allow you to craft items, produce weapons, and defend your territory. The position must be fortified, because both NPC factions and other players can raid your base. </p>



<p>Distinct Possibility Studio also promises a dynamic Narrative Progression where handcrafted story arcs merge seamlessly with an in-game mission system. Players are constantly drawn into conflict against each other and the island’s relentless native factions. When it comes to combat, players will find that precision-focused gunplay, cover systems, and squad coordination are essential to victory. Just like in PlanetSide 2, there will be land, sea, and air vehicles, allowing for a combined arms experience. REAPER ACTUAL also features a player-driven economy, with players building not just guns, but gear as well, from night vision to goggles, communication devices, and vehicles.</p>



<p>Higby, Chief Creative Officer at Distinct Possibility, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>We are moving toward the next level of persistent FPS combat. Players want a world they can live in and build upon. Having a solid base is only the start in REAPER ACTUAL. Once faction missions interweave with PvP combat, the world becomes a swirling battleground of options for players. Mix that with a full crafting system and Reapers will grow every time you log in to play.</em></p>

<p>The only caveat is that <span>a standalone version of the game will integrate the Etherlink blockchain to allow for trading of in-game assets. According to the developer, this won't affect the&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2995670/Reaper_Actual/" target="_blank">Steam</a>&nbsp;or Epic Game</span>s Store versions. Although no release window is imminent, the store pages already include the minimum and recommended system requirements for REAPER ACTUAL.</p>

And <em>Battlefield’s </em>most successful game, <em>BF1</em>, reached “maybe 30 million plus” players, according to one anonymous source. </p><p>EA declied to provide a comment to <em>Ars Techinca</em>. </p><p>To help reach that high player count, EA has enlisted multiple studios to work on the next <em>Battlefield </em>together. The idea was for some teams to work on different parts of the game to create one larger package. <em>BF6 </em>is reported to include a free-to-play mode, multiple premium online options, and even a full single-player suite as well as a community-driven game mode. But this plan has reportedly led to tension between Dice, the original creators of <em>Battlefield</em>, and EA leadership, who have taken more control over the next entry after <em>2042 </em>flopped out of the gate.</p><h2 id="h868910"><a id=""></a>The high cost of making the next <em>Battlefield </em></h2><p>EA’s desire to compete with <em>Fortnite </em>and<em> Call of Duty,</em> while building something this big across so many teams located in different parts of the world, has reportedly led to a ballooning budget. <em>Ars Techinca</em>’s sources claim<em> Battlefield 6</em>'s budget is over $400 million.

But will it be enough for EA after it has spent all this money? And will the people who worked so hard on this game see any reward or stability after <em>BF6 </em>launches?

While the official experience is propped up as an important moment, thousands of players have already voiced their support for a boycott by using the #BoycottTheHatch across social media.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/core-roblox/The_Hatch_Event_and_Rewards">The Hatch</a> went live earlier today, cracking open its doors for players across the platform to enjoy the work put in by an army of Roblox developers. It’s entirely free-to-play and will no doubt attract millions of players who have been looking forward to the company’s latest Easter Egg hunt experience <a href="https://x.com/DavidBaszucki/status/1931120936645951877" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>for the last month</u></a>. What should be an exciting moment for the community has turned into a controversial stain as players and developers alike band together to opt out of The Hatch in favor of a movement that aims to make the platform safer for all ages forever.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Disappointing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BoycottTheHatch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#BoycottTheHatch</a> <a href="https://t.co/J6lhYkY4j1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/J6lhYkY4j1</a></p>— Kakiparks (@CKs_hidingplace) <a href="https://twitter.com/CKs_hidingplace/status/1936205286739706264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Communication from Roblox Corporation has done little to ward off concerns that the gaming giant is failing to protect users from inappropriate content. Though much of the firestorm that’s taken hold of the conversation has subsided, many fear issues surrounding The Hatch are only a symptom of larger issues yet. Community organization opposed to The Hatch could be the start of what players hope will be meaningful change, but they’ve got a long way to go.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is The Hatch?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Prominently featured atop the Roblox home page, The Hatch is an Easter Egg hunt-themed umbrella event that runs from July 2–12 and incorporates a variety of Roblox experiences. Joining the event teleports players to an island realm, which itself serves as an in-between area to hang out in before traveling to a more fleshed-out hub world. In this vacation paradise, users can take in the sights across different colorful biomes while completing quests, challenging others for higher leaderboard spots, and purchasing cosmetic items. It all revolves around one goal: collect as many eggs as possible.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Roblox The Hatch Event - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Each painted collectible isn’t found in The Hatch itself, though. Instead, players use the official Roblox hub world to transport themselves to other user-created Roblox experiences via portals placed around the map. Each portal features around 40 games that range from Squid Game obstacle courses to anime-inspired fighting simulators. These are where the eggs can be found, and while they’re often not particularly well hidden, The Hatch and Easter Egg hunts in general have proven to be enticing events that get Roblox players engaged with experiences they know and some they don’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hundreds of Roblox games are included in The Hatch, cementing the event as a crucial limited-time mode with official backing from Roblox Corporation. <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/98209635344835/The-Hatch#!/about" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Hatch’s page</u></a> had more than 46 million visits at the time of this piece’s publication. It also describes an experience that is “suitable for everyone.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Roblox Players Take Action Against a Controversial Creator</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox <a href="https://x.com/Roblox/status/1932838162411540657" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pulled back the curtain</u></a> on The Hatch June 12, marking a return to beloved Easter Egg hunting festivities with more to do and more polish than ever. It was an exciting moment marred by controversy when players caught wind that infamous (and verified) Roblox developer TheOfficiaITeddy had been invited to include his creations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox is a free-to-play platform that is no doubt used by countless children every day, yet, nearly 20 years into its lifespan, Roblox Corporation still <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-makes-big-changes-to-parental-controls-amid-pedophile-hellscape-report">finds itself facing accusations that it’s cultivated a dangerous environment for younger players</a>. TheOfficiaITeddy is one developer at the center of the conversation surrounding these topics thanks to his involvement in what many call “condo” games. These social experiences allow players to mingle with one another, but it’s the allegations that Teddy’s condo experiences have featured romantic, dating, and even sex-themed content that have the community ready to take action.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This person has gained HUNDREDS of MILLIONS of visits on games that can only be described as s*x games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“This person has gained HUNDREDS of MILLIONS of visits on games that can only be described as s*x games,” one popular post from X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/RoCatchers/status/1934826140046074014" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>@RoCatchers</u></a> said. “These games feature inappropriate animations disguised as innocent stuff, and people within the games use it for lewd acts. These games also feature private ‘motel rooms’ that you can lock allowing people to be 1 on 1.

The goal was clear: spread awareness. Posts covering the topic quickly gained thousands of likes on X alone as users called not only for Teddy’s invitation to be rescinded but for the controversial creator to be banned altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What was a simmer quickly evolved into a full-on boil as Roblox developers involved in The Hatch began to pull out from the event.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With the console release of the co-op tactical shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ready-or-not">Ready or Not</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/17/tactical-shooter-ready-or-not-is-coming-to-consoles-this-summer-whether-youre-ready-or-not/">just around the corner</a>, developer Void Interactive has ended up in a bit of a pickle, as the PC community has taken to review bombing the game over content changes aiming to meet the policies of global platforms and age rating bodies.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/526472884483263337">Providing new side-by-side and very specific details</a>, Void Interactive insist that these are “minor content changes” being made so that they can have one unified set of assets and features to better support the full cross-play between platforms. The game will still be as gory and violent as ever, and it will still feature full limb dismemberment (albeit now only for characters while they are alive), and many levels are completely unchanged.</p>


<p>Where Void is making changes in in removing nudity – video game ratings are often totally fine with killing hundreds of people, but showing a bit of a boob? That’s not OK. So a number of characters that had nudity or exposed genitals now have underwear on. There’s also one instance where a child is now depicted as sleeping instead of convulsing, and one collectable piece of evidence that is now generic photographic evidence instead of “Photo of Minors” with a pile of children’s photographed faces.</p>
<p>All in all, this feels like a storm in a teacup. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/526472884483260567">Void Interactive was up front about the incoming changes</a> and described their intent last week, and has now provided side-by-side comparisons on Steam.</p>
<p>Here’s the six specific visual changes that Void are making to the PC version of Ready or Not:</p>

<ul>
<li>Twisted Nerve: The girl is now depicted as sleeping instead of convulsing. &nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>A Lethal Obsession: Nudity involving the ghillie suit suspect has been adjusted&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Hide and Seek: Female hostages now wear underwear&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Narcos: Police informant hostage now wears underwear&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>23 Megabytes a Second: ‘Photo of Minors’ objective model was revised, also to better connect narratively with the later ‘Sinuous Trail’ mission. <wbr></li>
<li>Post-mortem dismemberment has been disabled (note: dismemberment for living characters remains unchanged)</li>
</ul>
<p>Scanning through the comments, there’s still an awful lot of people decrying what they view as naked censorship, and there’s plenty others who are more accepting.</p>
<p>In the original statement, Void wrote, “The changes with the console version are small enough that most people here wouldn’t notice if we didn’t say anything, but we want to be transparent. It’s largely just evidence and nudity that’s altered, and the texture changes don’t affect the PC version.”<wbr></p>
<p>This is absolutely the kind of thing that happens constantly behind the scenes when games, films, TV shows go to the ratings boards. There’s plenty of public back-and-forth discussions for the creation of South Park, for example, as the show’s creators bargain with lawyers over what they will and won’t tweak and change. For Void, this is just being done out in the open and after release.</p>
<p>The difficulty is trying to apply this globally, and similar examples might include Conan: Exiles, where the console version removed nudity to avoid an AO (Adults Only) rating and receive an M in the US. There have also been games that received an AO rating purely for the tone of their violence – such as Hatred in 2015, where you are a mass murdering villain. Ready or Not has received <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40312/ready-or-not/">an M rating in the US</a>, with the listing mentioning nudity, but has an restricted 18+ rating in Australia from the PC version, which Void could be trying to reduce. It could also be the platform holders applying their own judgments.</p>
<p>Ready of Not is going to launch for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on 15th July.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation</a> of the long-awaited ZeniMax Online Studios (ZOS from now on) MMORPG codenamed Project Blackbird and the subsequent departure of studio founder and head Matt Firor shocked the development team, which is understandably still reeling. </p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1940751846064443838?t=Dwxr4abCb3L_nCifN6JyUA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hundreds of developers lost their jobs</a>, including ZOS Lead Graphics Programmer Alex Tardif, who had worked at the company for over ten years and was <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-tech-qa-improved-next-gen-usage-better-hdr-multithreaded-rendering-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featured</a> in an exclusive The Elder Scrolls Online tech interview with Wccftech in August 2021. Following the dire news, Tardif <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346200504034623489/">shared</a> some thoughts on LinkedIn, stating that the MMORPG was 'heading in a great direction' and the new engine he and the other graphics programmers had been working on had 'found its footing'.</p>



<p><em>Our project got cancelled. We'd been working on a new engine + MMO for some time now, and despite some troubles along the way, the project was heading in a great direction and our tech had found its footing. Of the high notes of our tech was undoubtedly our new renderer, made by one of the best damn graphics teams around. If you see any of them looking for work in the coming days/weeks, they have my full throttled endorsement. An entire team of humble, hardworking, self motivated and passionate devs bleeding with talent. You could not go wrong hiring any of them.</em></p>



<p>Now, I'm the first to be entirely flummoxed at the news. As someone who spent thousands of hours in The Elder Scrolls Online, I was very much looking forward to this new game by ZOS, and I'm extremely sad about all the job cuts. On the other hand, if one wanted to play devil's advocate for a second, it is also true that the project had been cooking for over seven years and they didn't have anything to show for it, at least to the public. Even the fact that tech had just about 'found its footing' isn't exactly inspiring in that regard - likely, Microsoft decided that they weren't willing to spend any more resources on such a slow-going project.</p>



<p>Again, though, it's a shame, as so few triple-A MMORPGs are being built nowadays. We're down to less than a handful that are being worked on by Western developers now.</p>

Initial impressions online suggested it wasn’t that tough, especially compared to the enhanced Gaping Jaw fight that kicked off <em>Nightreign</em>’s latest round of live-service summer events. This one revolves around a third enemy, a giant, red, glowing moth called the Animus that only becomes vulnerable when it’s resurrecting its two insect counterparts. It was cool but a bit of a sleeper. We beat it on the second try. </p><p>Not everyone was so lucky, though. The<em> Nightreign</em> subreddit quickly started filling up with clips of players who got stuck on the fight with no way to progress. Two of the enemies lay motionless on the ground while the third disappears. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lqfm69/new_sentient_pest_everdark_is_broken/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lqfm69/new_sentient_pest_everdark_is_broken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some players</a></span> said they were eventually able to wait it out and get the scripted part of the fight back into motion, while others said they had to try to attack the red moth out of bounds to unfreeze the fight. <br></p><p>The development team <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1940772696163602536&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1940772696163602536" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has already acknowledged the issue</a></span> and is preparing a hotfix to go live tomorrow. “We have identified a bug in <em>Elden Ring Nightreign </em>that may occur during the Everdark Sovereign Sentient Pest fight, making Expeditions impossible to complete,” the official account posted on X on Thursday. “To address this issue, a partial temporary hotfix will be released tomorrow, July 4.” </p><p>Server maintenance will start at 4:00 p.m. ET, just in time for fans to get in some Independence Day barbecuing and fireworks before logging on to defeat more Nightlords. Sentient Pest completes the first trio of weekly rotating Everdark Sovereign boss fights, and it’s not yet clear when the next batch will drop, or if the game will continue cycling through these initial ones until they do. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1014&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1014" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A recent patch was pretty barebones</a></span> but did include one nice new feature: actual item class descriptions. No more wondering if that big weapon you picked up is a great axe or colossal one.  FromSoftware said it’s also planning to introduce a duos mode at some point in the future. We haven’t gotten an official roadmap for future free updates or DLC yet. I’m one trophy away from the platinum and excited to finally take a break, but all bets are off once more new content drops. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-sentient-pest-bug-hotfix-patch-1851785592]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The year is 2025 and the Angry Birds franchise is not only still around, but still getting new games. Developer Rovio has launched the newest Angry Birds game, Angry Birds Bounce, via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-apple-arcade-games/2900-5678/" data-ref-id="2900-5678">Apple Arcade</a>.</p><p>That's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=A+New+Angry+Birds+Game+Is+Out+Now&amp;fnauthor=eddienoteddy&amp;fndate=2025-07-03+08%3A44%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-07-03+09%3A05%3A40&amp;fnarticle_id=6532947&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fapps.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fangry-birds-bounce%252Fid6462195757&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fa-new-angry-birds-game-is-out-now%2F1100-6532947%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the only place you can play the game</a>, so you'll need to sign up for for $7/month subscription service to try it out.

Players fling the birds at the pigs, but they can now bounce off the walls for a new layer of strategy. Players need to strategically assemble a group of birds and go after specific power-ups to have the best chance at success. In essence, it appears to be a block-breaker game in the mold of Arkanoid.</p><p>Apple Arcade games have no microtransactions or ads, which is a big change from most mobile titles, and this applies also to Angry Birds Bounce.</p><p>Some of the other new additions to the Apple Arcade library in July include Kingdom Rush 5: Alliance TD and Suika Game+.

            <p>Sega president and CEO of Sega America and Europe Shuji Utsumi has admitted live-service games are the company's biggest challenge.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/live-service-games-continue-to-dominate-accounting-for-40-of-time-spent-on-ps5-and-xbox-in-us-last-month">Live-service games dominate playtime</a>, but at present Sega does not have a competitive offering in this space.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZDinRJa2C4">The Game Business</a>, Utsumi stated: "One of the biggest challenges is the GaaS [Games as a service] business for us. The game companies with a strong record tend to have a strong GaaS business globally. Console/PC standalone business is getting to be better but we are still working on making the GaaS business global. So that's one of the big challenges."</p>

<p>In response to what the company is doing to address this, Utsumi cited <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-buys-angry-birds-maker-rovio-for-625m">Sega's acquisition of Angry Birds maker Rovio</a> in 2023. "They have deep knowledge of the global mobile business and they have very strong IP like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/angry-birds">Angry Birds</a>," he said.</p>
<p>That's why the company is now working on the mobile party game Sonic Rumble, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/angry-birds-maker-and-sega-delay-sonic-rumble-release-once-again">this was delayed earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>Added Utsumi: "We are giving [Rovio] access to our IPs including Sonic to come up with nice welcoming GaaS titles."</p>
<p>It's important that Utsumi mentioned global business in his comments. Later in the interview, he discussed emerging countries as an opportunity for growth, particularly with mobile games - including the likes of countries in the Middle East and Africa.</p>
<p>Sega did, of course, have looter shooter Hyenas from Creative Assembly, which was intended to be a live-service game. However, Hyenas <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-has-cancelled-hyenas">was cancelled in 2023</a>, due to "lower profitability of the European region".</p>
<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-is-aiming-to-create-a-super-game-by-march-2026">Sega announced the development of a "Super Game"</a>, though little has been revealed since.</p>
<p>"The ultimate goal in the 'Super Game' strategy is to create a game so revolutionary that it attracts far more active users than any of the Group's games to date," reads the company's strategy report from the time. "One key to achieving this goal is whether we can draw together a large community, involving not only players but also streamers who stream the game and viewers who watch their videos.</p>
<p>"That kind of community expands and further develops game content, adding value to the game that is unimagined by developers, and sparking a broader movement - which can then draw in even more users and grow the game's presence dramatically."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-5-the-phantom-x-coming-to-pc-and-mobile-next-month">Atlus and Sega released Persona 5: The Phantom X</a> on PC and mobile, a free-to-play gacha spin-off of its RPG series. Perhaps this could build on the heights of the Persona series to find global success.</p>
<p>Sega isn't alone in struggling with its live-service ambitions. Sony infamously cancelled Concord last year, as well as other unannounced projects. Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-remains-committed-to-diverse-and-resilient-live-service-games-including-forthcoming-marathon-and-fairgames-despite-high-profile-failures">PlayStation's Hermen Hulst recently stated the company remains committed to building "a diverse and resilient" portfolio of live service games</a> - Marathon and Fairgames in particular.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-president-admits-live-service-games-are-the-companys-biggest-challenge]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/neil-druckmann-hbo-the-last-of-us-naughty-dog/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/neil-druckmann-is-stepping-back-from-hbo%E2%80%99s-the-last-of-us-to-bring-his-%E2%80%9Ccomplete-focus%E2%80%9D-back-to-naughty-dog-and-its-future-projects.1235274/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Naughty Dog studio head Neil Druckmann has announced that he is stepping back from his role with HBO's The Last Of Us to bring his full focus back to Naughty Dog and its future projects, including the studio's upcoming game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.</p>



<p>The news was announced with a statement from Druckmann and Naughty Dog on the <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1940465773639880781">official X account</a> for the studio. "<em>I've made the difficult decision to step away from my creative involvement in The Last of Us on HBO,</em>" Druckmann began. </p>



<div><p>"<em>With work completed on season 2 and before any meaningful work starts on season 3, now is the right time for me to transition my complete focus to Naughty Dog and its future projects, including writing and directing our exciting next game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, along with my responsibilities as Studio Head and Head of Creative.</em></p><p><em>Co-creating the show has been a career highlight. It's been an honor to work alongside Craig Mazin to executive produce, direct and write on the last two seasons. I'm deeply thankful for the thoughtful approach and dedication the talented cast and crew took to adapting The Last of Us Part I and the continued adaptation of The Last of Us Part II</em>."</p></div>



<figure></figure>



<p>Since HBO began working on its adaptation of The Last of Us, Druckmann has been straddling his work at Naughty Dog with work on the show. He's written and directed episodes alongside his duties as an executive producer, and been the co-showrunner alongside Craig Mazin over the course of the first two seasons. With Druckmann stepping away from the show, Naughty Dog is officially not meaningfully involved in how HBO's adaptation of The Last of Us Part II continues with season 3 and beyond.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see if Druckmann returns to the show to direct an episode here or there in season 3 or season 4, or if he really is watching from the sidelines for the rest of the adaptation. That he's made this announcement at all is also a bit surprising, considering how involved he's been so far. His first responsibility was always to Naughty Dog, so perhaps it became evident that he could no longer dedicate time to the show while things ramped up at Naughty Dog on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>



<p>If that is the case, then that raises questions as to how successful Druckmann was at being able to juggle his duties at Naughty Dog and on the show, and if this decision to step back from the show is due to him ultimately being unable to properly balance the two. That's all just speculation of course, and we'll likely never know the real truth of the matter, but for Druckmann to leave before the job is done on the adaptation, so to speak, shows that he had to make a choice about where he's spending his time.</p>

            <p>It never rains but it pours, as we say in old London town. Hard on the heels of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">gargantuan mass layoffs</a> yesterday, which accompany <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">several game cancellations</a> and have also seemingly led to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-shooter-from-romero-games-loses-funding-as-staff-post-theyve-been-let-go-thanks-to-microsoft-cuts">layoffs at Romero Games</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light">Dying Light</a> developers Techland have reportedly cancelled two projects. They've haven't said which, but in the absence of known alternatives, one of them could be their untitled open world fantasy action-RPG from former employees of CD Projekt.</p><!--more-->
<p>Techland, who are a subsidiary of Tencent via majority stake, are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dying-light-the-beast-is-coming-in-august-with-the-usual-mix-of-rooftop-parkour-and-zombie-blasting">currently working</a> on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, a game of wide open horizons and puckish zombo head-platforming, which I played at Summer Game Fest and mostly enjoyed. Highlights: fleeing super-mutant cadavers in the dark, from rooftop to rooftop. Less fun: having cars thrown at me by a bullet-sponge boss. That's him in the picture there. Up yours, you greasy Bruce Bannerlike.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, Techland <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dying-light-2s-developers-are-ramping-up-work-on-an-open-world-fantasy-rpg">also announced "a new fantasy epic set in a sprawling open world"</a>. Last we heard, it was being made by former developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and The Witcher series, amongst them open world director Bartosz Ochman, narrative director Karolina Stachyra, and narrative lead Arkadiusz Borowik. But all that may be no more, for Techland have just reported losses of 130 million Polish złoty or roughly $37.3 million, according to Polish business site <a href="https://www.pb.pl/techland-z-potezna-strata-za-2024-r-1244492">Puls Biznesu</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dying-light-developer-techland-has-reportedly-cancelled-two-games/">VGC</a>). These losses stem from "our decision to discontinue further work on two projects."</p>
<p>I'll ask Techland for comment. If you're wondering why there are so many layoffs happening, it's not just the games industry's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">general enshittification</a> - it's the end of a financial quarter, a season in which book-balancers like to get out their red pens and polish the old cost/revenue ratio for the investors.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dying-light-developers-techland-are-cancelling-two-games]]></content:encoded>

She wears her pink dress when driving a regular cart; but give her a motorcycle and she changes into a white jumpsuit with pink boots and a scarf, making her one of the most badass racers in the roster. Now in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, she gets more than just the jumpsuit, called Aero. But she’s not the only fashionable character anymore–everyone gets a new outfit to expand their racing wardrobe!</p><p>Whether you’re racing as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, or even Donkey Kong, you can pick up new outfits for them to wear when you get a bag of Dash Food sitting outside fast food restaurants run by either Yoshis or Toads–but mostly Yoshis because of the chain restaurants are named after them. Eat the food and you change into another outfit that looks even better than what your character was wearing before. It also gives you an extra boost as you eat and change, hence the name “Dash Food.”</p><p>However, Dash Foods don’t always give the same outfits to everyone. Here are the outfits our hero characters wear and the foods that trigger them.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bbbabdbcc26b4de37a9a2753caf19a7b" data-recommend-id="image://bbbabdbcc26b4de37a9a2753caf19a7b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows outfit selections for various characters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows outfit selections for various characters." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Cristina Alexander / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bbbabdbcc26b4de37a9a2753caf19a7b" data-recommend-id="image://bbbabdbcc26b4de37a9a2753caf19a7b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows outfit selections for various characters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Regular: </strong>Pancakes, Lunch Box</li><li><strong>Mechanic: </strong>Sweet Snacks (Green Type)</li><li><strong>All-Terrain: </strong>Donuts</li><li><strong>Cowboy: </strong>Popcorn &amp;

The report added that ZeniMax Online Studios was making a new game engine for it, which may have contributed to its lengthy development schedule.</p><p>Pre-production on Blackbird was "going well," the report said, adding that the studio was "actively ramping up" with the belief that the game could enter full production. The report went on to say higher-ups at Xbox approved the game advancing to the next stage of development, with developers on The Elder Scrolls Online and other teams shifting to the game to support this ramp up.</p><p>The entire team working on the game has been affected by the game's cancellation, the report said, adding that "several hundreds" of developers at the Maryland-based developer were let go.</p><p>Microsoft confirmed the cancellation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Rare's Everwild</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/" data-ref-id="1100-6532921">The Initiative's Perfect Dark</a>, but the company has not directly said anything about the rumored new game from ZeniMax.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> will be featured at Summer Games Done Quick 2025.</p>
<p>Games Done Quick, for those unaware, is a series of charity video game marathons, which promise "high-level gameplay" from those with a lot more skill and patience than I have. </p>
<p>Summer Games Done Quick 2025 will run from 6th - 13th July, with all donations raised going towards Médecins Sans Frontières / Doctors Without Borders. This organisation provides medical assistance to those affected by conflict, disease outbreaks, and disasters globally. Last year, Summer Games Done Quick raised $2.5m for Doctors Without Borders.</p>

<p>The event will include Knockout Tours in the Nintendo racer. Considering the amount of shortcuts found out in the game's open world, it'll be intriguing to see if world record times will be beaten.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Build a Rocket Boy CEO Leslie Benzies reportedly finally addressed staff after the launch of MindsEye, blaming internal and external saboteurs for the game's and the studio's current struggles.</p>



<p>As reported by<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-devs-uk-workforce-of-around-300-receive-at-risk-emails-as-former-gta-lead-leslie-benzies-finally-addresses-staff"> IGN</a>, the former producer of the Grand Theft Auto series addressed staff at the development studio yesterday, July 2, in a short video call. During the call, the Build a Rocket Boy CEO insisted the studio would bounce back and relaunch MindsEye while blaming both the game's and the studio's struggles to internal and external saboteurs. This is the second time a similar suggestion was made by a BARB exec, as last month, co-CEO Mark Gerhard talked about a supposed concerted effort by some to trash the game and the studio.</p>



<p>Though there seems to be plans to relaunch MindsEye at some point, things are looking dire at the studio. At-risk emails have been sent to around 300 employees at Build a Rocket Boy and to staff at PlayFusion, which was acquired by BARB in late 2024. As such, the situation seems to be far worse than what it seemed<a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/"> last month</a>, when it was confirmed that a layoff process began at the studio.</p>



<p>Few should be surprised to see MindsEye becoming more and more one of the most disastrous game launches of all time. The writing was on the wall even before release, when two BARB chief executives left the studio a few days before the release of the game. With a lot of <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-unreal-engine-5-gpu-destroyer/">technical</a> and gameplay issues, relaunching the game will be a real challenge, and with layoffs looming on the horizon at the development studio, it remains to be seen if there are real plans to do so and how they will be realized.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-estimated-to-have-sold-1-4-million-units-in-june/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is expected to have sold well in its first week of availability, moving close to 1.5 million units in just a few days.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/us-consumers-will-cut-back-on-buying">The Game Business</a>, market research and analytics firm Ampere estimates that Death Stranding 2: On The Beach sold 1.4 million copies by the end of June in one week of availability. The game had a slower start than its predecessor in terms of physical copies across Europe, but digital sales are reportedly stronger. Considering how the original game continued to sell well even years after its launch, the second entry in the series by Kojima Productions seems set to become a success.</p>



<p>Although Death Stranding 2: On The Beach doesn't significantly shake up its predecessor's formula, the huge number of quality-of-life additions and the much faster pace make it a more accessible and ultimately more enjoyable experience. Stealth and combat have also been improved significantly, and by taking advantage of <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-make-stealth-and-combat-way-more-enjoyable-with-this-one-game-changing-trick/">a mechanic</a> that is not properly explained in-game, the entire experience turns into the sequel to Metal Gear Solid V we never got.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is now available on PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">review-in-progress.</a></p>
