			<p>With Borderlands 4, Gearbox Software is pushing toward a far larger, seamless world, and that factored into the developer's decision to drop the minimap seen in previous installments.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvsx1FzIKEg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PAX East 2025 panel</a>, Gearbox founder and president Randy Pitchford explained:</p>
<p><em>This is the biggest (by far) universe that we've built, and it's seamless. There's no load times. You see something anywhere on the screen, a mile away up in the sky, and you will be able to get there. We made a big freaking world. And a lot of the things you do can be local space, but a lot of the things you do or want to do are out there, and a local space map is not a good way to navigate when you're thinking about objectives and opportunities, several at the same time, that might be miles away. A compass really helps us do that.</em></p>
<p>The other aspect that played into Gearbox's choice is that Borderlands 4 will be much more vertical than its predecessor. Pitchford added:</p>
<p><em>The other thing that the team really wanted to commit to is to push the boundaries of design and environment. Instead of just a single flat plane, they embraced a lot of verticality. You're going to have more verticality in Borderlands 4 than you've ever seen before in a Borderlands game by far, and when you have a layered environment, a top-down two-dimensional view is extremely confusing. With a compass with arrows that tell you if things are up or down, you have a much better sense of spatial awareness, and we want you to play the game, not the map. So, we made a commitment, and we put all of that investment into this compass system.</em></p>
<p><em>You still have the big map. It's one click away and we put more cool stuff in there than we've ever done before. We even have an AI-driven kind of navigation system that'll give you a GPS on the big map to show you the line of where you can go, and there's even an in-world companion, Echobot, that has some features there that'll help you navigate.</em></p>
<p>Pitchford didn't rule out adding a minimap to Borderlands 4 at some point in the future (presumably after launch), but told fans to play the game first before judging.&nbsp;That'll happen <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on September 12</a>, when the game is planned to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. A Nintendo Switch 2 version will release later, and Pitchford talked about that, too, as you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-very-powerful-is-perfect-for-borderlands-4-says-randy-pitchford/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our previous report</a>.</p>

            <p>
It's been a little under a year since the vehicular combat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-speed-freeks">Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks</a> launched into early access, and yesterday developer Caged Element Inc. announced that it'll be receiving its 1.0 launch next week, May 22nd. There are a couple notable changes that come with this launch though. For starters, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/wired-productions">Wired Productions</a> are taking over from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/plaion">Plaion</a> on publishing duties. As the devs explained in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2078450/view/541105873081074235?l=english">Steam post</a>, the reason this matters to you is the second change, which is that you'll have to pay for it when it arrives next week. Some of you, anyway.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Anyone that played the early access version of the game will be getting the full release completely for free. That's great for that subset of people, though perhaps a small bummer for anyone that was interested but prefers to avoid early access games. Ah well, it won't be very expensive, as it'll only launching with a discounted price of $16 (the full price hasn't been shared just yet, though I doubt it'll be much more than that).
</p>
<p>
A press release also says that microtransactions are also being removed from the game with this change. Anyone that earned or bought in-game currency, called Teef, will still be able to spend it for the next 12 months. Anyone that is new to the game with the 1.0 launch won't be able to the in-game store where you can spend Teef. There'll also be some DLC packs coming at launch, which I'm assuming will be the same bits you'll be able to pick up with Teef, though this wasn't clarified in the press release.
</p>
<p>
Caged Element explained that moving away from free-to-play does have its benefits. For one, player-hosted matches with custom settings will be possible, alongside hosting private games. There will also be a new free-roam mode to "explore any map and create custom races."
</p>
<p>
It's probably worth noting that the game won't be playable from this coming Tuesday, May 20th to the 22nd, launch day, so don't panic if you can't get your freek on.

These days, when there's so many games coming out that I feel like an overwhelmed dog with free reign in a butcher's, there's no sweeter sentence to me than "this game will take you no longer than two hours." I know for some people length is everything (don't), but personally I love a short, good time (seriously, leave it out). So the second I saw <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/formless-star">Formless Star</a>, an eclectic little creature cataloguing game, and read that it was one to two hours long, I was immediately in.
</p>

<p>
Here's the low down: you are Anemo, a researcher sent on a mission in a spaceship to a planet called the Formless Star to collect data on the many animals that live there. There's around 60 for you to find and learn about, all of them weirder than the next. You might find Flodeboller, a marshmallow-looking creature that hangs out in hot areas even though it's very uncomfortable with the heat, but just forgets it could leave any time it wants. There's Boy, who is a boy! Or Sylvia, an animal that evolved from a crashed spacecraft (you should definitely hang out with Sylvia, I would die for them).

Gameplay is pretty simple, you just kind of go up to each of these animals and interact with them, and then you get a Pokedex-esque entry that'll likely be a quirky goof. The world itself is randomly generated, changing itself every time you step out, different animals appearing on a fresh generation. 
</p>
<p>
It is primarily a game about vibes, those vibes being a funny, oddball, Game Boy Advance looking game with a, I want to say, healing soundtrack. It's just a lovely place to hang out for an hour or two, simplistic or not. Think of it almost like a walking simulator, but in 2D.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps most impressive of all is how unique each of the animals feel. Something I often feel let down by in non-Pokemon creature collectors is how uninspired the designs are. I understand that that might come down to not having the resources, but the range of designs in Formless Star, a game predominantly made by a single person, splendidland, does kind of show that when it comes to this type of design work, you just need to get weird with it.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, it's pay what you want over on Itch.io! Meaning you can just download it for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free</a> if you like, or you can chip in a bit of dosh to support the dev. Which you should do, because it's a delightful little gem that has a nice simple message to it.

			<p>Nintendo has confirmed that for Nintendo-developed, first-party games for the Nintendo Switch 2, like Mario or Zelda games, the company has "<em>no plans</em>" to release game-key card versions.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-has-no-plans-to-use-game-key-cards-for-first-party-developed-titles">Nintendo Life</a>, Nintendo confirmed that game-key card versions of its first-party developed games are not something it is looking to do. "<em>We have no plans to use game-key cards for Nintendo-developed titles.</em>"</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-has-great-optimism-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-but-wont-necessarily-bring-all-games-to-the-platform/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is weeks away from launch at the time of writing, and while there's plenty of excitement, there are still plenty of questions and anxieties about how all the changes coming with the console will land.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-will-likely-be-widespread-due-to-limited-cartdrige-options/">Game-key cards</a> are one of the changes that players aren't happy about. If you didn't know, Game-key cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 are physical cartridges you can buy in your local video game store or online, just as you would any physical copy of a game, but they are not, in any way, a copy of the game you're buying. There's no game data on them; they're just a key, and the game you're buying will be installed on your console through a digital download.</p>
<p>We've seen that before with PlayStation and Xbox game discs, and with some Nintendo Switch games that have a limited amount of the game's data on the cartridge, with the rest downloaded. But that isn't stopping players from being upset in a whole new way about game-key cards.</p>
<p>At least, for now, we can expect that games like Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and whatever the next 3D Mario game is will all be released as proper physical editions, where the game is on the cartridge you buy in a store or online instead of just a key for a digital download.</p>
<p>Of course, the stipulation that Nintendo has no plans to do this for titles that Nintendo develops means that any Nintendo-published titles could still be released as game-key card versions. We should also expect plenty of third-party studios to go the game-key card route instead of spending the extra money to release proper cartridges.</p>

            <p>A new report alleges that Marathon developer Bungie is in "chaos" after the studio was forced to admit that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">an external artist's work has been used within upcoming game Marathon without consent</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/17/new-marathon-info-bungie-morale-launch-worries-and-changing-plans/">Forbes</a> claims morale at the studio is in "free fall" right across the organisation, with one source telling the outlet "the vibes have never been worse".</p>
<p>The issue came to light earlier this week following recent playable alpha tests of Marathon, from which <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605">artist Fern Hook recognised their designs</a> had been used. Responding via its less-visible <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262">Marathon Dev Team social media account</a>, Bungie wrote that it had "immediately investigated" Hook's claim and found that, yes, a former artist at the company had swiped the designs.</p>

<p>Then, in an ill-timed and palpably awkward livestream last night, the developer revealed it would not be sharing any Marathon gameplay due to the ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>"Our show is a little bit different today," explained game director, Joe Ziegler, at the beginning of the stream. "We had planned to show a lot more stuff, but for a lot of reasons we're about to get into, we decided not to show a bunch of this stuff. But we are going to be discussing a lot about what we learned through Alpha, some of the plans that we're going forward with."</p>
<p>Ziegler later said part of the reason Bungie wasn't showing any gameplay was because the team was "still scrubbing all of our assets to make sure that we are being respectful of the situation".</p>
<p>"It came to our attention that an artist who worked on Marathon in the early stages of pre-production took a number of graphic elements from a graphic designer, without permission or acknowledgement, and placed them on a decal sheet that was then checked in, in 2020," added art director Joe Cross, reading from a statement.</p>
<p>"The decal sheet included icons and text elements. These elements ended up in our alpha build and there is absolutely no excuse for this oversight, and we are working on, and 100% committed to, our review process to ensure instances like this don't happen again on Marathon or at Bungie."</p>
<p>Forbes now reports sources at Bungie say the explanation given publicly about the incident - which is that a former employee is responsible - is the same reason given internally, but "morale was in free fall" as the team scrambled to recover from the latest in a line of plagiarism accusations. With changes to its marketing plan - which pre-dates this week's incident - and possible amendments to its playtesting plans, as well as now an audit into what should be every single graphic element used on Marathon, some fear the shooter will struggle to hit its 23rd September release date.</p>
<p>Forbes also intimates staff have been uneasy with the direction of development, saying, "as far back as five years ago, devs were telling [management] what would and wouldn't work and were often ignored. Many have said previously that it needed to have some sort of PvE component".</p>
<p>"Sony and Bungie legal" are reportedly looking into what happened with the stolen assets, but Bungie's decision not to share <em>any</em> footage in yesterday's livestream is perhaps telling enough.</p>
<p>Marathon is set to launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 23rd September.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At a time where there is constantly word of this or that game shutting down, even successful ones, it will never fail to surprise me that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xi">Final Fantasy 11</a> is still going. You can't play it on PS2 anymore, but there's still an active community on PC even now. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> just celebrated its 23rd anniversary yesterday in fact, with a new update video and <a href="http://www.playonline.com/pcd/topics/ff11us/detail/22548/detail.html">letter from the producer</a> Yoji Fujito released to highlight some of the new and upcoming features.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For one, in a future update more monsters are getting added to Limbus. There's also a new morale gauge system coming to Besieged that gives your forces a stat boost. Perhaps most interesting of all is a feature you might take for granted in modern MMOs, which is the introduction of the character race change service. Dodgy name aside, this will allow you to change your character's race, gender, face type, hair colour, and size.

<p>
Updates over the last year even added in something as small as gamepad configuration adjustments, and as big as a new master trial, Wing of War.
</p>
<p>
Fujito's letter further explained that even now, the team is looking to help new and returning players, particularly solo ones, have an easier time with the game. Currently there's something called the alter ego system, which is similar to Final Fantasy 14's trust system in that you can recruit NPCs to help you on quests. According to Fujito, the devs will be looking to allow you to upgrade these alter egos "as a means of enhancing the solo player experience." They have other plans to smooth things over too, which is honestly a little wild to me for a game that's been running for so long.
</p>
<p>
I've not dived into Final Fantasy 11 myself, there's always too many games for me to play to even consider touching an MMO. Still, it's comforting in a strange way that knowing that it's there, trudging along, ready for myself or anyone else to give it a go. Kudos to the team!

            <p>
Earlier this week, it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellar-blade-pc-will-release-on-11th-june-according-to-leaked-trailer-montage-of-technical-improvements">leaked</a> and then later confirmed that <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1923048769245020481">Stellar Blade</a>, that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>-esque one with the jiggle physics cranked up to the max, would be coming to PC next month on June 11th. This was obviously welcome news to the kind of people who enjoy that sort of thing (more or less no judgement here). But it quickly became apparent that there was a bit of a caveat: the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game isn't available to pre-order in all regions on Steam.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, you'll probably remember how a lot of Sony published games on Steam aren't available in every territory because of their annoying PSN requirement. That was at least <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-finally-drop-the-psn-account-requirement-that-annoyed-every-pc-player">dropped by Sony somewhat earlier this year</a>, so it's a bit confusing why <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> isn't available in all regions. In fact, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/shift-up-corporation">Shift Up</a> don't even seem to know why this is the case, as in a Dwitter post they explained that they are "closely discussing the region lock issue with the publisher and are doing our best to resolve most of it as soon as possible."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">🔸️We are closely discussing the region lock issue with the publisher and are doing our BEST to resolve most of it as soon as possible.<br>🔸️As shown in the test chart below, the DRM has been hard tuned to maintain the same average frame rate, with even higher minimum frames in… <a href="https://t.co/JDimvKiKte">pic.twitter.com/JDimvKiKte</a></p>— StellarBlade (@StellarBlade) <a href="https://twitter.com/StellarBlade/status/1923430874391118044?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
They also clarified that connecting a PSN account is "entirely optional and never required." It's clear they know how badly this has been received across the board by PC players, and it sounds like this has been a bit out of their hands.
</p>
<p>
Outside of trying to get this region lock problem sorted, Shift Up also sought to make it known that the "DRM has been hard tuned to maintain the same average frame rate, with even higher minimum frames in some cases", and the mods will be "fully supported without any restrictions." I'm sure people plan on making perfectly regular mods for this game. Definitely not having a vision of something weird and questionable, no sir.

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Guilty Gear Strive developer Arc System Works has suffered a "data leakage due to unauthorised access".</p>
<p>In a brief <a href="https://www.arcsystemworks.com/notice-regarding-data-leakage-due-to-unauthorized-access/">statement</a>, the company said that while its systems had been illegally accessed by a third-party and data was leaked, it didn't believe the leak included any "personal information or player account information".</p>

<p>"We regret to announce that we have discovered that our systems were illegally accessed by a third party and that data held by us was leaked to outside parties," the statement read.</p>
<p>"As of May 12, we have not confirmed the leak of any user personal information or player account information due to the unauthorised access. We are working diligently to determine the cause of the unauthorised access and the extent of the impact with the help of outside experts, and we will inform you if any new facts are discovered as a result of the investigation.</p>
<p>"We sincerely apologise to all for any inconvenience and concern this may cause. We are truly sorry."</p>
<p>The statement closed on imploring people not to try and access the data that was allegedly leaked, "as there is a possibility that it may cause malware infection".</p>
<p>What information, exactly, the leakers <em>did</em> manage to access remains to be seen. Arc System Works hasn't said if it was employee data or information pertaining to unreleased or unannounced game projects, but <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/guilty-gear-strive-source-code-leak-explained-season-5-characters-discovered-3193826/">Dexerto</a> reported earlier this month, before Arc's statement, that Guilty Gear Strive's source code was leaked, including "new data" about the game's story and characters.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't the first time a studio's plans been hacked and prematurely leaked. In December 2023, PlayStation-owned Spider-Man developer Insomniac had detailed plans of future projects published online, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-investigating-insomniac-hack-which-reportedly-leaked-wolverine-files-and-employees-personal-data">stolen from the company by hackers</a>, and then ransomed for $2m. The files include a project roadmap for the next decade and beyond including an array of unannounced projects, plus production details, art assets, and personal information on Insomniac employees.</p>
<p>Perhaps more famously still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/90-gta-6-videos-and-screenshots-have-allegedly-leaked-online">90+ videos and screenshots from Rockstar's then-unannounced GTA 6 also leaked online early in September 2022</a> after a hacker managed to access its internal systems.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bungie">Bungie</a> aren't having a very good week are they? First there were those accusations of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> using assets without permission from the artist 4ant1r34l (Antireal), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">which Bungie admitted to taking place</a>. Then yesterday there was a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2460495264">livestream</a> featuring game director Joe Ziegler and art director Joseph Cross which was filled with chat messages about said asset usage for practically the entire stream. Ziegler and Cross did at least address those messages, but with the response to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> already being quite mixed thus far, it doesn't amount to much right now.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Things also don't sound great internally at Bungie right now either. Several current and former employees reportedly spoke with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/17/new-marathon-info-bungie-morale-launch-worries-and-changing-plans/">Forbes</a> about where Bungie and Marathon are at right now, with morale apparently in "free-fall" across all departments. One source supposedly said "the vibes have never been worse", and staff are concerned about what happens if Marathon flops, something the studio can't afford. There's been nothing said about a potential delay from the current September release date, and it's unclear at a lower level if those discussions are being had by higher-ups.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to the art theft in particular, the explanation that's been provided publicly - that these assets were from a texture sheet made by a former Bungie artist - is the internal explanation as well.
</p>
<p>
Bungie's marketing plans sound like they're out the window too. A new trailer was meant to be coming in June, as well as the start of pre-orders, but this is apparently being reworked. A public beta meant to be held in August could now be turned into a "roadmap of public playtests" as well.
</p>
<p>
Those that spoke with Forbes also said that Marathon was pitched by higher-up "good old boy" Bungie leadership, and as long as five years ago team members were trying to explain what would and wouldn't work. They were frequently ignored. Apparently many devs even noted there should be some kind of PvE element to the game, a frequent complaint you will likely have seen about the game by now.
</p>
<p>
Bungie are in a very precarious position right now. They have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/turns-out-bungies-plan-to-save-destiny-2-is-literal-star-wars-and-two-expansions-a-year">lots of Destiny 2 updates and expansions on the way</a>, but there's no guarantees that'll bring people back the way it needs to. Who knows if there's even time to fix these big issues Marathon is facing. We'll just have to wait and see for now.

Perhaps this was because many companies are gearing up for Summer Game Fest next month and this show got bitten in the ass by its move from March to May, or it’s just an extension of the tailspin the video game industry is dealing with right now. Whatever the reason, the result is the same: PAX East was a weird show for heavy hitters, but for those interested in seeing indie teams with small games and big ideas, being there felt like running around in a candy shop.

Despite everyone you know using it for hours on end, the video-sharing app is currently facing legislation that would force its ban in the U.S pending a potential sale, and prospective buyers are lining up. One of these potential buyers is reportedly Bobby Kotick, the former boss of Activision Blizzard, according to the Wall Street Journal.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,195618,197567" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>TikTok has been scrutinized for years by U.S. lawmakers who have argued that its China-based parent company ByteDance may share data it collects with the Chinese government, or that the app could serve as a propaganda delivery tool. Despite tensions ramping up some time ago, leading many to believe that the app would be banned in the U.S., matters had seemingly cooled until a bill was pushed through the House Energy and Commerce Committee last week, ratcheting up the pressure on ByteDance. The bill is expected to be reviewed and approved by the House of Representatives this week before being sent to the Senate, and President Joe Biden has already claimed he would sign off on a ban if the bill made it through legislation.</p><p>The bill requires that ByteDance “divest itself” of TikTok or see the app banned in the U.S., which has led to renewed interest from potential buyers, including Kotick. Kotick, according to WSJ’s sources, has floated the idea of a buy to ByteDance’s co-founder and is reportedly looking for partners, which could include Sam Altman of OpenAI. According to the Wall Street Journal, “OpenAI could use TikTok to help train its AI models if a partner such as Kotick could raise the capital for such an acquisition.” TikTok’s sale has been estimated to be in the range of “hundreds of billions of dollars.”</p><p>Kotick departed from Activision Blizzard late last year after completing the publisher’s $68 billion sale to Microsoft. Kotick’s tenure at Activision Blizzard spanned decades and came under fire in 2021, when the state of California filed a now-dismissed lawsuit following an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination. Ultimately, California’s Civil Rights Department withdrew all allegations and claims relating to harassment and settled with Activision Blizzard in December 2023 for $54 million to resolve unsubstantiated pay and promotions claims.</p><p>The court-approved settlement included a statement that provided that: </p><p>“[N]o court or any independent investigation has substantiated any allegations that there has been systemic or widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard; that Activision Blizzard senior executives ignored, condoned, or tolerated a culture of systemic harassment, retaliation, or discrimination; or that Activision Blizzard’s Board of Directors including its Chief Executive Officer, Robert Kotick, acted improperly with regard to the handling of any instances of workplace misconduct.”</p><p>In addition, the settlement noted that a former chair of the EEOC had conducted a review of the company’s policies, practices and certain complaint data and reported that there was no widespread harassment at the company. The company itself publicly released its Transparency Report, which further asserted that there was never been widespread or systemic harassment or gender pay inequity at Activision Blizzard. </p><p> Kotick departed with a golden parachute estimated to be worth around $15 million.</p><p><strong>Updated: 04/01/2024, 2:00 p.m. ET: </strong>This article has been updated to include details of the CRD settlement, that Activision Blizzard denied any wrongdoing, and the settlement confirms CRD could not substantiate those claims. </p><p><strong>Updated: 05/17/2025, 12:10 p.m. ET:</strong> This article has been updated to include additional language from the CRD settlement, and to include that as part of the settlement, the CRD withdrew the claims related to harassment from its complaint.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-star-wars-barbenheimer-of-games-vs-movies-mandalorian-and-grogu<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-mandalorian-grogu"><u>The Mandalorian and Grogu</u></a> is released next year on May 22, 2026 – the first new Star Wars movie to hit theaters in six and a half years – and then Grand Theft Auto VI hits four days later on May 26, 2026 – the first new GTA game in 12 and a half years – which one do you think is going to be the bigger deal? And which is going to be same old/same old?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On paper at least, these should be two of the biggest pop culture events of the year – the Barbenheimer of 2026. A new Star Wars movie? A new GTA title!? Grand Theft Watto!!? And while we can guarantee that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><u>GTA 6</u></a> will be huge – it’s <em>already</em> huge – The Mandalorian and his little friend are actually far less of a sure thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It reminds me of when I was a kid and I told my Noni that I would eat pizza every day if I could. And I meant it! She was like, no, you’d get sick of it eventually. But man, pizza every day sounds amazing! You know what though? Noni was 100% right. Pizza every day is actually really freaking gross, and it’s bad for you, and it’s bad for the people selling the pizza in the long run because eventually I’m just going to not want to even think about pizza again for a long, long time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And this is where we’re at with Star Wars right now: It’s pizza every day, over and over again. But GTA… the anticipation for a new GTA game has been building for years. And in some ways, that very anticipation is a big part of the allure of the franchise as well. It’s something Lucasfilm and Disney would do well to take note of.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not that GTA has a bigger cultural footprint than Star Wars. On the contrary, everyone knows who Darth Vader is (even my Noni did, I expect; at the very least she got me a TIE Fighter toy for my third-grade graduation). But the GTAs of the world are still aimed at a tighter demographic. The reason something like GTA can make as much money as it does (more on that in a sec) is because folks spend a lot more playing a game like that than they do going to see a movie. Its success is not because more people are playing it than are watching Star Wars. But one must also consider the lasting impact of a game of this nature, the amount of time that it takes to complete, the replayability, and the interactivity versus the, frankly, old-fashioned act of watching a movie or show and then moving on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">2015’s The Force Awakens, which kicked off the era of modern (i.e., Disney) Star Wars, brought in <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt2488496/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>$2.071 billion</u></a> at the box office worldwide. But Lucasfilm’s hyperdrive motivator was already starting to lose some steam by the time the Sequel Trilogy closed out: The last new Star Wars movie to be released, 2019’s The Rise of Skywalker, made <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt2527338/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>$1.077 billion</u></a>, almost half what The Force Awakens did. Star Wars was already feeling pretty commonplace after just four short years of its return to the big screen, and the numbers bear that out.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Star Wars was already feeling pretty commonplace after just four years back on the big screen, and the numbers bear that out.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Force Awakens actually serves as a better comparison than Rise of Skywalker to the last Grand Theft Auto game, GTA 5, since the game came out in 2013. That just lets us compare the amount of money the two properties brought in a little more cleanly since it’s just a two-year gap between releases. And even though Rey, Finn and Poe’s first adventure (remember them?) is also the fifth-highest grossing film of all time worldwide (not adjusted for inflation), its numbers still pale in comparison to those of GTA 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So about that: Released in September 2013, GTA 5 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2014/05/13/grand-theft-auto-5-has-sold-nearly-2-billion-at-retail/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>made a billion dollars in three days</u></a>. By May of 2014, the game had sold 33 million copies, which would come to approximately $1.98 billion in sales (based on a price of $60 per unit, which is an estimate and doesn’t take into account sale prices, for example). I know – you’re thinking, ‘That’s still below The Force Awakens’ $2.017 billion and it took nine months to get there.’ But whereas The Force Awakens made all that theatrical dough in just a couple of months before leaving theaters, GTA 5 just kept on grabbing the loot year after year after year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2023, <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/grand-theft-auto-built-for-the-long-haul-68eff4de" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Barron’s</u></a> reported that GTA 5 had grossed over $8.5 billion since its release in 2013. And last year, publisher <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-5-surpasses-200-million-units-sold"><u>Take-Two revealed</u></a> in an earnings report that the game had, at that time, continued to sell approximately five million units every three months. This is of course in part due to the fact that GTA 5 has been released on three generations of consoles over the years, and the revenue from GTA Online must be considered as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">By comparison, the combined box office total of all the Disney-era Star Wars movies – The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, The Rise of Skywalker, Rogue One, and Solo – is $5.934 billion. That’s, well, a few <em>billion </em>dollars less than what is essentially a single game in GTA 5. But the other money that the Star Wars franchise brings in is a little harder to track – Blu-rays, digital downloads, streaming, merchandising, theme parks, and, of course, its licensed video games as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things get a bit opaque here because while having, for example, all the Star Wars movies (and TV shows) available on Disney+ exclusively is certainly a draw for potential subscribers, it’s also difficult to attach a dollar value to that scenario. Ditto the theme parks. Yes, you too can rub elbows with an ersatz Rey while at Galaxy’s Edge, and you can also pay $200-plus for a custom lightsaber to shut up your kid’s whining, but how much does that add to the overall take-home of quote/unquote Star Wars itself? (Star Wars games, meanwhile, can be hit or miss; for every Jedi Fallen Order success there’s an Outlaws that has a rough go of it.) Does all the Star Wars stuff in the world that people can and do buy make up that extra three billion dollars to put the series at the same gross revenue point as GTA 5? Maybe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s only one Grand Theft Auto game as compared to the entirety of the modern Star Wars line. Of course, GTA’s online multiplayer mode, with its new cars and interactive events, keeps players coming back over and over again – easily spending beyond the price of the game itself thanks to its in-game currency. (And by the way, why doesn’t GTA have a more extensive line of merchandise IRL? Where are my GTA toys? Why can’t I go to a GTA theme park in California, or even better, <em>Florida</em>, where I can get in an awesome car and run over people to my heart’s desire before buying a custom uzi!?)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well actually, maybe that’s where the real difference between these two franchises – in the here and now of the year 2025 – can best be articulated, and why people rolled their eyes when, for example, the Ryan Gosling/Shawn Levy Star Wars movie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-starfighter-is-a-new-film-starring-ryan-gosling-thats-arriving-in-theaters-in-may-2027-star-wars-celebration"><u>Starfighter was officially announced</u></a> recently compared to the incredible excitement that can be felt around any and all <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-fans-go-deep-on-trailer-2-to-work-out-which-bits-are-gameplay-after-rockstar-clarification"><u>GTA 6 news</u></a>. As noted, it’s going on 13 years since a new GTA game was released. Compare that to the constant watering down of Star Wars through streaming shows, announced movies that never happen, bad movies (and, sure, some good ones!), and the aforementioned ever-present merchandising that we’ve been inundated with since at least 2014, when the marketing build-up to The Force Awakens kicked in. There’s just <em>so much Star Wars now</em>.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When a new GTA title finally is released, there's a huge demand, but also the amount of time and resources that have been put into it are clear. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And that brings me back Noni and my pizza dreams – dreams that were dashed (Dash Rendar’d?) when I realized she was right about too much of a good thing. Sure, sometimes the toppings are different, and some days it tastes better than others, but Star Wars is just always <em>there </em>now. There’s nothing special about it anymore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But GTA… GTA brings me to a different Noni memory. Rockstar only serves new editions of the beloved franchise on the most special of occasions. It’s sort of like lasagna on Christmas! We didn’t get lasagna all the time growing up, so when we found out Noni was making sauce and lasagna was in the offing, it was awesome. The meatballs and sausage sliced up, the oozing ricotta, the basil leaves on top, the toasted Italian bread to go with it – just the best. And it wasn’t just the actual lasagna, but even the <em>anticipation </em>of it. Knowing that it was coming was almost as good as actually sitting down and eating it. It was a rare and special thing, like a new GTA game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar also has a history of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-shouldnt-be-surprised-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-delayed-rockstar-history"><u>delaying new installments</u></a> of the series – they will serve no wine before its time. The result of this philosophy is that when a new GTA title finally is released, there is a huge demand, but also the amount of time and resources that have been put into the game are clear in the finished version. With all due respect to the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy, there was obviously no plan in terms of the <em>trilogy </em>part of it all. (One day Rian Johnson will say how he really feels about the 180-degree turn The Rise of Skywalker took after his film.) Audiences aren’t dumb; they can tell the difference between something that is rushed to make a date versus a work of art that is given its due time to develop and evolve as it should.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Jason Duval Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Is the GTA series an outlier in the world of games? Certainly. And yet, as of 2023, Minecraft had sold over 300 million copies (including sales across the many platforms it's released on) and Tetris had sold over 520 million copies. (GTA 5 is at 200 million+ and the Grand Theft Auto franchise overall has 430 million units sold.) And that’s just the top of the pile of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-selling-video-games-of-all-time-grand-theft-auto-minecraft-tetris"><u>best-selling games</u></a>. People like video games! Who knew?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s crazy to think now that there was a 16-year gap between Return of the Jedi and The Phantom Menace. It was a relatively fallow period for Star Wars (even if the expanded universe and merchandising continued), and when George Lucas finally did return to theaters in 1999 with young Ani and Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, there were lines around the block everywhere. That was excitement. There was huge anticipation for a thing we all loved that we hadn’t gotten a new installment of in a long, long time. The same happened 10 years after Revenge of the Sith, which we had all thought was the end of the Star Wars movies forever, when The Force Awakens rekindled the Star Wars flame. Audiences were truly amped to return to that galaxy far, far away again.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Upcoming Star Wars Movie and TV Show</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that gap between Return of the Jedi and The Phantom Menace, that 16 years, that’s not far off from the 13 years that will have passed between GTA 5 and GTA 6. The expectations, the hopes, the theorizing, the <em>fun </em>of knowing a new game in the series is coming. It’s almost as important as the game itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in the case of the next Star Wars movie… which is the continuation of a TV show… which has had three seasons already… and at least a couple of spin-offs… well, it’s gonna be kind of hard for audiences to get too excited for that, I think. Sure, it may prove to be a good or even a great movie – I hope it does.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But you have to wonder. How many people are gonna say to themselves, “Eh, I’ll wait for when it hits streaming.”</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Also, an artist was surprised to spot examples of her artwork in Bungie’s <em>Marathon</em>, given that the company had never contacted her, much less compensated her for her work, and we’ve got a look at the cards representing every Cid in <em>Final Fantasy </em>that are being released as part of the roleplaying game series’ crossover with <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>.

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> was review-bombed last year following a PSN requirement, which led to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">game being pulled from sale in 177 countries</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/667900/doom-the-dark-ages-clair-obscur-expedition-33-parry-season<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you like games with parrying, there are two great new ways to get your fix: <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. These very different games — one is a fast-paced first-person shooter, the other a turn-based fantasy RPG — approach the mechanic in very different ways.</p><p>Let’s start with <em>Doom</em>. One of the big new additions to the game is a giant shield for the Doom Slayer, and you can use it to block projectiles or enemy attacks. The game helpfully signals anything that you can parry in a bright neon green that’s easy to see as you’re rushing around and destroying hordes of demons.</p><p>When a green projectile gets within range or an enemy does a green attack, you can press the parry button at the right time to deflect the danger with a huge reverberation of your shield and an action-movie-like moment of slow motion. Like most of modern <em>Doom</em>’s action, it all looks, feels, and sounds very satisfying. But parries are also critical for fights, as they can open up an opportunity to hit the enemy with a punch or a few shots from whatever monstrous gun you’re wielding.</p><div><p>Stay keen for something green</p></div><p>In intense battles, I’m always hunting for green glints to find things to parry to potentially gain an advantage. When an enemy shoots a spread of bullets with some green interspersed, I’ll even run <em>toward</em> the danger to get in a good deflection. Some weapon upgrades have perks tied to parries, too, giving you many incentives to stay keen for something green.</p><p><em>Doom</em>, very helpfully, has a setting that lets you change the timing for the parry window whenever you want. I have no shame in admitting that I’ve occasionally made the parry window as wide as the game allows; yes, it lowers the difficulty, but I like parrying every chance I can.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Kepler Interactive</cite></p></div><p><em>Expedition 33</em>’s parrying system is just as thrilling and impactful, but shifts from fast-paced action to turn-based battles. When it’s an enemy’s turn in a battle, they’ll often wind up their giant swords, axes, or fists for flashy, multistep attack combos, and you can parry each hit if you time things right.</p><p>Every successful parry regains one AP, which you’ll spend during your turn to use skills. More powerful skills typically have higher AP costs, so the more blows you parry, the better equipped you’ll be on your next turn. Parry all of an enemy’s attacks on their turn and you’ll do a counter (which also has an action-movie-like slow-motion effect) that can be a very helpful way to chip away at a health bar.</p><p>That’s not easy, though: <em>Expedition 33</em>’s gives you a <em>very</em> tight window to press the parry button in time to block a hit, and if you miss the window, you’ll take some damage. Missing multiple parries on a single turn might drain your health bar from full to empty, and given how tricky the game’s enemies can get with staggering their hits or faking you out, that will probably happen often.</p><p>The game lets you dodge enemy attacks, which has a much wider timing window, but you don’t gain AP and you won’t get a chance to counter. I found myself leaning toward parries far more than dodges: despite the risks, landing a successful series of parries, especially in a high-stakes battle, was usually worth the trial and error because of how cool it looked and how much it helped in a fight.</p><p>I do wish <em>Expedition 33</em> had a setting to adjust the parrying windows just slightly (and if you’re on PC, there’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/clairobscurexpedition33/mods/28">a mod that can help with that</a>). But I also get why the timing is so tough: the rewards are high, but so are the costs.</p><p>Parrying can be a divisive mechanic, especially when it’s challenging. That’s why people bounce off of games like <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em> and <em>Nine Sols</em>. But <em>Doom</em> and <em>Expedition 33</em> both offer new and interesting takes on the idea that show just how rewarding a good parry can be.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>My Ars colleagues were kicking back at the Orbital HQ water cooler the other day, and—as gracefully aging gamers are wont to do—they began to reminisce about classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment">Sierra On-Line adventure games</a>. I was a huge fan of these games in my youth, so I settled in for some hot buttered nostalgia.</p>
<p>Would we remember the limited-palette joys of early King's Quest, Space Quest, or Quest for Glory titles? Would we branch out beyond games with "Quest" in their titles, seeking rarer fare like<em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddy_Pharkas:_Frontier_Pharmacist">Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist</a></em>? What about the gothic stylings of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colonel%27s_Bequest">The Colonel's Bequest</a></em> or the voodoo-curious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Knight:_Sins_of_the_Fathers"><em>Gabriel Knight</em></a>?</p>
<p>Nope. The talk was of acorns. [Bleeping] acorns, in fact.</p>
<p>The scene in question came from <em>King's Quest III</em>, where our hero Gwydion must acquire some exceptionally desiccated acorns to advance the plot. It sounds simple enough. As one <a href="http://www.sierraplanet.net/kqgames/kings-quest-iii/kq3-walkthrough/">walkthrough</a> puts it, "Go east one screen and north one screen to the acorn tree. Try picking up acorns until you get some dry ones. Try various spots underneath the tree." Easy! And clear!</p>
<p>Except it wasn't either one because the game rather notoriously won't always give you the acorns, even when you enter the right command. This led many gamers to believe they were in the wrong spot, when in reality, <em>they just had to keep entering the "get acorns" command</em> while moving pixel by pixel around the tree until the game finally supplied them. One of our staffers admitted to having purchased the <em>King's Quest III</em> hint book solely because of this "puzzle." (The hint book, which is now online, says that players should "move around" the particular oak tree in question because "you can only find the right kind of acorns in one spot.")</p>
<p>This wasn't quite the "fun" I had remembered from these games, but as I cast my mind back, I dimly recalled similar situations. <em>Space Quest II: Vohaul's Revenge</em> had been my first Sierra title. After my brother and I spent weeks on the game only to die repeatedly in some pitch-dark tunnels, we implored my dad to call Sierra's 1-900 pay hint line. He thought about it. I could see it pained him because he had never before (and never since!) called a 1-900 number. In this case, the call cost a piratical 75 cents for the first minute and 50 cents for each additional minute. After listening to us whine for several days straight, my dad decided that his sanity was worth the fee, and he called.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Like the acorn example above, we had known what to do—we had just not done it to the game's rather exacting standards. The key was to use a glowing gem as a light source, which my brother and I had long understood. The problem was the text parser, which demanded that we "put gem in mouth" to use the gem's light in the tunnels. There was no other place to put the gem, no other way to hold or attach it. (We tried them all.) No other attempt to use the light of this shining crystal, no matter how clear, well-intentioned, or succinctly expressed, would work. You put the gem in your mouth, or you died in the darkness.</p>
<p>Returning from my reveries to the conversation at hand, I caught Ars Senior Editor Lee Hutchinson's cynical remark that these kinds of puzzles were "the only way to make 2–3 hours of 'game' last for months." This seemed rather shocking, almost offensive. How could one say such a thing about the games that colored my memories of childhood?</p>
<p>So I decided to replay <em>Space Quest II</em> for the first time in 35 years in an attempt to defend my own past.</p>
<p>Big mistake.</p>

<h2>Play it again, Sam</h2>
<p>In my memory, the Space Quest series was filled with sharply written humor, clever puzzles, and enchanting art. But when I fired up the original version of the game, I found that only one of these was true. The art, despite its blockiness and limited colors, remained charming.</p>
<p>As for the gameplay, the puzzles were not so much "clever" as "infuriating," "obvious," or (more often) "rather obscure."</p>
<p>Finding the glowing gem discussed above requires you to swim into one small spot of a multi-screen river, with no indication in advance that anything of importance is in that exact location. Trying to "call" a hunter who has captured you does nothing… until you do it a second time. And the less said about trying to throw a puzzle at a Labian Terror Beast, typing out various word permutations while death bears down upon you, the better.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The whole game was also filled with far more no-warning insta-deaths than I had remembered. On the opening screen, for instance, after your janitorial space-broom floats off into the cosmic ether, you can walk your character right off the edge of the orbital space station he is cleaning. The game doesn't stop you; indeed, it kills you and then mocks you for "an obvious lack of common sense." It then calls you a "wing nut" with an "inability to sustain life." Game over.</p>
<p>The game's third screen, which features nothing more to do than simply walking around, will also kill you in at least two different ways. Walk into the room still wearing your spacesuit and your boss will come over and chew you out. Game over.</p>
<p>If you manage to avoid that fate by changing into your indoor uniform first, it's comically easy to tap the wrong arrow key and fall off the room's completely guardrail-free elevator platform. Game over.</p>

<p>Get used to it because the game will kill you in so, so many ways: touching any single pixel of a root monster whose branches form a difficult maze; walking into a giant mushroom; stepping over an invisible pit in the ground; getting shot by a guard who zips in on a hovercraft; drowning in an underwater tunnel; getting swiped at by some kind of giant ape; not putting the glowing gem in your mouth; falling into acid; and many more.</p>
<p>I used the word "insta-death" above, but the game is not even content with this. At one key point late in the game, a giant <em>Aliens</em>-style alien stalks the hallways, and if she finds you, she "kisses" you. But then she leaves! You are safe after all! Of course, if you have seen the films, you will recognize that you are <em>not</em> safe, but the game lets you go on for a bit before the alien's baby inevitably bursts from your chest, killing you. Game over.</p>

<p>This is why the <a href="https://www.spacequest.net/sq2/hintbook/">official hint book</a> suggests that you "save your game a lot, especially when it seems that you're entering a dangerous area. That way, if you die, you don't have to retrace your steps much." Presumably, this was once considered entertaining.</p>
<p>When it comes to the humor, most of it is broad. (When you are told to "say the word," you have to say "the word.") Sometimes it is condescending. ("You quickly glance around the room to see if anyone saw you blow it.") Or it might just be potty jokes. (Plungers, jock straps, toilet paper, alien bathrooms, and fouling one's trousers all make appearances.)</p>
<p>My total gameplay time: a few hours.</p>
<p>"By <a href="https://frakipedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grabthar%27s_Hammer">Grabthar's hammer</a>!" I thought. "Lee was right!"</p>

<p>When I admitted this to him, Lee told me that he had actually spent time learning to speedrun the Space Quest games during the pandemic. "According to my notes, a clean run of SQ2 in 'fast' mode—assuming good typing skills—takes about 20 minutes straight-up," he said. Yikes.</p>

<h2>And yet</h2>
<p>The past was a different time. Computer memory was small, graphics capabilities were low, and computer games had emerged from the "let them live just long enough to encourage spending another quarter" arcade model. Mouse adoption took a while; text parsers made sense even though they created plenty of frustration. So yes—some of these games were a few hours of gameplay stretched out with insta-death, obscure puzzles, and the sheer amount of time it took just to walk across the game's various screens. (Seriously, "walking around" took a ridiculous amount of the game's playtime, especially when a puzzle made you backtrack three screens, type some command, and then return.)</p>

<p>Judged by current standards, the Sierra games are no longer what I would play for fun.</p>
<p>All the same, I loved them. They introduced me to the joy of exploring virtual worlds and to the power of evocative artwork. I went into space, into fairy tales, and into the past, and I did so while finding the games' humor humorous and their plotlines compelling. ("An army of life insurance salesmen?" I thought at the time. "Hilarious and brilliant!")</p>
<p>If the games can feel a bit arbitrary or vexing today, my child-self's love of repetition was able to treat them as engaging challenges rather than "unfair" design.</p>
<p>Replaying <em>Space Quest II</em>, encountering the half-remembered jokes and visual designs, brought back these memories. The novelist Thomas Wolfe knew that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Can't_Go_Home_Again">you can't go home again</a>, and it was probably inevitable that the game would feel dated to me now. But playing it again did take me back to that time before the Internet, when not even hint lines, insta-death, and EGA graphics could dampen the wonder of the new worlds computers were capable of showing us.</p>

<p><em>Space Quest II, along with several other Sierra titles, is&nbsp;freely and legally available online at <a href="http://sarien.net/spacequest2">sarien.net</a>—though I found many, many glitches in the implementation. Windows users can buy the entire Space Quest collection through <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/10110/Space_Quest_Collection/">Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/space_quest_1_2_3">Good Old Games</a>.

            <p>Just a year after release, Activision is "streamlining" and ending support for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, ceasing all seasonal content.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/WarzoneMobile/status/1923470814357385447">statement</a>, the developer said while it understood "this news may be disappointing", the mobile shooter had "not met [its] expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences."</p>

<p>"We deeply appreciate your dedication and passion for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile. Going forward, we will be streamlining the scope of the game. This decision was made after careful consideration of various factors and while we're proud of the accomplishment in bringing Call of Duty: Warzone to mobile in an authentic way, it unfortunately has not met our expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences," the statement began.</p>
<p>"As a result, we will no longer be delivering new seasonal content and gameplay updates to the mobile version. Effective immediately, players will no longer be able to purchase Call of Duty Points or Black Cell using real currency in Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile. Sunday, May 18, 2025 will be the last day the game can be downloaded from the Google Play and Apple’s App Store and social features across both mobile platforms will be retired."</p>
<p>Players who install the game before next Monday, 19th May, will still be able to play, complete with cross-progression and shared inventories. They'll also be able to use unspent COD Points. After Monday, however, the game will no longer be downloadable from mobile stores, nor will players be able to spend any further real currency on COD Points or Battle Passes.</p>
<p>It's not clear how long the game will stay online, but Activision <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes">stressed</a>, "refunds are not available for previously purchased in-game content on unused COD Points".</p>
<p>"We know that this news may be disappointing, and we truly appreciate the support, passion, feedback, and dedication from our community," the statement added. "We have special incentives for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile players in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-mobile">Call of Duty: Mobile</a> and encourage our players to try it for free."</p>
<p>Activision's sibling Call of Duty mobile game, which is different from Warzone, is seemingly faring much better. In May 2022, the publisher revealed<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-mobile-reaches-650m-downloads"> the mobile title had reached an impressive 650 million downloads</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/PlayCODMobile/status/1853527640516293059">a billion by November 2024</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
