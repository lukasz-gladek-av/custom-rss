<figure><a title="Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160076/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>When you think of platformers, you likely think of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> When you think of JRPGs, you likely think of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>. When you think of FPS, you likely think of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/call_of_duty_modern_warfare">Call of Duty</a>. Some games are just synonymous with their respective genres. And when it comes to tower defence games, what comes to my mind immediately is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/plants_vs_zombies">Plants vs Zombies</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/plants-vs-zombies-replanted">Plants vs Zombies: Replanted</a> is exactly what it says on the tin. Zombies are invading and the only hope against them is a crop of… well, crops. You’ll need to plant an entire plant army to prevent the zombie hoard from entering your home. It’s a simple, if not rather iconic, premise.</p>
<p>I never actually had the chance to play Plants vs Zombies growing up. My only exposure to the franchise has been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/plants_vs_zombies_battle_for_neighborville_complete_edition">the hero-shooter spin-offs</a>. Thankfully, this Replanted edition has breathed life back into the game to offer a way for players like me to experience this cult classic properly for the first time. It’s worked well for the most part; I’ve greatly enjoyed my time with Replanted, even if it stumbles in a few areas.</p>
<figure><a title="Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160080/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s worth noting the amount of gameplay content you get for your buck. From the main campaign, which is itself fairly meaty, to new minigames to even a puzzle mode, there’s a lot packed into this gem of brain-hungry, botanical tower defence.</p>
<p>The unlockable minigames are a blast. Walnut Bowling is self-explanatory, but modes like ZomBotony — where you’re attacked by plant-zombie hybrids— spin gameplay mechanics around on their heads. And if that’s not enough, there’s also a puzzle mode where you have to think strategically about card placement to clear vases.</p>
<p>There’s also an unlockable co-op mode (that I unfortunately wasn’t able to test as I had no one to play with), and those with a partner will be able to do head-to-head PvP matches, with one player on the side of the zombies. You’ll get hours of replayable fun and I’m surprised by how much I’ve enjoyed it all. The tower defence gameplay is as strong as ever, and I love having to carefully prep my cards (i.e. units) to best battle waves after waves of zombies.</p>

<p>My strategy tended to change between battles. Some plants can spray through screen doors, which makes them essential for battles with zombies sporting screen doors. But then you also have to consider which plant you want to use for resource generation and whether you want walnuts to act as a buffer, or maybe protect your crops with landmines. Those kinds of options helped keep the flow of combat feeling fresh and made me get out of my comfort zone to test new strategies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was initially more trouble in the neighbourhood than just the hordes of undead ghouls. As Felix mentioned <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zik-Cx7oxQE">in his video</a>, the optional mouse controls were downright abysmal at launch, and the touchscreen controls didn’t fare much better - at least until <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/plants-vs-zombies-replanted-rolls-out-more-updates-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">patches</a> adjusted things (and also restored the original dynamic audio and implemented a whole load of sound effect fixes which dogged the game on release day).</p>
<p>Previously, trying to use the mouse controls resulted in a headache, as it was so sensitive that it quickly switched back to standard controls the second you lifted the controller. Meanwhile, planting in touchscreen was a letdown because the sprites followed you as if they were stuck to your finger once you selected a unit.</p>
<figure><a title="Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160085/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The ball definitely got dropped in this area, and those <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/plants-vs-zombies-replanted-rolls-out-more-updates-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">post-release patches</a> haven’t totally solved things for me, especially in touchscreen mode. It still feels clunky and difficult to control, sometimes slowing on-screen action to a glitchy crawl and ultimately making me question the inclusion of the control scheme in the first place.</p>
<p>There’s also <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/amidst-allegations-of-ai-art-and-complaints-about-the-music-plants-vs-zombies-fans-are-not-happy-with-the-remaster/">allegations of AI usage in the game</a>, which — at the risk of sounding like I’m soapboxing — is downright messy if true.</p>
<p>That aside, the overall package is still a blast to play. It doesn’t take very long before the 'just one more level' addictiveness begins to take hold. This is helped by the number of units you unlock, all of which have a quirky charm and cute design. <em>Of</em> <em>course</em> the basic attacking unit is called a Pea Shooter, and <em>of course</em> the icy variant is a Frozen Pea Shooter. You can’t beat those kinds of puns! It’s a game that’s guaranteed to make even the most cold-hearted gamer crack a smile.</p>
<figure><a title="Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160084/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Plants vs Zombies: Replanted also comes with some quality-of-life improvements. One of the best new features is the ability to fast-forward the gameplay up to 2.5x speed. By default, these are the slow shambling type of zombies and there’s normally a long, slow gap between waves. But with the press of a button, they speed up to <strong>World War Z</strong> levels of fast. It makes playing feel more fluid and smooth; it also adds another layer of challenge for those who might find the standard gameplay flow too easy.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, I find myself really loving Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted. Its cute and quirky character designs are infectiously charming, and the gameplay is simple but effective. The graphics are easy on the eyes and help make the character designs shine. It’s a bummer that there were problems with the controls at launch, but even with those issues, it wasn't enough to prevent the game from being a botanical blast.</p></section>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/26/ps-plus-december-2025-monthly-games-features-lego-horizon-adventures-in-a-five-game-bonanza/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> Monthly Games for December 2025, and it’s a&nbsp;<em>big</em> month with a bumper crop of five games that includes one of their big first party games… in Lego form. There’s also a surprising amount of mutliplayer horror stuff for the festive season.</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus December 2025 Monthly Games?</span></p>


<p>There’s a big bundle of titles for PS Plus this month, available from Tuesday, 2nd December:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LEGO Horizon Adventures</strong> | PS5</li>
<li><strong>Killing Floor 3</strong> | PS5</li>
<li><strong>The Outlast Trials</strong> | PS4, PS5</li>
<li><strong>Synduality Echo of Ada</strong> | PS5</li>
<li><strong>Neon White</strong> | PS4, PS5</li>
</ul>

<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures is the biggest deal here, as Guerrilla Games and Studio Gobo’s Lego reimagining of their post-apocalyptic robo adventure. Play as Aloy and chums in a bricky adventure that does things a little bit differently to the Travellers Tales games, but looks absolutely gorgeous.</p>


<p>Then there’s the gruesome twosome of Killing Floor 3’s co-op sci-fi zombie blasting and The Outlast Trials’ co-op horror. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/28/killing-floor-3-review/">Killing Floor 3’s</a> a rather recent game, but didn’t have the greatest launch behind it, while The Outlast Trials has a solid cachet and recently was updated with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/21/the-outlast-trials-pvp-invasion-mode-is-out-now-just-in-time-for-halloween/">a new versus mode</a>.</p>

<p>With extraction shooters the talk of the town right now, thanks to ARC Raiders, it’s good to remember that there’s plenty of other examples out there too. Synduality Echo of Ada is just one such game, stuffed with cool mechs, customisable characters and tight combat, and putting its own polish on the extraction experience. We gave it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/24/synduality-echo-of-ada-review-the-ultimate-extraction-experience/">a hefty 9/10</a> in our review.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NEON WHITE | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X0b-qZTF0Mc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Perhaps the cream of the crop is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/22/neon-white-review/"><strong>Neon White</strong></a>, which Miguel absolutely adored. He said, “Neon White is a love letter to turn-of-the-decade internet weirdos. It’s full of rule-of-cool anime nostalgia, ear-shredding electronic music, and dialogue ripped straight out of my group chats. It’s a genuine game made for an audience rarely prioritised, but even if you don’t fit the archetypical person this game was made for, you’re still in for the most stylish and satisfying action-platformer I’ve ever experienced.”</p>
<h2>Can you still get the November 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>Yes! You’ve got until Monday 1st December to claim this month’s PS Plus games, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stray</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>EA Sports WRC</strong> | PS5</li>
<li><strong>TABS</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/heres-the-november-2025-ps-plus-monthly-games-cats-cars-and-tabs/">Head here for the full skinny</a> on that.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Splash Damage Enters Consultation Process Impacting All Staff, More Layoffs Incoming]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/splash-damage-enters-consultation-process-impacting-all-staff-layoffs/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A short two months after <a href="https://wccftech.com/developer-splash-damage-no-longer-owned-by-tencent-acquired-by-private-equity-investors/">it was acquired by an unnamed private equity group</a>, veteran support studio Splash Damage has announced it has entered a consultation process that will impact all staff members. While all current staff could potentially be laid off, it's unclear at the time of this writing how many will be impacted.</p>



<p>"<em>Today we announced to our teams that we are entering a studio-wide consultation process affecting all roles</em>," a post on the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/splash-damage_an-update-from-splash-damage-activity-7399486098588196864-pz0I/">studio's LinkedIn page began</a>. "<em>This was a difficult step for us to take, but we believe it is necessary so Splash Damage can remain agile and adaptable in what has been a very challenging market. We know this kind of change is emotionally tough, and we will do what we can to guide our people through this process with honesty and care. We're committed to exploring every option to retain talent and making sure those affected have meaningful support throughout</em>."</p>



<p>After quietly pulling away from its previous parent company in September, Tencent, though the studio's future was unclear, there was a bit of a sense that it could fare better away from Tencent than under it. Now, however, it's clear that's not the case, and if the consultation process wraps up before the end of the year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/splash-damage-ends-development-of-transformers-reactivate-lays-off-staff/">it'll be the studio's second layoff in 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Since 2020, Splash Damage has only been able to ship one game, Outcasters, which launched and died with Google Stadia. It supported games like Star Wars Hunters and Gears Tactics, but has been unable to get a game over the finish line since Outcasters. Its last major project, Transformers: Reactivate, was cancelled, which led to the layoffs in January 2025. </p>



<p>It's unfortunate to see Splash Damage struggle like so many other studios, especially because if this does end with the studio essentially shutting down, it'll be the latest veteran studio to be killed off. Splash Damage has been around for 20 years now, and that kind of staying power isn't easy to obtain. </p>

            <p>
I don't know if I'm allowed to write "dad I'd like to" you know what, even as an acronym, so I won't, but my current prediction for Scholar, the first of two new Nightfarers coming to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> as part of its Forsaken Hollows DLC, is that this is what an alarmingly large number of people will refer to him as. I get it! He's a bit grubby looking, but he's smart because he reads books and stuff. There's multitudes there.
</p>
<p>
Goofs and gafs aside, how about we take a look at what he actually does. According to the DLC's <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-the-forsaken-hollows">official website</a>, the Scholar boasts "impressive arcane levels" and can gain "incredible advantages through battlefield observation." I'm not exactly sure how this translates in-game, but there is one moment where he sort of scans a group of enemies that appear to be causing some trouble, after which they seemingly get easier to takedown.
</p>

<p>
Another spell, used during a boss fight against some clones of the player characters, seemingly links both you and your comrades to one another, but also the enemies to one another. After that, when one of the enemies gets killed, the other two die at the same time, so my guess is that there's a trade-off in that if one of you gets downed, so do the other two. He also has a sword! Seemingly nothing fancy about that particular fact, it looks like he uses it almost like a fencer does, but there's really not much more to say than that.
</p><p>
He is one of two new classes coming with the DLC, the other being the Undertaker, who is yet to receive a trailer herself. The Forsaken Hollows also brings with it two more bosses to face off against, as well as additional shifting earth and a mysterious "more." I'm sure that'll all be revealed soon enough, given that it's due out next week, December 4th.

              <p>The holiday season is here, and to celebrate the most festive time of year, PlayStation is offering all PlayStation Plus subscribers extra games to download and play in December. ‘Tis the season and all that.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/26/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-december-lego-horizon-adventures-killing-floor-3-the-outlast-trials-more/">On November 26, PlayStation revealed December’s monthly games</a> that will be available to all PS Plus subscribers across all tiers. These games will be available to add to your PlayStation library permanently on December 2. Once added, you can install them and play them whenever you want as long as you are an active PS Plus Essential, Extra, or Premium subscriber. Here’s the list of games and what platforms they are available on.</p> <ul> <li><em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em> – PS5</li> <li><em>Killing Floor 3</em> – PS5</li> <li><em>The Outlast Trials</em> – PS4, PS5</li> <li><em>Synduality Echo of Ada</em> – PS5</li> <li><em>Neon White</em> – PS4, PS5</li> </ul> <p>You don’t want to wait too long to grab these PS Plus monthly games, as they are only available to grab for free until January 5.</p> <p>This is one of the better months for PS Plus in some time<em>.<a href="https://kotaku.com/neon-white-pc-nintendo-switch-annapurna-interactive-got-1849072088"> Neon White</a></em> alone makes this a fantastic list of games. Its fast-paced platforming/shooting action is hard to put down, and the story it tells is equally engrossing. I expect many players will be fighting among friends to reach the top of the leaderboards.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile<em>, LEGO Horizon Adventures</em> is the perfect game for the holidays. If you have young kids hanging out at your house, and you can pull them away from <em>Roblox</em> for a few hours, <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-review-aloy-ps5-switch-pc-1851696761"><em>Horizon Adventures</em></a> is a fantastic co-op game that will help keep them distracted while the adults cook, clean, and wrap last-minute gifts.</p> <p>Or maybe you want to be scared during your holiday break? Well, then I’d check ou<em>t The Outlast Trials,</em> though you might want to scooch away the kids at your house before booting that one up. And don’t forget to add November’s freebies to your PlayStation account library. You have until December 1 to grab <em>Stray, EA Sports WRC 24, </em>and <em>Totally Accurate Battle Simulator.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Having inventory of extra PC RAM is going to be as valuable as having a stockpile of gold bars if trends continue at their current pace. Due to a claimed memory shortage across the industry, RAM prices have shot up exponentially over recent weeks. </p>



<p>It’s gotten to the point where buying a couple sticks of memory can cost more than a new GPU or even a fully priced video game console. </p>







<p>But how bad is the pricing situation, actually? Looking at storefronts like Newegg, and it paints a pretty dire picture for enthusiasts of all levels. Whether you just want one stick of 16GB or even 64GB for your new build, you better be ready to spend more than ever. Prices of memory have risen by as much as 250% since the beginning of November.</p>



<p>Below you can see just how much costs have gone up for consumers for anything from 16GB (2 x 8GB) to 64GB (2 x 32GB). And this specifically focuses on the current DDR5 generation of RAM.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>PC Memory</th><th>November 1 Price</th><th>November 26 Price</th><th>Percentage Increase</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>16GB T-Force</td><td>$77.99</td><td>$177.99</td><td>128.2%</td></tr><tr><td>16GB Kingston Fury </td><td>$62.99</td><td>$149.99</td><td>138.1%</td></tr><tr><td>32GB T-Force</td><td>$96.99</td><td>$339.99</td><td>250.5%</td></tr><tr><td>32GB G.Skill Flare X5</td><td>$97.99</td><td>$269.99</td><td>175.5%</td></tr><tr><td>32GB Corsair Vengeance </td><td>$142.99</td><td>$406.99</td><td>184.6%</td></tr><tr><td>32GB G.Skill Trident Z5 NEO</td><td>$104.99</td><td>$279.99</td><td>166.7%</td></tr><tr><td>64GB Corsair Vengeance</td><td>$239.99</td><td>$839.99</td><td>250%</td></tr><tr><td>64GB G.Skill Trident Z5 NEO</td><td>$204.99</td><td>$629.99</td><td>207.3%</td></tr><tr><td>64GB G.Skill Flare X5</td><td>$204.99</td><td>$569.99</td><td>178%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As the data shows, the availability of memory has turned the market into a chaotic place. It’s even gotten so bad that some stores are starting to sell the components at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1p55n8k/taken_at_microcenter_on_1123/?utm_source=embedv2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“Market Price”</a>. That’s something usually saved for Lobster and other seafood. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to a number of RAM manufacturers about when they think the prices could come down. Every single person who spoke gave a similar answer of uncertainty. That’s because of the fact that, often times, when there’s a shortage, it could take months and even years to catch back up to meet the demand. It’s the truest form of going day-by-day and week-by-week there is.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-is-there-a-pc-memory-shortage">Why Is There A PC Memory Shortage?</h2>



<p>These price increases while seemingly sudden and extreme, shouldn’t come as a surprise for those who’ve been following what’s happening. For those who are unaware, however, there’s a big reason why RAM costs have gone up the way they have: AI.</p>



<p>As AI infrastructure continues to expand worldwide, the components needed like memory and storage are being bought up. And these companies are willing to pay higher prices for more product. That means there’s just not enough to keep up with average consumer demand. And it seems to be a problem that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/ai-fuels-memory-chip-shortage-that-could-hit-phones-and-cars.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">may only get worse</a> and more expansive before it gets better. </p>



<p><strong>“It could be very bad for PCs, laptops, consumer electronics and automotive, which depend on cheap memory chips,”</strong> TriOrient’s vice president of research, Dan Nystedt, told CNBC.</p>

It's been 17 years and counting, but Ubisoft has sent out a job listing that suggests development on the follow-up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil/" data-ref-id="5000-4537">Beyond Good and Evil</a> is still in progress.</p><p>Ubisoft has posted a job on <a href="https://hitmarker.net/jobs/ubisoft-technical-sound-designer-m-f-nb-beyond-good-evil-2-montpellier-1584708" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hitmarker</a> for a technical sound designer for Beyond Good and Evil 2. The role calls for the person in question to have the duties of both a sound designer and an audio technical lead with an emphasis on creating audio assets, as well as proposing and integrating audio designs.</p><p>More intriguingly, the listing reconfirms that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 will be a prequel to the original game that offers "a seamless experience of exploration and space piracy across a solar system full of exotic locations, colorful characters and mysteries to uncover, solo or with friends." That suggests the sequel will have multiplayer capabilities</p><p>Last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-gets-a-launch-trailer/1100-6524417/" data-ref-id="1100-6524417">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition</a> set the stage for the prequel story by adding a side quest that allowed the main character, Jade, to learn about the people and creatures who raised her when she lived among a pirate crew while she was a child. However, it doesn't appear that the sequel will address the post-credits cliffhanger from the original game.</p><p>Michel Ancel--the director of the original Beyond Good &amp; Evil--stepped down from the sequel and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rayman-creator-michel-ancel-retires-but-beyond-good-evil-2-will-go-on/1100-6482347/" data-ref-id="1100-6482347">retired in 2020</a>.

                <p>If you've spent any time on X in recent days, you may have seen some gameplay "leaks" of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323" data-mce-href="/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. They've gone incredibly viral thanks to a poster named Zap Actu GTA6, who's admitted that the videos they've shared are all generated using artificial intelligence.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/increasingly-convincing-ai-generated-gta-6-gameplay-leaks-are-getting-millions-of-views-on-social-media" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.ign.com/articles/increasingly-convincing-ai-generated-gta-6-gameplay-leaks-are-getting-millions-of-views-on-social-media" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spotted by IGN</a>, Zap Actu GTA6 began posting these "leaks" on November 18. They all typically show some male or female figure walking through Leonida, a fictional state based on Florida. The <a href="https://x.com/zapactugta6/status/1990919582278709450" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://x.com/zapactugta6/status/1990919582278709450" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">first video</a> only generated 217 likes and 26,000 views, but subsequent ones gained more traction as Zap Actu GTA6 posted more. In <a href="https://x.com/zapactugta6/status/1991284160640827635" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://x.com/zapactugta6/status/1991284160640827635" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a video posted on November 19</a> that garnered 6,100 likes and 1.8 million views, Zap Actu GTA6 claimed these were from "several anonymous accounts" who filmed the clips "from inside Rockstar’s studios." Another one <a href="https://x.com/zapactugta6/status/1991957817180205341" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://x.com/zapactugta6/status/1991957817180205341" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on November 21</a> purported that a character has "facial features strongly resembling those of Leonardo DiCaprio." Despite claiming there's "absolutely no official confirmation" on anything being posted, Zap Actu GTA6 still noted that the leaks are real and serious.</p>

<p>That "leak" that really blew up was posted on November 25. Zap Actu GTA6 said the video they shared "surfaced on TikTok before being taken down." It allegedly showed a gameplay moment of someone controlling co-protagonist Lucia as she walked along what appeared to be a beach with a "dynamic weather system" that produced heavy clouds and rain showers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>The moment the first trailer for <em>Rental Family</em> dropped, it felt like the clouds parted and light poured down in a sign from the universe. This was the movie that would finally put Brendan Fraser, an actor I adored in my youth, on the map. The <a href="https://www.avclub.com/brendan-fraser-gets-choked-up-hearing-a-fans-words-of-s-1847465268?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Brenaissance</u></a> film that was promised.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n0pqP6ClcE8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="RENTAL FAMILY | Official Trailer | Searchlight Pictures"></iframe></figure><p>Back when I was in kindergarten, I was a kid who only watched Bruce Lee flicks (able to recite every line from memory) or random anime on TV. Never anything scary. I was a wimp, you see—a little scaredy-cat. But my mom had a VHS copy of <em>The Mummy</em> that I broke from loving it too much with repeated rewatches. Granted, I probably shouldn’t have been watching it at five (the <em>Freddy vs Jason</em> trailers were too scary for me), but hey, we were also the kind of family who treated <em>The Godfather</em> and <em>Scarface</em> as holiday background movie traditions, so who can blame me for experiencing a film before I was ready?</p><figure><figcaption><span>This was "so cool" (🏳️‍🌈🤔) to a baby Isaiah.</span></figcaption></figure><p>That film wasn’t just another entry in my early cinematic viewing. It was also an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/08/mummy-remains-classic-bisexual-awakening-movie-brendan-fraser-rachel-weisz?ref=aftermath.site"><u>early onset bisexual awakening</u></a> (Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold Vosloo, Patricia Velasquez, and Oded Fehr, I stood no chance). As far as my mom knew, I just found Fraser “really cool,” but we all know what I meant without the words to articulate it. But, more importantly, it opened my eyes to what an actor is. Fraser not only became the definition of the word, he also became the blueprint for my taste in films: action mixed with comedy, charisma balanced with earnestness, and a softness against toxic masculinity. Still, whenever I rewound a tape in our modest <a href="https://halbaronproject.web.illinois.edu/items/show/45?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Cabrini Green project building</u></a> (Delores Wilson is my grandmother, by the way) after school, I was enamored by the gravity of his art. From then on, I only wanted my mom to rent Fraser movies from Blockbuster because he was the best proof that an actor could be romantic, funny, heroic, and deeply human all at once.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F-lto1Jc2Kg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Brendan Fraser Breaks Down His Career, from 'The Mummy' to 'The Whale' | Vanity Fair"></iframe></figure><p>I watched both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PP9VGoP8xnI&amp;pp=ygUcZ2VvcmdlIG9mIHRoZSBqdW5nbGUgdHJhaWxlcg%3D%3D&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>George of the Jungle</em>s</u></a> and I even watched those <a href="https://youtu.be/5cKjOl2wr2A?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Looney Tunes</em> live action films</u></a>—dated feature-length advertisements, sure, but formative cinema for my hero's uncanny ability to charm no matter how ridiculous the premise of the movie. And as a child who had my eight grade mentor break the news one random evening after school that just because I saw Bruce Lee in a film yesterday doesn’t mean he’s still alive, my mom telling me Fraser was still alive doing things was both a comfort about the fleeting mortality of life and a promise that I’d still be able to be awed by his movies for years to come.&nbsp;</p><p>But the older I got, the fewer movies I saw him in. And after <em>The Mummy 3</em> at 11 (starring Jet Li and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/michelle-yeoh-ne-zha-ii-interview-2000643804?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Michelle Yeoh</u></a>—my action movie Mt. Rushmores of Hong Kong cinema), he virtually disappeared.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So when <a href="https://www.avclub.com/film-review-the-whale-brendan-fraser-darren-aronofsky-1849855211?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>The Whale</u></em></a> arrived when I was comfortably feeling life out as an adult, marketed as his “<a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/features/brendan-fraser-the-whale-career-1235399057/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>comeback</u></a>,” I felt conflicted. It won him awards, but to me it reeked of Oscar-bait misery. The direction of Darren Aronofsky (a director I can comfortably call a hack on a good day)leaned into trauma exploitation, treating Fraser’s character like a wounded puppy in those <a href="https://youtu.be/tjZ5dld2qHs?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Sarah McLachlan ASPCA commercials</u></a> rather than an actor with his full, wide range of talent on display. His performance was strong—especially since he was working through his own Hollywood trauma in the film—but the movie itself felt like audiences were crying at him instead of with him. That one goddamn poster of him looking miserable didn’t help.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nx6jZ0zJuc4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="RENTAL FAMILY | Outsider Official Clip | Searchlight Pictures"></iframe></figure><p>That’s why director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikari_(director)?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Hikari</u></a>’s <em>Rental Family</em> feels like the real Brendan Fraser renaissance. Finally, Fraser isn’t just doing <a href="https://gizmodo.com/brendan-fraser-doom-patrol-robotman-comeback-whale-1849501496?ref=aftermath.site"><u>comic-book jury duty</u></a> or prestige cinema misery porn—he’s back as a full actor. Here, he plays Phillip Vandarpleog, an American actor whose career bloom has faded, reduced to wacky commercial gigs to pay the bills in Japan. Until he stumbles into the bizarre (<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/30/japans-rent-a-family-industry?ref=aftermath.site"><u>and actual Japanese industry</u></a>) world of “rental families”---services where actors are hired to play roles in people’s lives. The film is basically Nathan Fielder’s <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a40971499/the-rehearsal-nathan-fielder-psychologist-interview/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>The Rehearsal</u></em></a> meets <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d299rICUzU&amp;pp=ygULa2FwcGEgbWlrZXk%3D&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><em><u>Kappa Mikey</u></em></a>, but played straight. Not therapy, but some bizarro capitalistic extra steps to something resembling closure for clientele. Be it stand-ins at their funerals, where they get to hear good things and hard truths about themselves never meant to reach their ears, infidelity interventions, weddings, and even surrogate fathers.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Searchlight Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p>I caught the film (which released worldwide on my freaking birthday—a sign, I tell you!) at the Chicago International Film Festival, and I loved it. So much so, I even looked up the exact weekender bag Fraser lugged around in the film to feel vicariously close to my childhood hero in my own parasocially acceptable adult way. But more than anything, <em>Rental Family</em> feels revelatory because it gives Fraser space to be the actor he always was: not trapped in sad-drama roles, but thriving in a dramedy with a mix of humor and heart that shaped my love of movies.&nbsp;</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p><span>Searchlight Pictures</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>If the past seven paragraphs weren’t evident enough, I can’t talk about this film objectively, if there ever were a way to endeavor to do so with any piece of media. I’m too close to it. Fraser was a linchpin in my appreciation of cinema, and seeing him return to the kind of work that made him a shining star in my eyes—but with deeper emotional resonance, I finally have the words to describe—feels…well, moving.&nbsp;</p><p>If there ever were an actual inception point for his career resurgence, it is <em>Rental Family</em>. While sure, the film <a href="https://joysauce.com/rental-family-skims-the-surface-of-japans-rent-a-family-industry/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>yadda yaddas its way around not fully addressing the awkwardness of rental families</u></a> as a real-life Japanese industry, I’m giving Fraser his flowers for reminding me that he’s just as much a tour de force as he was in my childhood: a kind, funny, deeply human presence both on-screen and off. May the sun never set on the Brenaissance. </p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/criterion-mobile-closet-picks-peter-decker-interview-chicago-international-film-festival/"><div><p>Criterion’s Mobile Closet Wasn’t About The Van—It Was About IRL Friendships We Made Along The (Five-Hour) Way - Aftermath</p><p>Fifteen years ago Guillermo del Toro was scheduled to drop by Criterion’s New York, and sparked an unexpected tradition.</p><p><span>Isaiah Colbert</span></p></div></a></figure>

The AIR SNES are a heavily customized version of the Nike Air Max 90 inspired by other <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24221246/can-you-guess-which-consoles-inspired-these-custom-shoeboys-sneakers">gaming-themed sneakers like Bull Airs’ ShoeBoys</a>, but Bonzanini’s creation doubles as a functional retro console.</p><p>Given the size of the Super Nintendo, and the chunky cartridges it used, Bonzanini decided against trying to trim down and shrink the console’s electronics to fit inside a shoe that was still wearable. They instead opted to go the emulation route and used a compact <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/28/14762228/raspberry-pi-zero-w-wireless-adds-wifi-and-bluetooth">Raspberry Pi Zero W</a>. It has more than enough processing power to play 16-bit SNES games using the RetroPie emulator that Bonzanini customized to match the look and feel of the sneaker.</p><p>But you won’t find the microcomputer hidden away in the sole of the Air Max 90. All of the electronics, including a battery with enough capacity for up to 30 minutes of gameplay, can be found inside the sneaker’s tongue. The Raspberry Pi Zero W includes an integrated Mini HDMI port, but to “make the design feel like it could exist in 1990,” Bonzanini added a small analog converter so the AIR SNES connects to a TV using retro RCA cables.</p><p>The sneakers even work with an original SNES gamepad, but to keep the cable wrangling to a minimum Bonzanini upgraded the controller using an <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-mod-kit-for-original-snes-sfc-controller-old-edition">8BitDo Mod Kit</a> so it connects to the Raspberry Pi wirelessly over Bluetooth. Given the ever-growing popularity of retro gaming nostalgia and sneaker culture there’s little doubt Bonzanini could sell as many pairs of AIR SNES as they could make. But unfortunately they’re just a one-off creation with no plans to commercialize the design.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/829880/gustavo-bonzanini-nike-air-max-90-sneaker-super-nintendo]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Samsung enjoys a great reputation in the electronics industry, especially when it comes to its extensive lineup of tablets, ranging from affordable models to high-end models such as the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra (that cost over $1,000). The <strong>Galaxy Tab A9+ model is placed in the budget category</strong> and provides all the basic functionalities of a tablet at an affordable cost. Now available at a record-low price on Amazon,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/"> the Black Friday offer has cut the 64GB / WiFi tablet price to $149 from the earlier cost of $219</a> and makes it the lowest-priced quality tablet in the industry.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>11-Inch Screen with 90Hz Refresh</h2>
<p>The <strong>11-inch screen means you get plenty of room to watch videos</strong>, work, and play without the bulk of larger tablets. The<strong> 90Hz refresh rate</strong> means you get even smoother animations and video compared with the typical 60Hz offered on other budget tablets. While the brightness levels are sufficient in indoor conditions, using it in direct sunlight outdoors still isn’t optimal, just like other tablets in the same price range. The tablet has an average battery performance similar to other tablets in the same range.</p>
<p>The <strong>quad-speaker audio system is boasting Dolby Atmos</strong> and provides better audio than the average tablet, courtesy of the soundstage effect. Videos and TV shows come alive with surround sound, whose audio effects help in better listening, particularly in the center. Playing tunes using the quad-speaker audio system provides better audio than the average tablet Speaker, since the audio system has separate audio inputs on the left and right side. The<strong> four speakers are optimized in a landscape setup</strong>, and allows the mobile tablet device to offer better left and right audio stereo when watching videos.</p>



<p>The improved chipset ensures there is sufficient power available for all basic needs like browsing, video watching, social networking, emails, and gaming, without the annoyance and disappointment that accompanies underperforming and budget-friendly tablets. Multiple Chrome tabs run well, video streaming occurs in high definition, and most leading mobile games run at an adequate frame rate.</p>
<p>The <em>Multi Window Display</em> feature means you can have <strong>multiple apps running at the same time in split-screen</strong> and floating window modes, making the tablet truly a productivity tool. Surf websites and jot notes in OneNote, watch videos on YouTube and respond to emails, and even cook recipes while video chatting with family. The large screen has room for up to three apps running side by side, without overcrowding each individual screen. This multitasking feature pushes the Tab A9+ beyond the territory of a consumption tablet.</p>



<p>With a <strong>thickness of only 6.9mm and a weight that measures in at 480g</strong>, there’s no denying the phone’s portability. This lightweight smartphone means that when you have to spend long periods holding the smartphone, you won’t experience much fatigue in the arms. The smartphone’s ruggedness means that you don’t have to worry about the typical drops and bumps when using the smartphone in your family.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Tab A9+ is now available for $149 and comes with features such as an 11-inch 90Hz screen, quad speakers with Dolby Atmos, a refined processor, Multi Window functionality and the ability to <strong>expand the microSD card slot</strong>, all at 32% off the normal price on this Black Friday.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review-impressions-2000647644</link>
            <guid>1365601</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Yeah, I’m playing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"><i><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</span></i></a><span>. Not the weird campaign or the extra-large Zombies offering, but the multiplayer. Team Deathmatch, mostly, maybe some Kill Confirmed. A few hours a couple of days a week, ass parked on the couch, brain on autopilot, cranking some </span><i><span>CoD</span></i><span>. This describes me recently, but it could also describe versions of me stretching back more than 15 years ago.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s not nostalgia as much as it’s resignation, or the quiet reliance on something familiar. </span><i><span>Halo Infinite</span></i><span> feels empty and sad. </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span> is too big and tactical for my twitchy shooter preference. </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i><span> and</span><i><span> Arc Raiders</span></i><span> are much longer time sucks. In this regard, I suppose I’m Activision’s ideal consumer: a tired millennial who just wants to shoot shit quickly.</span></p>

 <p><span>When playing </span><i><span>Black Ops 7,</span></i><span> I am pulled into a parallel universe like the one from </span><i><span>Interstellar</span></i><span>. Every </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> that has ever existed or will exist is here, and I can press all of their buttons at once. The pre-game lobby music sounds identical to the music from </span><i><span>Black Ops 6</span></i><span>, several of the Operators are from last year’s Zombies mode, and the map I’m playing on is a recreation of one from 2012’s </span><i><span>Black Ops 2</span></i><span>. Nuketown 24/7 is here, and it’s available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It always has been.</span></p>

 <p><span>The various bells and whistles that are supposed to make this version of </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> worth spending another $70 on are mostly lost on me (Activision gave me a code, plus it’s on Game Pass). I sink into comfort, into the pre-made loadouts or the singular one I build myself (a kitted-out AR, Semtex, Cold-Blooded), into cooking a sticky before throwing it into a crowded room, into reloading after every shot fired to ensure I have a full clip, and I relax into repetition.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I queue up in a lobby. Someone calls someone else the r-slur. I go 25 and 4. The lobby automatically queues up for another game. Someone calls someone else the f-slur. I go 18 and 9. I do this on repeat for a few hours, before dinner or bed beckons. Am I having fun? I guess?</span></p>

 <p><span>There are new things in </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span> multiplayer, of course. The most noticeable is the wall jump, which the sweatier players have already perfected in a particularly irritating manner—imagine your standard </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> but with the vertical leap of a </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> game that’s far more erratic. Skirmish, the 20v20 mode that sees players glide into a larger map on suited wings to try and capture various points, keeps me occupied for a few rounds. Then I return to TDM.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The new maps are fun, but they all blur together into a vague, </span><i><span>Call of Duty-shaped</span></i><span> smear. This doesn’t deter me, though it should. Instead, I am almost soothed by the banality of it all. I realize after a particularly dominant match that, out of all the shooter franchises I’ve played throughout the years, I am most attuned to these former pseudo-mil-sims turned power fantasies. While playing </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span>, I enter a flow state that I can’t mimic in any other game: my fingers move without me willing them to, my body relaxes like I’m neck-deep in a sauna, my eyes glaze over as if under a spell.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Though it’s difficult to argue the artistic merits of a gigantic video game publisher annually pushing out a hoo-rah shooter (</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-activision-statement-blops7-steam-ps5-2000644397"><span>with at least some help from generative AI</span></a><span>), I can’t lie and act like I’m not playing them. But like the comfort breakfast I would eat every day in elementary school to exercise some control over my life, I will eventually grow tired of this taste. First, it was Entemann’s corn muffins, then it was Eggo waffles. Now it’s </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span>, tomorrow it might be </span><i><span>Halo Infinite </span></i><span>again. For those of us who love first-person shooters with fast queue times, the pickings are slim, and </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> is there every year. </span></p>

<p>CD Projekt Red’s Q3 2025 earnings call is underway today, revealing the studio’s current financial status and other details. We have already been informed that Cyberpunk 2077 has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-hits-new-sales-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 35 million copies</a>. Now, let’s get into the dev team expansion, which adds new developers across all of their ongoing projects. </p>

Work on it began with under 50 devs in 2023, and the team has now grown to just under 150 devs by 2025. Their goal is to bring this number to over 300 by 2027.

                <p>Microsoft has released some new data points that highlight how Xbox Cloud Gaming is growing. The company said in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/26/xbox-cloud-gaming-expansion-india-brazil-argentina-countries/?ocid=Platform_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Photo_lrn_11.26.1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post </a>that cloud gaming hours from Game Pass members increased by 45% compared to the same time in 2024. Additionally, Microsoft said cloud gaming users on console are spending 45% more time streaming games via the cloud and 24% more on other devices.</p><p>Microsoft did not provide anything in the way of specifics regarding the increase in Xbox Cloud Gaming usage. For example, with Xbox Cloud Gaming expanding to many more places around the world and devices, it wouldn't be surprising to see usage go up, too. </p><p>After years of existence as a beta product, Xbox Cloud Gaming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-exits-beta-with-some-improvements/1100-6535146/" data-ref-id="1100-6535146">launched its 1.0 version in October 2025</a>. Also at this time, Microsoft announced improvements for Xbox Cloud Gaming, including better-quality streaming up to 1440p.</p><p>Microsoft launched Xbox Cloud Gaming 1.0 at the same time that it announced a 50% price hike for Game Pass Ultimate, and a membership is required. Streaming is also available for the lower-priced Essential and Premium tiers, but only Ultimate members get access to the highest quality at up to 1440p.</p><p>In other Xbox Cloud Gaming news, Microsoft recently launched the service in India, which the company says is the "fastest-growing gaming market in the world" and one that has more than 500 million gamers. Xbox Cloud Gaming is now available in 29 countries.</p><p>The appeal of Xbox Cloud Gaming is that people can stream games almost instantly instead of having to download games, which can be quite hefty. People can stream Xbox games to a variety of devices they may already own, including Xbox consoles, smartphones, tablets, and TVs. Soon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/your-next-car-could-also-be-your-xbox-thanks-to-lg-and-cloud-gaming/1100-6534573/" data-ref-id="1100-6534573">Xbox Cloud Gaming will be available in cars.</a> Of course, a consistent and strong internet connection is essential to get the best experience, and anyone with data caps on their internet should be mindful of that.</p><p>Microsoft has maintained that its cloud gaming efforts are not aiming to supplant its Xbox hardware business, and that offering cloud streaming is a means to give players another option for how they want to play their games.</p><p>Initially announced as Project xCloud in 2018, Xbox Cloud Gaming officially launched in 2020 as part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription plan.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>CD Projekt Red has just announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> has passed 35m copies sold, and that it reached the milestone faster than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> - the game that preceded it.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1993715326782251511">CDPR announced the sales milestone on X</a> and in <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2025/11/prezentacja-wynikowa-q3-2025-en.pdf">a quarterly financial report</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0ENiOGmcic&amp;feature=youtu.be">accompanying video</a>. It was in that video that chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz said, "This is a better result than The Witcher 3 was able to achieve in the same post-release timeframe. Cyberpunk is currently our main source of revenue," he said, "and we continue to expand its availability."</p>
<p>It's been a busy year for Cyberpunk 2077, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playing-cyberpunk-2077-for-the-first-time-on-switch-2-reminds-me-of-one-of-gta-onlines-greatest-quirks">an impressive adaptation released for the Switch 2 launch</a> earlier this year, a tailored version released for Mac computers, and a release for Sony's subscription service PlayStation Plus. All of these things helped push CD Projekt's earnings higher than when the Cyberpunk 2077 expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> launched - alongside a major game overhaul - in 2023.</p>
<p>CD Projekt Red is currently bulking out the Cyberpunk 2 team as the project enters full production - there are now 135 developers working on the game, <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2025/11/prezentacja-wynikowa-q3-2025-en.pdf">according to the updated financial report</a>. But the studio's biggest project by far is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, which has 447 people working on it.</p>

<p>That project - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-unreal-tech-demo-was-running-on-a-standard-ps5-at-60fps-with-ray-tracing">The Witcher 4 - was shown in an Nvidia-related tech demo in the summer</a>, and CDPR was insistent that it was running on PS5, at 60 frames-per-second - an impressive claim given the visual quality on show. Will we see anything more of The Witcher 4 this year at The Game Awards, I wonder? It's one of the titles vying for the Most Anticipated Game award - something Piotr Nielubowicz referenced in this investor video.</p><p>"Finally I would like to mention that we're flattered by The Witcher 4's nomination in the Most Anticipated game category at this year's The Game Awards," he said. "This nomination, which comes despite the fact that we haven't yet kicked off the game's proper marketing campaign, shows the extent to which the fourth instalment in The Witcher series is already hotly anticipated."</p>
<p>The Witcher 4 stars Geralt's daughter-like figure and protégé Ciri, who was semi-playable throughout The Witcher 3. The question is, will Geralt be semi-playable in her adventure - or playable at all at some point? That we'll have to wait and see.</p>

The adorable baby animation with which the company kept us on tenterhooks for three days straight as it drip-fed us information about its context? Well, it looks like it'll be cropping up again, this time in an upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pikmin_bloom">Pikmin Bloom</a> event.</p>
<p>As of tomorrow (27th November), anyone logging into Pikmin Bloom will receive a Gold Seedling, which promises a special Decor Pikmin inside. And this isn't any old Decor Pikmin either, oh no, this is a Seedling that "seems to have a connection to the short movie Pikmin Close to You". At least, that's how the <a href="https://pikminbloom.com/news/nov25-closetoyou">Pikmin Bloom blog post</a> puts it.</p>
<p>We don't know the exact form that this Seedling will take, but considering that Decor Pikmin usually style a cute bit of — you guessed it — <em>decor</em> on their heads, we'd wager it will be something along the lines of a Pikmin wearing a stylish pacifier, rattle or some sort of stuffed toy. Talk about <em>synergy</em>, eh?</p>
<p>You'll be able to collect this special Seedling from the app's home screen simply by logging in any time between <strong>27th Nov 2025</strong> and <strong>26th Nov 2026</strong>, so you have a whopping great year to make sure that you pick it up.</p>
<p>It's unclear whether anything else will come of the Pikmin short movie for the time being, but that sure was a fun week while it lasted. Here's hoping there will be a couple more cameos from the little guys in <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, or how about that Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> that we're all after? Whatever it takes to keep us Pikmin fans happy...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Since the beginning of the PlayStation Plus subscription service, one of the baseline features has always been that subscribers get three free games with their subscription every month. Now, under the new system, that feature has stayed for all subscribers, though players at the higher PS Plus Extra and Premium tiers get more than just three games per month. For December 2025, PlayStation has added two more games for PS Plus Essential subscribers as a holiday treat.</p>



<p>Announced in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/26/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-december-lego-horizon-adventures-killing-floor-3-the-outlast-trials-more/">PlayStation Blog post,</a> next month players subscribed to PS Plus Essential (and higher) will be able to add five games to their library of PS Plus games, including two games that were released this year with Killing Floor 3 and Synduality Echo of Ada, and three major 2024 releases with The Outlast Trials, Neon White, and LEGO Horizon Adventures.</p>



<p>"<em>To mark the year’s end and to start the holiday celebrations early, we’re pleased to make December’s PlayStation Plus Monthly Games lineup a special one, with additional bonus titles available to PS Plus members* in select regions</em>," writes Adam Michel, director of game services and content at Sony. </p>

<p>All five games will be available for players to add to their libraries on December 2, 2025, which means that December 1 will be the last day for players to add the November 2025 games to their library: Stray, EA Sports WRC 24, and Totally Accurate Battle Simulator (TABS).</p>



<p>With Essential-tier players getting two extra games, it'll be interesting to see if there's a similar treat in store for Extra and Premium-tier subscribers. November 2025 was a highlight month for Extra-tier players, with games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pacific-drive-still-wakes-the-deep-ps-plus-extra-game-catalog-november-2025/">Grand Theft Auto V, Pacific Drive, and Thank Goodness You're Here all in the lineup</a>. Hopefully, there's something special prepared for the lineup of Extra and Premium games for December 2025.</p>

            <p>
To say <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> hasn't had an easy go of it would perhaps be a mild understatement, though that's not to say it's entirely undeserved. There was that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-boss-admits-the-trumpish-hat-he-wore-at-summer-game-fest-was-a-publicity-stunt-after-it-goes-sour">absolutely silly hat malarky</a> for one, creating a not particularly welcoming vibe, and there was of course some controversy involving the pricing for some of its in-game items. All of that unfortunately led to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-their-hat-and-pricing-controversies-splitgate-2-studio-1047-games-have-laid-off-an-unspecified-number-of-devs">two rounds</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-devs-1047-games-lay-off-more-staff-as-the-shooter-heads-back-to-beta-eyeing-a-2026-rerelease">layoffs</a>, and a switch back to a beta version of the game. Now, it looks like it'll be back in action next month.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2918300/view/590662508143970096">very brief post over on Steam</a>, developer 1047 Games shared that the Splitgate 2 beta will be ending next week, December 4th, "with relaunch coming later in December." If you're taking part in said beta test, they also noted that the beta season and active battle passes will be ending, as well as your seasonal rank progress, so keep that in mind.
</p>
<p>
No specifics were shared about when that launch may happen, but they did say they are "excited to share more soon," and December is right around the corner, so you probably won't have to wait long.
</p>
<p>
I haven't tried out Splitgate 2 for myself, so I can't comment on how it seems to be shaping up, though in a separate, recent blog post related to this recent playtest, 1047 did outline some of the changes they've made since the beta started. 
</p><p>
This includes simple things like bug fixes and optimizations to bigger jobbies like new maps and weapons, removing factions, and bringing back a number of different modes. According to the devs the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> is in "the best place it's ever been," but I suppose the masses will find out if that's true soon enough!

            <link>https://kotaku.com/outdoor-party-season-is-not-over-and-neither-is-this-big-amazon-deal-on-the-jbl-xtreme-3-waterproof-speaker-2000625491</link>
            <guid>1365544</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Even though winter has fully settled in, Black Friday isn’t the end of the celebration season. Holiday parties, cozy nights in, and even snowy trips all feel better with the right soundtrack, and now’s the perfect time to upgrade your audio with the JBL Xtreme 3 portable waterproof Bluetooth speaker. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5961/">It’s just $200 — over $130 off its regular price — during this Amazon Black Friday sale</a>.</p>
<p>The JBL Xtreme 3 is a party machine in search of a party, outdoors or inside. It’s IP67-rated waterproof and dustproof so you don’t have to scramble if a sudden rain shower pops up, and despite its compact and abundantly portable size, it brings enough high-quality volume to entertain your whole guest list and has the battery capacity to do it all day and all night.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5961/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Sound Guaranteed</h2>
<p>Of course the Xtreme 3 Bluetooth speaker has top-notch sound — it’s a JBL product. There’s a passive radiator at each end of the speaker for deep, powerful bass, and two sets of drivers and tweeters to handle the rest of the audio needs. It’s just a Bluetooth connection away from delivering 100W of your favorite playlist over a wide area, and it can connect to more than one at the same time so you’re not hogging the DJ duties.</p>
<p>There will be plenty of time to share, though, thanks to the Xtreme 3’s 15 hours of playtime from a single charge. And speaking of sharing, the JBL Xtreme 3 has a USB port built in that can charge a smartphone or other device while it charges up your party with great music. And if you really want to rile the neighbors, the Xtreme 3 has JBL’s PartyBoost feature so it can be paired with another compatible JBL speaker to either double your sound or create wireless stereo effects.</p>



<h2>Road Ready</h2>
<p>When you’re buying a portable Bluetooth speaker, the Bluetooth part is pretty much understood to be the same across models. But the definition of “portable” tends to vary. Rest assured, the JBL Xtreme 3 is, in fact, exceptionally portable. It’s just under a foot long and 5 inches around, and weighs slightly over 4 pounds. It’s the perfect size to tuck under your arm and carry for as long as you need to, but there’s also an included strap for even easier transportation.</p>
<p>Stand your ground against the pumpkin spice wave — summer’s not over yet! Invite your friends to the pool or the beach, and before you do that, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5961/">smash the buy button on this great Amazon deal that drops the price of the JBL Xtreme 3 waterproof portable Bluetooth speaker by over $130, all the way down to just $200.</a></p>

<p>CD Projekt Red’s latest earnings call has revealed that Cyberpunk 2077 has sold 35 million unit.</p>



<p>All we have been hearing about in recent days is Cyberpunk 2077’s sequel. We recently saw Keanu Reeves asking the devs to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-creator-pondsmith-keanu-reeves-2077-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact him for the sequel</a>. There was also a job listing that suggested an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2-could-feature-online-multiplayer-new-job-listing-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online multiplayer feature</a> for the title. However, today is not about the sequel; it is about the original game that reached a spectacular sales milestone after overcoming many hurdles. </p>







<h2 id="h-cyberpunk-2077-surpasses-35-million-copies-sold">Cyberpunk 2077 Surpasses 35 Million Copies Sold</h2>



<p>Thanks to CD Projekt Red’s <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q3 2025 presentation</a>, we now know that Cyberpunk 2077 has sold 35 million copies. This number is as of November 26, 2025, and it includes copies of the game sold separately and those included in the Ultimate Edition bundle. CD Projekt Red is currently laying the foundation for Cyberpunk 2 by expanding its Boston team. They expect the developer team to reach 300 developers by 2027; it currently stands at just under 150.</p>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 hitting this sales milestone is truly an inspirational story for all game developers. Who remembers the game’s state when it was first released in 2020? The title was in the worst possible condition, making it almost unplayable for players and prompting refunds across all platforms. It was all thanks to the devs’ patience and hard work that they were able to bring the title back to life and deliver even more solid content with the Phantom Liberty DLC.</p>







<p>In other news, Cyberpunk 2077’s update 2.31 added <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-2-31-autodrive-photo-mode-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AutoDrive and new Photo Mode updates</a>. Additionally, Cyberpunk Edgerunners 2 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-officially-confirmed-at-anime-expo-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially confirmed</a> at Anime Expo 2025.

<p>Sony has announced that five (!!) games are being made available in December as part of the monthly free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers.</p>



<p>Starting Tuesday, December 2 and running through Monday, January 5, PlayStation Plus members at any level can claim a mix of new and older games that you may have missed in recent years. </p>



<p>Before getting into what’s coming up, you still have until December 1 to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-free-monthly-games-revealed-for-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claim November’s free games</a>. </p>

<p>As mentioned, Sony is giving subscribers five free games in December.

<p>Now, while there are five games available this month, it’s important to note that they are available in “select regions”. To find out if your region is included, you’ll have to check the PlayStation Store on December 2. </p>



<p>This month, the five games available for PlayStation Plus subscribers are:</p>



<ul>
<li>LEGO Horizon Adventures | PS5</li>

<li>The Outlast Trials | PS4, PS5</li>



<li>Synduality Echo of Ada | PS5</li>



<li>Neon White | PS4, PS5</li>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 Essential Starter Guide</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">A possible option is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review-good-company/1900-6418420/">Battlefield 6</a>, since the FPS has seen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-first-month-sales-were-higher-than-any-game-since-2022-in-the-us/1100-6536380/">the highest first-month sales in the US since 2022</a>. Last month, EA announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-sells-7-million-copies-for-biggest-opening-of-all-time-for-the-series/1100-6535488/">Battlefield 6 had sold 7 million copies</a>. Of course, a competitor in the shooter space could also be behind the "pop sounds"--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. Or maybe it's neither, and the person was playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arc-raiders-review-us-against-the-world/1900-6418435/">Arc Raiders</a>, Grand Theft Auto V, or something else entirely. Though we probably can rule out recent Nintendo releases like Pokemon Legends: Z-A and Kirby Air Riders.</p><p>The whole incident seems to be a misunderstanding. But that hasn't always been the case with police and video games. Over the past decade and more, swatting has seen authorities called on popular streamers under false pretenses. In 2015, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/three-swatting-incidents-attributed-to-teenage-min/1100-6426236/">a 13-year-old Minecraft player faced serious legal consequences</a> for allegedly three separate instances of swatting.</p>

<section><p>The new League of Legends trading card game takes familiar mechanics and streamlines them in smart ways.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Riot Games recently launched Riftbound, a trading-card game based on the wildly popular League of Legends franchise. While the first thought that comes to mind when coming across a new TCG in an overcrowded market is usually “another one?” I’m here to tell you that not only does Riftbound have a strong foundation for a casual/competitive game, it actually improves and fixes many mechanics seen in other TCGs. Most notably, Riftbound addresses my biggest issues with Magic: The Gathering and its 30-year-old design that at times feels wildly outdated. Here’s a breakdown of just some of the many improvements I noticed while playing Riftbound as a seasoned Magic player.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Casual Yet Competitive</strong></p><p dir="ltr">One of my least favorite aspects of Magic is having to juggle multiple decks for multiple situations. When playing Limited, I have to build a 40-card deck. When playing Pauper or Vintage, I have to maintain 60-card decks. When playing Commander with friends at the local brewery, I have to carry around a 100-card behemoth of a deck. The different formats all carry their own restrictions and decklists and it can be a lot to maintain for a single card game. This issue doesn’t exist for Riftbound, as any 40-card deck you buy or build is good for use in 1v1, 2v2, and three- or four-player Free-for-All. While any TCG can inspire the “grinding” mindset that comes with entering competitive play, I find myself regularly playing casual Riftbound matches simply because the game scales so well without deck modifications. It encourages the mindset of building a single deck and being able to play it in multiple formats, and means my Jinx deck that I’m so proud of can be shown off a lot more. To learn a bit more about this design choice of scalable formats, I talked with Nik Davidson, game design architect over at Riot Games.</p><p dir="ltr">“I've worked on Magic and Marvel Snap and Pokemon, and I love all of those games. There's so much that can be drawn from all the best design innovations over the years. I think one thing that we really wanted to do was focus on the social multiplayer. That is something that games have done, but we felt we could do with a fresh take if we're doing it from the ground up," Davison said. "The fact that Riftbound plays so well as a four-player free-for-all or three-player free-for-all, or a 2v2, that's not accidental. That was really baked into the initial pitch for the game. That social competitive play is something that I think Riftbound does uniquely well."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1860/18602785/4612159-riftbound2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4612159" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1860/18602785/4612159-riftbound2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4612159"></a><figcaption>A game of Riftbound in action.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1860/18602785/4612159-riftbound2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Player Urgency</strong></p><p dir="ltr">If you play Commander, you’ve likely experienced being knocked out of the game far before anyone else--being forced to sit there and watch while everyone else continues to play. Riftbound circumvents this lackluster experience by being a point-control game, in which players are racing to collect eight points by conquering or holding battlefields. By having this be the goal of the game, Riftbound ensures that every player is participating for the entirety of the match. Sometimes, a player can even come back from behind by playing smartly while others are dunking it out.</p><p dir="ltr">Riftbound also ensures that you’re playing the game more often than you’re not, as players need to only shuffle their decks once at the start of the game. There’s no “tutor” or searching cards, meaning no more having to sit there while someone struggles to shuffle a 100-card deck over and over again.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>A Resource System That Never Leaves You Screwed</strong></p><p dir="ltr">One of the least appealing aspects of Magic is its outdated mana system. Players having to draw into resources and play a single land per turn leads to slow games, especially if you’re “mana screwed,” meaning you either haven't drawn enough lands or lack the right mana colors to play your spells. It feels bad and keeps players from playing the game. Riftbound doesn't have this issue, as it features the rune system, wherein players get to channel two per turn from a separate deck of 12 cards. This design choice leads to faster starts and players always having decisions to make on their turns instead of playing a single (or worse, no) land per turn before passing.</p><p dir="ltr">More powerful spells and units in Riftbound require a “Power” cost, where a rune of the corresponding color must be “recycled” to the bottom of the rune deck. This provides players with a healthy curve, but also allows for explosive and impactful turns that can’t be repeated turn after turn. This creates some of the most hype-heavy moments I’ve experienced in a TCG in recent memory. Using Kai’sa as a Legend, and her ability to ramp into a Time Warp to take an extra turn, led to me scoring winning-game points that felt like solving a puzzle. Davidson said of the system:</p><p dir="ltr">“The original trio of Dave Guskin, Dave Smith, and John Mormon came up with a similar system relatively early. It was just one of those things where you take your first shot and try to reiterate it from there. The first shot turned out really close to the mark. It's gone through some iterations since then, but when I first talked to people about joining the Riftbound team, I was told ‘Yeah, we've got a new resource system’ and I'm like, ‘Oh no,’ because normally you can have a new resource system or a good resource system. But in this case, we lucked out and got both. I actually wouldn't say it's luck. Those guys are some of the best in the business. The thing that this resource does, that I really, really love, is it gives you a balance of consistency and choices. You get to choose when you're expending those power costs. You get to choose how much in your deckbuilding you're focusing on being able to consistently ramp or being able to pay those high-impact, high-power cost cards. It's really flexible.”</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>A Promise Of Support</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Already Riot has shown that it's willing to communicate with players and support Riftbound in meaningful ways. From putting out a statement about supply issues and promises to fix them, a second set announcement, prize-pool support, a promise of future formats such as draft, and encouraging people to go out to their local game store to play, it is clear Riot is aiming to make an impact in the TCG scene. It's not unusual for game companies to simply refuse to put out statements or neglect proper communication with its playerbase, making it all the more refreshing to see Riot make strides where other TCGs have failed.</p><p dir="ltr">“TCGs live and die by their local play environments. We have our first regional qualifier in the United States. We've had huge tournaments in China. Tournaments are great and they are a part of our competitive ecosystem. Coming out of COVID, it is such a wonderful thing just to get together with your friends and play a card game. It's one of those simple pleasures that cannot be replaced," Davidson said. "I have gotten back together with friends to play Riftbound that I hadn't seen in like a year and a half and now we have something to connect over again in a physical space. There is something special that a physical face-to-face game can provide. That's one of the things that made Riot so interested in Riftbound. It's an opportunity for us to create what we intend to be the best possible face-to-face, competitive, social, collaborative gaming environment that we can.”</p><p dir="ltr">After spending some quality game time with Riftbound, I can’t help but agree with him. The future of the game looks bright.</p>

            <p>Oh, the weather outside is frightful, but the gunfire on my PS5 is delightful (or something to that effect). Yes, Sony has lifted the lid on its PS Plus monthly game offerings for December. And, in the spirit of the season, it is giving us five games rather than the usual three. </p>
<p>As we march confidently towards the new year, those with a PlayStation Plus membership - be it Essential, Extra or Premium - will be able to enjoy the following games this coming month:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lego Horizon Adventures (PS5)</li>
<li>Killing Floor 3 (PS5)</li>
<li>The Outlast Trials (PS4/5)</li>
<li>Synduality Echo of Ada (PS5)</li>
<li>Neon White (PS4/5)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> is the brickified and much more family friendly reimagining of Aloy's first outing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>. "It's a decidedly joyless kind of game, the sort that's better to look at than actually play with, and one that does little to bridge the gap between its two main subjects," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">Eurogamer's Lego Horizon Adventures review</a>.</p><p>Then we have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neon-white">Neon White</a>, the stylish Annapurna-published anime speedrunner. "With airtight controls, smooth speedrunning and a big helping of anime-inspired flair, few games can keep up with Neon White's pace," Oisin Kuhnke wrote, recommending the game in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neon-white-review-speedrunning-has-never-been-so-stylish">Eurogamer's Neon White review</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps not a very festive offering, but one that a few of my friends still play on occasion, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outlast-trials">The Outlast Trials</a>. "The Outlast Trials is excessive and frantically enjoyable - but can occasionally tip over into frustration more than fear," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-review-a-unique-obscene-spin-on-the-horror-staple">Vikki Blake said when she reviewed The Outlast Trails</a> on its release in early access, awarding it three out of five stars.</p>
<p>Lego Horizon Adventures, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killing-floor">Killing Floor</a> 3, The Outlast Trials, Synduality Echo of Ada and Neon White will be available to PlayStation Plus members from next Tuesday, 2nd December. They will be on the service until Monday, 5th January.</p>
