		<p>Following<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/27/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remastered-leaked-by-merch/"> leaks</a> of some sort of release for Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver I &amp; II we now have official confirmation that Raziel is back… on the Evercade handheld console. Hands up who has one of those?</p>
<p><iframe title="Evercade - Legacy of Kain Collection - Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zlSBRNk2fVY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As you can see they seem to be ports of the original titles, not remasters, and it’s also Soul Reaver and Blood Omen, not Soul Reaver I and II – more on that later.</p>
<p>Fans have been clamouring for something from the Soul Reaver franchise for many years but there really has not been any hint of anything until now. However, Embracer did say that they saw “great potential, not only in sequels, but also in remakes, remasters, spinoffs, as well as transmedia projects” when they spent vast amounts of cash buying up loads of IPs. As they don’t have any cash left now it seems they just want to make a quick buck shoving the original games on a new platform.</p>
<p>The two games are sequels to The Legacy of Kain, both featuring the vampire wraith Raziel in a quest to kill Kain, the star of the first game.&nbsp; Both titles picked up excellent reviews when they were released between 1991 and 2001, not surprising when they were directed by Uncharted’s Amy Hennig. However they do look very dated now, but hey, if retro arcade action is your thing then go grab and Evercade.</p>

<p>The Evercade console launched in Winter 2022 with a 4.3″ IPS screen, USB-C charging port, a 1.5Ghz processor and 4GB of built in RAM, so you probably wil have some RAM to spare when playing Legacy of Kain.</p>
<p>A new version of the console launches at the end of this month, the Evercade VS-R, and you can<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Evercade-VS-R-Console-Tomb-Raider/dp/B0D1VYPWLH/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2TZ52VU5R0PUW&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.3ZxKPe-Y-GV6g4h27z8Ehhz0OgpcpjeSvASDzyaJLNxfpIkF9HiHJ9RUg5tdtKpS90Pu7y8Cel2NMXhTFy_nV9fFUco64u6s6vfqHL3JNjxcjHVWUJtypq_OEXg1rs589E79e60JxaqfXbfqZJoWWMEZjPO4yZXGvsbbSmj_GK4ukftH_B0S9cFG1SlGslKPBjHCiiT8Pd0FkklkALbM0HkYHPP-CjsKY_z7iUrie9s.LnzgpGc1zBH5lXNbabRjj5RNd7lkaxEGuhKzxarLXBA&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=evercade&amp;qid=1723747516&amp;sprefix=evercade%2Caps%2C90&amp;sr=8-2"> grab it from Amazon along with Tomb Raider for £100.&nbsp;</a> There are currently around 50 titles available for the console.</p>
<p>So, not quite the Remaster everyone was hoping for but the leaks clearly state Legacy of Kain: <em>Soul Reaver I &amp; II Remastered</em>. So maybe they are also on the way?</p>

<p>As a reminder, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is powered by the Frostbite engine. BioWare will shine a spotlight on the PC platform next week, likely to announce a partnership with NVIDIA, Intel, or AMD. Here's an updated overview of the game shared today by the developers:</p>
<p><em>Enter the world of Thedas, a vibrant land of harsh wilderness, treacherous mazes, and glittering cities - steeped in conflict and secret magic. Now, a pair of corrupt ancient gods have emerged from centuries of darkness and are hell-bent on destroying the world. </em><em>Nations are at war, and factions are splintering. Who will you trust? From the Arlathan Forest to the back alleys of Minrathous, this is a broken world. Your actions will forever shape the fate of Thedas.</em></p>
<p><em>Unite a team of seven companions, each with rich lives and deep backstories. These are characters to befriend and even fall in love with. They include an assassin, a necromancer, and a detective, each bringing their own expertise and unique abilities to the fight. You are never alone as you decide who to take into battle and face off against demons, dragons, and corrupt gods.</em></p>
<p><em>Choose from different races and combat classes, customize your appearance, choose your character's backstory, and begin your journey as Rook, the newest hero of Dragon Age. The choice is yours. Throughout your adventures, you'll gain new skills and discover unique, powerful artifacts to enhance your own fighting style. Prepare for tough decisions to be made, allies to be inspired, and a battle that will require every sword, staff, and bow you can muster.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is out on October 31.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/startup-exists-announces-new-genai-gaming-platform/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/startup-exists-announces-new-genai-gaming-platform.954378/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/startup-exists-announces-new-genai-gaming-platform/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>An artificial intelligence startup, Exists, has unveiled a new generative AI-powered text-to-game platform that will allow anyone to <a href="https://exists.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create high-quality games in minutes</a>. The platform doesn't require coding skills; it only needs text prompts from the person using it.</p>
<p>This new, fully automated process will run from Exists' cloud-based creation platform. The platform already has proprietary Generative AI models, allowing users to create environments and characters and play mechanics using the intuitive cloud-based ecosystem.</p>
<p>For those who are concerned that the platform may be difficult to use, Exists has made it as user-friendly as possible to break through the traditional barriers of making a game and allowing people to make a game just by typing in a concept, no matter how vague or detailed they want to be with it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Exists - Games from Text, Just Like That" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pou46iBNZHw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Exists has a novel neural network architecture that integrates Generative AI with advanced gaming engine capabilities to power all of this. This neural network allows them to combine the creative potential of AI with the strengths and performance of modern gaming engines to create complex games with visually stunning graphics. This takes minimal effort and is user-friendly for those who want to take the GenAI gaming platform for a test drive.</p>
<p>At the moment, Exists is in the Beta testing phase and is inviting users to sign up for early access to experience what Exists has to offer. Additionally, those attending Gamescom can see the brand-new technology and its offerings. Attendees will be able to see live demonstrations of the generative AI and have the opportunity to have a hands-on experience to test the platform's features.</p>
<p>"Our goal is to enable a paradigm shift in the gaming world that Generative AI has brought to text, image, video, and audio creation," says Dr Yotam Hechtlinger, the founder and CEO of Exists. "Providing the public with a powerful technology to create unique and personalized games sees us democratizing game creation and revolutionizing the gaming industry."</p>
<p>The use of AI in creative industries is highly controversial, with SAG-AFTRA frequently trying to get companies to stop using AI in their works. At the moment, SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://wccftech.com/electronic-arts-seo-in-talks-with-sag-aftra-to-reach-deal/">is on strike in the gaming industry</a> and is attempting to get game companies to rethink their use of AI and use voice actors to train their AI models.</p>
<p>In addition, the games industry is incredibly volatile, with companies being closed worldwide, even if they make highly successful games. There have also been many layoffs, from the most senior to the junior roles.</p>
<p>What impact software like Exists will have on the gaming industry remains to be seen.</p>

It’s also one of the studio’s most accessible games and—in keeping with that sentiment—the first one that I ever finished. It’s a game I’ve shared with loved ones, and the guy who helped me beat it the first time around is now my roommate all these years later. I love that I share <em>Bloodborne</em> with so many people in my life, and now I’m sharing it with you all because it’s on sale.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196742" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>PlayStation has extended its summer sale into the entirety of the month of August, and as part of the deals on offer, <em>Bloodborne Complete Edition </em>is just $17.49. </strong>Considering the base game (which lacks the critically lauded <em>Old Hunters </em>expansion) is just a few dollars more than that, you’re getting more out of this cheaper bundle than you would just picking <em>Bloodborne </em>up on a whim.</p><p>You might know <em>Bloodborne </em>because people on the internet have been constantly clamoring for a remake, remaster, or a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-pc-port-ps5-fromsoftware-elden-ring-miyazaki-1851539098&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-pc-port-ps5-fromsoftware-elden-ring-miyazaki-1851539098">port to PC</a></span> for years. This might give the wrong impression of the game, which is totally playable and doesn’t explicitly need to be remade or remastered, though a PC port would be nice. The PS4 version that can be played via backwards compatibility is a perfect version of a perfect game, and you should get to know that firsthand rather than through the stories about it.<br></p><p><em>Bloodborne </em>marked FromSoft’s first non-<em>Souls </em>soulsike and bears the lessons that the studio learned from their tenure developing the <em>Dark Souls </em>trilogy. Whereas the former series always approached combat as this trepidatious back-and-forth, <em>Bloodborne </em>encouraged aggression. The serrated Saw Cleaver—the now iconic weapon that sits on the game’s cover art— was the perfect tool for drawing the tainted blood of the diseased population of Yharnam, man and beast alike. And god, does <em>Bloodborne </em>feature some of FromSoft’s best and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-fromsoftware-horror-amygdala-lore-remake-ps4-1849630972&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-fromsoftware-horror-amygdala-lore-remake-ps4-1849630972">most memorable beasts</a></span>, like Mergo’s Wet Nurse and Rom The Vacuous Spider, as well as the <em>Old Hunters</em>’ Ludwig and Orphan of Kos. I’d go toe-to-toe with these bosses any day of the week, and it’d still be a thrill.<br></p><p>Due to its emphasis on action, which bled into mechanics such as health recovery, <em>Bloodborne </em>was an immediately gratifying experience. When I first played it as a high schooler, it was exactly the speed of game I wanted, paired with the difficulty and atmosphere of the <em>Souls </em>games that I just couldn’t penetrate at the time. It was gorgeous and haunting, and playing it felt like being seized by the very same fever that ripped through Yharnam. I tore that game a new one, and have repeatedly done so every few years for a while now. You all don’t know me, but I don’t replay games that often. I don’t know man, <em>Bloodborne</em> just clicked in a way that very little ever has.<br></p><p>I didn’t just conquer the nightmares of <em>Bloodborne </em>(of which there are many), I unlocked some piece of myself and my interests playing this game. I think I discovered that I love art that confuses me and asks questions more than it provides answers. I like things that enjoy a certain degree of inscrutability. I love things that are kind of uncomfortable and transgressive. Yes, you slay cosmic horrors left and right, but I also got to cleave my way through the patriarchal institutions that enabled Yharnam’s descent into madness, and that’s a rather liberating feeling at times. Some few games muse on these things, but even fewer let you literally take them to task.<br></p><p>I think <em>Bloodborne </em>is masterful at communicating these tenets in a packaging that could meet me halfway, and because of it I’ve been able to more fully appreciate a catalog of games that have become like treasured belongings to me. It’s the perfect entry point into FromSoft’s oeuvre, and as far as I’m concerned, its crowning jewel <em>still</em>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We see what looks like some tentacle-sporting demons infesting the city of Minrathous, along with other powerful magic-using enemies we’ll learn more about in October. There’s also a scene of someone trapped in something that looks similar to the Darkspawn or Broodmother lair seen in <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>. We don’t see the source of this root-like binding in the trailer, however, so it could also be coming from a demon or a spell from a malicious mage.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fae09f216d1e4826f03051f9ad4b417e" data-recommend-id="image://fae09f216d1e4826f03051f9ad4b417e" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A dragon perches on the side of a tower." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A dragon perches on the side of a tower." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fae09f216d1e4826f03051f9ad4b417e" data-recommend-id="image://fae09f216d1e4826f03051f9ad4b417e" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A dragon perches on the side of a tower." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It looks like <em>The Veilguard </em>will be bringing back dragon fights.

Its neck is covered in roots, as if it had been buried or stuck in the ground for quite some time.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ece6a50d4cf7062cecda0800f3327481" data-recommend-id="image://ece6a50d4cf7062cecda0800f3327481" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A giant wolf leaps at a dragon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A giant wolf leaps at a dragon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ece6a50d4cf7062cecda0800f3327481" data-recommend-id="image://ece6a50d4cf7062cecda0800f3327481" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A giant wolf leaps at a dragon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of the last significant shots of the trailer includes a giant wolf clashing with a dragon. The wolf has several eyes on its face and resembles Solas’ tarot card shown in the party select screen in <em>Inquisition</em>, so this may be the fabled “dread wolf” that elven history has written him to be. What’s unclear at this moment is if Solas is actually transforming into the beast we see here or if he’s commanding it in some way.

The game has been a long time coming, with the last game, <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, launching in 2014. Fans have been waiting nearly an entire decade to see what comes next for Thedas, and it looks like <em>The Veilguard </em>will be the culmination of several plotlines that have been expanding for over 15 years. <br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Games</a> and developer NetherRealms have released the gameplay trailer for <em><a title="Games > Mortal Kombat 1 [20 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a></em> expansion “Khaos Reigns” and “Kombat Pack 2” character Cyrax. <span id="more-906297"></span></p><p>“Khaos Reigns” is due out on September 24 includes new story chapters and “Kombat Pack 2.” A bundle containing “Khaos Reigns” and the existing “Kombat Pack 1” will also be available. “Kombat Pack 2” will not be available as a standalone character pack outside of the expansion.</p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>In Fire God Liu Kang’s New Era, Cyrax is a young Lin Kuei warrior from the Zaki clan whose prodigious skills earned her an invitation to serve directly under Sektor. She seized the opportunity with her trademark vigor, but while her skills impressed, her independent streak created rifts between her and her mentor. It has become clear that Cyrax remains untamed and will serve the Lin Kuei on her terms, or not at all. Cyrax’s high-octane moveset is on full display in the new trailer, including her ability to leverage cybernetic technology to perform impressive aerial attacks and evasive maneuvers, complemented by her utilization of energy nets to pin down opponents, explosives to extend combos, and sawblades for devastating strikes.</p><p>The new video also teases Cyrax’s Animality, the brutal finishing move allowing her to morph into a hornet to annihilate her defeated opponents. The fan favorite Animalities will be available as a free content update for all Mortal Kombat 1 owners in conjunction with the Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns release on September 24.</p></blockquote><p><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,661 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,834 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,781 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,896 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/mortal-kombat-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Activision says the fastest way to jump into the beta immediately is to download the Season 5 Reloaded update for Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone that arrives on August 21. You'll want to make sure this update is complete before August 30, as Activision says players with this update installed will automatically receive the beta files as an update to their existing game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Evercade - Legacy of Kain Collection - Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>This announcement came as a surprise, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/soul-reaver-remasters-seemingly-confirmed-by-a-statue-at-comic-con/1100-6525310/" data-ref-id="1100-6525310">rumors of a Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver I &amp; II Remastered</a> surfaced last month due to a statue spotted at Comic-Con. The series is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-is-making-a-comeback-but-its-not-what-you-think-it-is/1100-6524621/" data-ref-id="1100-6524621">getting a prequel graphic novel</a>.</p><p>However, the announcement of the Evercade collection doesn't necessarily mean that the series won't be coming to other platforms. Last year, developer Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-fans-are-convinced-the-next-game-in-the-series-is-being-secretly-tested-soon/1100-6513443/" data-ref-id="1100-6513443">conducted a closed</a> playtest, but didn't say for which game. Those who completed a Legacy of Kain survey around the same time received an email from the developer about playtests "for an unspecified new game."</p><p>The last game in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/legacy-of-kain-defiance-review/1900-6083425/" data-ref-id="1900-6083425">Legacy of Kain: Defiance</a>, came out in 2003. Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain and Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver were released in 1996 and 1999, respectively.</p>

Call of Duty HQ, the popular military shooter’s current one-size-fits-all launcher, requires players to download tons of stuff they don’t want to access a new campaign or multiplayer mode and then delete the rest later. The new approach will require a big download initially starting August 21 as Activision reorganizes the Call of Duty HQ content ahead of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-6-beta-weekend-dates-pre-order-game-pass-1851593252&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-6-beta-weekend-dates-pre-order-game-pass-1851593252"><em>Black Ops 6 </em>beta later this month</a></span> on August 30, but will eventually result in players being able to install exactly what they want without eating up half of their PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S’s storage. </p><p>The biggest change is that <em>Call of Duty Warzone</em>, the free-to-play battle royale mode, will exist as a completely separate download from <em>Modern Warfare III</em> and later when it launches, <em>Black Ops 6</em>. Activision didn’t breakdown exactly what the file sizes will be for the games at that point, or for the initial updates players need to install to re-optimize Call of Duty HQ, but it did share how big the standalone <em>Black Ops 6 </em>beta will be on every platform. The biggest is 80GB on PS5 and the smallest is to 66 GB on Steam.</p><p>Players have long complained about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernWarfareII/comments/17qt3ph/the_call_of_duty_hq_is_possibly_the_worst_thing/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernWarfareII/comments/17qt3ph/the_call_of_duty_hq_is_possibly_the_worst_thing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how chaotic and ugly the Call of Duty HQ experience is</a></span>, and what a pain it’s been trying to make room for ever-bigger sequels on their hard drives, especially when big new updates rivaling the size of most average games are added on top of the existing space requirements. This peaked in absurdity earlier this year when the <em>Black Ops 6 </em>Microsoft store page revealed a total size of 309.85 GB for the upcoming game. Activision <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-website-says-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-weighs-in-at-an-eye-watering-30985-gb-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-website-says-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-weighs-in-at-an-eye-watering-30985-gb-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quickly clarified</a></span> that the number in question included <em>MWII</em>, <em>MWIII</em>, <em>Blops 6</em>, and <em>Warzone</em>. Thank god that come October 25 players won’t have to fiddle with any of that nonsense anymore. I’m sure it will be an incredibly smooth handoff with no further wrinkles or issues. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Firearms Expert Reacts to Hunt Showdown PART 3</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">It's a big moment for Hunt: Showdown. The 1896 update overhauls the 2018 shooter's visuals, with an upgrade to the latest version of the CryEngine and all the improved lighting and audio updates that come with it. The changes are so dramatic that Crytek is ending support of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game. Owners of the last-gen console versions, however, will be upgraded for free to the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions. It also adds the game's first new map in years (set in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, which is the first map set outside the swamps of Louisiana), and introduces new enemies, weapons, weapon variants, and cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">Controversially, it also overhauls the game's UI, which is earning Hunt: Showdown 1896 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594650/Hunt_Showdown_1896/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Mixed" recent reviews on Steam</a> despite the game's overall "Very Positive" rating. Most of the game's recent negative reviews remark on the UI change, with one negative review stating the new update "brought with it a UI that was designed for console players" and "barely functions," while another calls the new main menu and UI "disgusting."</p><p dir="ltr">There are gameplay changes too, with major adjustments to various Hunter traits like the widely used Necromancer trait, changes to make it so Hunters burn out faster when downed and on fire, reduced duration for Choke bombs, improved Trap placement, and reworked bullet physics, including bullet drop. Headshots will now always be an instant kill as well. The game's challenge system has also been overhauled, with all players now having the same weekly challenges, all the objectives of which are displayed on the in-game map.</p><p dir="ltr">For those interested in seeing what Hunt: Showdown 1896 is all about, the game is running a free weekend on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594650/Hunt_Showdown_1896/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> that ends on August 19, with an Xbox free weekend lasting until August 18. Hunt: Showdown 1896 is also discounted on all platforms by 20% until August 22, available for $24 instead of its usual $30.</p>

We had only the best intentions, but the whole episode has turned into one huge drama.</p><p>First, yes,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I know <em>Roblox </em>is not the ideal platform for kids his age (or any age) to be playing on</a>. I'm as aware of its shortcomings as anyone. But <em>Roblox </em>is the default communications platform for 11-year-old kids where we live. It's the place everyone hangs out in after school, talks shit and checks out each other's stuff, so with some safeguards in place--he's on a monthly stipend of Robux<em> </em>and we monitor which games he's playing--he's allowed to play.</p><p>The problem here wasn't with the games, but the platform and company itself. We bought him a physical card because it felt like more of a gift, something we could hand him and say "here you go, buddy" and have it mean more than just dumping some Robux into his account. We gave it to him on a Friday afternoon, and he <em>loved </em>it: he was ecstatic after a pretty shitty week at school and all seemed well!</p><p>We watched him pop the card off its cardboard backing excitedly, peel back the sticker protecting its code, punch the code in and...ah, fuck. Instead of adding $50 (or however much that is in Robux) to his account, we were greeted by some red text and the words INVALID CODE. After a quick google it seems this is pretty common, and mostly happens when you enter the wrong parts of the code in (like using "B" when you were supposed to use "8"). But after some substitutions on the most suspect characters, we were still getting INVALID CODE.</p><p>Another popular cause for this code (according to forums and Reddit at least) appeared to be when the retailer you bought it from didn't activate it properly at the register, so we jumped in the car and drove back to the department store where we bought the card in the first place. There we were told by customer service that it <em>had </em>been activated, and that if we were having any problems to please contact <em>Roblox </em>support.</p><p>I'd been trying to avoid that, given the track record of megacorps like this when it comes to customer service, but with little other option we emailed in--there was no phone number in Australia, of course--provided the details of what we'd run into and waited for a response. Eventually a <em>Roblox </em>representative named "Freddy" got back to us and asked for some photos of the card and receipt and my son's username. It felt like we were only hours away from a resolution.</p><p>We were, just not the one we were after. "Freddy" told us that the code had already been redeemed to a different account, that was that, and to have a nice day. Freddy, we were not having a nice day. <em>We </em>had not redeemed the code, that was...why we were contacting you in the first place. My son, now distraught, kept saying "but why can't I just get my $50", and while my wife and I knew the world was more complicated than that, his basic point was correct: why couldn't he just get his $50? Despite several follow-up questions, Freddy went silent, and we received no further response from <em>Roblox</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="ELYSIUM Clip - &quot;Would You Like to Talk to a Human?&quot; (2013)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/klqn7oF41dc?start=245&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Our son had done everything right. We had done everything right. We'd been right there as he opened the card and typed it in, so knew that he hadn't redeemed it to the wrong account. We'd bought the card legally, paid legal tender for it and gone to all the right places for support. And still, we were shit out of luck, through absolutely no fault of our own. We'd been wronged and, like so many other places on the internet, there was no recourse. We were left feeling powerless as customers in a way that feels decidedly and depressingly modern.</p><p>This is what happened to us, at this particular point in time and this specific scenario, but we all know what it's like. Whether it's a cancelled flight, a shopping return, insurance dilemma or an issue on Facebook, in more and more aspects of our daily lives we're running into problems that you simply cannot solve because there is not a human being there to listen to you, and emails, bots and FAQs are not up to the task. Companies that make billions in profits, with operations around the world, are selling us goods and services and failing to provide even the most basic level of customer service, and I fucking hate it.</p><p><em>Roblox</em> made over $2 <em>billion </em>last year, I'm sure they could afford an Australian call centre or two <a href="https://x.com/BBW_BFF/status/786211687686770689" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so I could explain my passions in person</a>. Instead I get some <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/15062331967764-AUSTRALIAN-TERMS-AND-CONDITIONS-FOR-ROBLOX-GIFT-CARDS-AND-CREDITS#:~:text=The%20value%20of%20any%20lost,access%20of%20your%20Roblox%20account." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Australia-specific rules that essentially tried to wash <em>Roblox's </em>hands of it</a> and I got "Freddy", who for all "his" inflexibility and canned responses could have been an AI for all I know.</p><p>Thankfully, this story has a happy ending. After days of silence and a number of unanswered emails to <em>Roblox</em>, I reached out to the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission, our federal government's consumer watchdog. I explained to them my situation and told them I thought <em>Roblox </em>had a duty to make good on my purchase, especially since they'd been unable or unwilling to answer my follow-up questions.</p><p>A few days later--such timing!--we got an email from a different <em>Roblox </em>rep, "Debby", who broke the company's silence to tell us that "as a one time courtesy" they were going to credit my son's account with $50. You know, a <em>courtesy</em>, to just give him the thing we paid for then went to all this hassle over. </p><p>In all, this process took over two weeks. Two weeks! I could have spoken to a human and sorted this out in minutes, but no, because <em>Roblox </em>either want to save money on call centres, eliminate human conversation in their customer service entirely in order to make ripping kids off easier or both, I had to email, drive back to a department store then involve the <em>government </em>to try and get my $50 back.</p><p>And the lesson I learned at the end of it? However terrible you think <em>Roblox </em>is, whether it's because of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/roblox-online-games-irl-fascism-roman-empire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fascists</a> or the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/roblox-child-gambling-lawsuit-1234808313/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">child gambling</a> or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMF6xEiAaY&amp;vl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">labour exploitation</a>, there are always fresh and new ways to discover it sucks!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s been 10 years since the previous game, so fans have been waiting awhile for this installment. Like the previous games, it’s set in the fantasy world of Thedas, where you’ll create a character and lead a team of heroes against evil forces.</p><p>The Veilguard is noticeably more colorful than previous entries, which leaned toward the brown and gray end of the spectrum. Characters have a stylized, almost cartoonish, look to them — a change that’s been somewhat controversial among the fan base. However, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/veilguard-the-first-dragon-age-game-where-the-combats-actually-fun-former-exec-producer-says">combat has gotten an overhaul</a>, to the extent that the developers say it’s “actually fun” now. You control a party of three (instead of four, like in previous games), and the combat is much more action-oriented.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - Preview Gallery</h3></div></output></p><p>In case you’re worried about a lack of story, you can allay your fears: the script for Dragon Age: The Veilguard has roughly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-a-massive-140000-lines-of-dialogue">140,000 lines of dialogue</a>. That’s quite a bit more than Dragon Age Inquisition’s already-considerable 88,000 lines — though not as many as Baldur’s Gate 3 or Starfield.</p><p>There will be plenty of customization options, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-reveals-a-host-of-customizable-difficulty-options-including-the-ability-to-turn-death-off-entirely">various difficulty settings</a>, as well as the ability to turn off death entirely. Veilguard will also let you romance any of the party members, and it features <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-wants-dragon-age-the-veilguard-players-to-find-out-for-themselves-whether-it-has-full-nudity">full nudity</a>, if that’s of interest. Of note for Steam players, you <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-steam-native-so-you-dont-need-the-ea-app-to-play-the-game-on-pc">won’t need the EA app</a> as a launcher to play the game, which is always nice.

It was first announced way, <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dragon-age-4-the-dread-wolf-rises-teaser-breakdown">way back in 2018</a>, and later that year was given the title <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dragon-age-dreadwolf-title-and-logo-officially-revealed-ign-news">Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a>. In 2022, we learned that an alpha build of the game was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-just-hit-an-important-stage-of-development">playable from start to finish</a>, and earlier this year <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-revealed-alongside-familiar-faces-xbox-showcase-2024">we finally saw the first official trailer</a> with a fall 2024 release window.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard Release Date Trailer Stills</h3></div></output><p>At the time, it was revealed that the name of the game was being <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay">changed to Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> to place more emphasis on the party of protagonists, rather than returning Dragon Age character Solas, known as the Dreadwolf.</p><p>We've since learned plenty of tidbits about what to expect. The Veilguard apparently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-a-massive-140000-lines-of-dialogue">has 140,000 lines of dialogue</a>, will be <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-steam-native-so-you-dont-need-the-ea-app-to-play-the-game-on-pc">Steam-native on the storefront</a>, has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-reveals-a-host-of-customizable-difficulty-options-including-the-ability-to-turn-death-off-entirely">customizable difficulty options</a>, and will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-will-allow-you-to-import-your-choices-from-previous-games-through-the-character-creator">import choices made in previous games</a>. We've also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-voice-cast-revealed-including-erika-ishii-and-more">gotten a look at the game's voice cast</a>, and we've learned that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-confirmed-to-let-you-romance-any-companion-you-want-will-include-nudity-it-gets-pretty-spicy">all possible companions will be pansexual</a>.</p><p>Along with the release date, you can now <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-age-the-veilguard">preorder Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> ahead of October.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Zombies Terminus Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">With this new update in effect, players will only be downloading the annual Call of Duty titles they purchase, and Warzone will be a separate download that they can choose to "opt-in" and download at that time. Alternatively, they can separately download it at any time.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision says, "Flexibility and choice matter. We want to give players the choice to download each Call of Duty, including Call of Duty: Warzone, when and how they wish."</p><p dir="ltr">The smaller file sizes also come from Call of Duty expanding its usage of texture streaming. The publisher explains by saying, "With these capabilities, we can cycle content that is less frequently used by players to a streaming cache, avoiding the need to download it directly to your device's storage. Going forward, more content will be included in this cache."</p><p>Activision warns that players will see a large file size for the initial update needed to make these changes, but this download will not permanently add the stated file size that Call of Duty takes up on each device. The update will instead reorganize game files and add the new tech to prepare for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-replacing-its-awful-ui-before-black-ops-6/1100-6525826/" data-ref-id="1100-6525826">Call of Duty's new user interface</a> arriving in October.</p><p dir="ltr">Players on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X and PC will acquire the entire update via a single download, similar to other updates that are needed before booting up Call of Duty.</p><p dir="ltr">PlayStation 5 players have a slightly different process. PlayStation 5 users will acquire this update via four separate downloads. The initial download will be similar to other updates that are needed before booting up Call of Duty, but a second update will be triggered within the Call of Duty app after first accessing MW3 or Warzone. After the second update is completed, there will be another download when specifically re-accessing MW3 and a final download when re-accessing Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision explains this more complicated process by saying, "The PS5 requires split downloads due to differences in file organization. The initial download may be larger in size for players who also have MW2 content installed."</p><p dir="ltr">As a thank you to the community for completing this download, the publisher is gifting players with a pack of Battle Pass Tier Skips and double XP tokens. From the start of Season 5 Reloaded until the end of Season 5, players who complete the download and login will receive:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">10 - 1-Hour Double Player XP Tokens (10 Hours Total)</li><li dir="ltr">10 - 1-Hour Double Weapon XP Tokens (10 Hours Total)</li><li dir="ltr">10- Battle Pass Token Tier Skips</li></ul><p dir="ltr">These tier skips and tokens will be delivered when the player first logs into Call of Duty after completing the Season 5 Reloaded update.</p><p>Black Ops 6 was previously mentioned to be a 300GB download, but Activision confirmed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-isnt-300gb/1100-6524154/">the game's file size isn't actually that large</a>, which will be thanks to the upcoming update. However, the game size can become quite large if a player chooses to have Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 3, Warzone, all relevant content packs also installed.</p><p>Players can get hands-on with Black Ops 6 during the beta later this month, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/">here's how to get the early access</a>. Black Ops 6 releases on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. Live gameplay for Black Ops 6 multiplayer will be revealed during the Call of Duty: Next event on August 28.</p>

            <p>
Lonely Mountains: Downhill, the brilliantly serene/controller-snappingly infuriating mountain biking game from developer Megagon Industries, is trading its wheels for a pair of skis later this year, with the arrival of newly announced follow-up, Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders.
</p>
<p>
Much like its predecessor, Snow Riders is all about getting from up to down as elegantly and/or speedily as possible. This time, though, its gorgeous mountain vistas are blanketed in thick snow and ice, lending a different dimension to proceedings as players attempt to perform tricks, discover shortcuts, and beat their best times with a pair of skis strapped to their feet.
</p>
<p>
Once again, there'll be challenges to complete and new equipment, outfits, and tricks to unlock during play, but Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders also introduces online competitive and co-operative multiplayer across a variety of modes.

<p>
Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders doesn't have a release date yet, but there won't be too long to wait - it's currently scheduled to release for PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545360/Lonely_Mountains_Snow_Riders/">via Steam</a> before the end of this year. And if it's anything like its predecessor, there's ample reason to be excited.
</p>
<p>
"It's a magic game, conjuring a sense of life from what looks like trees of folded paper, rocks made real from crinkled blankets," Christian Donlan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-the-year-2019-lonely-mountains-downhill-is-a-magic-game-of-pure-sensation">wrote</a> of Lonely Mountains: Downhill back in 2019. "At times I've felt more connected to the world of this game than my own. It does that through feeling, and feeling in the simplest and purest sense. Take a corner."
