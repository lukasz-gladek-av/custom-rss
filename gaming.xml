<p>Here at Nintendo Life, we had a perfectly pleasant time with TPC's latest. Our very own Ace Trainer Alana awarded it a 7/10 in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>, calling the new real-time combat mechanics "the best Pokémon battles have ever felt", but struggling with the whole set up of Lumiose City. Here's a snippet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A should be celebrated for its fabulous real-time combat and its largely smooth jump to the Switch 2, but in condensing things down to one single location, it loses part of the Pokémon magic that Arceus and many other entries managed to amplify.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="vf32irwF2Do" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f76a2qvgkyi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>And yet, we are not the only outlet which has been getting reacquainted with Kalos; oh no! Reviews are rolling in across the board and there's actually a pretty wide range of opinions.</p>
<p>We've assembled the following round up to give you an idea of the critical consensus, picking out all the different view points so you can get a snapshot image of the overall reception. We should also point out that <em>all of the following are for the Switch 2 version only</em>.</p>
<p>We'll kick things off right at the top of the spectrum, with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/">VGC</a>'s 5/5 review billing Legends: Z-A "the best Pokémon game in many years":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In many areas, it feels like a massive departure for the series, with its new battle system and Z-A Royale structure, in particular, paying off, and once again proving that the Legends series is home to the most interesting ideas <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/companies/game-freak/" title="Companies > Game Freak [345 articles]">Game Freak</a> has.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo-switch/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">TechRadar Gaming</a> went ever so slightly lower in its 4.5/5 review, praising the how the game reinvigorates the classic formula, and packs in a cracking story and soundtrack to boot:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It finds a way to simultaneously mix things up while gripping perfectly to a few core Pokémon pillars such that the end result can feel very different yet very recognisable all at once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Opting for a 4/5, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/">GamesRadar</a> vibed with the worldbuilding and battle system, but felt the scope of Lumiose City was perhaps a little too small:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pokemon Legends: Z-A may not be the perfect open world adventure, but its slice of life vibes and brilliant battle system changes are a real delight, and I hope this isn't the last we see of its innovations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.pockettactics.com/pokemon-legends-z-a/review">Pocket Tactics</a> went for a similar 8/10, saying that the focus on battles, solid performance and overall bravery of the damn thing is enough to outweigh its shortcomings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This game might be the bravest and boldest effort from Game Freak in as long as I can remember, and the developer is successful in a lot of ways</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a 7/10 for <a href="https://www.gfinityesports.com/article/pokemon-legends-z-a-our-review">GFinity</a>, where the outlet found Lumiose City's "claustrophobic" design to be a real tripping point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Revisiting an area in modern times in Legends felt like a good idea when I first started the game, but upon reflection, traveling back to the more ancient time in Arceus felt like a much fresher experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">Eurogamer</a> awarded Legends: Z-A a 3/5, describing it as "proof of concept" for a much bigger, better game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What we have is a kind of proof of concept. But the concept is <em>so good</em> that you can't help but feel a little frustrated to be teased with it.</p>
</blockquote>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A is already playable on PC and Android devices via emulators like EDEN.</p>



<p>As showcased in a new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tabeneru">tabeneru</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases">EDEN emulator</a> can run the new entry in the popular series launching this week worldwide on PC and even Android devices rather well with the appropriate settings. </p>



<p>On PC, users don't even need a high-end system to run the game at the native 30FPS cap, as the user's system, powered by an Intel Core i5-13500 CPU and RTX 3060 Ti GPU, which is far from being the fastest system configuration, has no trouble running the game smoothly, at least in the shown segment. However, a high-end system is required to push the emulated Switch release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A past its resolution and framerate cap on PC with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44SLbqzH04M&amp;t=2s">the first mod that allows up to 4K at 60 FPS gameplay</a> shared by Youtube user FRANC225. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although Pokémon Legends: Z-A has yet to officially release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-leak-online-early-builds-pokedex-more/">early copies of the game already reached the hands of players</a>, so it's not surprising to see the game already emulated on PC. However, this ability to emulate new titles may soon change. As development shifts to the Nintendo Switch 2 exclusively, it is widely expected that it will take a long time before an effective emulator for the new console becomes available on PC.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hps-2025-intel-n150-laptop-bundle-is-back-in-stock-at-almost-80-off-and-its-not-refurbished-2000634011</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this week, Amazon was celebrated Prime Big Deals Days which had extended from October 7 to October 8. It was a great two-day stretch of time to find yourself some excellent savings on just about anything from kitchen appliances to apparel to tech. Had you been hoping to score a new laptop for yourself, but somehow missed the sales event, all is not lost just yet. You can still find some fantastic laptop deals across the website. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4760/">Like right now, this HP Intel laptop designed for students and businesses dropped its price by a staggering 76%. Amazon has the full price listed at $1,500, so after the discount, it comes down to just $365.</a> That’s a savings of $1,135.</p>
<p>Now before you get too excited, know that this discount — while good — isn’t enormous as it seems. Lots of Amazon sellers tend to jack up the list price of their offerings and then mark the product back down so that it can be labeled with a huge discount. The specs on offer here would really never justify a price of $1,500. The new $365 price tag is a much better reflection of what you’re getting. Still a great value though.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4760/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>With this 2025 HP laptop, we’re looking at an Intel N150 four-core, four-thread CPU alongside an integrated graphics card. You’ll have solid performance browsing the web and even doing some light photo or video editing. It’s working with 16GB of RAM and a storage capacity of 128GB.</p>
<p>The screen measures in at 14-inch, keeping it compact and portable to easily fit into any bag on your way to and from class. It displays in slightly above 720p at 1366 by 768 pixels. The HP True Vision 720p web camera and dual-array digital microphone allow you have crystal clear video calls, even in low light conditions.</p>



<h2>Bonus Gifts Included</h2>
<p>Included with the laptop is a set of added accessories to get you going. The HP 2025 laptop comes with a wireless mouse and CD/DVD drive which pretty much no laptop comes with on-board any more. You get a 256GB SD card which effectively triples your storage capacity. Then we also have Windows 11 Pro pre-installed as well as a one-year license to Microsoft 365 which will grant your access to Word, PowerPoint, Excel and all the other Microsoft Office apps. Plus that comes with OneDrive so you can save files to the cloud and access them from any device.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4760/">For a limited time, you can get the HP laptop with all these additional accessories for just $365.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-raichu-ranked-2000625708"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is just a few days away and already </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-leaks-switch-2-image-mega-evolution-2000630717"><span>leaking all over the internet</span></a><span>, but that’s not the only leak coming out of Game Freak right now. It’s been a full year since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688"><span>the massive Teraleak</span></a><span> revealed more information about upcoming </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games and anime, and now, the same leaker is releasing some new alleged details on even more future projects. This includes information about the 10th-generation games for the Switch 2, but also the next </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game, and a new MMO that might give some fans something they’ve been asking for for years.</span></p> <p><span>The leaks have begun circulating through </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>leak accounts, and include details and concepts for five upcoming games, and a loose timeline for the next five to six years of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> development. But keep in mind that even if these projects are at some stage of development at Game Freak, pipelines shift, ideas can be scaled back from their initial concepts, and some of these games could be internally canceled and never formally announced.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The biggest info dump is for what appear to be the Generation X games: </span><i><span>Pokémon Wind</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pokémon Wave</span></i><span>. Game Freak is apparently targeting a 2026 launch for these games, and they will be Switch 2 exclusives. The games will be set in a region inspired by Southeast Asia, which contradicts original reports that Gen X would be based in a Greece-like region.</span><i><span> Wind</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i><span> will lean hard into the open-world exploration of recent games like</span><i><span> Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, with procedurally generated islands for the player to traverse. There will also be underwater areas that you can dive into and explore further. Game Freak also appears to have DLC in the works that will launch in 2027.</span></p>

The more surprising leaks are those indicating upcoming spin-offs and a new </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game. The third </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game is codenamed Ringo and will be set in the Galar region from </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. This game will apparently return to the past like </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus</span></i><span> after </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s modern-day detour, and will be set 1000 years before the events of </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. Part of the game will focus on the player creating the first Gigantamax Poké Ball, which is used to capture the massive kaiju Pokémon in the Galar region. Game Freak’s pitch documents for the game liken it to </span><i><span>Xenoblade Chronicles X</span></i><span>, implying it may have real-time elements in its combat systems. This may also include boss battles against Gigantamax Pokémon, though the leaks only show concept images of those at this time.</span></p>

The game’s initial pitch documents claim it will be set in a region that connects Hoenn (</span><i><span>Ruby</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span>) and Sinnoh (</span><i><span>Diamond</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pearl</span></i><span>), and will allow you to travel between them alongside other players. Game Freak is targeting a 2028 launch for Switch 2.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/Xptp3QYETK">pic.twitter.com/Xptp3QYETK</a></p> <p>— (Not) Centro Leaks (@CentroLeaks_alt) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977788607818793207?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The leak also has notes about Generation XI, which is currently planned to launch sometime in 2030. While knowing what might be coming is fun, the leaks also give us some insight into things that aren’t in the pipeline, despite long-running fan theories. A </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>remake is apparently not in the works at the moment, with Game Freak noting it wants the eventual project to be a thorough remake.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">From Game Freak docs:</p> <p>“Remakes made for Black and White onwards should have a lot more love and care put into them. I hope that they become good games that will allow people to enjoy eras different from the Legends series.”</p> <p>Note that currently Game Freak has no Unova remake in… <a href="https://t.co/bGKyEYh7rf">pic.twitter.com/bGKyEYh7rf</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977923383623848195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>One of the more maddening scrapped ideas in the leaks is that Game Freak was, at some point, considering making a </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game set in the Johto region from </span><i><span>Gold </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Silver</span></i><span>, and would have released a pair of games rather than just one. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Ho-Oh</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Lugia</span></i><span> were going to be a historical RPG that would have explored the origins of the first Pokémon trainers. Like in</span><i><span> Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>, the player would have been transported to the past from modern times. Eventually, Game Freak shelved this in favor of the modern story in Kalos that became </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. I’d like to think the team could revisit this project down the line, but now that it’s been leaked like this, that feels unlikely.</span></p> <p><span>That’s a lot to digest all at once. The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>pipeline is a well-oiled machine of nearly annual releases at this point, so it’s not surprising that several projects could be in some stage of development all at once. A lot of these games sound very ambitious, so hopefully the extra year of development Game Freak got by skipping 2024 helps them reach that potential. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> is coming to Switch and Switch 2 on October 16, and was originally planned to launch last year, so we’ll see how much that extra development time paid off.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you can’t bear to wait a few more days, one final ARC Raiders Open Beta test awaits. It’s known as the ‘Server Slam Test,’ and it’s trying to ascertain server stability and functionality. Check out its dates and how you can take part in the final hurdle before launch.</p>



<p>There are no more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> delays on the cards. We know the devs thought the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-delay-explained-embark-game-not-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game was “Not Fun,”</a> hence earlier delays. We are now about as locked in as you’ll need to be once you set foot in Speranza and the surface for real this time. But just in case, Embark Studios has unleashed one final open beta test for ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>It’s a server stress test to find out how many players are likely to pop in on release day, and how the servers will handle the enormous amount of pressure likely heading the shooter’s way.</p>

<p><strong>The concluding ARC Raiders Open Beta will begin on October 17, and you’ve got until October 19 to see what the extraction shooter is all about heading into launch.</strong></p>



<p>It’s only a short one, but it’s both a final chance to see if ARC Raiders is for you (it’s basically a free demo), and this is your moment to let Embark Studios know if anything needs fixing, improving, or looking at before October 30. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It's not as far in the future as we thought.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-pokemon-game-pokemon-presents-2024">When Pokémon Legends: Z-A was first revealed,</a> we all immediately got to work speculating on when it would take place in the Pokémon timeline. Not where, we knew that: it takes place entirely in Lumiose City from Pokémon X and Y's Kalos region. But given that Legends: Arceus was a time-traveling narrative going back hundreds of years into Sinnoh's past, we had every expectation based on trailers that Z-A would be many, many years in Lumiose City's future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We were incorrect! We now know exactly when it takes place, and it's not nearly as big a leap as you'd think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've been playing Pokémon Legends: Z-A for review and the embargo has now lifted. So we can confirm, from first-hand experience talking to multiple characters (most of which we unfortunately can't directly cite or show due to the ongoing embargo restrictions), that Z-A takes place just five years after the events of X and Y. It's not a time traveling narrative, it's a direct sequel that offers a follow-up to many of the characters and situations introduced in X and Y.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, we already know that you get to hang out with AZ, a 3,000-year-old man who plays a pivotal role in X and Y. We also know that Mable, a former member of Team Flare, takes on the role of Pokémon professor in this game and sends you out to catch Pokémon with various challenges. Other characters you'll remember from X and Y show up as well, some of them dramatically changed, but we can't and won't spoil them just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends: Z-A being a direct sequel is actually a pretty big deal. The Pokémon universe has been real hand-wavey with how the different games and regions relate to one another over the years. While there have been some direct sequels before (Gold and Silver after Red and Blue, Black and White 2 after Black and White, etc), later games have introduced time travel (Legends: Arceus), alternative universes (Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire), and basically every game has implied that all the other games' locations and monsters exist in the same world, but events taking place in those games may or may not be canon depending on which one you're playing. The Pokémon timeline, if drawn out, probably looks far more ridiculous than the Zelda one at this point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if you were wondering what happened to most of the main cast of X and Y five years after the events of the game, here you go: this is just a straightforward sequel! In hindsight, we should have seen this coming when they named it "Z-A" after X and Y.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">review-in-progress of Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is now live, if you want to check out my impressions of the first 24 hours, with a full review coming next week. I've also been writing about how the Nurse Joy job is now open to people who don't look exactly identical to the original Nurse Joy after 27 years in Z-A.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Review codes for Pokémon Legends: Z-A were only sent out less than a week ago, but I’ve already put in around 24 hours or so in the last five days. Across that time I’ve been catching every new species of Pokémon I find, doing every side quest that pops up, and stopping every so often to completely change my outfit. I’ve currently got a full team all in the level 50s, and I can’t wait to stop writing this review-in-progress to go play more. It’s real good so far!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ah, feels nice to say that after, uh… <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-the-teal-mask-dlc-review"><u>this</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a few reasons why I don’t feel comfortable scoring Z-A right now. Apart from simply not having beaten it yet, the embargo we’re publishing this under is pretty strict about what we can and can’t say or show. We always try to avoid spoilers (and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-datamining-begins-fans-warn-that-the-pokmon-legends-z-a-spoiler-floodgates-have-now-opened"><u>recent leaks</u></a> mean plenty are already in the wild), but here we can’t even talk about basic plot details that happen literally in the first 10 minutes. We can’t mention loads of the specific Pokémon in Z-A, despite the fact that any number of them might casually roam across our footage at any time. We can’t even show you the map of Lumiose City, where everything in Z-A takes place. It’s difficult to say exactly how close to the credits 24 hours puts me, but I’ll likely be back with my final, scored review shortly after launch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also haven’t had the chance to test it on Nintendo Switch 1 ahead of time, although I am at least so happy to report that Pokémon Legends: Z-A runs great <em>on Nintendo Switch 2</em>. It glides along at a smooth framerate with very, very few hitches or hiccups. There is occasionally still some sudden pop-in of NPCs, including ones positioned very close to the player, and here and there I’ve seen a character do that creepy thing where their head and neck suddenly snap into place as I get closer. But critically, unlike <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review"><u>Scarlet and Violet</u></a>, none of this is horribly distracting, nor does it really detract from the overall experience. Because of Scarlet and Violet, I spent the first 20 minutes or so paying close attention to whether or not Z-A ran well. But then, after that, I barely thought about it again, a state of mind which I consider ideal. Here’s hoping that’s still the case with the Switch 1 version, which I will take into consideration as part of my final review either way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Running well doesn’t equate to a game being pretty, of course, and Z-A isn’t going to win any beauty contests. Lumiose City looks fine. Its buildings are covered with mostly flat images of the same couple of window and terrace patterns over and over again. Up close, the effect is pretty weird – like someone painted a Looney Tunes door on a wall so Roadrunner would crash into it. The samey buildings are broken up with occasional trees, battle courts, parks, and the same bench copy-pasted about 100 times. There’s a greyish sewer system with greyish water running through it, and rooftops occasionally interrupted by same-looking cafe set-ups. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The reduced scale of this world has worked in Game Freak’s favor.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, I do think that the reduced scale of the world has worked in Game Freak’s favor with Z-A when compared to, say, Arceus or Scarlet and Violet. The city is smaller, so it’s more densely packed with trainers, Pokémon, items, shops, and other actually interesting things to see and do. I’m not running for minutes on end through massive fields of flat, GameCube-style textures, with nary a point of interest in sight. As a result, similar to Z-A’s performance, it was easy to stop thinking about the low-quality building design fairly early on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s also helped by the fact that building interiors and the character and Pokémon models themselves look pretty good, and the human characters in particular are more varied than ever before. While almost every NPC you meet in the city is categorized by trainer type and given an appearance to match, Game Freak is now experimenting not just with diverse facial features and skin tones, but also clothing items. We saw some of this in Scarlet and Violet, but almost everyone was wearing school uniforms, so it wasn’t nearly as noticeable. Now, you might see two athletic trainers wearing differently colored versions of the same athletic gear, or two artists with different colored aprons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Small a touch as this sounds, combining that with facial differences does a lot to make Lumiose City feel inhabited by many different, diverse people instead of the same 10 trainer types repeated ad nauseum. That customizability extends to the protagonist, too. There are tons of hair, facial, and fashion choices to choose from, including new options to mix and match certain types of outfits (different undershirts with different jackets, for instance). It’s a massively refreshing improvement after spending most of Pokémon Violet expressing myself via the same four ugly purple uniforms and a variety of mismatched hats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another element that I think elevates Lumiose City far above the much larger overworld of Scarlet and Violet is that it’s dense with interesting landmarks, items, obstacle courses, stores, Wild Zones, shops, and people. Lumiose is round, with different streets running out from the center like wheel spokes, and the entirety of it is open to you within just a few hours of starting your journey. You can, if you want, scour the whole map very early on, though it won’t be especially interesting at first blush. But over time, you’ll gradually unlock new ways to get around and new things to see when you get there: a new travel method that lets you scale scaffolding to collect rare items at the top, new ways to get onto buildings and Assassin’s Creed your way to little nooks of the city you couldn’t quite reach before, and new Wild Areas teeming with new Pokémon to catch. That steady unlocking of a city you always had free reign of adds to the feeling of getting to know a new place you’ve just moved to.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Every Pokémon location in Lumiose City feels deliberate and well-considered.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploration is often rewarded, too. While I criticized Scarlet and Violet for just sort of slapping large quantities of Pokémon haphazardly over a big map, especially in later areas, every single spawn location in Lumiose City feels deliberate and well-considered. A line of trash bins might not have anything interesting to see when you pass by on one visit, but there could be a Trubbish on top the next. Flocks of Pidgey and Fletchling scatter as you dash into a courtyard. Spinarak regard you calmly while hanging from tree branches. If you really explore, you might encounter a rare dragon-type on a rooftop (the embargo forbids me from saying which one despite the fact that its evolutions have been confirmed for the game already); a Spritzee floating idly in a hidden cafe; once, I turned just in time to see an Eevee sprint past me into an alleyway, and I barely threw a PokeBall quickly enough to catch it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I won’t (and can’t) spoil too much of the story, but what I can talk about is the interesting rhythm it establishes that feels, in practice, quite different from any other Pokémon game so far. Like Arceus, Z-A foregoes the traditional “gather eight badges” structure, though here you’ll divide their time between day and night – during the day, you’ll be catching Pokémon in Wild Zones, battling rogue Mega Evolved Pokémon, performing goofy side quest errands for individuals around the city, shopping, and exploring. At night, you have the option to visit Battle Zones where you take on trainers and complete challenges to raise your score and eventually collect a Challenger’s Ticket, which unlocks your promotion match for the next level of the “Z-A Royale.” There are 26 ranks total, one for each letter of the alphabet. I am currently at rank D, though I wish this was slightly more fleshed out as a proper competitive mode rather than just a story vehicle – for instance, you don’t exactly spend a meaningful amount of time at every single one of the 26 letter ranks.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Pokemon Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll have more to say on this in the final review, free from my embargo shackles, but I am really enjoying the story so far. Ditching the eight badge trainer journey like Arceus before it allows Game Freak to flesh out a deeper, more interesting cast of characters, both the heroes and the villains. There’s simply more reason for them to be where you are, doing things alongside you and participating in the world-changing events you’re experiencing. I’m also fascinated by how much Z-A appears to be inspired by the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series. The enclosed city setting, the absurd and silly tone of the side quests, the story’s concerns with community and civic issues, and the protagonist bopping around a metro area solving problems by being absurdly stronger than everyone else all lend Lumiose City big Kamurocho energy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which leads me to the meat and potatoes of any Pokémon game: the battling. With Z-A, Pokémon has gone full action game. Not a turn-based battle in sight. While I don’t think I want Pokémon to fully depart from doing turn-based combat forever, this works pretty well as a detour. Game Freak did an admirable job translating its traditional battle system into one that works in an active-time environment, especially with moves seemingly so specific to the turn-based format. Protect and Detect now stop damage for a set period of time instead of one “turn.” Spikes dumps, well, spikes all over the floor in an area, forcing you to steer your Pokémon out of it. Long-range moves keep Pokémon out of harm’s way, but take longer to execute and recharge than more risky, short-range ones. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are a lot of new tactics and strategies to mess around with.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a lot of new tactics and strategies to mess around with, such as how movement and dodging works. You control your trainer directly, and can either hold ZL to open the move select menu to send your active Pokémon into the fray, or release it to have them follow you around, allowing you to guide them while dodging. This makes for an interesting combat flow as I strategize around calling my Pokémon back to me to dodge an attack, then positioning them ideally to set up their next move before the opponent can swing again. The system is a bit awkward at times, especially in enclosed areas, but I’m interested to see what a competitive meta looks like with this format.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These tactics grow even more critical and chaotic in boss battles with Rogue Mega Evolved Pokémon, of which Z-A has many. These battles all take place in uniform, wide, circular arenas, but the Pokémon themselves are far from ordinary. Rogue Mega Evolved Pokémon are essentially Z-A’s answer to Arceus’ Frenzied Noble Pokémon. In addition to their regular movesets, they each have additional unique abilities you’ll have to avoid, such as turning the arena into a bullet hell you have to dodge around, or suddenly appearing right in front of you for an attack. Like in Arceus, your trainer can get hit and even die (sorry, I mean “black out”) if they’re attacked too many times by an enemy Pokémon, and that becomes a legit concern as Rogue Megas will enrage partway through and try to attack you directly.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Rebekah's Favorite Pokemon Games</h3><p>All my favorite Pokemon games from over the years! In no particular order. (but Crystal IS number one)</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The best way to counter this is to Mega Evolve your own Pokémon or use “Plus” moves, which are superpowered versions of regular moves that also consume the energy you need to Mega Evolve. Unlike in Pokémon X and Y, where you could get away with fighting Mega Evolved Pokémon with regular monsters, you really do need to engage with the Mega mechanics in Z-A. Though it starts off pretty tame, Z-A quickly ramps up the difficulty – even doing every side quest, I’m still finding its boss battles will make me sweat a little.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Man, I was going to try and hold back a bit on this review-in-progress since I still have plenty to see before my final review, but I’m just so genuinely excited about what Game Freak has done here. I liked Arceus a fair amount and thought it showed promise, but have been broadly disappointed with the slow backslide I saw from the studio in its move to console game development, and worried the quality dip was a new trend for 3D Pokémon games that we’d never escape. Pokémon Legends: Z-A, at least across the first two-dozen hours, is putting a lot of my fears to rest. It’s not revolutionary by any stretch, but it’s really good! I’m having fun, I’m excited to keep playing, I feel rewarded for exploring every corner, the story’s got my attention, and I’m not distracted by my Pokémon falling through the floor while they battle or everything crashing when I try to climb a ladder. If the rest of my adventure holds up (and the Switch 1 performance isn’t a disaster), we could finally have a 3D game worthy of the Pokémon franchise on our hands. It’d be about dang time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review]]></content:encoded>

Kiuchi went on to describe manga and anime as “irreplaceable treasures” that Japan boasts to the world. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/gettyimages-2175283205-1760445251099.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Minoru Kiuchi described manga and anime as “irreplaceable treasures” that Japan boasts to the world.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Square Enix has announced a new entry in its Dissidia Final Fantasy series, and it has a surprising premise. The game, which is coming to mobile devices next year, still features a who's who of Final Fantasy protagonists but unfolds in the modern day.</p><p>Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy is set in current-day Tokyo, albeit a version that has a giant crystal at its center. This crystal appeared in the city some time ago, but by the time the game begins, the population has already adapted to its strange presence. That is, a negative energy pollutes the crystal, causing monsters to pour out of it and invade the city.&nbsp;</p><p>These creatures aren’t the only things to emerge; warriors hailing from various Final Fantasy games also arrive to save the day. But when they’re not fighting monsters, characters like Cloud and Lightning have assimilated into society and live ordinary lives (which includes wearing contemporary clothing) until they’re needed again, almost like they’re superheroes.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zLM7V3jrNNc?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zLM7V3jrNNc?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In addition to a main story, which is fully voiced in Japanese, players will witness the daily lives of these FF heroes in short episodes. That includes text chats featuring characters such as Terra sharing their new outfits for other characters, like Warrior of Light, to comment on.&nbsp;</p><p>Gameplay-wise, Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy features 3v3 team boss battles as two teams race to defeat a giant boss the fastest, all while battling e roaming monsters along the way. As a mobile game, Dissidia's third-person action is designed to be played using only one hand.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-will-reportedly-arrive-on-nintendo-switch-2-in-december-2025.1324447/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows hasn't officially been announced for the Nintendo Switch 2, but we've seen multiple rumours, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-assassins-creed-shadows-ports/">even dating back to August 2024</a>, that the game would arrive on Nintendo's new console. After the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gets-rated-for-nintendo-switch-2/">was rated by PEGI earlier this year</a>, it seemed like a lock that an announcement would arrive soon, likely at the next Nintendo Direct event.</p>



<p>There have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/">multiple chances for the game to show up at a Nintendo Direct</a> event since the rating went live, and still we've heard nothing, but a <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/assassins-creed-shadows-debarquera-bientot-sur-switch-2-on-vous-devoile-la-date-de-sortie-60629">new report from Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a> seems to have told us both when the game will arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 and when we'll hear about it.</p>



<p>According to the report, the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Assassin's Creed Shadows will be officially announced at some point before November 7, 2025, while the actual release date of the new version is expected to be December 5, 2025. Dealabs also reports that it expects the new version to be priced at "<em>around € 50</em>."</p>



<p>If Shadows arrives on Nintendo Switch 2 before the end of the year, then it'll be the second major Ubisoft title to make its way to the device after Star Wars Outlaws, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">which was actually a pleasant surprise in terms of its performance</a>. Hopefully, Assassin's Creed Shadows <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlKCBGzrB1I">follows in those footsteps</a>, and we're able to see the Nintendo Switch 2 continue to punch above its weight class and keep up, as best it can, with current-generation releases.</p>



<p>Its arrival in December would also technically make it the first 'new release' for the Assassin's Creed series under <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Ubisoft's new subsidiary with Tencent, Vantage Studios</a>. </p>



<p>For more on Assassin's Creed Shadows, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">you can check out our review from its initial release in March</a>, where Francesco De Meo gave the game an 8.7/10, saying, "<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em>" </p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/streaming/799066/splinter-cell-deathwatch-netflix-derek-kolstad-interview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix%E2%80%99s-splinter-cell-deathwatch-picks-up-where-the-games-left-off.1324441/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s been more than a decade since there was a proper <em>Splinter Cell</em> game. So when Derek Kolstad, a writer best-known for creating the <em>John Wick</em> series, approached making the new animated Netflix adaptation, he treated it as if the story continued as the games were dormant. “I wanted to do it almost like the timeline kept going since the last game,” Kolstad tells <em>The Verge</em>. At the outset of the show, called <em>Deathwatch</em>, the iconic Sam Fisher finds himself in a new phase of life: “Retired on a farm in the middle of nowhere, surprised that he’s survived.” Of course, it’s not long before things go wrong.</p><p><em>Deathwatch</em> sees this newly settled version of Fisher (who is now voiced by Liev Schreiber, taking over for Michael Ironside) quickly pulled back into action when he’s forced to help a younger agent who has been injured and stranded from her team. Initially we see him sipping tea and hanging out with his dog Kaiju, but as soon as the agent Zinnia (Kirby Howell-Baptiste) shows up at his door, he’s thrust back into a globe-trotting journey filled with guns, gadgets, and oh-so-many bloody stealth kills.</p><p>Kolstad, who grew up on Tom Clancy novels as a kid, says Ubisoft largely gave him free rein to approach the story how he wanted. “Maybe it’s because there hasn’t been a <em>Splinter Cell</em> game in quite some time, they just kind of let me go with it,” he says. “Once I explained that I was doing Old Man Logan by way of <em>Point Blank</em>, they understood what I was trying to do.”</p><p>Given the amount of time that has passed since the last <em>Splinter Cell</em> title, Kolstad says he wanted to “introduce the character simply” to make it easier for newcomers to jump in. But he still wanted to make sure this was the same Sam Fisher that fans knew and loved — only a little older. “Adaptations are tough,” Kolstad says. “To move from one medium to the next, you have to build out new things, and you’re losing stuff. I made sure that we retained his history as best we could.”</p><p>This isn’t Kolstad’s first time playing around in an existing universe; he also wrote several episodes of the Marvel series <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22337849/falcon-winter-soldier-episode-1-recap-explainer-marvel-mcu"><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></a>. But this was his first time working in the realm of animation, which was a big shift. There was a less tangible aspect to the show’s creation. Kolstad could see art and animatics but wasn’t able to visit a set like he would on a live-action production. “When the scripts are done, you’re kind of like ‘Cool, let’s see what happens in two and a half years.’ That’s the weirdest thing,” he says, adding that “there’s still some of that wizard behind the current element that I don’t understand, but I trust the people doing it.”</p><p>One benefit of animation, though, is that there are fewer constraints when it comes to the action, as you don’t have to worry as much about things like budget, safety, or, um, gravity. Even still, Kolstad says that he remained largely restrained with <em>Deathwatch</em>’s action — even if there are motorcycle chases and plenty of explosions — primarily because it fit the world and character better.</p><p>“I could write the biggest action scene in the world, and it’ll cost a little bit more — because you’re animating many more elements — but in live action, a $30 million budget becomes a $150 million budget,” he explains. “So they encouraged me to go as big as I could. But to be honest, I like the moments of intimate action. I like the sneaking, I like the goggles. All of these intimate sequences are just as cool.”</p><p>There also, perhaps unsurprisingly, is a bit of a <em>John Wick</em> feel to <em>Deathwatch</em>. You can see it in the slick and brutal action but primarily in the setup, in which a veteran killer starts out hoping to live out their life in peace with a cute dog before things turn sour. There’s one key difference between the two, though, according to Kolstad: “This dog survives.”</p><p><sub>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch <em>is streaming on Netflix now.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/streaming/799066/splinter-cell-deathwatch-netflix-derek-kolstad-interview]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-bose-skullcandys-anc-headphones-havent-moved-from-that-prime-day-lowest-price-2000633363</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Here’s a deal you’ll literally be able to feel: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4759/">Amazon just dropped a monster post-Prime Day sale on the Skullcandy Crusher ANC 2 wireless over-ear headphones, taking the price down by nearly half to just $144.</a> That’s almost $100 off the regular $240 list price, and while you might not be able to physically feel the heft that extra $100 in your wallet, you’ll most definitely feel the heavy-duty Multi-Sensory Crusher Bass sound, probably all the way down to your toes.</p>
<p>Skullcandy’s flagship over-ear wireless headphones may look similar to most other phones, but there’s nothing subtle about the powerful sound they kick out with two extra bass drivers joining the two full-range 40mm audio drivers. Use the adjustable 4-mic active noise cancellation to shut out the few external sounds able to penetrate the sonic wall of the Crusher ANC 2 headphones, and you’re fully immersed in your playlist.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4759/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All About the Bass</h2>
<p>When you have access to deep, heavy bass like what comes from the Multi-Sensory Crusher Bass sound of these Skullcandy headphones, you’re going to want to put it to the best use possible. Cinematic scores when you’re streaming a movie are perfect. So is a high-intensity shooter or battle royal when you use the Crusher ANC 2 headphones for gaming. EDM drops? That goes without saying — the Crusher ANC 2 headphones are absolutely perfect for those.</p>
<p>It should be noted that you’re not completely locked into blasting away with the bass at all times — you can use the Skull-IQ app to fine-tune your EQ, flip the noise cancellation into Stay-Aware mode, and completely optimize your sound with Personal Sound by Mimi. With multipoint pairing, you can connect to two devices at once and easily toggle between them without having to “forget connection” on one before pairing with the other.</p>



<h2>Sound for Days</h2>
<p>If you don’t have the Crusher ANC 2’s active noise cancellation engaged, a single full battery charge is good for a staggering 60 hours. And if you’ve let that charge dwindle and you’re about to run for the door, a quick 10 minutes of Rapid Charge gets you 4 hours of listening time. The Crusher ANC 2 headphones come with an extra 1.6-foot 15W high-speed USB-C charging cable for when you want to use Rapid Charge.</p>
<p>There are times you want to relax with a mellow playlist, and there are times you want to just shut out the rest of the world and blast away with&nbsp; good and heavy mix. The Skullcandy Crusher ANC 2 wireless Bluetooth headphones are very good for the former, but they’re unbeatable for the latter. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4759/">And the Amazon post-Prime Day deal knocking nearly $100 from the price?</a> That’s unbeatable too.</p>

The boxed version lines up with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-sees-another-switch-2-listing-pop-up/1100-6535394/">the French retailer listing for the action-adventure game</a> from yesterday, which noted it will be on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/certain-nintendo-switch-2-physical-games-are-game-key-cards-for-downloads/1100-6530576/">Game Key Card</a>.

<p dir="ltr">The leaked release date also comes with a price tag of 50 euros, which could convert to roughly $50 in the US, but this would be a significant price drop compared to other platforms. The box art shows the standard edition of Assassin's Creed Shadows. With Star Wars Outlaws, which retails for $60, Switch 2 got the Gold Edition (includes Season Pass) for that open-world title.</p><p dir="ltr">Eagle Vision isn't required to see the likelihood of Assassin's Creed Shadows coming to Switch 2. Earlier this year, the PEGI ratings website <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reportedly-been-rated-for-the-switch-2/1100-6531001/">listed the game for Nintendo's system</a>. On top of that, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has even previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-exec-teases-new-versions-amid-switch-2-rumors/1100-6533378/">teased that "new versions" of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> will "come to other machines."</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/">Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>. The game initially launched on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in March.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> is fast approaching its first anniversary, and to celebrate new updates are on the way that will make it easier to complete your collection.</p>
<p>Firstly, a new Share function will be added, which will allow players to give away cards to their friends. The feature will appear on the Social Hub screen, but only one card can be shared each day and only 1-4 diamond rarity cards will be shareable.</p>
<p>Secondly, the range of tradable cards is expanding to include two star rarity cards, as well as shiny 1-2 rarity cards. Further, cards from the most recent expansion will be tradable.</p>

<p>A third tweak will alter wonder picks so that cards not registered in your card dex will appear more often to be chosen.</p>
<p>These updates will collectively make completing your card collection a lot easier, and arrive following the most <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-limited-time-booster-pack-will-let-you-collect-rare-cards-you-might-have-missed">recent booster pack that repeated rare cards previously released</a>.</p>
<p>While these updates have not been given a specific date, they're expected this month alongside the game's anniversary. It certainly feels like a closing chapter on its first year of availability.</p>
<p>A further update will allow players to obtain Flair automatically without consuming shinedust.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company has also teased the next expansion will feature Mega Evolution Pokémon and is planned for the end of October.</p>
<p>Mega Evolutions are a key part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">new spin-off game Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, which is released this week.</p>

<figure data-uuid="b374eebd56bd7"><a title="Prime 4 / Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b374eebd56bd7/prime-4-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Multiple rumours have been doing the rounds regarding a potential Switch 2 release for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/assassins_creed_shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, the latest flagship entry in Ubisoft's stealth series, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-rating-spotted-online">age ratings and even box art images</a> making their way online.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to prominent leaker Billbil-kun over on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/assassins-creed-shadows-debarquera-bientot-sur-switch-2-on-vous-devoile-la-date-de-sortie-60629">Dealabs</a>, we may now know the proposed launch date for Shadows. According to the article, the game is scheduled to release on <strong>5th December 2025</strong>, just in time for Christmas.</p>
<p>This also means that it's landing just one day after the highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which is scheduled to release on both the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>4th December 2025</strong>. We're not expecting a huge amount of crossover between the two games in terms of target audience, but we imagine Ubisoft must be losing out on at least a handful of sales as a result.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>This is how things go in the games industry, mind you, as we've seen time and time again. We'll just have to see how it all shake out.</p>
<p>As indicated by the 'leaked' box art design, it also seems likely that Shadows will be a Game-Key Card release on the Switch 2, meaning that no significant data will be stored on the cartridge and a full download will be required.</p>
<p>It's probably wise to take all of this with a grain of salt until we hear directly from Ubisoft. We've reached out for comment and will update you as soon as we hear more.</p>

<p>To be fair to them, they haven't shied away from it or a commitment to doing a better job of communicating about the state of the game. In a new video, Helldivers 2 director Mikael Eriksson is firmly unducked and makes clear that updates adding new enemies, gear or twists will be a bit slower to arrive while the studio work on getting things running without hiccups.
</p><p>"The feedback that we've gotten has been very justified," he said. What I can say is that we're taking this very seriously and we are focusing way more now on addressing these issues to make sure that this sort of thing doesn't happen again. We have made the decision to push some of our content and feature updates a little bit into the future while we're addressing these things, to make sure that we can get to a much more stable state."</p>
<p>Eriksson added that some of the problems can be addressed "fairly quickly", whereas are a bit more complex, a sentiment the studio have regularly expressed when it comes to this build-up of buggy bits and bobs. "We are already making really big improvements. I'm confident that we will get there and we will be able to talk more in detail about this hopefully quite soon," the dev added.</p>
<p>It's good to see Arrowhead being a bit more proactive with their comms than they have been in the past. Here's hoping they can solve at least a good chunk of the lingering issues, even if it's impossible to make every addition risk-free when it comes to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-devs-arrowhead-pull-new-rupture-strain-bugs-offline-for-five-weeks-to-fix-their-er-bugs">kicking off unintended consequences</a>.</p>

              <p>Dragon Con, Atlanta’s massive annual pop culture convention, featured its usual array of enormously famous guests, booths and of course, cosplayers. As ever, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s intrepid photography heroes Mineralblu were there, snapping the best outfits, compiled here today for your viewing pleasure.</p> <p>The Florida event can certainly bring out the big guns. 2025’s shindig saw the likes of John Boyega, Charisma Carpenter, David Boreanaz, Brent Spiner, Simon Pegg, Timothy Omundson, Christopher Lloyd, Karen Fukuhara and William Shatner. It also appears to attract some of the most inventive cosplayers too, with some costumes the likes we’ve never seen before.</p> <p>Among the more familiar sources, such as <em>Elden Ring</em>,&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em> and&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>, this year’s Dragon Con also featured cosplay inspired by <em>Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure</em>, the glorious idea of an unpainted Space Marine, and my absolute favorite, a collection of Thumb Thumbs from the mighty&nbsp;<em>Spy Kids. </em>And check back soon, as hopefully we’ll also have a video of the event to add to this post in the not-too-distant future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Days has come and gone. This was the online retail giant’s two-day sales event where you’re able to save big on TVs, tablets, coffee makers, and pretty much anything else. The next massive, site-wide sale won’t be here until Black Friday, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find a good deal. You just have to look hard enough. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4758/">This Marshall Bluetooth speaker came down in price at the beginning of the month by a whopping $85 and has remained there through the Prime sale.</a> That 47% discount brought the price down from $180 to just $95.</p>
<p>Marshall has been an industry leader in sound engineering for more than 60 years. The company first put its name on the map when it introduced the world to the JTM45 guitar amplifier. That amp produced a much heavier reverberated sound than all other speakers on the market, which helped defined the sound of rock n’ roll. Music was changed forever. Fast forward to today, Marshall still commits itself to crafting great products featuring its signature sound. That’s what you’re getting with this portable Bluetooth speaker.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4758/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Iconic Look and Sound</h2>
<p>First thing you notice about the Marshall Emberton II is its look. This Bluetooth speaker has been models to look like all the iconic Marshall amps of the past, bringing a stylish accent to whatever desk, coffee table, or nightstand you place it on.</p>
<p>The Marshall Emberton II offers a rich stereophonic 360-degree sound that can fill a room and sound great no matter where you are sitting or standing in relation to it. It’s compact in size, but still durable, allowing you to take it with you anywhere without worry.</p>



<p>A portable speaker would be pretty useless without a good battery — so how is the Marshall Emberton II on that front? Well, this speaker will get you over 30 hours of playtime off of a single charge. That over a full day of listening to Ben Platt’s cover of&nbsp;<em>Diet Pepsi</em> on repeat. If you find you have forgotten to charge.</p>
<p>After pairing your phone in your Bluetooth settings, you can start listening with rich sound immediately. Though, if you download the dedicated app, you can customize your sound to your environment and persona preferences. Mess with the equalizer presets to find what’s perfect whether you’re listening in your living room or outside on the beach.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4758/">Right now, you can grab the Marshall Emberton II speaker for $85 off for a limited time.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New leaks have revealed that Pokémon Scarlet/Violet’s cost went way over budget, matching the likes of Pokémon Legends: Arceus’ entire development. </p>



<p>A massive number of leaks have surfaced online about the Pokémon franchise since yesterday, revealing details about past, present, and future games. We have already been informed about the Gen 10 title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wind and Wave</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-games-and-dlc-roadmap-allegedly-revealed-in-new-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a roadmap</a> for future Pokémon games. Now, new details about Scarlet and Violet’s DLC have also surfaced online. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-s-expansion-brought-in-6-15-million-downloads">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Expansion Brought In 6.15 Million Downloads</h2>



<p>As revealed by the reliable CentroLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978000011733664139" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the cost for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s DLC development surpassed their estimated budgets enormously, reaching “as much as the entire Legends: Arceus development”. After that, the development team decided that DLCs would be kept “at an appropriate scale commensurate with the revenue, and focus on achieving low costs”. In the first 10 months, the DLC sold 6.15 million downloads, which is 25% of the players that own the game. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Pokémon Scarlet/Violet DLC development ended up going way over budget, costing as much as the entire Legends: Arceus development.</p><p>"Going forward, we will keep the DLC at an appropriate scale commensurate with the revenue, and focus on achieving low costs". <a href="https://t.co/gIkuf3FwIV">pic.twitter.com/gIkuf3FwIV</a></p></div>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978000011733664139?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-dlcs-became-a-mandate-after-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-s-expansion-0">DLCs Became a Mandate After Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Expansion</h2>



<p>A previous post from Centro also talks about troubles during the development of the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC, which led to a decision that many fans will be happy about. It seems that the DLC was not planned from the beginning, which led to a bug that affected development. After this issue, “Game Freak mandated that all future games will be programmed assuming DLC will be made.” Which means all future Pokémon games will be made with an expansion in mind. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-season-1-ranked-release-date-times-rewards/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-season-1-ranked%E2%80%94release-date-start-time-rewards.1324390/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you can’t wait to get stuck into Pokémon Legends: Z-A Season 1’s Ranked mode, you need to hear about its official start date, what time it’s expected to go live, and potential rewards waiting for you if you can be the very best like no one ever was.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has a different feel to Arceus. From its location to its gameplay mechanics, there are differences across the board. But we’ve not had to wait for the game’s launch to find out everything about the RPG. We already know the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-pokedex/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complete Pokémon Legends: Z-A Pokédex</a> and its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-preload-guide-file-size-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">file size</a>.</p>



<p>The developer is also keen to keep you all up to date with Season 1 Ranked—and so are we!</p>







<figure><figcaption>A lot to look forward to. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You can write down October 16 in your diary as the start date for Z-A Season 1’s Ranked mode.</strong></p>



<p>Funnily enough, it coincides with the game’s release day! Many new releases wait until some time after launch before going full board with any Season 1 content. If you’re looking forward to <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon</a> Legends: Z-A’s Ranked content, you won’t have to wait long to get stuck in.</p>







<p><strong>Pokémon has revealed that 6:00 UTC is the official start time for Season 1 Ranked.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick time breakdown of what this looks like for different regions if you’re having trouble converting UTC to your time zone.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Season 1 Ranked Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">11:00 PM—October 15</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">1:00 AM—October 16</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">2:00 AM—October 16</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">7:00 AM—October 16</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">5:00 PM—October 16</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p><strong>So far, we know you can earn a Greninjite for ranking up in Season 1.</strong></p>



<p>Obviously, there will be a lot more to earn, which we’ll learn about once Season 1 is live. The more battling you do, and the more you win, the better your loot at the end of it!</p>

NVIDIA has also <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/arc-raiders-geforce-game-ready-driver/">released new drivers</a> for ARC Raiders ahead of its server slam test before it launches later this month.</p>



<p>Last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-little-nightmares-iii-and-crimson-desert-all-launching-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-support/">Battlefield 6 and Little Nightmares III</a> were the two highlights launching with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, and this week, the attention turns to Pax Dei, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mmo-game-pax-dei-launches-october-16-available-game-pass/">new MMO arriving on PC </a>and as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-keeper-pax-dei-xbox-game-pass-october-2025/">Xbox Game Pass</a> this week on October 16, and Keeper, the latest game from Double Fine Productions, which is due to launch later this week on October 17 (and also directly into Xbox Game Pass) will launch with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support.</p>



<p>Fairlight84, the free-to-play PvP first-person shooter, where everyone has been turned into a new zombie-cyborg hybrid called 'Zomborgs,' also arrives this week on October 16, and with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>



<p>Regarding the ARC Raiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-opens-pre-orders-server-slam-oct-17-19/">server slam test going on this weekend</a>, you'll also be able to jump into that with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation turned on. Of course, you'll want to ensure you have the latest drivers installed, but once you do, you'll be good to go for this test and for the game's coming launch on October 30, 2025.</p>



<p>Also happening this week, NBA2K26 gets support for DLSS Super Resolution, and if you are eligible for GeForce Rewards, then you'll be able to grab a free golden key for Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>A couple of notable titles are also launching later this month with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support, including Obsidian's second major RPG for the year, The Outer Worlds 2, and the long-awaited Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, which launch on October 29, 2025 and October 21, 2025, respectively.</p>

              <p><i>Call of Duty</i> has been such a staple of gaming that it’s hard to imagine a time when it wasn’t a household name. But way before its yearly release cycle kicked in and modern and futuristic settings became <i>CoD</i>’s bread and butter, even before the franchise made its debut and was largely about simulating World War II battles, there was <i>Medal of Honor</i>. And according to EA’s Vince Zampella (<i>Battlefield</i>, <i>Titanfall</i>, <i>Apex Legends</i>), Activision brought <i>CoD</i> into existence to put <i>Medal of Honor</i> in its crosshairs. Mission accomplished.</p> <p>“The only reason <i>Call of Duty </i>exists is because EA were dicks,” Zampella said in an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/battlefield-6-vince-zampella"><i>GQ</i></a> (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-only-reason-call-of-duty-exists-is-because-ea-were-dicks-battlefield-boss-vince-zampella-says">h/t <i>IGN</i></a>). An FPS OG, Zampella was the lead designer of <i>Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</i>, and would go on to co-found Infinity Ward.</p> <p>In what sounds like a dispatch from an alternate universe, Infinity Ward was originally hoping to create more <i>Medal of Honor </i>games. That didn’t happen. EA decided to be “dicks,” and chose to handle things on its own with <i>Medal of Honor</i> (that wouldn’t end up working out well). At the time, Infinity Ward, now without its franchise of choice in its grasp, pivoted to pitching Activision on a new historical shooter, <i>Call of Duty</i>.</p> <p>Zampella would later join EA, creating <i>Titanfall </i>and <i>Apex Legends</i> in his role at Respawn Entertainment. He’s now in charge of <i>Battlefield</i>, which is celebrating its sixth mainline release.</p>

<p>The current lead for the Battlefield franchise has stated that the only reason Call of Duty exists is because EA had a fallout with him. </p>



<p>The Battlefield franchise is back to its victory days with the release of BF6, finally giving the likes of Call of Duty some serious competition. Their last title, Battlefield 2042, didn’t perform well with fans, but the developers have pulled off a complete turnaround, with BF6 reaching <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beats-call-of-dutys-all-time-concurrent-player-count-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost 750k concurrent players</a> on launch day. </p>



<h2 id="h-vince-zampella-reveals-call-of-duty-is-only-here-because-ea-were-d-s">Vince Zampella Reveals Call of Duty is Only Here Because ‘EA Were D***s’</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/battlefield-6-vince-zampella" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GQ</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/call-of-duty-creator-and-current-battlefield-6-head-vince-zampella-says-the-only-reason-that-cod-exists-is-because-ea-were-d-ks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Vince Zampella spoke about Call of Duty’s existence. The executive vice president at Electronic Arts stated, “The only reason that&nbsp;Call of Duty&nbsp;exists is because EA were dicks”. For those unaware about Zampella’s past, he left EA after a dispute, only to make Infinity Ward in 2002, which led to the creation of the Call of Duty franchise. He later returned to EA to oversee games such as Titanfall, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,&nbsp;and Apex Legends.</p>



<p>Vince Zampella is a true veteran of the shooter genre, delivering players with some of the biggest hits in this space. He started with Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, where we worked closely with Steven Spielberg. After the dispute, Activision tasked him with creating a franchise that would kill Medal of Honor, and that was Call of Duty. However, after that, he returned to EA and is now overseeing the latest big thing in the FPS space, Battlefield. </p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6’s campaign offers players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-campaign-tells-you-to-uninstall-when-youre-done/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an uninstall button</a> after completion. Additionally, Black Ops 7 beta matches were nearly 99% cheater-free. What are your thoughts on Call of Duty not existing if Zampella didn’t have a fallout with EA? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

            <p>Head of Battlefield Vince Zampella has given his opinion on the creation of the Call of Duty franchise, stating the series only exists "because EA were dicks".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/battlefield-6-vince-zampella">In an interview with GQ</a>, Zampella spoke about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s potential to save the modern military shooter, but also his own history in game development. After all, before he touched Battlefield, Zampella was part of the original Call of Duty team.</p>
<p>"The only reason that Call of Duty exists is because EA were dicks," stated Zampella. For those who don't know, Zampella was working on the Medal of Honor series  - specifically the fantastic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/medal-honor-allied-assault">Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</a> - at developer 2015 Inc. Zampella and his peers then formed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/infinity-ward">Infinity Ward</a>, and soon after EA quickly decided to move development of Medal of Honor in-house. It's here when Infinity Ward made a deal with Activision Blizzard to create a new game codenamed "MOH Killer", which later manifested as Call of Duty.</p>

<p>While Zampella's comment on the creation of Call of Duty is new, whisperings about the birth of CoD and EA's sudden decision to take Medal of Honor in-house have been circulating for years.</p>
<p><a href="https://mcvuk.com/business-news/publishing/the-medal-of-honor-killer-a-call-of-duty-story/">In a 2013 MCV article</a>, former Infinity Ward artist Justin Thomas (who worked on Medal of Honor: Allied Assault), stated: "After leaving 2015 we were working with a major publisher. For legal reasons I will say things didn't go as planned with it. We were left in a situation of unpaid milestones that were delivered and no finances to operate on.</p><p>"The company was potentially going to disband. In a last ditch effort our then president, Grant Collier sent out a signal to all the major publishers in the industry letting them know that the majority of the Medal of Honor: Allied Assault team was available. Within days of closing the doors on the studio, Activision responded immediately with an offer."</p>
<p>Fast forward decades later, and Zampella has found himself leading the charge with a new military shooter facing off against the Call of Duty series, in an interesting twist of fate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-ward-studio-heads-sacked">especially given Zampella was dramatically fired from Activision</a> back in 2010 due to claims of breach of contract and insubordination. Infinity Ward staff <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-told-infinity-ward-staff-to-take-the-money-and-get-over-it-after-west-and-zampella-firing">were then given a pay-rise, and told to "take the money and get over it"</a>.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 is proving to be a successful challenger to Call of Duty's throne right now, given the sheer popularity of the game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-only-been-out-a-day-and-its-already-one-of-steams-biggest-games-ever">quickly becoming one of the most popular Steam launches of all time</a>.</p>

			<p>The year was 2013, Lumoise was the city, and roller skates were all the rage. When you weren’t taking time out to ride a Skiddo across town, battle in a café or try out this newfangled Mega Evolution, you were doing tricks on your roller skates. Those halcyon days are long behind us. Pokémon X&amp;Y are ancient, nobody roller skates anymore and Lumoise is not the city it once was. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, it is much, much larger.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition — Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZL4jOPorLQM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>An urban redevelopment mission is underway with one core goal in mind: to turn the city into a place Pokémon and people can truly share. And boy have they done a lot – both to the city and to the game.</p>


<p>After getting off the train in the capital of the France-like Kalos region, you quickly see what the city has become. Back in 2013, Lumoise was a little more than two ring roads, with 10 ‘spoke’ roads reaching from the central hub to the rim. The geography is much the same in 2025, but buildings aren’t so much obstacles as they are your new playground. Much like in Assassin’s Creed, (almost) every rooftop is in reach. As long as it’s outside, there’s (almost) nowhere you can’t go.</p>
<p>This is important because the entire game takes place within the confines of the city. That may seem hair-raising, considering the number of biomes and regions seen in typical Pokémon games, but it really isn’t an issue. A few dozen hours in, and you’re still exploring new rooftops, catching new Pokémon and heading to newly converted patches of turf that have been given over to wild Pokémon.</p>


<p>These Wild Zones, as they’re dubbed, are essentially self-contained biomes, zoned off using holotech that keeps ordinary citizens out and wild Pokémon within. You can go in and catch Pokémon using the cool new dynamic battle feature, or you can leave them be. The choice is yours.</p>
<p>This dynamic battle system is very cool, shifting this series from turn-based battles to real time, where you actively run around and dish out commands to your current Pokémon. Rather than using traditional PP (stamina), each move has a cooldown. Transitioning between Wild Zones and the rest of the city is seamless, and you use the same system of attacks no matter where you are — whether that’s using Rock Smash on a boulder or Water Gun on an enemy Pokémon.</p>

<p>The battle system is nothing new in the wider scheme of things. It’ll be pretty rote for anyone who has played World of Warcraft, for example, but it’s new for Pokémon which has historically stuck to its guns on 1v1 battle systems where you and your Pokémon stand rooted to the spot. It feels, in many ways, like the boss battles from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, but throwing moves instead of rocks.</p>
<p>But where things get <em>really</em> like Arceus is once night falls and the Battle Zones pop up. This is all part of the Z-A Royale — a letter-based ranking system to prove once and for all that you are, indeed, the very best, like no one ever was.</p>

<p>The Royale is a fun twist on traditional trainer battles, and as soon as you enter the zone, you’re fair game. Much like your Hisuian predecessors, this has you sneaking around like a ninja. The aim is to unleash an opening attack on a rival trainer and their Pokémon while literally crouching behind a bush, sign or bin. There’s none of this ‘When your eyes meet’ nonsense — this is brutal, all out backstabbery of the Pokémon kind. Not only is this fair game, but it’s actively encouraged by the app governing the tournament. You get missions to do this that give you bonus points. Get enough points and you can take on a Promotion Match to rank up.</p>
<p>Your opponents will tell you they’re taking part so that they can impose their own weird ideals and schemes on the city, like outlawing non-taxi based transport so they can monopolise urban mobility. But you’re an upstanding citizen (brutal backstabbery aside)! You’re in it to heal Lumoise, the city you only just arrived in!</p>
<p>Heal it from what, you might ask? Well, that newfangled Mega Evolution is no longer new. Everyone knows you hold a keystone, that your Pokémon holds a shiny marble that corresponds to their name and then you can unlock a form of temporary evolution that massively boosts their stats and gives them a cool new look.</p>

<p>What is new, and an emerging threat to this metropolis, is Rogue Mega Evolution. Certain Pokémon are evolving without the necessary stones, causing them a lot of pain and wreaking havoc. You have to end their pain by beating the tar out of them so they revert back to normal before they go on a rampage. It’s classic Pokémon logic.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s side missions! Pokémon fans are well known for being distracted by shiny things, and in this case, it’s missions given to you by the local detective agency – why would you do the main story stuff when you can cosplay as Detective Pikachu? There are dozens of these side missions scattered across the map at any given time, and they can be anything from a Pokémon-themed fetch quest to a battle request. They’re generally not difficult, but they offer some subtle guidance on type-based match-ups for newer players and unlocks new rooftops to explore.</p>

<p>But, wait, there’s even more! There’s parkour-based collectibles hidden around the city (Kalos gonna France), so you’ll be bounding around like some kind of Pokémon Ninja Warrior, there’s research quests to do and more. While you may not leave Lumoise, why would you want to when there’s so much to see, do, climb and catch?</p>
<p>Somewhat unsurprisingly, the Nintendo Switch 2 manages to take all of this in its stride, and the game plays admirably well in both handheld and docked modes. That’s to be expected, but as we were only able to test and review on the newer hardware, there does remain a question mark over the game on the original Switch hardware, given the long-standing performance struggles of Scarlet &amp; Violet in particular, which the Switch 2 patch was able to effortlessly brush aside.</p>
