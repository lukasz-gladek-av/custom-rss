However, if that game has left you wanting a more typical lightsaber-swinging odyssey across the stars, boy, have I got the games for you. Respawn Entertainment, which is best known for shooters like <em>Apex Legends </em>and the <em>Titanfall </em>series, has also spent the past several years developing the <em>Star Wars Jedi </em>third-person action-adventure games, and you can snag them on sale on PlayStation right now. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196086" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Dark Knights And Dark Princes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196086,196918,196307" data-current="196086"><div><p>The Week In Games: Dark Knights And Dark Princes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21614.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>At the moment, you can pick up the first game, </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-the-kotaku-review-1839940185&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-the-kotaku-review-1839940185"><em><strong>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</strong></em></a></span><strong>, for just $10 on both PS4 and PS5.

For this low of a price, picking them up is just insurance.<br></p><p><em>Jedi: Fallen Order </em>surprised me when I finally played it. I think I was a year or two late to the party, playing it in the midst of an emotional and mental rut smack in the throes of the first year of the pandemic. I needed any game to just kind of make me feel anything, and I was throwing wanton money at sales trying to find the thing that would jolt me awake and actually enthrall me. I knew to expect more from it than the average licensed game based on the pedigree of the team working on it, but also I simply didn’t know Respawn had that dog in them.<br></p><p>Respawn’s <em>Jedi </em>games are sometimes compared to From Software’s <em>Dark Souls </em>series thanks to a handful of mechanics and principles they adapt. For example, combat in the <em>Jedi </em>games primarily centers around smaller and more intimate skirmishes, where you are forced to dodge, parry, and pick your moments. You spend the game learning new lightsaber and force techniques, but at the end of the day, you won’t get far unless you learn to parry and riposte early on. Much like <em>Souls</em>, and perhaps to a greater extent <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>, the <em>Jedi </em>games feature a give-and-take kind of approach to combat. Yeah, there are nameless grunts with blasters that you can just cut through, but there are also a number of opponents with similar weapons to yours who will push back on you till you throw everything you have at them.<br></p><p>These games are also structured in a similar way to the <em>Souls </em>series. There are meditation points that function as bonfires, and you can level up there and even fast-travel, but using one also resets the enemy spawns in the area. When you fall in battle, you leave a Force impression of your XP behind, and unsurprisingly, it must be picked up before your next death or it’ll disappear entirely. Even the way that <em>Jedi: Fallen Order </em>and its sequel dole out shortcuts in their huge environments is similar to the Metroidvania-style approach to level design found in both the <em>Souls </em>games and the games that I think both series are ultimately more akin to: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-legend-of-zelda-games-breath-wild-botw-nintendo-1850320051&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-legend-of-zelda-games-breath-wild-botw-nintendo-1850320051">3D <em>Zelda </em>titles</a></span>.</p><p>The <em>Jedi </em>games aren’t nearly as hard as some of those comparisons let on though, unless you specifically adjust the difficulty to the highest levels. I wouldn’t recommend it though, because whereas their inspirations are designed around difficulty more thoughtfully, upping the challenge in the <em>Jedi </em>series simply tweaks knobs in the back end to make the games more brutal and unfair. Take it from someone who has completed both on higher settings, I got nothing but headaches from trying to force the <em>Jedi </em>games into being <em>Souls </em>games, which is why I think they’re better thought of as 3D <em>Zelda </em>wrapped in a <em>Star Wars </em>skin and story. </p><p>To that end, <em>Fallen Order </em>and <em>Survivor </em>both have a greater degree of platforming, puzzle-solving, and traditional dungeons than your typical <em>Souls </em>game, giving them a much more vintage vibe as opposed to the modern feeling of other contemporary action adventure games. That doesn’t make them feel dated though. They feel like relics of a bygone era of games, which I do mean in the most complimentary sense. There aren’t actually <em>many </em>huge AAA games that commit to both open worlds and these small, focused gauntlets that break up the monotony of nonstop combat and constantly expanding maps. You’d think the popularity of <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a></span>,<em> </em>and these <em>Jedi </em>games would spawn more of them.<br></p><p>The two games released so far—with a third game currently in development—tell one of the more entertaining stories in the current incarnation of the <em>Star Wars </em>Expanded Universe. Centering the padawan-turned-runaway Cal Kestis, who’s played by <em>Shameless</em>’ Cameron Monaghan, the series takes place between <em>Revenge of the Sith </em>and <em>A New Hope</em>. Cal, a survivor of the Great Jedi Purge, is on the run from the Empire when he meets the crew of the Stinger Mantis, including the pilot Greez and its captain, Cere Junda, played by the inimitable Debra Wilson.<br></p><p>I think these titles, more so than most of the current glut of shows and movies, capture the spirit of <em>Star Wars</em>, or at least what it’s traditionally meant to me. Cal is far from a perfect protagonist, and as he’s grown he’s had to deal with his imperfections and occasional inclinations to the dark side of the force. Greez is easily the most fun sidekick-style character introduced in a long time, and even BD-1, Cal’s robotic companion, feels leagues better than BB-8. Cere and Merrin, a Nightsister who becomes entwined in Cal’s journey, could have fulfilled very archetypal roles (and to some extent still do, because <em>Star Wars </em>loves a tried-and-true trope) but they are also great sources of conflict in Cal’s saga. They actually push on him, even grate against his sensibilities, and challenge him to be a better Jedi, and moreover, a better person. This cast and these games are as heady as they are whimsical, and that’s <em>Star Wars </em>for me.</p><p>Along their journeys, they take on a number of high-ranking officers of the Empire including a great deal of Inquisitors, and even come to blows with Darth Vader himself. The <em>Jedi </em>games span several planets, covering sights both familiar and completely foreign to <em>Star Wars </em>fans. And while it mostly stays relegated to its own corner of that far, far away galaxy, I can feel the ambitions of the story (especially that of <em>Survivor</em>) beginning to creep into territory of the books, shows, and movies. It is, by my measure, one of the better investments you can currently make in the beleaguered <em>Star Wars </em>universe, and one that’s well worth the relatively low asking price right now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You’ll craft specific bait for each catch you want and when you do catch your prize, you can use it to cook new recipes. There will be some relatively normal specimens, like jellyfish, but the trailer also teases more unique varieties, such as the Magma Shark, which is exactly what it sounds like: a shark made of lava<br></p><p>The Aquarius update also adds a catalog of all the game’s fish, a diving suit, and a personal fishing skiff for players. I’m also intrigued by Aquarius’s fishing expeditions, which are community competitions where you’ll try to get the biggest catch against other players. </p><p>When <em>No Man’s Sky</em> first released in 2016 it failed to live up to the lofty promises developer Hello Games had made prior to launch. But instead of giving up, the developer and fans stuck with it, and thanks to tons of major and minor updates over the better part of a decade, the game has transformed into one of the best space games on the market. The Aquarius update feels like a triumphant acknowledgment of how far the game has come. <em>No Man’s Sky</em> bringing fishing to the game adds one more pastime to the game and recognizes that after years, the world is good enough that players can just sit back and relax within it.

<p>It is a wild day when a game completely unrelated to another video game ends up sponsoring that game. World of Warcraft China (WoW) has recently sponsored two Chinese Dota 2 organizations going into The International 2024. These sponsorships are happening despite Valve’s ban on in-game ads during the massive tournament.</p>







<p>It was recently announced that World of Warcraft China was going to sponsor G2xiG and Xtreme Gaming’s Dota 2 team going into The International 2024. This huge esports event is considered the biggest Dota 2 competitive tournament in the world, happening once a year. </p>



<p>Seems pretty cool that a video game completely unrelated to Dota 2 would sponsor them, right? Well, it would seem as if the sponsorship may be for nothing, as Valve has made it incredibly clear that no in-game ads will be allowed during the extent of The International 2024 event.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>With this ban on in-game ads, it would seem as if the WoW sponsor holds very little weight going into the Dota 2 event. Will the game pull out from its sponsorships? Or do they have a marketing strategy up their sleeves that no one will expect?</p>



<p>The sponsorship plan was originally to put two popular WoW character’s names on the jerseys of each team.</p>







<h2 id="h-world-of-warcraft-releases-new-expansion">World Of Warcraft Releases New Expansion</h2>



<p>The popular MMORPG recently released its newest expansion, The War Within. Debuting with some of the game’s best reviews, The War Within has become a hit with World of Warcraft enthusiasts.</p>



<p>The partnership with the two Chinese Dota 2 teams was supposed to be a way to help promote the game’s new expansion, but it seems as if Blizzard’s efforts may have been for nothing.</p>

<p>If you had given me, at age 15 or so, a game in which you can fight seemingly hundreds of Tyranid bugs at once with two friends, alternately blasting them with bolt rifles or pulverizing them with a chainsword, then finishing the biggest of them by ripping off one of his claws and shoving it through his head, all of it happening to the sounds of action-movie orchestration and dialogue about stoic duty, would I have had any complaints?</p>

<p>No, I would not. But we're spoiled for choice now. How much you enjoy <a href="https://www.focus-entmt.com/en/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2"><em>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</em></a> (for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation and releasing on September 9) will depend on your ability to tap into the deep basement of your kill-'em-all mentality and fantasy lore engagement. You can enjoy it somewhat ironically, which I did at times, especially when playing co-op with friends who told me that they did not like the game's aesthetics at all. But strip away the grimdark trappings of zealotry, Chaos Marines, and skulls—so, so many skulls—and you have a competent, sometimes innovative third-person squad shooter. It feels like <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/gears-of-war-5-hands-on-a-new-blockbuster-for-the-game-subscription-era/">Gears of War</a>, </em>minus the cover, but with heavier characters, more melee combat, and somehow even fewer women.</p>
<p>Getting the most out of <em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>means suspending disbelief, feeling heavy metal, and wanting to kill a whole bunch of things with some very big dudes. In roughly a dozen hours of gameplay, I found the core gameplay loop relatively engaging, with enough mix-ups, upgrades, and challenges to keep it feeling more like the fun kind of endless war, not the real kind. It's pretty enjoyable to team up with friends, too, so long as they're cool with <em>Warhammer 40K's&nbsp;</em>vibes and some occasionally repetitive challenges.</p>

<h2>Constant lore, varied battles</h2>
<p>I do not have deep&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em><em>40K</em> lore knowledge (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/warhammer-40000-boltgun-is-a-loud-obnoxious-and-damned-fun-retro-shooter/"><em>Boltgun</em></a> was previously my deepest engagement), so please forgive everything I get wrong in sketching out the game's story. You, Demetrian Titus, are an Adeptus Astartes, a Space Marine, a bio-engineered huge guy with like three hearts and plugs in your head and an all-encompassing devotion to the Imperium of Man. In the prior <em>Space Marine</em> game, you did so well resisting the lure of Chaos that you were turned into the Inquisition and made to serve on the Deathwatch. Now you're back and demoted, and something bad happens to you in the training mission. You are saved by the Ultramarines, and you undergo the Rubicon Primaris surgery to make you an even bigger and stronger fundamentalist killing machine.</p>

<p>And then you're off, joined by Brother-Sergeant Gadriel and Brother Chairon, played by either your online friends or the game AI. You have a heavy primary weapon, a pistol-like sidearm, and a melee weapon, usually a chainsword, a big knife, or a huge hammer. Your armor is tough but gets worn down, and only time or pulling off a <em>Doom 2016-</em>style melee finisher on downed enemies will recharge it. You're not exactly agile, but you can lunge at remarkable speed, like Chris Farley in his <em>SNL&nbsp;</em>prime. And you call your teammates "brother" a <em>lot</em>.</p>

                <p>Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 remake comes out in October, and the developer has shown off some interesting extras on social media. A recent post revealed an optional no-UI mode, as well as a so-called "'90s filter" that adds large amounts of film grain, color correction, and other on-screen elements.</p><p>As you can see in the above post, the two modes work together to create an aesthetic that is highly reminiscent of the original Silent Hill 2. Copious film grain and fog are two of Silent Hill's defining aesthetic traits, and the game did not feature any UI elements--not even a health bar. But as pedants were quick to point out, the name of this '90s filter would seem to be a misnomer, considering that the original Silent Hill 2 released in 2001.</p><p dir="ltr">Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 has garnered a somewhat polarized response from the horror community, with some players expressing concern over the direction of the project. But after a three-hour hands-on preview with the game, GameSpot's Jessica Cogswell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-preview-significantly-better-than-the-trailers-youve-seen/1100-6525893/" data-ref-id="1100-6525893">wrote</a> that the remake is significantly better than its marketing materials have indicated. "In short, I was incredibly impressed by the time I spent with Silent Hill 2 Remake," she wrote. "It is surreal, cerebral, horrifying, and grotesque--all of the things that made the original title such a remarkable title not only for Konami, but for the horror genre as well."</p><p dir="ltr">Fans will decide for themselves when the game releases on October 8. In the meantime, PC players can try the definitive version of the original, Silent Hill 2: Enhanced Edition, which recently received its final update.</p>

                <p>Despite recent changes to the app store to accommodate cloud gaming, Microsoft and Nvidia still don't have native cloud-gaming apps on iOS. Anyone wishing to play Game Pass via the cloud on their iPhone must use a web app. New submissions to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) reveal Microsoft's reasons for not yet publishing an app.</p><p>In a submission from late July (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234777/microsoft-apple-cloud-gaming-app-store-changes-xbox-cma" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>), Microsoft claims that Apple's recent changes to its app guidelines are insufficient for Microsoft to release a native iOS app. Microsoft objects to Apple's 3.11 guideline, which forbids developers from linking to outside websites for subscriptions, thereby circumventing Apple's 30% cut on app transactions. It claims that, "The 30% commission fee makes it impossible for Microsoft to effectively monetize its cloud gaming service offering," because other Apple regulations make it impossible for Microsoft to change subscription fees on iOS. Furthermore, Microsoft claims third-party developers would need to recode their own games to fall under Apple's rules.</p><p>Apple countered that other developers have not had similar difficulties with the in-app purchase requirement. It cites Antstream, a retro-gaming cloud app, that Apple assisted with subscription optimizations, editorial frameworks, and public relations review. According to Apple, Microsoft has failed to negotiate with Apple or work towards a compromise, despite Apple's recent changes and willingness to cooperate with other teams.</p><p>The CMA is investigating mobile browsers, browser engines, and the distribution of cloud gaming in the UK. It is identifying remedies to competition issues including requiring cloud gaming native apps to operate on a "read-only" basis (i.e. without in-app purchases) to prevent the need for recoding or requiring Apple to allow cloud gaming clients to provide their own payment systems. The CMA will release a provisional decision report in November. A final report will likely release in February or March 2025.</p>

			<p>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war. This one line all the narrative reasoning you need for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a>. It’s exposition, it’s emotional grounding, and it’s explanation for the hours you’re about to spend soaked in the gore of many thousands of enemy xenos.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - The Angels Of Death" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/buT5yuGwg8s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Straightforward it might seem, but there’s also an emotional connection here that overrides the guns, the chainswords and the gruff militaristic interplay between the characters. This is a game utterly enamoured with the world of Warhammer 40,000, Games Workshop’s most popular franchise, and which, in turn, will speak to those that are similarly enamoured with it.</p>


<p>You could raise questions about the lack of female characters, the one-note emotional range, or indeed a story that thinks that character development is frivolous window dressing. You could, but you shouldn’t. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> is the most spectacular, the most faithful and the most enjoyable video game adaptation of this beloved setting – a setting that, when it was created in 1987, was just as deliberately flawed and hyper-sensationalised as the ultra-violent social satire of RoboCop.</p>


<p>Space Marine 2 is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/09/12/review-warhammer-40000-space-marine/">the continuing story</a> of our hero Titus. It’s been over 100 years since the conclusion of the last game saw him branded a heretic and despatched to the Deathwatch, a suicide squad sent to deal with the worst threats in the galaxy.</p>
<p>Called to the planet Kadaku in the midst of a Tyranid invasion, your team are deployed to unleash a bio-virus designed to attack the xenos. Titus is the only survivor, though only through the timely intervention of the Ultramarine chapter. Reinstated, and newly reborn as a stronger, faster and more resilient Primaris marine, Titus leads a new team into the heart of the alien infestation, giving you the excuse to cut down Tyranid after Tyranid after Tyranid. It’s an objective that never gets old.</p>
<p>Titus is a brusque, but likeable, central hero, and some of the most interesting elements of the narrative are to do with how he’s perceived by his fellow Ultramarines. Certain parts of his past have been erased from the company’s records, and that makes for a few noteworthy moments amongst the gung-ho missions. This isn’t particularly a game with bags of character development, which is a shame when there’s so much fantastic writing set within the 40K universe, but it does the job it needs to.</p>

<p>Saber want you to constantly move forward. You’re a nigh-on indestructible warrior, and they’ve built your ability to survive into the combat system. You have four blocks of armour, each of which will regenerate after a small amount of time.</p>
<p>If all your armour has gone then you’ll begin to lose health, with the most obvious way to reclaim it begin to dole out some damage of your own, refilling any health and a portion of the shields you’ve just lost. Beyond that there’s the standard medkits, or your teammates can revive you, but the whole point of Space Marine 2 is to wade forward, straight into the gaping maw of the Tyranid threat, and by Jove, you’re going to do it.</p>
<p>It’s quite amazing just how well balanced the combat and its built-in healing system is. Any number of times I’ve been on the brink of death, a sliver of health keeping Titus upright, and still I’ve been able to triumph, building health and armour back through timely executions and parries. You are one of the galaxy’s toughest troops, and Space Marine 2 makes you feel like it.</p>
<p>It’s also surprising how fast and frenetic that combat feels, when you’re a soldier that’s been stuck in the thickest, most tank-like armour mankind has created. You stomp around the different landscapes at a pace that’s just about fast enough not to drive you insane, but the moment that one of those vile Tyranids appears everything seems to accelerate. They’re <em>much</em> faster than you are, and as they rush at you with their lethal blades your focus shifts as you try to survive the deadly dance.</p>

<p>Space Marine 2 looks absolutely stunning, and it’s even more impactful if you’ve grown up with the franchise, formative years spent hanging around in Games Workshop and lusting over the biggest and most expensive models. Those huge models look incredible, an early appearance of a Thunderhawk craft then setting the tone for impressive neo-gothic industrial buildings, alien locales and the terrifying swarms of aliens that you have to deal with.</p>
<p>Saber are rightly very proud of their swarm tech, and just as we saw in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/26/world-war-z-review-wwz-ps4-xbox-pc/">World War Z</a>, it’s a hugely effective way of making encounters feel insurmountable, with the resulting exhilaration when you do scrape though a truly euphoric reward. The sense of scale at times is breathtaking, and when it’s combined with the level of detail found throughout the game, Space Marine 2 is an alien-infested feast for the senses.</p>
<p>The team have also thought about longevity and come at it from multiple angles with both PvE and PvP options. You can play through the Campaign in online co-op with up to two other players, and as with most games, the experience is even better with real people to go into battle with. It allows you to co-ordinate with each other, focus in on specific enemies, and just bicker between yourselves about who was really better when the results page shows that you did the most melee damage.</p>
<p>While Gears of War certainly cribbed from Games Workshop’s world, Saber are here returning the favour, and playing in co-op feels as natural with Titus and his cohorts as it did with Marcus and Dom. If you don’t have enough Space Marine-orientated friends the AI is serviceable enough, and while they’ll be found stood around at times when there’s definitely aliens to shoot, you can at least always rely on them to heal you when you’re down. That might make them better than your friends.</p>

<p>With the campaign behind you, there’s then the Operations mode, pitting&nbsp;you and your squad against a batch of aliens in a set mission structure, and with multiple classes to choose between.&nbsp;This is a further treat for 40K fans, with Assault troopers nestling up to Snipers, Paladin, Heavy, and the standard Tactical marines as well.</p>
<p>Playing Operations grants you experience, which in turn allows you to level up each of these hero types, granting perks, new weaponry and alternative cosmetics to personalise your trooper with. Just as with the real models, you can go to town here, and make them as different as possible to your friend’s trooper, though there’s a disappointing little dose of microtransactions for some of the other Space Marine chapters’ colour schemes.</p>

<p>If you’d rather be blasting real people, there’s also Eternal War, which is the 6v6 PvP mode pitting Space Marines and their fallen Chaos Marine brethren. Pre-release this has been the portion of the game we’ve had the least amount of time with, but even with that caveat, it’s already a good dose of chunky fun.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>"In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war." So goes the infamous&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6bc2812a-69f3-4947-89d3-4c79996f4d0f" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000">Warhammer 40,000</a>&nbsp;</em>opening screen, but if you want to understand&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="669ee953-b128-427d-8ca6-11ed47ab3529" href="https://techraptor.net/games/space-marine-2"><em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2</em></a>, it's not the far future to which you must journey. Instead, you must travel to the not-so-distant past.</p>
<p>Specifically, you should go back to the seventh console generation, the days of the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3. That's where&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>dwells, which is appropriate enough given it's the sequel to a game from that very era.</p>
<p>Unlike the Tyranids that Demetrian Titus faces,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>seems fairly content not evolving too significantly. It offers the same kind of hack-and-slash-come-shooter thrills you'll find in the original, but there are a few new quirks here that alter the formula, for better and for worse.</p>
<h2><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>Feels Like a Throwback</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review-jump-pack.jpg?itok=1tUeLcia 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review-jump-pack.jpg?itok=pY3Av7Ej 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many of the original&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/node/31982"><em>Space Marine</em>'s </a>pieces of wargear make a return in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Pretty much every facet of&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>feels like a callback to the era that spawned its progenitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's got everything you'd expect from an early-2010s third-person shooter: boxy, two-dimensional level design, a&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="996bd110-ba62-4ea1-ac45-607c1c48e361" href="https://techraptor.net/games/halo-infinite"><em>Halo</em></a>-style regenerating armor system, and big manly men in power armor murdering scores upon scores of monstrosities.</p>
<p>I'll try to avoid starting every sentence in this review with "much like the first game", but it'll be difficult, because&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>often comes across like more of a remake than a sequel, albeit one with Tyranids in place of the first game's Orks.</p>
<p>If you've played&nbsp;<em>Space Marine</em>, you'll know the drill. You and your two Space Marine buddies must journey to various vast, imposing Imperial facilities to dispatch droves of Tyranids in combat that veers between ranged blasting and up-close-and-personal chainsword speed dating.</p>
<p>You'll have a variety of weapons to choose from, but you can only carry two guns at a time (plus, occasionally, a third heavy weapon), and your objectives are pretty much exclusively "press that button", "fall off that ledge", or "ride that elevator".</p>
<p>I'm on record as a fan of throwback Xbox 360-era shooters, though; I was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/evil-west-review">a big fan</a> of&nbsp;<em>Evil West</em>, and so it's no surprise that&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>offered similar comforts. For all its flaws (and it has many), I enjoyed immersing myself in the nostalgia of a bygone era with Saber and Focus' game.</p>
<p>Much like with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/evil-west"><em>Evil West</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s lack of modern trappings reads like a refreshing return to basics. You won't find a skill tree (except in the multiplayer mode), and there's no open world to be seen. Instead, it's just you, your enemies, and the holy wargear blessed by the Emperor.</p>
<h2>Combat in&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>is Fun, but Awkward</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review-dodge.jpg?itok=znMW6UK5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review-dodge.jpg?itok=j42eGV3_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Marine 2</em>'s parry and dodge mechanic is a little clunky.</figcaption></figure><p>That's not to say there's nothing new here at all. While the combat closely resembles that of the original&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine</em>, Saber has seen fit to throw in a couple of innovations, not least a system that has you dodging and parrying enemies based on colored prompts.</p>
<p>This system is perhaps the biggest change from the original, so I'm sad to report that it never quite felt right to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a particularly big Tyranid (or Chaos Marine later on) approaches with designs on your gene-seed, they'll throw out attacks that must either be dodged or parried, which generally works fine when you're one-on-one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem here is that's not really how&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s combat works. At any given moment, you'll be facing off against scores upon scores of slavering monsters, and watching for parry or dodge symbols in chaos (no pun intended) like that is difficult.</p>
<p>There's also the issue that in order to lend a sense of weight to proceedings, your Space Marines' attacks are heavy and ponderous, which means you'll often be locked into animations and blindsided by a parry or dodge prompt you've got no way of responding to.</p>
<p>In practice, I found that this system resulted in just waiting for enemies to strike and reacting appropriately, which didn't feel very 'Space Marine'. I'm supposed to be charging in for the glory of the Emperor, not gloomily hoping Lictor-senpai will notice me so I can return its flirtations.</p>
<p>Happily, hacking through hordes of Tyranids or Chaos cultists still feels great. The chainsword still packs a real punch, and the bolters feel exactly as heavy and impactful as they should, which is a big plus in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s favor.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>had leant further into its power fantasy strengths and ditched the parry system, I'd be wholeheartedly recommending it. As it stands, though, this system feels to me like a strange, clunky imposition rather than a game-changer.</p>
<h2><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>Has a Great Sense of Place</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review-location.jpg?itok=tiol8Puu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review-location.jpg?itok=yiM83LWP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Marine 2</em>'s austere cathedral-like interiors look great.</figcaption></figure><p>Between fights in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, you'll mostly be wandering through ruined industrial facilities, religious buildings, and swampy jungles. There's not a lot to do when you're not carving up enemies, but that feels appropriate; these are the Emperor's chosen, after all. They're not administrative assistants.</p>
<p>Developer Saber has done a great job of rendering&nbsp;<em>40k</em>'s oppressive, almost comically brutal world writ large. Interiors have that unique&nbsp;<em>40k&nbsp;</em>mix of claustrophobia and grandiosity, and when things open up, some of&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s vistas are truly jaw-dropping.</p>
<p>The characters, too, look great. Titus and his Ultramarine compatriots feel like walking suits of armor, tech-priests look appropriately alien, and when Chaos Marines join the fray, the alien otherness of the Immaterium feels genuinely intimidating.</p>
<p>If you love the immersive, grimy maps of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warhammer-40000-chaos-gate-daemonhunters"><em>Warhammer 40k: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters</em></a>, or even the cold industrial environments of something like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warhammer-40000-mechanicus"><em>Mechanicus</em></a>, then you'll likely appreciate what Saber and Focus have done with&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s worlds.</p>
<p>It's a good thing the environments look so pretty, too, because the story that takes place in them is utterly unremarkable and bog-standard. Titus remains a fairly flat and boring protagonist, and the best&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>can manage in terms of character arcs is the old, tired "I have come to trust you as my leader" trope.</p>
<p>To be fair to Saber and Focus, some of that is down to the material. Space Marines aren't exactly the most exciting characters in the&nbsp;<em>40k&nbsp;</em>setting, after all; they're stoic fascist enforcers, so obviously, they're not going to be cracking wise every few minutes.</p>
<p>Still, I feel like&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>is less engaging on this level than its predecessor. That may also be down to&nbsp;the choice of enemies. Tyranids are much less charismatic than Orks, so it's less fun to cut through their ranks.</p>
<p>On that front, there's a very, very cruel tease towards the end of the story that threatens to make things far more interesting, but&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>is over before it can go anywhere with said tease. Better wait for&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 3</em>, I suppose...</p>
<h2>Try Not to Play&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>Alone</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review-chainsword.jpg?itok=3lH5MRiR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review-chainsword.jpg?itok=u8rvSSSx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>wants you to bring your buddies along for the ride.</figcaption></figure><p>Throughout the entirety of&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, I got the sense that Saber and Focus really, really didn't want me to play alone.</p>
<p>The campaign offers support for two extra players who take the roles of Titus' squadmates Gadriel and Chairon, and there are also a range of extra missions designed to fill in some of the gaps in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s story (just six at time of writing, but more are promised).</p>
<p>While the campaign can largely be enjoyed solo, those aforementioned missions pretty much carry the prerequisite of playing with others. It's possible to experience them with bots at your side, but they're clearly designed for multiplayer.</p>
<p><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>positions these missions as optional, but given that they feature entire boss encounters that you won't find in the main campaign, I have a sinking suspicion they were cut from the story in order to shore up the multiplayer offering.</p>
<p>The missions themselves are perfectly fine. They offer more of&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s indiscriminate xenos murder, and there aren't many cutscenes to interrupt the action either.</p>
<p>The aforementioned unique encounters are also great; they play to&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s strengths, although they, too, are better with other players rather than bots.</p>
<p>I'm just not sure how much longevity&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>has as a live service-adjacent game.</p>
<p>Focus and Saber have promised it will feature <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-no-microtransactions">no microtransactions</a>, and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-roadmap">robust roadmap</a> has also been put in place for the next year. Six missions feels a touch paltry, though, and I can see players getting tired of&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s straightforward, no-frills action sooner than the two studios might envisage.</p>
<h2><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review-conversation.jpg?itok=AWZWPyK9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review-conversation.jpg?itok=ieO8nEUh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You're probably not playing&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>for the story.</figcaption></figure><p>Never was a game more appropriately named than&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em>. It feels very much like "another&nbsp;<em>Space Marine&nbsp;</em>game", so if you enjoyed what the first one had to offer, you'll probably get along with this one as well.</p>
<p>That does, however, prompt the question of whether waiting 13 years for something that feels so similar to its predecessor was worth it. I'm a big fan of the first&nbsp;<em>Space Marine</em>, but honestly, I was hoping for a little more movement than this.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>has its thrills. At its best, it's uncomplicated, horde-slaying fun, and it offers a fascinatingly well-rendered look at the&nbsp;<em>40k&nbsp;</em>universe. That may well be enough for you, and if so, you'll find a lot to like here.</p>

And like the last game, you play as Titus, an Ultramarine who, since the events of <em>Space Marine</em>, has been charged with heresy, imprisoned for a century (Space Marines live a long time), and eventually released. He was offered the chance to return to his Ultramarine brothers, but instead punished himself for his mistakes in the first game and joined the Deathwatch. Eventually, he’s forced back into the Ultramarines at the start of <em>Space Marine 2</em>. Here he’s put in charge of two new characters as their squad leader and helps the Imperium of Man push back a deadly alien threat known as the Tyrannids. All the while, Titus’ squad is suspicious of his past, his motives, and his tendency to question leadership.<br></p><p>The main plot of <em>Space Marine 2</em>’s campaign, which will take most players about 10 to 12 hours, is focused on how Titus, his squad, and the Imperium will win the war against the alien invaders and another, worse threat that emerges in the second half of the game. And this aspect of the story is totally serviceable and fine enough. I was curious how things would wrap up and how the heroes would save the day or fail. And if you love <em>Warhammer 40K</em>, there’s probably some neat lore to be found in the campaign, which can be played solo or with two other players.<br></p><p>But rather than all that high-stakes interstellar conflict, it’s actually the story of Titus and his squadmates slowly starting to trust each other and learn from one another that’s the more compelling narrative hook of <em>Space Marine 2</em>. The end of the game, which I won’t spoil, definitely left me wanting more adventures with Titus and his squad and hopefully, we’ll get to play those adventures in the future.<br></p><h2 id="h794865"><a id=""></a><strong>Difficulty problems and awesome guns</strong></h2><p>Between the cutscenes and dialogue is a whole lot of combat and action, which is <em>Space Marine 2</em>’s meat and potatoes. And the good news is <em>Space Marine 2</em> is a joy to play. Like the original game and unlike most modern shooters, <em>Space Marine 2</em> rewards players for being aggressive.<br></p><p>If an enemy damages you, the easiest way to recover is to quickly attack enemies to re-up your health. Wait too long, though, and you’ll have to heal using a medpack. Likewise, you have armor that can be replenished by executing aliens who are staggered or by counter-attacking an enemy. This system rewards you for being aggressive and deadly, which means you’ll quickly start acting like a Space Marine. Well,<em> you might</em>.<br></p><p>My biggest problem with <em>Space Marine 2’</em>s campaign (and the rest of the game) is that some ranged enemies on higher difficulties can become incredibly annoying. These few baddies can single-handedly melt your entire shields away and kill you in a matter of seconds on the game’s Veteran difficulty, which it implies is the best way to play. When I eventually got annoyed by a single, random alien dropping me from halfway across a battlefield, I dropped the difficulty down to normal. And sadly, this sometimes led to fights being too easy.<br></p><p>It’s frustrating that a few enemy types can disrupt <em>Space Marine 2</em>’s difficulty and super warrior fantasy so much. I hope a future patch either gives you a bit more health on Veteran or nerfs some of the ranged attacks so players can actually feel they are a big, hard-to-kill, and aggressive man-tank. For now, I’d recommend playing on normal or hiding behind walls during large fights to avoid alien snipers.<br></p><p>Thankfully, as the game progresses, these ranged enemies become easier to manage as new, less annoying enemies replace them in most fights and you gain access to better weapons. And there are a lot of guns to find and use in <em>Space Marine 2</em>, from fully automatic SMG-like bolt guns to slow and heavy-hitting snipers and even plasma guns, too. Each of these guns feels powerful but different, and offers its own advantages and disadvantages. I appreciated that while playing the campaign, I never felt like <em>Space Marine 2 </em>was forcing me to use a specific weapon. (Outside of one intense sequence involving flamethrowers…)<br></p><p>Oh, and you don’t even have to use guns. <em>Space Marine 2</em> includes a basic but functional melee combat system that lets you block, parry, dodge, and strike enemies either one-on-one or while facing a massive group of baddies. In <em>Space Marine 2</em>, any weapon can get the job done if you use it correctly, so you can choose whichever one you want. It really comes down to your preference. Are you more of a chainsword guy or a melter gun dude? All that matters is you help your fellow soldiers kill thousands of aliens.<br></p><h2 id="h794866"><a id=""></a><strong>So many aliens, so little time</strong></h2><p>And yes, there are thousands of aliens to kill. Thousands. Saber Interactive developed <em>Space Marine 2 </em>and is using its Swarm Engine—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/world-war-z-is-almost-the-left-4-dead-successor-ive-wan-1834174006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/world-war-z-is-almost-the-left-4-dead-successor-ive-wan-1834174006">first seen in <em>World War Z</em></a></span>—to power the<em> W40K</em> sequel. And this engine is really, really good at tossing hundreds of enemies at you at the same time.<br></p><p>Not every single combat encounter in <em>Space Marine 2</em> is a last stand against thousands of insect-like Tyrannid aliens, but there are plenty of these moments and I didn’t mind at all. Mowing down hundreds of aliens climbing up walls and cliffs with a giant automatic bolt gun never gets old.<br></p><p>Later on, when the game’s story shifts and introduces a new enemy to deal with, these large crowd moments become a bit less common and are replaced with more standard third-person shooting action against tanky soldiers. It’s a shame that what might be the most unique quality of <em>Space Marine 2</em>, its massive crowds of deadly aliens, is partially left behind in the second half of the campaign and replaced with more generic shooter combat. Thankfully, the alien crowds made up of hundreds of individual Terrannids trying to rip your face off are a big part of the game’s Operations mode.<br></p><h2 id="h794867"><a id=""></a><strong>The real reason to play Space Marine 2</strong></h2><p>When I wrapped the main campaign of<em> Space Marine 2</em> I found myself disappointed by how little progression there was as I completed missions. You can choose which weapons you start the next level with, but that’s it. No skills trees, no upgrades, and no perks. None of that. Don’t worry, though, because all of that stuff and more is in Operations, which is basically a separate game attached to <em>Space Marine 2</em>. In fact, I’d argue the best part of <em>Space Marine 2</em> is not its heavily advertised campaign but instead this great multiplayer mode.<br></p><p>The Operations mode is connected to the main story of <em>Space Marine 2</em>, letting you see how some missions were completed while Titus and his squad were off doing something else. And like the campaign, Operations is an action-packed third-person shooter built around completely linear levels, which you play either alone or with two other players.<br></p><p>However, in Operations, you pick a class of Space Marine—each with their own unique abilities—and create loadouts that you can swap between at certain points in missions. These loadouts are made up of weapons that you can upgrade over time, making them deal more damage, fire faster, or hold more ammo. Eventually, you can even unlock weapon variants that look cooler and have their own special stats. Similarly, as you complete missions and earn XP, you level up your Space Marine and get access to new skills and perks via a skill tree as well as the ability to fully customize your soldier.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="a11396188244f6b9beddcb2eb23d2659" data-recommend-id="image://a11396188244f6b9beddcb2eb23d2659" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image shows how you can customize your Space Marine.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you are someone who loves painting actual <em>Warhammer 40K </em>figurines, then the customization options in <em>Space Marine 2 </em>are going to make you drool and you’ll likely grind away in the various missions just to earn resources to unlock more paint jobs and patterns.<br></p><p>There’s a lot to Operations and after playing for a few hours I came away impressed. My only concern is that this mode lives or dies based on how much new content is added to it over time. Sure, for now, the eight missions you can play and replay are fun enough, but three months from now will I still want to play the same levels over and over again? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-road-map-free-content-new-missions-modes-1851633332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-road-map-free-content-new-missions-modes-1851633332">Saber Interactive has already promised</a></span> new missions, weapons, and enemies are coming to Operations over the next 12 months, so hopefully this already content-stuffed mode will only grow more. If that’s the case, it’s likely that a year or two from now I’ll still be playing <em>Space Marine 2</em>’s Ops mode either alone or with random players via matchmaking.<br></p><p>There’s also a PvP mode in <em>Space Marine 2</em>, which I didn’t get much time with but also didn’t seem like the thing I’d care about in this kind of game. It works and maybe you’ll dig it, but to me the moment everyone is a big Space Marine, the combat stops feeling special and starts playing more like a so-so <em>Gears of Wa</em>r knockoff. I’m far more interested in co-op action and fighting off massive waves of enemies, so I’m more excited for the already-announced horde mode to be added in 2025.<br></p><p><em>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</em> is a surprisingly big game. It features a robust and well-made blockbuster campaign that is only held back by some difficulty balancing issues, a really awesome and in-depth co-op PvE mode that offers a lot of replayability, and a PvP mode that is fine and might be fun for some. The complete package is very enticing and I think that, even with some of its flaws and some minor performance issues on console, <em>Space Marine 2 </em>is probably the best <em>Warhammer 40K </em>game ever made. <br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The popular tech stock, NVIDIA ($NVDA), suffered its largest drop in a single day, losing $279 billion. While this is a massive loss for the company, it helps to put Microsoft in a winning position for the <em>market cap crown</em> as the two continuously battle it out. </p>



<h2 id="h-nvidia-is-taking-a-huge-loss-why">NVIDIA Is Taking A Huge Loss… Why?</h2>



<p>It would seem as if NVIDIA is facing an immense loss, as the company reportedly also lost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-lost-500-billion-three-days/">$500 billion over just three days</a> back in June. At the time, that news didn’t, by any means, even put a dent in the company, as they were declared the world’s biggest company by market capitalization earlier this year.</p>



<p>But the losses seem to keep coming. Why?</p>



<p>Well, for one, the hype around AI is starting to die down. At one point, AI was the biggest topic in the world. And while it is still in discussion, many are starting to suspect the stock hype around it to lack any real substance. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>With the company constantly making high-end GPUs, many other companies and tech enthusiasts were excited about the future of AI. But just this week, reports surfaced that OpenAI is seeking additional investments from major tech companies in hopes of staying afloat. </p>



<p>It would seem as if ChatGPT’s worth was never raised above being anything but a search engine. </p>



<p>Microsoft even took a hit when it came to the realm of AI, as the company’s Windows Recall AI feature was deemed a “privacy nightmare” by many. </p>



<h2 id="h-rumors-surfaces-regarding-nvidia-and-us-department-of-justice">Rumors Surfaces Regarding NVIDIA And US Department Of Justice</h2>



<p>A recent rumor also surfaced online regarding NIVIDA and the US Department of Justice. Supposedly, the government organization has issued a subpoena to NVIDIA. Nothing has been confirmed, but many speculate it is on anti-trust grounds.</p>



<p>So, what does this mean for the future of NVIDIA? More importantly, what does this mean for the future of tech?</p>

                <p>Acer unveiled several new laptops this week during a press event at IFA Berlin, but the most interesting hardware it unveiled is a conceptual one. The company posted a short trailer for what it calls Acer Project DualPlay: a gaming laptop that comes with its own detachable controller.</p><p>Similar to how the Joy-Cons detach from a Switch console, the controller can be easily popped out of the laptop--as demonstrated in the video below--and separated from the cradle for when you want to do so co-op gaming. The controller forms part of the underside of the trackpad when inserted back into place, and the laptop also features pop-up speakers on the side.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI2fyCh6KNo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vI2fyCh6KNo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The obvious benefit to this idea is that it gives a user less hardware to carry about with them, as most controllers can take up a fair amount of space due to their design. Acer says the controller on its DualPlay concept can be quickly detached from its electromagnetic lock by placing two fingers on the release button located on top of the keyboard, so it should be a secure fit for when you're doing non-gaming tasks on the laptop.</p><p>It also has quite a lot of RGB lighting, because nothing says gaming hardware like a constant flow of rainbow lights around the chassis of a device. For now, the DualPlay remains an idea with a snazzy trailer. It's not clear if Acer will ever put it into full production, and right now, it has several other gaming laptops coming out soon in its Predator and Orion lines. On top of that, the company also revealed several new gaming monitors and its first entry into the handheld gaming PC space.</p><p>The Acer Nitro Blaze 7 looks like an interesting alternative to the bulkier <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-review-redefinition/1100-6500986/" data-ref-id="1100-6500986">Steam Deck</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-plans-to-release-a-second-gen-rog-ally-later-this-year/1100-6520628/" data-ref-id="1100-6520628">Asus ROG Ally</a> models on the market, as it measures 25.6cm in width, 11.3 cm in depth, and 2.25cm in height. Internally, it's packing a Ryzen 7 8840HS chipset, 16GB of RAM, and a 1080p 144hz display.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235365/acer-ifa-2024-project-dualplay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Out of all the new laptops Acer announced at IFA today, <a href="https://news.acer.com/project-dualplay-novel-gaming-laptop-concept-with-detachable-controllers-for-dual-player-experiences">Project DualPlay</a> pops out the most. It’s a concept laptop that Acer says gives gamers more ways to play on the go, but looking at the design, I’m not sure which gamers it’s talking about.</p><p>For Project DualPlay, Acer took its Predator gaming laptop and added a cutout beneath the keyboard to hold its custom gaming controller face-down. The back of the controller doubles as the laptop’s trackpad. A button at the top of the keyboard releases the controller and causes two 5W speakers to pop out from the sides of the laptop. The controller can be further separated into two gamepads, Nintendo Switch-style. </p><p>Acer’s press release says Project DualPlay lets a second person join you just as easily as detaching the controller.<em> Street Fighter 6 </em>is called out specifically as well as first-person shooters, though the latter only makes sense if the game supports split-screen play. You can also just use it for single-player games, of course.</p><div><figcaption><em>Acer’s Project DualPlay gaming laptop concept.</em></figcaption> <p><cite><em>Image: Acer</em></cite></p></div><p>Unfortunately, we didn’t get to see Acer’s concept in person at IFA, so that leaves me with a few questions. Mostly: is the controller any good? If a second person is using the controller, how pleasant is it to game on a laptop with a gaping hole where the trackpad should be? </p><p>None of the press photos show someone using the laptop with the controller removed. </p><p>Plenty of PC games have controller support, and many people prefer using a controller over a mouse and keyboard. So there’s something to be said for having a controller that fits right into your laptop rather than having to cart one around.</p><p>Project DualPlay is just a concept for now. But how much extra would you pay for a laptop with the controller built right in?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Warner Bros have released the first trailer for Vertigo and Legendary's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> movie, the long-awaited or possibly, long-dreaded adaptation of Mojang's industry-straddling block-builder. Quick disclosure: I worked with Mojang and Microsoft on a book about Minecraft's first 15 years, shortly before joining Rock Paper Shotgun. As such, I am now obliged by the eternal laws of journalistic accountability to state that anything Minecraft-related is rubbish. But even if that weren't the case, I would describe this as pretty dismal.</p><!--more-->

<p>It's partly Hollywood-trailer-itis - they're doing that condescending thing where they slap a bass drop or local equivalent on every punchline - but it's mostly that they've monstered Minecraft's matchless visual direction, with a photorealistic spin on the original block aesthetic which makes me think of those fan mods that insist on forcing ray-tracing and hair physics into a game that is famously low-tech and simple.</p>
<p>I'm sure the film's visual direction represents many hours of skilled labour, and I empathise for the artists who are now reading the Youtube comments, but it all just seems so unnecessary. The original Minecraft didn't make waves because you could see your reflection in every Piglin's eyeball. I'm not sure it'll be "more appealing to a mainstream audience", either - if you've never played Minecraft, I suspect this will seem very disposable, another matinee CGI fest among many, but with a strange emphasis on right angles. Imagine if they'd taken a few cues from the LEGO movies or even the Spider-Verse films, and folded in different aesthetics from all across Minecraft's evolution in the hands of developers and players.</p>
<p>The cast includes Emma Myers from Addams Family spin-off Wednesday,  Danielle Brooks from The Colour Purple, Jason Momoa playing Jason Momoa But Comically Non-Macho, and Jack Black playing Steve, Minecraft's OG default character. I don't have any particular strong feelings about how Steve should be portrayed, but I am quite tired of Jack Black being Jack Black. They should have cast him as a Creeper. Anyway, here's some blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn't just help you craft, it's essential to one's survival! Four misfits--Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)--find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they'll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative...the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world."</p></blockquote>
<p>The Minecraft movie was announced in 2014, and has been through several rewrites and changes of project leadership. Like many Hollywood productions, it also saw delays during the pandemic lockdowns. It'll hit cinemas next year. I'm morbidly interested to hear about how they worked out the visual direction, but I don't think I'll be buying a ticket.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sektors-mortal-kombat-1-fatality-channels-marvels-iron-man-heads-out-of-this-world<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> developer NetherRealm has released a gameplay trailer for upcoming DLC character Sektor, showing off her Fatality and Animality.</p><p>Sektor arrives as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion for Mortal Kombat 1, the latest game in the gory fighting game franchise that's sold over four million copies. The expansion adds new story mode chapters available from September 24, along with Kombat Pack 2, which itself includes six new DLC characters: Cyrax, Sektor, and Noob Saibot (available on September 24), and guest fighters Ghostface (Scream franchise), T-1000 (Terminator 2: Judgement Day), and Conan the Barbarian (post-launch release timing to be announced at a later date).</p><p>It’s Sektor who is the focus for this new gameplay video, though. It shows off the character’s abilities and moveset (flamethrower, missile strikes, and rocket thrusters for enhanced movement and hovering ability), and clips of cutscenes that shine a light on the story fans can expect.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here’s the set-up, courtesy of publisher Warner Bros. Games:</p><blockquote>In Fire God Liu Kang’s New Era, Sektor grew up immersed in Lin Kuei culture – her father was its master armorer, and her mother was a leading warrior. This vast knowledge of weaponry and formidable martial skills passed down from her parents make Sektor a kombatant like no other. Sensing a kindred spirit, Sub-Zero shared with her his grand vision for the Lin Kuei's future and chose her to become his most trusted lieutenant. Now Sektor will force the Lin Kuei to evolve and those who cannot change will be eliminated.</blockquote><p>The highlight of the video, though, is a look at one of Sektor’s Fatalities. Here, Sektor channels Marvel’s Iron Man, complete with cool sci-fi in-suit headshot, as she drags her hapless opponent into orbit before heading back, their body burning up on re-entry.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/04/mk-main-1725458259235.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Sektor's Fatality in Mortal Kombat 1 has big Iron Man vibes.</figcaption></figure></output><p>NetherRealm, of course, is no stranger to the superhero genre via its Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe crossover fighting game franchise. We haven't seen a new game in that series for some time — perhaps it's time for a return, with James Gunn's new DCU set to kick off soon.</p><p>Meanwhile, the video also teases Sektor’s Animality, the finishing move that lets her to morph into a rhinoceros. Animalities are part of a free update for all Mortal Kombat 1 owners set to go live alongside Khaos Reigns on September 24.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

			<p>Today, Warner Bros. Games released a brand-new trailer for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-announces-mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns/">Khaos Reigns update</a> for Mortal Kombat 1, which showcases Sektor, one of the upcoming fighters. Sektor is one of six playable characters that will be added to the game with the new expansion, with the trailer showcasing Sektor's moveset and abilities as well as Sektor's story in Mortal Kombat 1.</p>
<p>In this new trailer, we get to see Sektor's deadly weaponry and her expertise in utilizing them, such as the capability to use a flamethrower, missile strikes and even rocket thrusters to demolish her opponent. Specifically, the rocket thrusters can provide Sektor with extra mobility, allowing her a few seconds in the air to attack while hovering. This short trailer also showcases the upcoming addition of Animalities, explicitly showing Sektor's animality in Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns.</p>
<p>Compared to some other characters in Mortal Kombat 1, Sektor's fatality is rather tame. While she is still seen to be breaking the bones of her opponent, there isn't as much gore and viscera as there is with other characters, such as Scorpion or Mileena, for example.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns – Official Sektor Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/plWgLXmsRpI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The trailer is three minutes long, giving players a glimpse into her combat style as well as the story of her involvement in the Lin Kuei culture. Both her mother and father were crucial members of the Fire God Liu Kang's New Era, being a warrior and master armorer, respectively. Having both of them as assets in her life helped her become the intense and fiery warrior that she is today, with skills passed down from both parents.</p>
<p>The three-minute trailer shows Sektor's animality, where she can transform into a rhinoceros to gore her opponent and finish them off for good. While Khaos Reigns is a paid update for Mortal Kombat 1, the addition of Animalities is not and will be free to access for all players who want to use them.</p>
<p>Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns will be available on September 24, 2024. With this comes the release of Sektor and the free update of Animalities for all players to access, regardless of whether they own Khaos Reigns or not. The update will be released digitally at 8 AM PDT / 10 AM CDT / 11 AM EDT for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Those <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3134000/Mortal_Kombat_1_Khaos_Reigns_Bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who pre-order</a> the new expansion will get four new skins based on previous classic aesthetics, such as Wedding Scorpion, Empress Mileena, and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 versions of Noob Saibot and Sub-Zero.</p>

<p>Coming from Japanese indie developer Toroya My Battery Is Fried, <em>Death the Guitar</em>&nbsp;features a simple, sort-of two-tone graphic style. Yet, it drips with style and creativity. It's a 2D platformer that asks you to clear room after room using the power of rock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you complete a stage, you’re graded by your time and number of deaths, making this a pretty speedrun-friendly game. However, casual platformer fans will also find this game to be in tune with them.</p>

<p>Much like <em>Hotline Miami</em> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/katana-zero-review-zero-to-hero"><em>Katana Zero</em></a>, Death the Guitar is a one-touch, one-kill sort of game. It raises the stakes, but it also pushes you into finding the most efficient route to clear a level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I played two separate preview builds over the summer, and so far, the controls are simple. You can jump and attack with a chord, and at some point, you can equip a special ability, like one that boosts you forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The magic in the game is how your jump and chord affects the world around you. Throughout each level, there are amps. Jumping off an amp gives you more height and an electrified aura to hurt enemies.</p>
<p>Attacking, on the other hand, boosts you forward, destroying enemies and glass walls in your way (not to be confused with the special ability boost, which can be done any time as long as it’s ready).</p>

<p>Amps aren’t the only thing you can interact with, though. Attacking a switch attached to a pulley lets you lower or raise amps, acting both as a platform and a means to crush enemies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, certain kinds of ground are shockable, meaning if you hit it with your attack, a shockwave will travel across. It’s a useful way to kill enemies from afar or below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, these different tools give you just enough options to figure out optimal strategies and paths for each room. As you run through a level, you’ll find all sorts of options to shred enemies with sound.</p>

<p>If you get hit once, you’re sent back to the start of the room, but it’s not as unforgiving as that sounds. These rooms are quick and breezy. After all, practice makes perfect, as any good rockstar knows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest demo I played at PAX West culminated with a boss fight that taught me which basic attack does the most damage (spoiler alert, it’s the forward dash off an amp).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It felt like a classic boss in a 2D platformer like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sonic-mania-review-breaking-cycle">Sonic</a> </em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/mega-man-legacy-collection-review-fun-trip-down-memory-lane"><em>Mega Man</em></a>, where you have to dodge some telegraphed but quick attacks while finding time to get your own hits in. It’s the sort of thing where on your first try, it might take a couple lives. But if you practice it, you can probably do a no-hit sub-30 clear easy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m realizing I gravitated toward a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/chainstaff-preview-bony-grappling-hook-we-deserve">lot of platformers</a> this PAX West, but <em>Death the Guitar</em> made my heart pump the most. Maybe it was because I wanted to get on the time leaderboard on the show floor, or maybe it was the pressure of the people behind me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either way, I’ll be looking forward to <em>Death the Guitar</em>’s eventual release, which is scheduled for some time in 2025.&nbsp;</p>
