"The parties are continuing negotiations at this time, but remain far apart on resolution of necessary terms covering critical A.I. protections for video game performers."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Crabtree-Ireland said SAG-AFTRA's resolve remains "unwavering" and "should not be tested" by employers. "Our membership voted more than 98 percent 'yes' to authorize a strike of this contract should the employers not come to the table with a deal that includes our critical provisions–especially in AI," said the chief negotiator.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We are steadfast in our commitment to our membership who work this contract and whose extraordinary performances are the heart and soul of the world’s most popular video games.

Commenting on the likelihood of strike action at the time, Crabtree-Ireland said members were "done being exploited" and wouldn't hesitate to down tools.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/22/the-tesla-cybertruck-will-be-added-to-fortnite-tomorrow<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>On an almost weekly basis, Fortnite announces new crossover events, adding characters to its Battle Royale, Lego, and Festival modes. Whether it's a fictional character like Jack Sparrow or a real person like Ariana Grande, it's hard to find a corner of pop culture the game hasn't touched. These crossovers, however, are almost always exclusive to characters, but Fortnite players don't always have to traverse the Battle Royale map on foot – there are vehicles as well. Today's crossover comes in the form of a particularly polygonal vehicle: Tesla's Cybertruck.</p>



<p>For the unfamiliar, the Cybertruck is one of Tesla's latest electric vehicles, a futuristic-looking pickup truck with a distinct shape and stainless steel exterior. It's a vehicle that, quite frankly, always looked like it belonged in a video game, both because of its angular aesthetic and the word "cyber" in its name.</p>

<p>It's unclear exactly how the truck will be present in Fortnite, as the trailer doesn't include any actual gameplay, but it's likely a vehicle skin that can be purchased from the in-game store. With car skins attached, whenever a player enters a vehicle, it will morph into the selected skin of their choice, and it's available in Battle Royale and Rocket Racing alike. This is purely speculation, however – it's equally possible the vehicle is introduced in some other limited-time event.</p>

<p>The Cybertruck will be added to Fortnite tomorrow. If you drive one, just pray your opposing players <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udxR5rBq_Vg">aren't wielding a steel ball</a>.</p>

The mainstay villain has apparently survived his presumed death (again) and is ready to reclaim his throne.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A cinematic trailer rolls out the red carpet for Heihachi, setting up his return after he was seemingly killed (i.e., tossed into a volcanic lava river) in Tekken 7. The video doesn’t explain how Heihachi managed not to melt into goop, but he does sport a Kazuya-esque scar on his chest now, so he didn’t walk away completely unscathed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QZWDIKKvNrc" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Heihachi becomes available sometime this fall. He follows<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/01/15/eddy-gordo-is-tekken-8s-first-dlc-fighter-opening-cinematic-released"> Eddy Gordo</a> and <a href="http://sobieska/">Lidia Sobieska</a>, who joined Tekken 8 in the spring and summer, respectively, leaving one fighter left for the winter season. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions automatically receive these fighters, and each can also be purchased individually for $7.99.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elon-musks-tesla-cybertruck-will-be-available-to-buy-in-fortnite.933579/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/elon-musks-tesla-cybertruck-will-be-available-to-buy-in-fortnite<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
The Tesla Cybertruck is set to make its official video game debut tomorrow, in Fortnite. 
</p>
<p>
Many other games have featured <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>'s wheels before - but only via unofficial mods. The Cybertruck has been added by fans into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/of-course-the-cybertrucks-been-modded-into-gta-5">Cyberpunk 2077, Rocket League, GoldenEye 007, and even Minecraft</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Now, it's set to be ownable in a video game for real - years after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elon-musks-new-truck-looks-like-a-low-poly-90s-game-and-the-memes-are-rolling-in">memes spread online suggesting the Cybertruck looked like a PlayStation 1-era vehicle</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today, developer Epic Games shared a trailer featuring Fortnite mascot Fishstick riding in a Cybertruck and pulling what I can only presume is meant to be an attractive face, blowing a kiss towards the camera. You can watch it below.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
The trailer is a nod to an official Tesla video of a Cybertruck in a tug-of-war with a Ford 4x4 (Tesla's original video shows the Cybertruck winning, though Ford said Tesla cheated and asked for a rematch). 
</p>
<p>
I imagine there will be some delighted that this silly-looking car is now available to buy, alongside so many other things, in Fortnite. But I also imagine some will baulk at the idea of handing over money, via Fortnite, to Elon Musk - who last week loudly backed the re-election of President Trump and pledged to donate $45m a month to his campaign. 
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté said he had to take "a step back" rather than immediately respond to Musk's online criticism</a> of the fact you play as real-life Black samurai Yasuke in upcoming game Shadows.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> has reinstated former President Donald Trump's account, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-bans-trump-for-good-promises-further-policy-changes">permanent ban in 2021</a> following the storming of the US Capitol building.

</p>
<p>
It's unclear if this was specifically requested by the Trump campaign team. Eurogamer was provided the following statement from a Twitch spokesperson:
</p>
<p>
"We reinstated former President Trump's Twitch channel," it reads. "We believe there is value in hearing from Presidential nominees directly, when possible. Trump is now the official Republican nominee for US president."
</p>

<p>
Further, Twitch has made it clear the same community guidelines apply to public figures.
</p>
<p>
"We continue to enforce our Community Guidelines and take necessary enforcement action when we identify violations of our rules," the statement continues. "Twitch doesn't have a 'public figure policy', meaning all channels are equally subject to our guidelines, regardless of whether the channel belongs to a public figure."
</p>
<p>
Twitch banned Trump's account "due to the ongoing risk of further incitement of violence," it said at the time. "The President's statements continue to be interpreted as calls to action, and we are taking this action to remove the potential for harm to our community and the general public."
</p>
<p>
While news of the reinstatement broke over the weekend (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/streaming/twitch-unbans-donald-trump-we-believe-there-is-value-in-hearing-from-presidential-nominees-directly/">PC Gamer</a>) and Trump's account had not been updated, now it includes a live broadcast from Michigan and a 2024 campaign banner image.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en_US">Twitch's community guidelines</a> have clear rules on hateful conduct: "Twitch does not permit behaviour that is motivated by hatred, prejudice or intolerance, including behaviour that promotes or encourages discrimination, denigration, harassment, or violence based on the following protected characteristics: race, ethnicity, colour, caste, national origin, immigration status, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, serious medical condition, and veteran status."

</p>
<p>
It also includes rules on breaking the law and off-service conduct - it's the latter that came into play for Trump's previous ban. "Twitch has clear rules that prohibit hateful conduct, harassment, or incitement of violence on our service, and we consider off-service events when making enforcement decisions," said Twitch in 2021 following Trump's ban.
</p>
<p>
Since the news broke of Trump's account being reinstated, contributions to Team Kennedy by Twitch CEO Dan Clancy have been discovered. Robert F Kennedy Jr is an anti-vaccine activist who was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-56021904">banned from Instagram in 2021 for spreading misinformation</a>.

</p>
<p>
Clancy has responded, stating it was his wife who made the donation. "Not quite sure why it comes across in my name," he said. "Don't take me saying this as being negative about Robert Kennedy but don't take this donation as me being a fan either."
</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Lol. But somebody's figuring out what political donations have come from my family  I did not know this till I read it here. </p><p>My wife must have made this donation. Not quite sure why it comes across in my name </p><p>Don't take me saying this as being negative about Robert Kennedy…</p></div>— Daniel Clancy (@djclancy999) <a href="https://twitter.com/djclancy999/status/1814525958885679484?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
He then followed up: "By the way, if you're curious about my political views, feel free to ask on my next live stream. Happy to share!" His <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/djclancy/schedule">Twitch stream schedule</a> is currently blank.

</p>
<p>
Twitch has been marred by scandal in recent weeks, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">high-profile streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm admitted</a> he was permanently banned from the platform in 2020 after exchanging "messages with an individual minor back in 2017" that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate".

			<p>Stardew Valley is an indie game that took the world by storm. Just one person, ConcernedApe, created it. While working on Haunted Chocolatier, he continues to release consistent updates for Stardew Valley across all platforms. The latest major update was uploaded for the game's PC version in March 2024, with players on other platforms still waiting to release 1.6.</p>
<p>As players eagerly await the news of when the 1.6 update for Stardew Valley will come to other platforms, <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1815272546130161821" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ConcernedApe has released a small statement on X</a> to reassure fans that it is still a work in progress.</p>
<p>"The ports and the next PC update are still in progress. I know it's taking a long time; it's on my mind every minute. I have personally been working on the mobile port every day. I will announce when I have any meaningful news." Most of the fan base supported this and appreciated his efforts.</p>
<p>Some players in the thread had a few additional questions they wanted answered from ConcernedApe. A discussion regarding free DLC and updates was initiated when someone tweeted in response to his statement asking about pricing. In the replies, the developer said they will "never charge money for an update or a DLC as long as I live." They also joke that they could "screencap this and shame me if I ever violate this oath."</p>
<p>Stardew Valley has been a massive addition to the cozy game genre, with many people loving the game and finding it easy to sink hundreds of hours into it. While it may look like a simple farming game, there are plenty of quests, mini-games, and stories to hear and unlock as you progress through the game.</p>
<p>This farming game is so popular that it received an orchestral performance that traveled worldwide for fans to experience live in concert. The developer has spoken out at events regarding how well Stardew Valley has done over the years.</p>
<p>Stardew Valley has officially sold over 30 million copies as of February 2024 and hit a milestone with a brand-new all-time player count with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/massive-stardew-valley-update-1-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release of the 1.6 update</a>.&nbsp;With the potential for more updates on the horizon, Stardew Valley could soar to new heights thanks to the creativity of ConcernedApe.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/f1-manager-2024-review.933561/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-manager-2024-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I’ll admit that I generally prefer to have direct control in racing games, but the F1 Manager series has made me equally excited to work behind the scenes. Watching a risky overtake pay off from the pit wall can be similarly thrilling to burning that rubber yourself, and a focus on team development and overall strategy between races can be refreshing. While F1 Manager 2024 is your typical annual update in many respects, content to make incremental improvements over massive changes, several of those tweaks leave developer Frontier's latest management sim more compelling than ever.</p><p>This year's biggest addition is the new 'Create a Team' feature, which offers a pleasantly surprising range of customization options. For example, different engine manufacturers add necessary strategy, asking you to pick your priorities between aspects like durability or fuel efficiency. Liveries and team outfits can also be customized in detail, with a nice assortment of preset designs that are useful for the less artistically gifted like myself. But one of the most interesting decisions is how you can set your team's backstory, which determines your overall goals. You could choose to be the small team with solid expertise but low funding, or the hungry newcomers determined to win at all costs, or plenty more. These options realistically impact your overall chances, and if you'd rather start entirely on your own terms instead, you can thankfully ignore them, too. </p><p>I appreciate how granular F1 Manager 2024's difficulty is when creating your team without selecting an origin. Different initial budgets, car performance settings, and facility qualities let you choose between starting near the front or rising from backmarkers to eventual champions. Of course, you can't set every facility to five stars immediately, which still keeps things balanced. There's a hard limit for improvement points, too, so choosing between improved race performance, manufacturing speed for car parts, or even the HQ's helipad provides welcome depth.</p><p>In previous games, choosing a constructor was effectively a silent difficulty setting since a team’s performance in-game matched that of their real-life counterpart. That made choosing midfield contenders like Alpine more appealing when I sought a challenge. Securing wins is always exciting, but spending time upgrading your team to earn them yourself feels infinitely better than being gift-wrapped victory simply by picking Red Bull. I'm also pleased that F1 Manager 2024 retains 2023's post-launch <a href="https://www.f1manager.com/2023/news/f1r-manager-23-new-difficulty-options-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>difficulty settings</u></a> for race days and your opponents' car development, making more teams immediately viable.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>F1 Manager has never felt too heavy on micromanagement, and that’s especially true with the slightly improved UI this year. </p></div><p>Selecting the 'Your Story' origin in Create A Team lets you customize the initial team quality, and there's no restrictions on which drivers and staff you pick. In a year where the driver line-up is almost identical to the previous season, adding an 11th team that can sign existing Formula 1 drivers (or even F2 and F3 rookies) shakes this dynamic up nicely. Rather than choose Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc immediately, I ultimately signed Nico Hulkenberg and Yuki Tsunoda, intent on securing their first podium finishes.</p><p>F1 Manager has never felt too heavy on micromanagement, and that’s especially true with the slightly improved UI this year. Once everything's set up, a new season with your custom team is otherwise similar to a standard campaign, which isn’t a bad thing. You still need to guide the team's overall focus, instructing engineers to create upgrades for this year's car along the way. However, because each year brings new regulations, you face a choice: Do you keep improving this year's car or invest in research for next season? Striking a balance remains rewarding when you succeed, and the cost cap ensures you can't just throw money around to solve every problem. And once a season is complete, the board measures your performance against its expectations, and the cycle repeats into the new year, so there’s always a drive to keep going.</p><p>Keeping staff spirits high remains essential, and F1 Manager 2024 uses a new 'Mentality System,' highlighting the team's overall mood instead of individual staff and drivers. It's a slight improvement over the previous confidence system, offering a more practical approach that immediately details the most pressing issues. Pit crews retain 23's monthly training regimes, and it’s still fun to balance improving pit times and avoiding fatigue by pushing them too hard. After all, a rested crew is less likely to make mistakes during critical pit stops.</p><p>I'm less impressed by the contracts system, and as team principal, you’ll have to interact with it a lot as you negotiate contract extensions with existing staff or sign new talent. It's a tedious process because asking the person you want to sign a contract immediately, as opposed to giving them a week or two to decide, negatively impacts negotiations. For example, trying to sign Tsunoda to Red Bull saw him reply after two weeks of waiting, only for him to counter offer saying he wanted an extra $7k on the existing $3.5 million salary offer. It remains a frustratingly drawn-out process, and Yuki wasn't the only person losing patience during renegotiations.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's great to see F1 Manager 2024 use a more dynamic sponsorship system.</p></div><p>Extra cash was previously earned by choosing optional performance targets from sponsors before races, like reaching Q2 in qualifying. You couldn't set deals until your second season, so it's great to see F1 Manager 2024 use a more dynamic sponsorship system. Title sponsors award more tangible benefits, and your earnings now depend on your confidence. Weighing a hefty upfront payment with minimal payouts for race day results against the opposite offer can be a satisfying risk vs reward situation. Each main sponsor requests various "engagement activities" every six weeks, offering financial rewards but causing issues like reduced driver performance. It's a welcome change that better reflects the sport's heavily commercialized nature.</p><p>Race weekends follow the real-life format, usually splitting your time between three practice sessions, the qualifier, and finally the main race. Six weekends out of each year also include an enjoyably straightforward sprint race where you don't need to worry about considerations like long-term tyre strategies. While F1 Manager 23 followed the 2022 season's rules, F1 Manager 2024 now uses a less than thrilling sprint qualifying approach split into three sessions before those races. I can't fault Frontier for following the current real-life structure; the extra work is just a hassle for comparatively few points when measured against the main race.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>F1 Manager 2024 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>I'm therefore glad that F1 Manager 2024 allows you to skip the actual races by letting the team automatically handle them, a feature that was previously only available for practice sessions and qualifiers. I can't always recommend doing that when you'll generally get the best performance via manual control, and rushing through the campaign would be missing the point, but at least having the option may be a blessing if you're on your sixth campaign and facing the opening race in Bahrain yet again.</p><p>Most of the time, of course, F1 Manager values confident strategies, and racing involves managing three critical areas from the pit wall: tyres, fuel, and the battery. Good tyre strategy can determine races, so it's pleasing when your decisions about which two dry tyre compounds to use before the final lap pay off. Tyre degradation feels similar to last year, and ordering drivers to speed up is another tricky choice to make since doing so affects the temperature and how quickly you burn through them. Electric boosts via ERS (Energy Recovery System) can close some critical gaps with opponents, though letting this completely drain comes with risks of its own as it makes you vulnerable to being overtaken.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Themechanical failure system immediately feels right at home.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Fuel consumption also needs monitoring, but one of this year's significant changes involves preventing your engine from overheating to preserve its long-term durability. You can only buy so many engines per year and extra unit costs are steep, even before incurring a subsequent grid penalty for using extra parts. Those penalties can feel harsh when you're already pushing for every point available, so getting through a season with minimal purchases feels like an accomplishment.</p><p>Overheating also ties into a compelling new mechanical failure system. TV broadcast-style replays will point out mechanical faults but rarely indicate what the actual problem is – that seemed slightly pointless beyond informing me of who's got issues, but I enjoyed this challenge overall. Just like the real thing, some faults need mitigating mid-race by requesting that your drivers follow specific tactics, such as avoiding high-risk kerbs and driving in clean air. I never really noticed this system’s absence until now, and it immediately feels right at home. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Henry Stockdale's Favorite Racing Games</h3><p>If you prefer going beyond the pit wall, there's plenty of great choices elsewhere.</p></div><p>Accidents also seem slightly more realistic, though not majorly. Incidents that would normally finish a driver's race in real life often wouldn't retire cars in previous entries – this issue hasn't entirely disappeared here, but it was less frequent during my latest campaigns. The visible damage to cars during collisions could also still benefit from looking more realistic, as heavy impacts rarely show more than some scattered debris.</p><p>Finally, if you're after something different, race replays return once more. They usually involve improving on your chosen team's real-life results compared to what happened in the actual race, which is fine, but the more specialized events keep this interesting with less realistic scenarios – things like having equal performance settings for each team. What's really fun are the events that challenge your strategic thinking even further, like figuring out how to guide Ferrari to victory in Italy despite a mechanical fault near the end.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-dlc-heihachi</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/heihachi-mishima-comes-to-tekken-8-as-dlc-this-fall.933546/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-dlc-heihachi<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The next&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>DLC character has been revealed, and it's none other than Mishima family patriarch and all-around maniac Heihachi Mishima, who's been with the series since its very first installment.</p>
<p>Heihachi will arrive sometime this fall as&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s third DLC fighter, joining previous additions <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-eddy-gordo-release-date">Eddy Gordo</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-lidia-release-date">Lidia Sobieska</a>, who were added to the roster in spring and summer respectively.</p>
<p>Following that, one more DLC character will arrive, although we don't know who it's going to be yet. Unlike other fighting games,&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>hasn't even given its last DLC fighter a silhouette, so we can't make any educated guesses either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tekken-8-heihachi-fire.jpg?itok=A8UROApR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tekken-8-heihachi-fire.jpg?itok=AguhvCzQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Heihachi is back in&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>, and he's not best pleased.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've played the story mode for&nbsp;<em>Tekken 7</em>, then you'd be forgiven for thinking that Heihachi's return in this game was an impossibility, but his trailer does sort of address that issue.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: at the end of&nbsp;<em>Tekken 7</em>, having been defeated once and for all by Kazuya, Heihachi's body is tossed into a volcano. At the end of his&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>introduction trailer, though, we see him standing amidst the fire and brimstone of said volcano, laughing maniacally.</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear how Heihachi survived his fight with Kazuya, but it's likely that the free story expansion announced at Evo this weekend will explain that, and it'll also likely find a way to integrate Heihachi (who's a pretty key character in the&nbsp;<em>Tekken&nbsp;</em>mythos) into&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s story.</p>
<p>You can check out Heihachi's&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>trailer right here. It doesn't give anything away regarding his fighting style; we'll have to wait for his character trailer for that.</p>

<p><em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>is, as you might already have guessed, the eighth mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>Tekken&nbsp;</em>fighting series.</p>
<p>Its roster features heavyweights like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-paul-phoenix-gameplay-trailer-brings-back-fan-favorite">Paul Phoenix</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-reveals-nina-williams-gameplay-and-in-depth-mechanics-explanation">Nina Williams</a>, and King, as well as new faces like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-victor-chevalier-reveal">Victor Chevalier</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-reveals-new-character-reina">Reina</a>, many of whom appear across an epic story mode that focuses on the conflict between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-kazuya-gameplay-trailer-shows-bone-crunching-combos">Kazuya Mishima</a> and his son <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-tekken-8-gameplay-trailer-reveals-jin-kazama-in-action">Jin Kazama</a>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3OKTfZS5qE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new cinematic trailer</a> today, the official Fortnite socials confirmed that the Tesla Cybertruck will release tomorrow. </p>



<p>The trailer didn’t showcase any gameplay. However, it did offer a clear look at the Cybertruck’s official in-game look, as it tows along some heavy vehicles.</p>



<p>The new trailer clarifies that “some optional content requires purchase and/or gameplay to unlock.” It did not include the actual pricing and V-Buck value. Still, fans can likely speculate on the cost based on similar previous DLC.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>With a separate <a href="https://x.com/RocketLeague/status/1815386430710874530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, the Rocket League team also confirmed that the Cybertruck would be available tomorrow. </p>



<p>This follows yesterday’s cryptic tease, but the post only reveals one image of the new addition. At this time, the devs did not offer any details about other potential themed cosmetics like custom trails.</p>



<p>The vehicle closely resembles its real-world counterpart in both games, which capture its unique design. Many fans quickly responded with humorous jabs at the Cybertruck’s reputation.</p>



<p>Rocket League just celebrated its ninth launch anniversary earlier this month. This coincided with an adidas collaboration and Festival of Football event. Season 15 also kicked off last month with the new Nissan Fairlady Z vehicle.</p>



<p>Some new Fortnite leaks also just surfaced today for Chapter 6, teasing possible <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-chapter-6-will-introduce-new-movement-mechanics-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new movement mechanics</a>. Fortnite is currently running its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-cursed-sails-event-is-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cursed Sails event</a>, which launched sooner than expected.</p>

He explained: "They think the release is make or break, and it's not. They have a financial way to be persistent, and they never do it. It comes out, doesn't work and they throw it away.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-doesnt-agree-with-ftc-comments-regarding-price-hikes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/ftc-files-complaint-against-microsoft-following-game-pass-price-hike/">filed a new complaint</a> against Microsoft to the US Court of Appeals for their recent Xbox Game Pass price hike, as this is precisely what the FTC was trying to avoid with the acquisition. However, since the complaint raised by Imad Aybad has been sent forward to the US Court of Appeals, <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1814438299844382964" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft has spoken out</a> and said that they disagree with the claims made by the FTC.</p>
<p>It wasn't a surprise that Microsoft finally pulled the trigger and increased the price of the Xbox Game Pass. It was too good to be true for too long. There are many reasons as to why they could have done this, but their merger with Activision and Blizzard most likely plays a part in it. On top of that, subscriber growth to Game Pass has slowed down, meaning they need to find a way to boost revenue, with increasing the subscription price being the only reasonable solution.</p>
<p>In a letter to the court, Microsoft addressed the FTC's allegations. In the statement, Microsoft said that the FTC "presents a misleading extra-account record of the facts and is a continuation of the agency's attempts to reinvent its case on appeal."</p>
<p>Additionally, Microsoft continues to stand by the changes they are making to Game Pass and says that it is unfair to call the new version of the Standard tier a "degraded" version, as it gives the improvement of multiplayer functionality, which the previous iteration of Console Game Pass did not have. To have multiplayer functionality, subscribers must pay an extra $9.99 to utilize those features.</p>
<p>Microsoft is also trying to prove that this version of Game Pass is better than ever, as "the service will offer many new games available day-and-date, in particular Call of Duty." Call of Duty coming to Game Pass is a big deal and is one of the significant features gamers hoped for from the merger with Activision Blizzard and Microsoft. However, as recent events show, it has come at a pretty hefty price.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on the subscription prices when Microsoft originally went to trial for the merger, Microsoft points out in the statement that "the FTC barely mentioned subscription at trial, instead focusing on the theory that Microsoft would be withholding Call of Duty from Sony's Console," which, we now know is a falsehood. Call of Duty will be available to everyone, regardless of whether they are on Xbox, PlayStation, or PC.</p>
<p>At the moment, it remains to be seen what will result from the FTC's appeal and whether it will help sway the tides in Microsoft's favor.</p>

In that regard, it’s similar to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sega-sonic-union-layoffs-persona-yakuza-1851026309&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sega-sonic-union-layoffs-persona-yakuza-1851026309">the union at Sega of America</a></span> which represents staff from across the organization’s marketing, localization, and community management teams. </p><p>  “We are so excited to announce our union at Bethesda Game Studio and join the movement sweeping across the video game industry,” Mandi Parker, Senior System Designer at Bethesda, said in a statement. “It is clear that every worker can benefit from bringing democracy into the workplace and securing a protected voice on the job.”</p><p>The process went so quickly and smoothly due to a neutrality agreement Microsoft made with the CWA promising not to fight unionization efforts or require formal elections. Instead, employees across the company can form a union simply by showing majority support for one via a card check or visiting an online portal. The tech giant made that deal as part of an effort to get its massive $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard over the finish line last year. </p><p>Unionization efforts have been slowly building in the gaming industry for years now as employees push back against cultures of extended overtime and frequent mass layoffs. That shift seems likely to gain even more momentum with major players like Bethesda joining in. Union workers there will now begin negotiating their first contract. So far, only the union at Sega of America has ratified a collective bargaining agreement at a major gaming company. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>\The release of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 Series may not be coming as soon as many originally thought. According to a <a href="https://x.com/kopite7kimi/status/1815314518656118837" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new claim from a known leaker</a>, the Nvidia RTX 50 series might not be officially announced and released until CES 2025.</p>



<p>“I think we won’t see RTX 50 until CES,” they said.</p>



<p>Originally, the idea was that the Nvidia RTX 50 series would start launching this fall with the release of the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080. Based on the claim, that seems to have changed.  </p>



<p>It’s worth noting that nothing about the new GPU launch has been confirmed, so please take this latest rumor with a grain of salt. That said, the source, Kopite7Kimi, has a history of being accurate with their claims.</p>



<p>Nvidia has said that they won’t comment on rumor or speculation.</p>



<p>As far as what to expect when they do launch, the RTX 5090 is rumored to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-will-have-a-2-9-ghz-base-clock-rumors-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have a base clock of 2.9 GHz</a>. Expected TDP for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5000-series-gpu-power-leaked-by-seasonic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new lineup of cards were also leaked</a> via Seasonic’s PSU wattage calculator.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/its-not-cheap-to-showcase-at-geoff-keighleys-gamescom-onl.933489/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-prices<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're a studio looking to showcase your game during Geoff Keighley's Gamescom Opening Night Live ceremony, then you'd better be prepared to pay for the privilege.</p>
<p>Per Gamescom's <a href="https://forms.gamescom.global/en/booking-opening-night-live/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official booking form</a>, prices for a spot during the pre-show start at&nbsp;€57,500, which works out at around $62,500. That'll get you a 30-second trailer. As a reminder, that's for the pre-show, not the main event.</p>
<p>For 60 seconds, you'll have to pay&nbsp;€82,500 (about $90,000), with prices rising to&nbsp;€107,500 (about $117,000) and&nbsp;€132,500 (around $144,000) for 90-second and 120-second spots respectively. The pre-show airs before the livestream for the main show, and it's not shown to Gamescom's in-person audience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamescom-prices-execs.jpg?itok=nUxtxWV9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamescom-prices-execs.jpg?itok=sozJ_6zy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gamescom isn't cheap for those wanting to showcase their games during Opening Night Live.</figcaption></figure><p>Bookings for the main show are sold out now, but a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240627122943/https://forms.gamescom.global/en/booking-opening-night-live/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quick search through the trusty internet archive</a> reveals just how much a studio will have paid for their game to be shown during Opening Night Live, and the costs are pretty eye-watering.</p>
<p>A mere 30-second spot costs a staggering&nbsp;€115,000, with prices rising to&nbsp;€165,000,&nbsp;€215,000, and&nbsp;€265,000 for 60-second, 90-second, and 120-second spots in that order.</p>
<p>If you think that sounds expensive, then you're not wrong; prices have risen significantly for showcase hopefuls since 2022. According <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pcgamer.com/heres-how-much-it-costs-to-show-a-game-in-gamescom-opening-night-live/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to PC Gamer</a>, a one-minute trailer during 2022's Gamescom Opening Night Live would have cost&nbsp;€125,000, which is&nbsp;€40,000 less than this year's price.</p>
<p>A 90-second spot would have set a studio back&nbsp;€165,000 in 2022, as compared to the&nbsp;€215,000 the same studio would pay today. Hey, at least they didn't hike the prices when the main show slots sold out, right?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamescom-capcom-monster-hunter-wilds.jpg?itok=EkYF5HHu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamescom-capcom-monster-hunter-wilds.jpg?itok=KkvF4nrs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Capcom is just one of this year's exhibitors at Gamescom.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that there are some games that are essentially editorially chosen, and that those games "earn" themselves a spot during Opening Night Live without having to pay for the privilege, so not everyone's going to be coughing up the amounts outlined above.</p>
<p>Additionally, these prices aren't for a spot on the show floor (since Gamescom is a public event at which studios have booths for interested attendees to check out); they're strictly for a trailer during Opening Night Live or its pre-show segment.</p>
<p>Still, any studio that wants to show off its game during such a high-profile presentation had better have some serious cash to pony up, it seems.</p>
<p>Gamescom Opening Night Live airs on August 20th at 2pm Eastern (that's 11am Pacific), and you'll be able to catch it via Gamescom's official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamescom1230" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamescom" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twitch</a> channels.</p>

Yes, telling you that it’s an adventure game which you navigate via a grid that moves the environment with you is technically accurate, but that doesn’t encapsulate how or why this effortless, intuitive way of moving through its world and embracing its inherent restrictions scratches an itch in my brain.</p><figure id="" data-id="8b59453cf81abad677fec59825a4cffe" data-recommend-id="image://8b59453cf81abad677fec59825a4cffe" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="448" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jemma knocks someone off a ladder with her movement abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jemma knocks someone off a ladder with her movement abilities." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Furniture &amp; Mattress</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8b59453cf81abad677fec59825a4cffe" data-recommend-id="image://8b59453cf81abad677fec59825a4cffe" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="448" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jemma knocks someone off a ladder with her movement abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There were times when I was playing through <em>Arranger</em> where it didn’t feel hyperbolic to call it a “perfect” video game because Furniture &amp; Mattress so concisely delivers upon an idea without letting it overstay its welcome, repeat itself, or ever approach tedium. The team blends its clever puzzle design into the game’s themes, as well as having some genuinely charming writing along the way. At the center of all of it is the heartfelt story of Jemma, a small-town outcast who was born with the unwanted ability to shift the environment around her as she walks through it. If she moves to the left, the entire x-axis across from her moves with her. That means any person or thing that happens to be on that line will be dragged along with her steps, looping between the edges until she steps off that line and into another to start the process again.<br></p><p>Jemma, feeling like she doesn’t quite fit in in this little town, decides to leave, and uncovers hidden truths about this world and her powers that her lifelong neighbors could never fathom. <em>Arranger </em>delivers all of this with writing just as clever as its puzzle design, but even as I was invested in Jemma’s self-discovery and desire to leave the claustrophobic confines of her small town, navigating <em>Arranger</em>’s puzzle-driven world was enough hook me on its own.</p><figure id="" data-id="4d751ca9f0690aa58455be331cec4eb5" data-recommend-id="image://4d751ca9f0690aa58455be331cec4eb5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="448" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jemm pushes a sword into an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jemm pushes a sword into an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Furniture &amp; Mattress</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4d751ca9f0690aa58455be331cec4eb5" data-recommend-id="image://4d751ca9f0690aa58455be331cec4eb5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="448" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jemm pushes a sword into an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Arranger</em>’s core conceit of Jemma moving parts of the world as she walks through it is introduced as the silliest of inconveniences. She walks through the town square and knocks down a ladder on the other side of the walkway because she can’t control her abilities. But it also proves to be her greatest asset as she navigates new, unknown places and you master her abilities. <em>Arranger</em> has combat, but it’s done by manipulating the environment to push swords into foes. Often, however, they’ll be positioned just awkwardly enough that you can’t just drive a blade through a beastie’s heart. That’s where the puzzle part of <em>Arranger</em> comes in. Pushing entire pathways along with your movement while only being able to move on the x and y axes is the perfect, instinctual limitation that <em>Arranger </em>is constantly building on.<br></p><p>Each new area Jemma arrives in has a distinct mechanic added on top of the core loop. Some are as simple as avoiding laser beams that trigger barriers in her path, while others are as complex as controlling two characters at once that aren’t on parallel paths. <em>Arranger</em> never tutorializes any of these new ideas, instead making you figure it out on your own as each new obstacle appears in your way. Still, the game is so concise in its visual communication that figuring these new obstacles out out feels almost innate, like something built into your muscle memory. And while there are ways in which you’re restricted by the game’s movement, there are ways in which you’re liberated by it, too. Figuring out I could quickly get through long pathways by looping from one side to the other was an incredibly satisfying moment in which I realized I was navigating <em>Arranger</em>’s world with the same kind of in-the-zone precision and awareness I associate with games like <em>Tetris</em>, and there are moments like that up to the very end.</p><p><em>Arranger </em>is a brisk adventure, but it’s filled with so many clever, perfectly executed ideas that by the time it was over, I was just left wanting more. Jemma’s story might be over by the end, but I’d love to see Furniture &amp; Mattress add new puzzles in future updates because the team has such an immaculate, clever eye for what makes puzzle games so satisfying. Now I’m just waiting for my memory of the game to fade so I can go back and try to solve those puzzles with fresh eyes once more.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>To celebrate the arrival of Deadpool &amp; Wolverine on July 26, Xbox unveiled a<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-releases-new-controller-with-deadpools-butt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> special edition </a>‘Cheeky’ controller that features the anti-hero’s famed butt cheeks. To add to the bromance between Deadpool and Wolverine, Xbox has unveiled a Wolverine edition of the wireless controller featuring “Logan’s very own Adamantium-tough tush”.</p>



<p>Just having Deadpool’s tush on an Xbox controller wasn’t enough, so they went on to add Wolverine’s butt cheeks too. The Wolverine edition of the Cheeky Controller features a unique design with different colours. The controller has been clad with Wolverine’s iconic comic-inspired blue and yellow costume, with yellow joysticks and black buttons. There is additional detailing on the controller, which gives it the feel of a tactical suit.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Deadpool is known for his over-the-top antics, and to celebrate the announcement of the Wolverine edition Xbox controller, a massive billboard was put up in Alberta, Canada. The poster reads, “My Best Bub’s cheeks never looked so good,” it features an image of Deadpool sitting on the Wolverine Cheeky Controller.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Wolverine edition Xbox Cheeky controller is an exclusive item and will not be available for purchase, similar to the Deadpool edition controller. Players who wish to acquire it must enter the 18+ Xbox Sweepstakes contest. To do so, you must follow Xbox on X (formerly Twitter) and repost their Sweepstakes post embedded below. Doing this will also allow you to win 2 ‘Cheeky Controllers’, the Deadpool-inspired Xbox Series X, and a stand that features foam versions of the anti-hero’s trusty katanas, Bea and Arthur.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LUExu3qU-o">a new trailer</a>, Capcom announced that Terry Bogard of Fatal Fury will join the Street Fighter 6 roster in Autumn 2024.</p>



<p>Capcom did not confirm an exact release date. However, the new teaser does clarify that Bogard will be available in World Tour, Battle Hub, and Fighting Ground. </p>



<p>The new teaser is purely cinematic, so Terry Bogard’s kit remains unclear. But there are some hints about Bogard’s potential abilities, and fans are quickly speculating based on existing Fatal Fury content. </p>



<p>The trailer description explains that fans can purchase Terry for Fighter Coins. Players who purchased the Year 2 Character Pass or Ultimate Pass will get access to Terry on release.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Street Fighter 6 - Terry Teaser Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9LUExu3qU-o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Fatal Fury is a classic series that took the fighting genre by storm in the 90’s. It’s unclear if Capcom has plans for Andy Bogard, Joe Higashi, and other central characters from the IP. They’re a natural fit, and fans widely praise Terry Bogard’s addition to the Street Fighter 6 roster. </p>



<p>Capcom also previously released a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-x-monster-hunter-crossover-is-coming-april-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossover with Monster Hunter</a>, which arrived in April 2024. However, that was a smaller event that mostly involved cosmetics.</p>



<p>Street Fighter 6 released in June 2023 to solid critic ratings, and it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-6-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached one million players</a> in just 3 days after launch. In April 2024, Capcom even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-raises-earnings-forecast-following-dragons-dogma-2-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raised its earnings forecast</a> following the success of Street Fighter 6 and Dragon’s Dogma 2. </p>



<p>Street Fighter fans also look forward to a new movie, which recently got a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release window of 2026</a>.</p>

<p>Several new rumors have claimed that Modern Warfare 3 will be coming to Xbox Game Pass on July 24, which Insider Gaming has been able to corroborate with its sources.</p>



<p>We first reported that Modern Warfare 3 will be coming to Xbox Game Pass this month a couple of weeks ago, but at the time couldn’t verify the exact release date with multiple primary sources. However, since then, several new claims have said that Modern Warfare 3 will be released on Game Pass on July 24.</p>



<p>The date was first mentioned by XboxEra’s Sikamikanico during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/F5yyYnZVbWw?si=Aou3EG6b5QNJEM_p&amp;t=4818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XboxEra podcast</a>, in which he said, “July 24th is the rumor [for a MW3 Xbox Game Pass release].” Later, leaker eXtas1s <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1815163683661594741" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">corroborated the date</a>, also saying July 24. Soon after, WindowsCentral’s Jez Corden also <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1815175561607618798" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweeted to his own report</a> from earlier this month covering our story by stating “very soon”.</p>



<p>July 24 is also the date that Insider Gaming has been hearing for the release of Modern Warfare 3 on Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear on when the announcement will be made, but Xbox typically makes its Game Pass announcements on a Tuesday. So keep your eyes peeled.</p>



<p>Several claims have also said that&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-activision-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">older Activision games will start to come to the subscription service later this month</a>, including Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy.</p>
