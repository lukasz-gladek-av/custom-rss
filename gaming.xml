The update makes New Horizons more stable in multiplayer sessions with players on both Switch and Switch 2, part of Nintendo's effort to make sure some of its tentpole games from the original Switch are compatible with the new console.</p><p>According to <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/49112/~/how-to-update-animal-crossing%3A-new-horizons" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's patch notes</a>, the New Horizons update "improve[s] the compatibility for multiplayer sessions between Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch." While no other details are provided, the update's timing and focus suggest that Nintendo is emphasizing cross-platform performance and backwards compatibility to ensure a smooth console transition.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Animal Crossing: New Horizons Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Prior to this, its last update came back in November 2022, when Nintendo wrapped up its ongoing support for the game. New Horizons originally launched in March 2020 at the onset of widespread lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-huge-sales-figures-we/1100-6477018/" data-ref-id="1100-6477018">which supercharged its popularity</a>. However, despite its adoption rate by Switch owners, Nintendo has not announced plans for a specific Switch 2 version of the game, unlike <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-every-switch-2-upgrade/2900-6612/" data-ref-id="2900-6612">other headliners such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p><p>Ahead of the hotly anticipated launch of Switch 2 next week, a steady stream of news about the console has emerged. For example, Nintendo has gradually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/" data-ref-id="2900-6398">revealed the cross-platform games that are getting Switch 2 enhanced editions</a>. Relatedly, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-in-october-nintendo-switch-2-edition-detailed/1100-6531855/" data-ref-id="1100-6531855">Pokemon Legends: Z-A comes out in October for both consoles</a>, and the Switch 2 version will have improved graphics and performance.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced the release date of Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p>
<p>The upcoming Pokémon Legends game will launch across Switch and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> on 16th October. Pre orders for Pokémon Legends: Z-A will begin on 5th June, via the Nintendo eShop.</p>
<p>Along with revealing the release date, Nintendo also shared the upcoming game's cover art, which you can see in full further down this article, although I cropped it a bit for the header image above if you just fancy a taster now that you know the date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-on-october-16-with-improved-graphics-and-frame-rates-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-version/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A will arrive on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 later this year on&nbsp;<strong>October 16, 2025</strong>, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have announced. It'll be available on both the Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch 2, with the Switch 2 version featuring "<em>improved graphics and frame rates</em>."</p>
<p>It's right around the time we were expecting the release date to be, because mainline Pokémon releases have all recently launched in that same fall-early winter window to get it in just ahead of the holidays, and because that was the release window Nintendo revealed earlier this year during a <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-new-trailer-confirmes-late-2025-release-window-new-extended-look-gameplay-video-released/">Pokémon Presents presentation</a>. You'll be able to pre-order Legends Z-A when the Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, 2025.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company announced the news with a <a href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/1927712162778099735">post on its official X account</a>, sharing a new piece of key art for the game. "<em>Pokémon Legends Z-A arrives October 16, 2026!</em>" the caption for the post reads.</p>
<p>"<em>In addition to the Nintendo Switch title, a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will offer improved graphics and frame rates! The digital and physical versions of Pokémon Legends Z-A can be upgraded to the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition via upgrade pack</em>."</p>
<p>There's also going to be another <a href="https://x.com/Pokemon_cojp/status/1927712715335712964">Pokémon Presents event on July 22, 2025</a>, which will likely showcase more of what's to come in Legends Z-A, and hopefully some news on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pokemon-mmo/">what else we can expect to play</a> from the world of Pokémon.</p>
<p><iframe title="An Extended Look at Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M_KNDtKJJ-8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For the<a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html"> 150 million+</a> that already own a Nintendo Switch, it's great that one of the biggest series on the platform will still be available on the Switch 1, but it'll be interesting to see what the release of Legends Z-A does for Nintendo Switch 2 sales.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the Nintendo Switch 2 is only days away from launching globally, and there's no doubt it'll be a big seller for the rest of the year. But with how poorly the recent major Pokémon releases on the Nintendo Switch have been from a<a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-update-late-february-bug-fixes-functionality/"> technical perspective</a>, it wouldn't be surprising if the launch of Legends Z-A pushes people to upgrade more than any other game we know about in the console's launch year.</p>
<p>Especially if Pokémon Legends Z-A arrives and is borderline unplayable on the Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>release date, and we also now know when the next Pokemon Presents showcase is set to air.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Release-Date-for-Pokemon-Legends-Z-A-Revealed-and-Pokemon-Presents-Vid" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which had already been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-february-2025-all-reveals-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">slated for a late 2025 launch</a>, will be arriving on October 16th. Pre-orders for the game will be opening on June 5th, which is the same <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">day of the Switch 2's launch</a>.</p>

<p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>will be available on both the Switch 2 and the original Switch, and if you buy it on the older machine, you'll be able to pay to upgrade your version to the Switch 2 Edition of the game.</p>

<p>There's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-august-2023" rel="nofollow">often</a> a Pokemon Presents <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everything-from-pokemon-presents-about-arceus-and-gen-4-remakes" rel="nofollow">show</a> during the summer, and this year's is set to air on July 22nd, with The Pokemon Company promising to reveal "the latest news and updates from the world of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>".</p>

<p>I'd be very surprised indeed if we didn't get at least a hint about the next generation of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, which will almost certainly be exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2. Expect more info about&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>prior to its release as well.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, it's the second game in the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>sub-series, following on from 2022's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pokemon-legends-arceus" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon Legends: Arceus</em></a>.</p>




<p>While&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Arceus&nbsp;</em>took place during the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>world's past,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>will instead be set in the present day. It'll take place entirely inside Lumiose City, which is currently in the midst of an urban redevelopment plan.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Arceus&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Pokemon-Legends-Z-A-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2827849.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Switch 2</a> on October 16th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/674577/to-a-t-review-keita-takahashi-ps5-xbox-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>From the worm-like character stretching to the length of the planetary system in <em>Noby Noby Boy</em>, to the tiny Prince hoarding a spherical mass of objects and even buildings in <em>Katamari Damacy</em>, the heroes of Keita Takahashi’s games reflect the creator’s whimsical vision. <em>To a T</em> is yet another Takahashi title that fits that playful tradition, well, to a tee. The protagonist is a young teen, aptly named Teen, whose body is permanently stuck in a T-pose. But while they may be able to wiggle their fingers a little or move their wrists to reach out for an item, their elbows are woefully nonexistent.</p><p>That’s okay, though! Like most of Takahashi’s games, <em>To a T</em> is also a heartwarming tale about self-acceptance. Prep, an indie pop band from England, even composed an infectious, chirpy theme song for the game about already being the perfect shape, no matter what you look like.</p><p>In a world where elbows are very much an accessory to daily life, Teen has to go through some pretty unconventional routines due to their irreversibly stiff arms. For one thing, Teen can’t put on clothes, use the toilet, or even dry their face on their own. Even walking down the street can be a little cumbersome, since their outstretched arms mean they may inadvertently slap their hands into another passerby. Fortunately for Teen, they have a trusty sidekick — a dog named Dog — who’s more than eager to help them navigate these tasks.</p><p>Take washing your face, which can initially be an unfamiliar affair. As Teen, you’ll need to twist your upper body, reaching your hand toward the tap — one that’s uniquely designed for Teen’s predicament — and lower your head, so the stream of water spurts upward to your face. Then, you’ll hold your position until your face is clean and free of persistent eye boogers. Brushing your teeth is another fiddly routine. This is done by reaching for a toothbrush with a particularly long handle, getting Dog’s help in squirting a bit of toothpaste on it, and then scrubbing your teeth until they’re squeaky clean.</p><p>But these activities aren’t designed to be tedious; you aren’t carefully calibrating every small movement like you would in physics games like Bennett Foddy’s <em>QWOP</em> and <em>Getting Over It</em>. Instead, these are simply different sorts of routines you’ll need to get used to. When your arms are resolutely perpendicular to your body, these activities are just all in a day’s work.</p><p>They’re also genuinely joyful, even if the movements can appear superfluous. Rinsing your mouth is a matter of wriggling the analog stick or direction keys and then pressing another button to spit the water out into the sink. But you can also shake your head while doing that, so that your spit will trickle out like a meandering, miniature waterfall. Using the toilet allows you to mash several buttons, just so you can listen to Teen huffing and grunting as they go about their business behind closed doors. There’s really no point to doing so other than giggling at these sights and sounds, but it’s such a delightful way of prodding at the game’s inherent silliness. That’s the beauty behind <em>To a T</em> — it has zero pretensions about the kind of game it’s trying to be. </p><p>In fact, <em>To a T</em> later informs you that you can skip any of these routines if you like. Want to eat breakfast without brushing your teeth right after? If you can tolerate seeing green gunk stuck on your teeth for the rest of the day, go right ahead. The game isn’t going to penalize you for skipping teeth brushing for a day — or two.</p><p><em>To a T</em> is chockful of such diminutive joys. Breakfast consists of cereal and flavored milk every day, such as chocolate, matcha, and mango, and there’s a small thrill in discovering what these mixtures would taste like to Teen. In one meal, Teen commented that the cereal tasted like rubbery tires, and in another it was an explosion of strange, candy flavors. Regardless of the taste, they welcomed every mouthful of these sugary treats with gusto.</p><p>Exploring the neighborhood, particularly on weekends, feels especially liberating, as your day is seemingly filled with endless possibilities for fun. Eateries offer minigames in the form of speed-eating contests, as you devour a giant corn on the cob and even hailstorms of ice cream. There are coins to collect and discover among the shrubberies and rooftops, new shops to look at, and fascinating locales — from a lighthouse to a magical mushroom forest — to get lost in. Even attending school was an adventure, even though Teen was largely reluctant to head to class in his first few days due to relentless bullying, a problem that does get resolved. </p><div><p><cite>Image: Annapurna Interactive</cite></p></div><p>Eventually, Teen discovers an innate talent for flying. By spinning on their toes like a ballerina, they gain the ability to traverse higher grounds. This skill does have a bit of a learning curve, however. As it turns out, flying isn’t particularly intuitive, and it took me several tries to get my feet off the ground. But as with most gimmicks in <em>To a T</em>, failing isn’t really that big of a deal-breaker. You’re free to wander around town however you prefer, be it flying, running, or riding a unicycle.</p><p>As you delve deeper into the game, <em>To a T</em> spins an increasingly ludicrous-yet-charming tale, one that Takahashi himself has referred to as being rather “stupid” in <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/it-is-very-touching-and-very-stupid-katamari-damacy-creator-cant-wait-for-us-to-experience-the-final-scene-of-his-new-game/">an interview</a>. Having finished the game, I can attest that one of its final moments is, indeed, almost irredeemably nonsensical. Yet it also made me crack a really wide smile, something I haven’t done while playing games in a while.</p><p>Playing and making games amid a politically fraught climate may seem frivolous, and this is <a href="https://www.vg247.com/keita-takahashi-on-wattam-and-the-superfluousness-of-video-games">an issue</a> that Takahashi mentioned he was struggling with when he was working on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21021203/wattam-review-ps4-pc-katamari">his previous game, <em>Wattam</em></a>. But <em>To a T</em>’s central message of acceptance, and of finding joy in life’s smallest moments, feels like a salve for these trying times. At the very least, its positivity gave me the impetus to keep trudging on — hopefully it’ll do the same for you, too.</p><p><sub>To a T <em>launches on May 28th on the PS5, Xbox, and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s due to be with us on October 16, with pre-orders starting as early as June 5.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,195752,195905" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Coming to both the original Switch and the Switch 2, the new game from Game Freak will offer an upgraded version for the newer Nintendo console, which will boast a higher resolution and improved framerates. However, this will come at the cost of an upgrade fee—likely $10, based on the Japanese announcement of 1,000 yen.</p><p>  <em>Z-A</em>, set exclusively in Lumiose City within the Kalos region, is essentially a follow-up to 2013's <em>Pokémon X</em> and <em>Y</em>, while also the second in the <em>Legends</em> franchise. Which is to say,  it will play differently from the mainline series, especially when it comes to combat. <em>Z-A</em> will use real-time fighting between your Pokémon, rather than the traditional turn-based battles, and will include <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-new-leak-starters-1851772521&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-new-leak-starters-1851772521">Mega Evolution</a></span> as a core mechanic. It also looks unlikely to have the same open feel as <em>Legends: Arceus</em>, given the game is entirely set in one city.</p><p>In Lumoise City, Pokémon co-exist with humans, rather than being considered pets/captives. The city—originally based on Paris—is undergoing urban redevelopment by a company called Quasartico, which appears to be a pivotal aspect of the as-yet undetailed story. What we do know, however, is that play will be split into day and night. During the day, you’ll explore, chat with the locals, and progress through the story. During the night, the local Wild Zones become Battle Zones, where you take part in the Z-A Battle, attempting to climb your way up through the ranks from, well, Z to A. Here you’ll battle other trainers in real-time combat with your current collection of Poké pals.</p><p>If you’re not planning to upgrade your Switch just yet, don’t worry. <em>Z-A</em> seems to have been primarily developed for the original hybrid console, with the Switch 2 upgraded version tweaking things to run more smoothly with the extra horsepower. We don’t have prices yet, although given pre-ordering starts as soon as next week, we don’t have long to wait. $60 for the Switch version and $70 for the Switch 2 seems extremely likely, however.</p><p>It’s interesting that <em>Z-A</em> is releasing in the slot we’d usually expect to see a new mainline game in the <em>Pokémon </em>franchise. It likely speaks well of Game Freak, which was clearly overworked in its efforts to release two full-size games in 2022—hopefully the developers will be&nbsp;given more time and space to work on these projects from here on out.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>There have been plenty of solid fishing games over the years, but this new one ups the ante. Fish Hunters: The Most Ridiculous Fishing Simulator is a new PC game where players haul in fish with rods, but then the fish are vaulted into the sky and players blast away at them with automatic weapons. It sounds similar to the popular mobile game Ridiculous Fishing, but with a first-person perspective and more action.</p><p>From developer Dos Ivanes and publisher Polden Publishing, Fish Hunters riffs on the idea that fishing is boring (and in reality, it can be; after all, it's called fishing, not catching). "Fishing can be a total snoozefest, right?" a character says in the announcement trailer. "But not this one."</p><p>"In Fish Hunters, you ain't got time to get bored.

			<p>In the world of anthropomorphic gaming characters, bats are relatively rare. There seem to be countless foxes and cats running around competing quests and being heroes, so having a little bat dude with a yoyo is a refreshing change of pace. That being said, Pippit being a bat has very little bearing on the game itself – he can’t even fly! What our batty hero <em>does</em> have, however, is an incredible useful yoyo that serves as both weapon and navigation device in some of the most intricately designed top down levels you’ll find outside of a traditional Zelda dungeon.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo - Release Date &amp; Console Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jE-RFPhjTjs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We first meet Pippit on his way back from a big yoyo tournament as he recounts his excitement to a bemused taxi driver. The driver’s tone changes as soon as he realises that the young bat is a member of the dominant Pipistrello family who run the energy monopoly in the city. The scene is set for Pippit to be the exception to the rule in a family that seems to be a direct analogue for multinationals and corporations. Pippit is on his way to visit his aunt, the CEO of the company, but this trip does not go as planned. The end result is his aunt’s soul being split between four mega-batteries held by area bosses with the remaining part trapped within Pippit’s yoyo.</p>


<p>Pipistrello is a gorgeous game. Lovely pixel art and detailed backgrounds set the scene and there is also a real sense of character to the main antagonists. The range of enemies is decent, with new ones being introduced regularly throughout the game, each having specific attack patterns and weaknesses for you to learn. The soundtrack is solid too, with a surprising collaboration with Yoko Shimomura of Kingdom Hearts fame (amongst many others).</p>


<p>I played through the game on my Steam Deck, a choice that seemed to make sense given the in-game conceit that Pipistrello is being played on a Pocket Trap handheld (named after the devs themselves) and it performed excellently on that device. I was a little disappointed that nothing was really made of the meta framing idea of this being a new handheld system, but that might be a running theme for their future titles.</p>
<p>So, that’s the background and aesthetic covered, how does Pipistrello play? The closest comparison to the game is a traditional top-down Zelda game as you explore an overworld with areas locked off by specific abilities and upgrades to find dungeons that revolve around the skilful use of said new skills. Obviously Nintendo’s flagship adventure series has evolved to become a different (Divine) beast in recent years, but I freely admit to being one of those who have a stronger connection to the earlier titles. With that in mind, Pipistrello was both perfectly pitched for me but also found itself in direct competition with my nostalgic memories.</p>
<p>Exploring the overworld is kept fresh through some witty interactions with various locals, a large number of hidden items and some tricky environmental puzzles to get access to each boss area. As you explore the dense cityscape you can unlock taxi points to enable fast travel. This becomes especially useful when searching for collectables and upgrades later in the game.</p>

<p>Initially, your yoyo is relatively basic and can be used as a melee weapon or to grab items that are out of reach. Levels are intricately designed with triangular blocks that you can bounce your yoyo off to reach further. Identifying these blocks and the pattern they set out is crucial to navigating the levels and the game excellently trains you in spotting the different ways these can be set out. By the end of the game you’ll be pulling off yoyo parkour sections that look impossible at the beginning. These skills are also needed to tackle the various bosses throughout the game and these fights are well designed and challenging.</p>
<p>As well as simple back and forth yoyo abilities you unlock various more complex skills named after all the famous yoyo moves like Around the World and Walk the Dog. It does leave me to ask what happened to yoyos in the real world? They were huge for a few years in the 80s and 90s but I can’t remember the last time I saw somebody with one. Anyway, these abilities can be used in both combat encounters and in exploring the world as you’ll eventually be able to soar across water hazards, grind around the walls to avoid pits and even suspend the yoyo in midair and use it to spring across impassable gaps. Once your full range of skills is unlocked the sheer thrill of navigating the complex levels is up there with the best of Nintendo’s own game design.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Pispistrello and the Cursed Yoyo is a fantastic top down adventure game that deserves to be considered in the same echelon as classic Nintendo titles. It takes the traditional Zelda framework and reimagines it to create a world that is incredibly fun to explore. The thrill of nailing the yoyo traversal mechanics remains throughout and while the combat can be a little repetitive at times, this is equally the case with Link's various adventures. All in all, this is peak indie gaming and comes very highly recommended.	</p></div>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-early-access-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingmakers-early-access-release-date-revealed-for-october.1200420/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher tinyBuild and developer Redemption Road have finally announced the&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date, although the game will be landing perhaps a little later than you might have expected.</p>

<p>As revealed in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2109770/view/516336614597722796" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>will be launching on October 8th. Redemption Road acknowledges that some may have been "expecting it sooner", and that the game didn't make its previously-announced Q2 release window.</p>

<p>However, the studio says that "building a game where time-traveling mercs drop air strikes on medieval knights takes a hell of a lot of toiling", and that the aim is to give players "a game that hits hard and holds up", a goal for which the devs are currently "grinding".</p>

<p>The game quickly began accruing wishlists and followers on Steam, with publisher tinyBuild announcing last year that a&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">movie is in development</a>, despite the fact that the game didn't have anything approaching a release date at that point.</p>

<p>Following that announcement,&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-delayed-q1-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed to 2025 in December</a>, and while Redemption Road promised the game would arrive in the first quarter of the year, it was subsequently pushed back again to the second quarter (and then again to October).</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers</em>, Redemption Road describes it as an "epic action/strategy sandbox" in which you must "change the course of history and save the future" by traveling back in time with your "vast arsenal of modern weapons".</p>

<p>You'll switch between hitting the ground as a soldier equipped with modern military tools and issuing orders to your troops strategy-style, and you'll need to build fortifications to keep your troops safe as well.</p>

<p><em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>launches on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2109770/Kingmakers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Early Access</a> on October 8th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Here at <em>Kotaku</em>, I’ve been recapping each episode of the show, and I have not been having a good time. Frankly, I find it to be a mostly irredeemable attempt at adapting the narrative of the PS4 game. But what about the rest of the internet? Surely not everyone is as disappointed as I am and plenty of them enjoyed the show, right? Well, yeah. But they’re not quite as loud as the folks who weren’t thrilled with the finale and season at large.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197576" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="PlayStation’s Days of Play Brings Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, NBA 2K25 &amp; More To PS Plus" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="88" data-playlist="197576,197567,197565" data-current="197576"><div><p>PlayStation’s Days of Play Brings Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, NBA 2K25 &amp; More To PS Plus</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197576/197576_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197576/197576_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197576/197576_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23099.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>To start on a positive note, despite fans being divided over Bella Ramsey’s performance as Ellie, with some criticizing it for its more immature approach to the character compared to Ashley Johnson’s in the game, several fans sang their praises of Ramsey’s work in the finale. Personally, I appreciated that the show pulled off Ellie’s disillusionment with the people of Jackson despite what I felt was poor writing, and Ramsey’s execution of this tension finally boiling over received some praise.</p><p>However, with the show reaching one of its most climactic moments in the finale, many game fans are growing increasingly frustrated with the embellishments HBO has made. Some take issue with how certain characters’ personalities have been altered, like Jesse being an asshole instead of the golden retriever we once knew, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-abby-kaitlyn-dever-buff-ripped-gym-1851754822&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-abby-kaitlyn-dever-buff-ripped-gym-1851754822">Abby lacking the muscle</a></span> that once signified her obsession with killing her father’s murderer. Despite some praise for Ramsey’s performance, many longtime fans remain critical of Ellie’s newfound sadism and how she seems far less confident than her game counterpart. This is on top of weeks of criticism from fans who think that Ellie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-us-dina-ellie-romance-sex-scene-pregnant-episode-4-1851779166&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-dina-ellie-romance-sex-scene-pregnant-episode-4-1851779166">feels infantilized</a></span> in the show, especially when compared to her girlfriend Dina, who is carrying the angry, vengeful torch in her stead.</p><p>Character traits are one deviation from the source material fans are up in arms about, but perhaps the most controversial change in the finale involves the death of Mel. As in the game Ellie kills Mel, one of Abby’s friends who was with her on the expedition to kill Joel, but unlike in the game, here it’s an accident. Ellie fires a bullet at Mel‘s partner Owen and she just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, as the shot goes right through him and into her. In the source material, this is one of the most impactful moments of Ellie’s revenge tour, as it also results in the death of Mel’s unborn child, making Ellie confront just how much collateral damage she’s caused in her myopic need for vengeance. Fans argue that by making this kill an accident, the show is undermining Ellie’s story which originally showed her undergoing a deliberate descent into violent rage, and instead lets her off the hook by shifting the blame.</p><p>Not everyone hates the change, though. Again, Ramsey’s skill at communicating Ellie’s devastation has received praise, and some view it as a moment of the character’s true compassion coming out.</p><p>A lot of this discourse can arguably be chalked up to “Game fans are just precious about the original scenes.” Some might believe the show should be judged on its own merits rather than compared to the game it’s adapting, but many, myself included, feel that even on its own terms, the show is a mess of tonal contradictions and confused characterization. To me, examining it through the lens of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiT2VFyOr-A&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiT2VFyOr-A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony’s attempts to further capitalize on the series, even to the detriment of its story and integrity,</a></span> is the only way that it’s even interesting to talk about. If you take those elements away from the discussion, in my opinion the show is just bad in a boring way, with amateurish writing and inconsistent performances. </p><p>A lot of those problems are rooted in what seems to be an attempt to sanitize the original text and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035">avoid controversy</a></span>. However, the show’s inconsistent writing makes it feel like mash-up of competing stories in which Ellie’s motivations swap at the drop of a hat, which is frustrating to follow even without the context of playing the games. It’s easy to handwave criticisms as game fans simply not liking changes from the beloved source material, and if someone’s critique starts and ends with “the show is different than the games,” that’s not in and of itself making a qualitative point, it’s merely an observation. But as much as some people on both sides want to reduce the argument to dismissive extremes, the truth of the discussion exists somewhere in the middle, and right now it feels like some diehard game fans and show newcomers are ready to dismiss each other’s claims and praise on principle without hearing each other out. </p><p>Personally, I’ve found the show rewarding as a game fan because it’s been interesting to unpack <em>why</em> I think these changes are problems, rather than just being upset that it’s not recreating the game beat for beat. A lot of the show’s embellishments have felt like change for change’s sake. The <em>Last of Us </em>games felt very intentional in the story they wanted to tell, so taking a wrecking ball to so many characters and moments has made the show feel like a much less confident and coherent text. I don’t think it can be salvaged after this, but we’ll see if season three, which will primarily star Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, can turn things around.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As Ru Weerasuriya, creative director of The Order: 1886, explained in an French-language interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSkKtcblIOQ&amp;t=1165s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Julien Chieze</u></a>, the sequel was in the early stages of development before it was cancelled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In The Order: 1886, a game that re-writes history by introducing a unique vision of Victorian-Era London, you discover history’s darkest secret. From its 10-page pitch, Weerasuriya said the first sequel would have boasted bigger combat sequences, as well as an additional multiplayer mode. The third game didn't even make it to early production, but Weerasuriya and the team at Ready at Dawn had planned where the story would've taken them, as well as other instalments which could've taken the franchise into the 20th century.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ready at Dawn was a venerable, 20-year-old game studio that worked on God of War and Daxter among other projects.

It has elements of Grand Theft Auto, Watch Dogs, Cyberpunk, and a user generated content portion that has been labeled “AAA Minecraft.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During the Q&amp;A session on Discord, reviewed by IGN, Gerhard, who goes by the username MMG on the platform, was asked: “Do you think that all the people who reacted negatively were financed by someone?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“100%,” Gerhard responded, before adding: “Doesn't take much to guess who 🤣”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This accusation sparked a number of shocked responses, including one who said: “A co-CEO for a studio implying another studio is paying previewers to talk negatively about your game is an absolutely wild comment to make in a public environment in any situation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gerhard responded to that comment by saying: “Not wild when its [sic] true.....”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some users, who had clearly expressed concern about MindsEye and Build A Rocket Boy in the Discord in the past, wondered whether they were the target of Gerhard’s comments. One such user, ‘Cyber Boi,’ sparked a separate response:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Folks I never said Cyber Boi was being paid by anyone," Gerhard insisted. "I just said that there is a concerted effort by some people that don't want to see Leslie or Build A Rocket Boy to be successful that are making a concerted effort to trash the game and the studio. Its [sic] pretty easy to see the bots and the repeated replies to any content that we put out.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gerhard was then asked to clarify his comments by another user: “So just to clarify — you believe that individuals, be it content creators or otherwise, have been paid off to criticise MindsEye?” Gerhard then appeared to walk back the initial accusation, responding: “No I never said that. I do KNOW that there are bot farms posting negative comments and dislikes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The comments, still live on the Discord at the time of this article’s publication, were subsequently picked up on social media and began to circulate online. Gerhard has so far failed to provide evidence to back up his claims.

			<p>During yesterday's tinyBuild Connect 2025 show, developer Fire &amp; Frost shared a world overview trailer for their upcoming third-person open-world old-school RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/tinybuild-teams-up-with-fire-frost-studios-to-create-of-ash-and-steel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Of Ash and Steel</a>. The trailer is narrated by Tristan, a cartographer who also happens to be the game's hero, albeit a bit casually. Moreover, signups for an upcoming playtest are now open on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2893820/Of_Ash_and_Steel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>. While the date hasn't been finalized yet, the developers said players will be able to experience a few of the quests and the story's beginning.</p>
<p>According to Fire &amp; Frost, Grayshaft, where Of Ash and Steel is set, is one of the seven islands that make up the Kingdom of the Seven. While filled with beautiful environments, such as peaceful meadows stretching alongside endless crop fields, thick, ancient forests soon take over the horizon, shrouding crumbling ruins and long-forgotten relics.</p>
<p>The locals describe the island as a living entity, temperamental and unstable. The weather can change in an instant, a gentle breeze turning into a violent storm in moments. While some parts of the island bloom with color and life, others remain frozen all year round. Not even the ancient volcano at the heart of the island can warm the lands it overlooks.</p>
<p>Danger lurks around every corner. Whether players wander well-trodden paths or venture down hidden trails, chances are they shall encounter bloodthirsty beasts, merciless scavengers, and monstrous creatures. Still, those who persevere will be rewarded: hidden caves, buried treasures, and long-lost secrets await the brave.</p>
<p>Wildlife, bandits, and monsters are not the only dangers on the island: Grayshaft is also home to factions, some of which are vying for control and power. The Order of the Seven is renowned for its code and discipline, while the Free Hunters answer only to their own sense of justice. Many more groups operate in the shadows or on the fringes of society, so players won't know who to trust at first glance.</p>

<p>Fire &amp; Frost previously revealed that Of Ash and Steel features over 300 quests and has over 30K lines of dialogue, not to mention 180+ weapons, 270+ armor/cloth/jewelry pieces, 30+ monsters, 200+ crafting recipes, 5 hours of completely original in-game soundtrack, and 80+ random world events.</p>
<p>Of Ash and Steel is tentatively slated to launch for PC later this year. There's been no mention of other platforms yet.</p>

            <p>The co-CEO of MindsEye developer Build a Rocket Boy has suggested the game's negative reaction so far has been paid for in a "concerted effort" against the studio ahead of its release.</p>
<p>MindsEye is an upcoming action-adventure thriller from former GTA producer Leslie Benzies, which is being published by Hitman studio <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>. It is set for release on 10th June, across PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC.</p>
<p>A new trailer was released last night, highlighting some of the features coming to the game such as the ability for players to create their own missions using the in-game creation system. You can check it out below.</p>

<p>However, despite the trailers and having veteran developers working at the studio, the reaction to MindsEye has so far been underwhelming. A <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1925528143843999907">bulleted rundown listing issues with the game</a>, which was shared online earlier this week, called MindsEye a "broken mess, filled with bugs" and enemy encounters that "lacked depth".</p>
<p>Now, Build a Rocket Boy's co-CEO has claimed that there is a reason MindsEye is getting negative feedback - it's because people are being paid to do so. In an exchange on the MindsEye Discord server, Mark Gerhard was asked if he believes "all the people who reacted negatively were financed by someone", to which he replied: "100 percent."</p>
<p>When another user in the chat highlighted Gerhard's claims were rather unexpected, the studio exec replied: "Not wild when it's true....."</p>
<p>In another reply, the studio exec added it "doesn't take much to guess who" with an accompanying laughing emoji, though he didn't elaborate on this point further at the time. However, when confronted about the matter further, Gerhard said there has been a "concerted effort" involved regarding criticism around the game and the studio.</p>
<p>Wrote Gerhard: "I just said that there is a concerted effort by some people that don't want to see Leslie or Build A Rocket Boy to be successful that are making a concerted effort to trash the game and the studio. It's pretty easy to see the bots and the repeated replies to any content that we put out."</p>
<p>Eurogamer contacted Build a Rocket Boy for comment on Gerhard's claims, however neither the studio or publisher IOI was able to say more at this time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/early-nintendo-switch-2-used-day-1-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Those lucky enough to get a Nintendo Switch 2 before its official launch will only have a rather expensive paperweight on their hands until the system's day one update goes live, according to new online reports.</p>
<p>As reported by Wario64 on X following a short YouTube video featuring a quick unboxing of the system, which has since been removed but has been saved for posterity by <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1927448039330894258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Culture Crave</a>, a user who got an early unit of the console confirmed that the console cannot play any game, neither Switch 1 nor Switch 2 games, without downloading the day 1 update which cannot be done as of now, as the update function will not be available before June 5th, the day the system officially launches worldwide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Another person shared with me that they have a Nintendo Switch 2 as well. I have no permission to post pics but can share that when they try to boot a Switch 1 game, a message prompts "Please connect to the internet and update your system."</p>
<p>Needs update to boot a game <a href="https://t.co/18TU7Skk1D">pic.twitter.com/18TU7Skk1D</a></p>
<p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1927441748923457581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Though disappointing, the Nintendo Switch 2 not being able to play any game before its official release date next week will have no impact on the popularity of a system that is rightly expected to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/">massive success</a>. Launching with the system on June 5th are plenty of games that will definitely contribute to the system's popularity, such as Mario Kart World, which will likely feature a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-reverse-track-mode/">reverse track mode</a> as suggested by some recent footage, and a slew of third-party developers ports such as Cyberpunk 2077, which is already showing well <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-new-comparison-videos-highlight-how-the-game-and-technology-have-come-a-long-way-since-1-0-version/">before release</a> what the system is capable of, Hogwarts Legacy and a few others. The immediate future is also looking bright, with games like Donkey Kong Bananza and Metroid Prime 4: Echoes and others launching in 2026 and beyond, which may be able to deliver better visuals and performance by using more of the system resources than the launch window games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-nintendo-switch-2-resources-1-cpu-core-ram/">according to rumors</a>.</p>

The concern, he suggests, is that as they inevitably expand on a bedrock of first-party titles it will become harder for third-party studios and indies to cross that divide.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If the only way for people to play games is through subscriptions that's really dangerous, because what [type] of games can be created will be dictated by the owner of the subscription services," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's really, really risky because there always must always be fresh new ideas tried by small developers that create the next wave of development.
