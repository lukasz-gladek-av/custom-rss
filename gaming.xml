<p>In <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1846588233573937193" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter) yesterday</a>, Hazelight announced that&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>sales have reached the 20 million mark, which rather impressively means that the game has managed to shift another 10 million copies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-sales-stride-across-10-million-barrier">since February last year</a>.</p>
<p>If you were one of the millions who bought&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>and you enjoyed it, then you'll be pleased to know that Fares and his studio are currently working on a brand new IP, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/it-takes-two-sales-hazelight-new-ip-book.jpg?itok=VsNQDctF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/it-takes-two-sales-hazelight-new-ip-book.jpg?itok=pIqYkSAb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>How has&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>achieved 20 million sales? Why, through "co-llab-o-ra-tion", of course.</figcaption></figure><p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/josef_fares/status/1846928859213516992" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X earlier today</a>, Fares said that he's "getting a lot of questions" about the new game on which he and Hazelight are currently working.</p>
<p>He goes on to say that it's a brand new IP, the title of which will be "S*** ******n", which admittedly doesn't tell us much. Finally, he says that he "can't wait to show it soon". Could a Game Awards reveal be on the cards?</p>
<p>All we know about the new IP is that censored title and the fact that it will be released <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1846929745016987890" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sometime in the 2020s</a>, which...well, it's a release window of sorts, eh?</p>
<p>As you can imagine, some <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/josef-fares-and-hazelight-studios-next-game-is-confirmed-to-be-a-brand-new-ip-called-s-n.1012218/post-130295943" rel="noopener" target="_blank">people</a> are already <a href="https://x.com/DANNYonPC/status/1846929953633214554" rel="noopener" target="_blank">starting</a> to have fun <a href="https://x.com/SirJackSnake/status/1846933255498399990" rel="noopener" target="_blank">speculating</a> what the full name of Fares and Hazelight's new IP might be. I would love to see one of these titles as the final name, but sadly, I think it's probably pretty unlikely.</p>

<p>We'll bring you more on Hazelight's new IP as soon as we get it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/modders-are-using-ai-to-create-chatty-companions-in-skyrim-and-stardew.1012344/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24268007/modders-ai-companions-stardew-valley-skyrim<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In <em>Stardew Valley,</em> you can usually only speak to characters a few times per day. This limitation has led to a number of mods that add things for them to say so that players can spend more time with their virtual pals. But like many games, Stardew recently turned to AI, resulting in the addition of a mod with the ability to have theoretically endless conversations with your favorite farm companion.</p><p>“The reception has been a lot better than I initially thought [it would be],” says modder DualityOfSoul. In the comments on Nexus Mods, users have called it “brilliant” and “one of the best mods out this year.”</p><p>To function, the mod plugs into OpenAI’s API. The implementation is impressive but limited in its own way. Every character takes on a similar jovial personality that I’ve come to associate with the built-in parameters of these large language models. Grumpy camper Linus first tells me bluntly to leave him alone; this is his prewritten dialogue since he hasn’t warmed up to me yet. But click again, and I get the OpenAI dialogue — three long text boxes run one after the other. He calls me his friend and says he hopes I’ve “been finding peace in the beauty of nature.” Next, Pam complains that “every day is the same routine” before changing her tune to say she hopes “you’re enjoying the season as much as I am.”</p><p>The responses are somewhat tailored to the characters, and it works better when I’m not talking to grouchy NPCs. But the mod can’t easily escape that underlying voice. <em>Stardew</em> is a largely cheery game, especially after you’ve befriended everyone, so I can see how it can fit into the vibe for some players. But it’s a noticeable limitation.</p><div><figcaption><em>Stardew Valley.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: ConcernedApe</cite></p></div><p>That limitation is less present in Herika, an AI companion mod for <em>Skyrim</em>. Herika acts like most <em>Skyrim </em>companions, following the player and helping out in combat and elsewhere. But she <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DztAhbJT5Diw">will also respond to conversation</a>, both written and spoken. The LLM can draw from an understanding of the game’s map, quests, and key features and be assigned a personality. This means that she can be prompted to use a different style from the standard LLM voice, at least to a point.</p><p>Reece Meakings joined the Herika project after seeing the first iteration created by his now-coworker who goes by Tylermaister. The pair have expanded the mod from a tool to summarize the many books of <em>Skyrim</em> into a fully-fledged follower and intend to expand it again into a framework for any NPC to become an AI companion.</p><p>Nonetheless, Meakings doesn’t think that AI is ready to be used in game development more broadly. “It’s not going to work right now,” he says. For starters, using Herika or AI Stardew costs money. Both use OpenAI’s API, which charges the user a fraction of a cent per generated dialogue line. From the comments on Nexus, that low-level cost has put off a lot of players who are used to mods being entirely free. (Herika does offer a free option, but this requires running the LLM on your own setup, which is resource-intensive.) On a larger scale, any company will have to deal with the price of connecting to an API or running their own servers, multiplied across every player.</p><p>Then there’s the open-ended nature of how people interact with LLMs. “That completely changes how you [would] have to design the game,” says Meakings. Developers would lose linear control of dialogue trees and script triggers, quickly opening up possibilities that they didn’t account for in the narrative or worldbuilding. LLMs might be able to help NPCs keep up, but the rest of the game’s scripting wouldn’t have any way of adapting. Plus, he says, despite the safeguards companies attempt to use, it’s “very easy, if you know what you’re doing” to make these LLMs say things that are NSFW, potentially causing PR problems for companies that modders don’t have to consider.</p><p>At the moment, these larger-scale problems mean Meakings sees the most potential for AI in NPCs like Herika, particularly in the mod space. There are also AI NPC mods for games like <em>Hogwarts Legacy,</em> <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and <em>Garry’s Mod</em>. <em>Mantella</em>, another <em>Skyrim</em> mod that gives LLM interactions to every <em>Skyrim</em> NPC, has 30,000 unique downloads. (Herika has 25,000.) All of them have positive feedback — limitations aside, people are enjoying playing with AI-generated content.</p><p>Meakings’ own interactions with Herika give an indication as to why. In his experience, “you’ll really end up having meaningful conversations with something which isn’t human.” Although he understands that Herika is just a program, he’s clearly engaged by the fact that he’s been able to interact with her on a different level than previous characters. You don’t need to make small talk with Herika or stick to “ritualistic” social niceties. You can jump right to debating the philosophy and theology of <em>Skyrim</em>. In fact, you might need to because she can judge your actions.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Bethesda Softworks</cite></p></div><p>He gives a specific example. Playing as an Argonian, Meakings heard a rude comment about the lizard-like race from a standard NPC. “I [said,] ‘Hey, Herika, can you kill him? Please? He’s being racist to me.’” Herika refused, apparently either because of her own morality or because they were in a place with guards watching, which could have landed them in jail. Then, she started wandering away, talking about visiting the catacombs under the settlement.</p><p>At first, Meakings thought it was a bug. “But then I realized, ‘oh, I know what she did.’ …She realized, ‘oh, Reece is very angry. We can’t kill this person because we’re in the middle of a city — you can’t just kill people. I need to get him out of the situation… what if I lure him to his catacomb for treasures where we can get some space away from the situation?’” She seemed to be trying to diffuse things based on the tools available to her.</p><p>This kind of experience is not unique to this form of AI. Procedurally generated content creating emergent narratives through a combination of interesting behavior and player-led meaning-making is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22807568/procedural-storytelling-video-games-dwarf-fortress-wildermyth-blaseball">well documented</a>. But AI mods may open up more possibilities for these kinds of moments.</p><p>For that to happen, though, the LLMs need material to work with. Meakings is clear that Herika would not function without the wider framework of <em>Skyrim </em>since much of how she communicates relies on the writing of the original team. In a scenario in which LLMs are used as NPCs in a produced video game, they still could not exist without writers.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24206357/video-game-performer-strike-sag-aftra">video game performers strike</a> raises crucial questions about how these technologies will deal with digital replications of voice actors, something Nexus Mods treads carefully around. AI mods are allowed, but affected creators, including voice actors, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/14850">can ask for them to be removed</a> if they feel the “work is damaging to them.” (Herika has multiple options for generating her voice.)</p><p>The rollout of AI on the web has been fast and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24162896/google-ai-overview-hallucinations-glue-in-pizza">messy</a>, and how it might go in the game industry is still an open question. But thanks to modders, tens of thousands of players are already experimenting with it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

She’s angrily firing her signature green-and-pink shotgun up at Adam Smasher, the sadistic, foul-mouthed cyborg who permeates the <em>Cyberpunk</em> mythos and famously serves as the final boss of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. The statue depicts the bastard barrelling toward her from on high, and anyone who’s watched <em>Edgerunners</em> knows he is about to put the “smash” in Smasher and crush her in front of all of Night City. And now you, too, can relive this tragic moment for $300, plus shipping and handling.<br></p><p>The 14-inch-tall statue is set to ship out between May and July of next year, and even if it’s a kind of bizarre moment to capture in a collectible, it looks pretty damn good. Both Rebecca and Smasher are highly detailed, and there are a lot of small touches—like the bullet casings at her feet—that help tell a story in one moment, frozen in time. Thankfully, it doesn’t reveal the devastating ending, so any visitors to your home don’t need to know that you’re proudly displaying the moment before a disaster.

Hell, it was so good it more or less rehabilitated <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s image after its broken launch in 2020.

                <p>Steel oneself for a new challenge in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2's Operation mode with the arrival of Lethal difficulty. It's one of the biggest additions to the game as part of patch 4.0.</p><p dir="ltr">That's not all, either. The update--available now--introduces a new Operation named Termination as well as a photo mode. Termination takes place on Kaduku, and Space Marine 2 players can test out the Lethal difficulty there. Just be prepared for deadlier, enraged Majoris foes; limited refills on ammo crates; and the fact finishers must be executed near squadmates to receive armor restoration.</p><div tabindex="0"

With games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Honor of Kings</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> earning billions of dollars during their life cycle, mobile games clearly have ample opportunity to bring in revenue post-download from in-app purchases and ads. However, with hundreds of thousands of mobile games on the market, entering this arena can be daunting. How do you create a mobile game marketing strategy to make your game stand out from the crowd? In this article, we explore several ways of achieving this.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Crafting a winning mobile marketing plan">Crafting a winning mobile marketing plan</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Setting Clear and Measurable Objectives">Setting Clear and Measurable Objectives</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first action in your mobile game marketing strategy should be to set out your goals. Without clear and measurable objectives, you will struggle to quantify your success or pivot if your strategy does not yield results. Start by thinking about what your priorities are: what are you trying to achieve with your campaign (increasing your number of users or increasing your revenue per user?), who is your target market, where are you most likely to encounter these people (TikTok or Instagram, Facebook or Baidu?) and which KPIs will you need to use to measure your success (ad campaign conversion rate, click-through rate, average revenue per user, daily active users, or number of downloads)? Your marketing strategy will likely change over time as your KPIs help you keep track of what is and isn’t working.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Understanding mobile player demographics">Understanding mobile player demographics</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the key considerations in your mobile game marketing strategy will be who you are marketing to. You can’t please all of the people all of the time, so you will need to determine what sort of person belongs to your target market. Who is playing similar games already on the market? Where are they located, how much disposable income do they have per year, and what are their age ranges? Research your competitors to find out who’s playing their games, what they’re doing well and any areas for improvement that you could use in your own campaigns. Use tools such as Google Trends to help you identify key trends and conversations in your game’s genre. Carry out user surveys to discover your target market’s interests, habits and preferences so you can tailor your mobile game marketing specifically to them.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Via Pexels and LinkedIn</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Make sure your decisions are data-led—for example, according to the Mobile Marketing Association, female gamers spend 25% more time playing mobile games than men and comprise more than 50% of the mobile game market, and people aged 45 and older comprise 32% of the market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once you’ve determined your target market, investigate the best ways to reach these people and capture their attention. These will vary by demographic.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Advanced tactics in App Store Optimization (ASO)">Advanced tactics in App Store Optimization (ASO)</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Mastering the ASO fundamentals">Mastering the ASO fundamentals</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A winning mobile game marketing strategy cannot ignore app store optimization (ASO). ASO involves enhancing your game’s visibility and ranking in app stores so your target market can find, download and enjoy it. Critical steps in this process include:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Choosing a relevant title that contains the right keywords to improve searchability.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Selecting the appropriate app category for your game.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creating and optimizing visual assets such as gameplay videos and screenshots to increase the appeal of the listings in search and browsing results.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Engaging with users directly by replying to app store reviews to build user trust and confidence in your game.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Dedicating resources to improving load times and performance across older devices to retain existing users.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Localizing your game to appeal and cater to a broader user base.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Optimizing your game’s metadata with relevant keywords.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ensuring that you have clear messaging to enhance your conversion rates.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Customizing your icons, screenshots and even videos during global and local holidays to increase your game’s chances of being featured.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Try out and build on several different ASO strategies to discover what works best for your game. Cover all bases by uploading your app on all platforms, but bear in mind that it is more labor-intensive to change out marketing assets on the App Store (which requires a submission for each change, excluding updates to game descriptions) than on Google Play. The optimal ASO strategy will drive organic downloads, maximize visibility, and improve conversion rates, ultimately leading to all-around success for your game.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Staying ahead with ASO Trends">Staying ahead with ASO Trends</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like any other industry, mobile game marketing stands to benefit from advances in AI technology. There are numerous case studies demonstrating where AI can add value and save time in the ASO process, including keyword optimization, image and icon design, and data insight generation and summarization. Some examples include:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Trawling your market research to identify user personas for targeted ads or feedback sentiment, allowing you to focus on eradicating pain points and highlight positive feedback in your game’s description.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finding the best-performing keywords based on your game description and other games in the same category.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creating eye-catching icons.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Storyboarding videos and creating voiceovers for ad campaigns.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Carrying out data and market analysis to identify trends in the market and among your competitors.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using insights to adjust your ad spend budget.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Analyzing user behavior to provide suggestions to improve your marketing strategy.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When technological advancements appear, new data privacy regulations are never far behind. Keep an eye on any developments in this space, as you will need to ensure that the way you use and collect user data for ASO remains compliant with any such laws.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another ASO trend due to impact mobile game marketing strategies in 2024 is the evolution of app stores, sparking the need for marketers to prioritize the app discovery user experience. With the use of voice search and AI digital assistants rapidly increasing, mobile game marketers will have to consider how they will optimize their game metadata to ensure they remain discoverable and relevant.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Visual elements will be another cornerstone of the 2024 ASO landscape. Eye-catching screenshots, unique icons, and engaging short-form videos can all positively influence your conversion rate. For maximum impact, ensure these visual assets show off your game’s best features and are optimized for various screen sizes and devices.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Harnessing the power of social and influencer engagement">Harnessing the power of social and influencer engagement</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Building Relationships with Influencers">Building Relationships with Influencers</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Influencer engagement has become a stalwart of mobile game marketing strategies. Trust and credibility are decisive factors driving downloads—bringing in someone who has built a solid audience comprising members of your target market to act as your ambassador can give your players that extra confidence to click the download button and help increase your exposure and boost your engagement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before you get started, condense your value proposition into a media kit. This typically includes information about your studio and team, a one-pager that explains the game’s premise and USPs, some screenshots to serve as visual aids and potentially a trailer. There are two benefits to this: it will help keep your influencer search criteria on track and you can share it with influencers to show them what they would be working with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To find the right influencers, search platforms such as Twitch and YouTube for those with a strong viewership who are already creating content relevant to your game’s genre. Make sure they post regularly. Tools such as Lurkit and Social Blade can prove useful if you would like some help with this process. Be sure to choose influencers across several platforms, as this allows you to adapt your marketing to each platform’s strengths to show off different aspects of your game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Building a relationship with an influencer is best done organically rather than through cold calling. Make sure you’re following them on social media. Show genuine interest in their work—comment on some of their posts that appeal to you or tag them in a relevant post of your own. When you reach out to them, keep it short and sweet. A personal touch can make all the difference. Highlight what makes your game unique and why it would be a good fit for their audience. Avoid the temptation to use the same message for each influencer you contact—personalize your message to show them you’re interested in what they bring to the table. Mention something you feel they do well and point out areas where you have common ground. Remember that influencers are busy people and may not immediately see your message—patience will serve you well. If, after a few days, you have not received a response, send a follow-up message.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When you have found the right influencers who are willing to work with you and your campaigns are underway, remember that you still need to maintain your relationship with your influencers. Check in with them regularly to see how they are doing and how the campaign is coming along, but keep it casual—you don’t want to enter micromanagement territory. Allow them to feed back to you—they may have some ideas on better ways to shape your mobile game marketing campaign.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Creating shareable and engaging social content">Creating shareable and engaging social content</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To get the most out of your mobile game marketing strategy, your marketing assets must capture people’s imaginations. The best way to do this is to create something shareable and engaging. The most engaging social content is tailored to the interests, characteristics and behaviors of the target audience, so make sure you do plenty of market research. Try and create something unique, intriguing or thought-provoking—generic posts will get lost in the crowd.</span></p><p>Via Pexels creator Zhang Kaiyv</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As mentioned earlier, visuals are key—high-quality artwork that is consistently themed across all assets with colors that pop rather than clash will perform well. Test your content across various devices and screen sizes so you can be sure that everyone who encounters it can fully appreciate it. Ensure that any text in images and videos is succinct and large enough to read. Consider sound and sound tagging on platforms such as TikTok to increase exposure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Keep track of and engage in current trends. Relatable, on-trend content stays at the top of search results and increases your reach. You should have a good grasp of the platforms on which your marketing appears so you can tailor it to that specific type of content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A great way to spark engagement is to encourage interaction—create a challenge, ask a question or run a poll, enticing people to comment or share with their peers to invite them to join in. The ultimate tool to promote sharing is a call to action (CTA)—now they’ve seen your content, tell them what they need to do next, be that to comment, share, subscribe, or click on a link.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Data-driven campaigns for enhanced user acquisition">Data-driven campaigns for enhanced user acquisition</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Key metrics to track and analyze">Key metrics to track and analyze</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Any successful mobile game marketing strategy needs metrics to measure its effectiveness. There are several key metrics you can use to track and analyze the performance of your marketing:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>(CTR):</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The proportion of users who see and click on your ad. In a nutshell, the higher the CTR, the more profitable your monetization strategy is.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Conversion rate (CVR): </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">The proportion of users who see your ad, click on it, and then carry out your desired action (for example, clicking a button to download the game). This is the holy grail of mobile game marketing strategy metrics. Multiplying your CVR by your CTR will give you your </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>overall conversion rate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>oCVR</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">), which should be increasing to allow you to buy installs at a lower cost.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cost per install (CPI):</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> How much you spend on getting a single user to install your mobile game. The lower this is, the more effective your campaigns will be, especially if your CPI is lower than your average revenue per user (ARPU).</span></p></div></li></ul></div><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Making data-informed decisions to refine strategies">Making data-informed decisions to refine strategies</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now you have some examples of key metrics to track, how do you leverage them to gauge the effectiveness of your mobile game marketing strategy? First, you’ll need to find an appropriate data analytics tool. The right tool for the job will be compatible with your marketing tools. Look for helpful features such as real-time data processing and user segmentation. Once you’ve selected a tool, integrate it with your game. The tool will allow you to choose the actions or events to monitor. You’ll need to regularly review the data generated and assess how well it aligns with your game and mobile game marketing strategy objectives. The tool may have this functionality built into it, but you could equally engage an AI tool to identify any patterns or insights for you.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">An example may be a low click-through rate that may suggest that you need to adjust the time your ad appears or where it appears. Use these insights to adapt your strategy accordingly. Other changes may include updating the keywords, retargeting your ads to a more appropriate audience, reducing your game’s price or running a one-time offer. There are several different methods of analyzing the data:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A/B testing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Providing multiple versions of your ad or game to users to determine which yields the best results. This is best done when your game is already quite established, with significant amounts of data and a sizable budget.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Descriptive analysis</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Looking at the numbers to facilitate quantitative analysis of the data. This includes, for example, taking averages of how long a user spends watching your video ad.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Explanatory analysis</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Digging deeper into the data to spot relationships or patterns between two or more aspects. For example, the age ranges of people clicking on your ad compared with the platform where it appeared. Data visualizations, such as charts, are critical in this method.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inferential analysis</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Testing out theories on a sample of data, which will help provide some statistical information about your mobile game marketing strategy. This is a good starting point as it helps simplify and streamline this process compared to predictive analysis, which demands more time and resources.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Predictive analysis</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Harnessing machine learning to look at the current state of play to predict future events. This is best done when you have gathered a sizable amount of data, as this will improve the accuracy of the predictions.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Remember to regularly analyze your data, even after your game gathers steam, as there will inevitably be peaks and troughs.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hazelight Studios has teased its next project, and by tease I really do mean tease, as the developer has left me with more questions than answers.</p>
<p>Hazelight, best known for its co-op platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a>, shared a mysterious image earlier today, showing a stack of papers and a collection of post-it notes. The top paper reads, "New IP", which has been circled in yellow highlighter.</p>
<p>However, the project's actual title has been left as just a biro score line, while its release date is 202... with another biro scribble followed by a question mark. So, it could be coming anytime from now, 2024, until 2029.</p>

<p>A corner of the paper underneath, meanwhile, sees the names Mio and Zoe repeating, and as for those post-it notes, there is reference to "co-op" and then "ouch", so maybe this could become couch co-op, like It Takes Two?</p>
<p>Hazelight founder Josef Fares also shared a tease for the studio's next game. The bombastic director said he had been getting "a lot of questions" about what the studio is cooking up, and then went on to proclaim: "It is a BRAND NEW IP called S*** ******N."</p><p>But what on earth could S*** ******N be? Well, Eurogamer's own Matt Wales suggested Sexy Bassoon, and to be honest, if it's not this now, I will be sorely disappointed (although, would also be open to hearing your own suggestions of what S*** ******N could be).</p>
<p>Thankfully, Fares ended his enigmatic post by saying he can't wait to show the game off "soon", so we shouldn't be left in suspense for too much longer. See you at The Game Awards again, Josef?</p>

<p>Elsewhere in studio news, earlier today Hazelight announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marital-platformer-it-takes-two-sales-pass-20m">It Takes Two has now sold a rather impressive 20m copies</a> since its release in 2021. This means the game has sold a further 4m copies since March of this year, when the developer announced the game had sold 16m.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> and Borderlands publisher 2K has announced Project Ethos, a new "roguelike hero shooter" dreamt up by Michael Condrey, the former co-founder of Call of Duty studio Sledgehammer Games. 
</p>
<p>
Project Ethos is the first project from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2k-rebrands-studio-headed-by-sledgehammer-co-founder-to-31st-union">Condrey's current team 31st Union, which was founded back in February 2019</a>. Prior to that, Condrey, along with Glen Schofield, had worked on a string of Call of Duty hits, including Modern Warfare 3 (the 2011 one), Advanced Warfare, and WW2.
</p>
<p>
A colourful free-to-play third-person hero shooter, the game visually looks similar to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> (and the recently released and deceased Concord). Indeed, 31st Union has Overwatch DNA running through it, courtesy of Blizzard narrative designer Michael Chu, who holds the same position on this project also.
</p>
<p>
How is Project Ethos a roguelike? Today's announcement by 2K reveals the game features "powerful, semi-randomised upgrades unique to each hero" which let you evolve your fighters in real-time through each game. 
</p>
<p>
There's an extraction mode, because of course, which sounds like it offers the usual risk/reward gameplay loop of lingering to gather more resources or leaving more safely with less. 
</p>
<p>
If you'd like to give it a go, <a href="https://playprojectethos.com/playtest/">2K is shadow dropping a community playtest which is live right now</a> - as of 5pm UK time on 17th October - which will run until 1am later tonight. 
</p>
<p>
A second, longer playtest will then run from tomorrow, 18th October, at 1pm UK time to 21st October at 1am UK time.
</p>
<p>
This playtest will offer the game's extraction mode, named Trials, and also a competitive head-to-head mode, named Gauntlet, where you fight to be the last player standing. 
</p>
<p>So, fancy giving it a go?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The collection was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yu-gi-oh-early-days-collection-revealed-for-switch-and-pc-western-release-confirmed">first revealed back in February</a>, at which point it was also confirmed that the package would include games that have only previously been released in Japan.

It’s down to $21.99 ($8 off) at Amazon for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJTKYLCB?tag=theverge02-20">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Resident-Evil-4-Xbox-X-PlayStation/dp/B0BJTSN9ZC?tag=theverge02-20">Xbox Series X/S</a>.

It quickly becomes apparent that the cannibalistic desires of the townsfolk aren’t due to sheer psychosis and viral mutation alone. The <em>RE4</em> remake is very faithful to the original third-person action shooter, which was a stark departure from the pure survival horror feel of preceding titles. It won’t have many surprises for those who obsessed over the original nearly 20 years ago. </p><p>That said, if you thought the graphical fidelity of the original is a little too dated to make your skin crawl, you’ll be happy (or terrified) to once again fight your way through hordes of las plagas. Capcom enhanced several scenes and environments to considerably dial up the creepiness. There are also several new gameplay mechanics, such as the ability to crouch and parry, plus new side activities, accessibility tweaks, and several quality-of-life changes like an overhauled attaché that lets you craft ammo. Trust me, you’ll be glad to have it.</p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23642938/resident-evil-4-remake-review-xbox-ps5-steam">Read our <em>Resident Evil 4<strong> </strong></em>review</a>.</h5></p><div><p>The 2023 version of <em>RE4 </em>is a remake of the 2005 GameCube classic.

The original price tag was a lot to ask for something with aging display tech (it’s an average 1080p TV, albeit one with Dolby Vision and Atmos) and enough heft to deter you from taking a TV literally everywhere you go, but today’s discount helps for those with peculiar needs. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24109258/lg-stanbyme-go-portable-suitcase-briefcase-tv-review">Read our review</a>.</li><li>You can get an <strong>Anker Prime 20,000mAh 200W power bank with its charging base</strong> for $109.99 ($75 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Charger-Charging-Compatible/dp/B0BYP45YVF?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/2171699/9383?subId1=vergeroundupdeals101724&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAnker-Prime-Power-Bank-200W-20K-Portable-Charger-3-Port-100W-Charging-Base-Smart-Digital-Display-Compatible-iPhone-15-15-Plus-15-Pro-15-Pro-Max-14-Se%2F5188824224">Walmart</a>, which is matching the combo’s all-time low.

            <p>Back in 2021, that dark epoch known as the Pre-Edwin Age, there was but one Ed at Rock Paper Shotgun - the venerable Ed Thorn, aka Edders. Edders had a dream, the dream of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-hate-to-admit-it-but-i-wish-halo-infinite-had-a-battle-royale-mode">Halo Infinite getting a battle royale mode</a><a></a>. Like Moses descending from the mount with a Needler in either hand, he bedazzled and amazed us with visions of "an enormous playground stitched together from some of Halo's most iconic maps of yore; Warthogs and Mongooses roaming the lands; players racing to the M41 SPNKR as it spawns; grappling to a rooftop and laying down covering fire; some contrived reason as to why there's a circle of poison gas closing in... but hey, rings are what Halo does best, right? It's 100% doable."</p>
<p>Ed Thorn has always been a journalist of great sagacity and supernatural insight, so it was of no surprise to the RPS editors of the era when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/halo-infinite-support-studio-hint-at-a-big-project-that-could-be-rumoured-battle-royale-mode">rumours bubbled up a few months later</a> that Certain Affinity had partnered with 343 Industries (nowadays Halo Studios) to make Halo battle royale a reality. These rumours have now been confirmed by Certain Affinity's former design director Mike Clopper, who says the now-cancelled mode could have been a "game changer".</p><!--more-->
<p>That's pretty much all Clopper had to say, sadly. Here's the full quote from his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-clopper-9300811/">LinkedIn</a>, as passed along by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dev-claims-cancelled-halo-infinite-battle-royale-could-have-been-game-changing/">VGC</a>:</p>
<blockquote>I led a large team of designers working on a cancelled Battle Royale mode for Halo. I believe this product could have been a game changer for the franchise. We loved playing it and working on it, was a fantastic experience in spite of its cancelation.</blockquote>
<p>In the absence of anything further from Clopper, who is now design director at Call Of Duty developer Raven Software, I guess I'll echo Ed's sentiment that Halo battle royale could have been fabulous. The battle royale's star is thoroughly sunk, of course. Everybody's sick of them, even the millions who play Fortnite, which I barely comprehend as a game any longer: it's more of a giant intellectual property festival. Did you know they have an Edward Scissorhands now? Nonetheless, Halo's existing big team modes feel like a natural foundation for an excellent battle royale.</p><p>As Edders argues, one of the genre's virtues is its capacity to act as a flexible hangout space: you can decide exactly how intense you want the experience to be simply by choosing your initial landing site. It reminds me of how I'd chill out on Blood Gulch simply by avoiding the bases and heading for the caves or the deeper dunes. The key thing would be preserving the physics, with such large groups of players involved, because what would a Halo game be without the joy of flipping a Warthog with a surgical grenade throw? </p>
<p>Certainly, I'll take this over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/halos-future-as-an-unreal-engine-game-looks-both-handsome-and-boring-going-by-these-project-foundry-videos">Halo Studios's current visions for Halo as an Unreal Engine series</a>, which seem overly cautious and dedicated to more cosmetic questions of texture and lighting, possibly because the videos in question were designed for the purposes of recruiting Unreal Engine developers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The ex-PlayStation executive blamed nine-figure development costs for less willingness among big publishers to take risks. The result is games getting greenlit based on how well their revenue can be modeled instead of whether they feel fun and innovative. </p><p> “You’re [looking] at sequels, you’re looking at copycats, because the finance guys who draw the line say, ‘Well, if <em>Fortnite </em>made this much money in this amount of time, my <em>Fortnite</em> knockoff can make this in that amount of time,’” Layden said. “We’re seeing a collapse of creativity in games today [with] studio consolidation and the high cost of production.” </p><h2 id="h180"><a id=""></a>A ‘hard reset’ on the console arms race</h2><p>During the event, Layden <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/former-playstation-exec-says-console-arms-race-has-plateaued/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/former-playstation-exec-says-console-arms-race-has-plateaued/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was also asked by<em> VGC</em></a></span> if the incremental improvements recently demonstrated in the controversial $700 PS5 Pro show the limits of new hardware.

It has to be super optimal…you have to have an 8K monitor in a dark room to see these things.”</p><p>The executive said the console power chase has hit a “ceiling” and called for companies to compete on content rather than specs. “It’s time for a real hard reset on the business model, a hard reset on what it is to be a video game,” he told <em>VGC</em>. </p><p>This isn’t the first time the former Sony veteran <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-acquisition-preservation-1850951069?_gl=1*mdse6v*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTE3MDc1OC4xNzguMS4xNzI5MTc1NzM1LjQwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-acquisition-preservation-1850951069?_gl=1*mdse6v*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTE3MDc1OC4xNzguMS4xNzI5MTc1NzM1LjQwLjAuMA..">has sounded the alarm</a></span> about the long-term health of the gaming industry.

</p><p><strong>Melee Perks</strong>: Chainsword, Power Fist, Combat Knife charged attacks perks get significant damage increase.
</p><p><strong>Basic Auspex Scan</strong>: bonus damage on bosses is reduced by 30%.
</p><p><strong>Melta Charge</strong>: damage to bosses is reduced by 70%.
</p><p><strong>​Enemy Spawn Director PvE</strong>:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Tweaked idle spawns.</li><li>Enemy variety within waves is now less random while enemy variety between waves is bigger.</li><li>Extremis enemies can now spawn with additional enemies.</li></ul><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Ruthless: Ammo crates have limited refills per player.</li><li>Ruthless: Player's armour reduced by 20%.</li><li>Substantial: Player's armour reduced by 10%</li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It’s worth highlighting the change to fencing weapons’ perfect parry window (Space Marine 2 combat is all about well-timed perfect parries, indeed they’re essential for success on the harder PvE difficulties because they let you follow up with a high damage shot from your pistol).</p><p>Fencing weapons were by far the most popular weapon type in the game due to their more generous perfect parry window compared to the balance weapon type (block weapons can't perfect parry). But Update 4.0 limits fencing weapons' active parry frames to the first half of the parry animation (frames 1-10), whereas pre-patch it covered the entirety of the animation. This means fencing weapons now revolve around parrying at the last moment; indeed it may be the case that the developers wish for fencing weapons to lean on last moment parries.</p><p>In contrast, balance weapons parry frames 11-20, and so require players predict a parry in advance. There are trade-offs here when you get down to the stats, but the perception of this change right now is currently a negative one, given it halves the active parry frames of all fencing weapons.</p><p>Then there’s the significant nerf to the basic Auspex Scan, which was a popular, some say essential method of doing bonus damage on enemies and bosses (some of the Operations mode bosses are incredibly tough, especially on harder difficulties).</p><p>The change to the Melta Charge has also sparked a backlash. This one-hit high damage piece of equipment (you can only carry one at a time) was often used against bosses to give Space Marines a fighting chance on higher difficulties. Now, players say, they’re next to useless.</p><p>And then there are the changes made to the ruthless and substantial difficulties, which make Operations mode a lot harder for everyone chasing rewards tied to those tiers.</p><p>Even on the new Lethal difficulty, which is designed to be brutally hard, players have complained about its exclusive mechanic that only restores armor from finishers if you stay close to your teammates (restoring armor through finishers is essential to survival in Space Marine 2).</p><p>Anyone who has played Space Marine 2’s Operations mode will know it’s not easy to stick together, especially when playing with randoms. Some of the more raid-style mechanics in the Operations require player coordination while Space Marines do their thing in different spots on the map. Players are now reporting that the radius players must be within to restore armor is tiny. This change, then, feels like a particularly harsh kick in the teeth.</p><p>The backlash has been aggressive and swift. The official Space Marine 2 discord is packed with complaints, as is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1g5ocmw/whats_with_all_the_bullshit_nerfs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Space Marine subreddit</a>. “STOP THE NERF GIVE US FUN,” declared Wyndolll. “Haven't you learned from Helldivers 2 experience? Nerf player = negative reaction.”</p><p>“‘Thanks for the nerfs in my PvE powerfantasy game,’ said no one ever,” said a clearly disgruntled Aspharr. “What’s with all the bullshit nerfs,” added Old_Competition8765. “Extremely disappointing to see this game going the way of Helldivers. Hope they do proper balancing and not this lazy nerf shit.”</p><p>The mention of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> is of course a reference to the backlash Arrowhead suffered from doing pretty much what Saber Interactive has done here: nerf the game at a time when players were hoping for buffs. Arrowhead spent a great deal of time, energy, and resources getting its playerbase back on-side, culminating with a recent update that rebalanced the entire game.</p><p>Will Space Marine 2 end up stumbling down the same path? There are early signs players may review bomb the game to voice their displeasure. On Steam, Space Marine 2's recent user review rating remains ‘very positive,’ but at the time of this article’s publication, 181 new negative reviews were left so far today, October 17. That number, many more than is usual for a single day, seems likely to grow.</p><p>For Focus and Saber’s part, in today’s Patch 4 notes they admitted the changes would make Operations mode harder and promised to keep an eye on feedback. The developers made the changes, they said, because they felt Operations mode was too easy, especially after the release of Patch 3. “This is not the last change,” they promised.</p><p>Here’s the statement:</p><p>"With Patch 3 we have noticed that Operations mode became noticeably easier, especially Chaos operations. We are happier with what we have right now compared to what we had on release, because before Patch 3 Chaos missions were unpopular. Still, we think that currently Operations mode is a bit too easy.</p><p>"Overall these changes are going to make Operations mode harder, but it is difficult to measure by how much. We will continue to monitor those changes and will continue to adjust the balance of Operations mode. This is not the last change."</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/unknown-9-awakening-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unknown-9-awakening-review.1012239/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/unknown-9-awakening-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>It only took 10 minutes of playing Unknown 9: Awakening for me to feel a keen sense of deja vu. Taking out enemies in small arenas, watching an emotional story of personal growth, and squeezing between plenty of tight cracks in walls – it’s a formula that feels all too familiar, sticking to the well-established traditions of the "Crevice Crawler" genre. It does try out one or two unique ideas to set itself apart, like mind-control powers that let you play puppet master with your enemies, but the problem is that it executes on the fundamentals significantly worse than its contemporaries. There are certainly glimmers of hope within that new stuff, but any novelty quickly wears off, resulting in a generic and underwhelming slog full of performance issues and other jankiness to boot.</p><p>Set in an alternate-reality version of the early 20th century, you play as Haroona, a distrustful woman who loves spouting trite platitudes that has been imbued with the power to tap into an unseen dimension called the Fold. Her powers let you do typical magic stuff like go invisible for a brief period of time, Force push and pull baddies around like an off-brand Jedi, and enter a ghost form so you can walk around and solve the easiest puzzles ever conceived. You'll use them to worm your way through a series of small arenas separated by cutscenes clearly pining to be the next HBO adaptation – if you’ve played <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-i-review">The Last of Us</a> or <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">God of War</a> then you already get the idea, but instead of finely-tuned combat encounters and nail-biting stealth sections, Awakening offers sloppy fisticuffs and barebones crouch-fests.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Unknown 9: Awakening Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Despite the extremely generic setup, the worldbuilding here is actually not half bad, and there’s clearly been a lot of time and effort put into establishing this universe’s timeline, lore, and supernatural rules. Like a knock-off Indiana Jones, this alternate version of Earth is home to mystical secrets and hidden histories kept just out of reach in parts unknown, including a mysterious cycle of extinction, a race of beings who cheated death by making themselves immortal, and secret societies vying for paranormal knowledge. Unfortunately, that promising foundation doesn’t do the story itself much good, as Haroona’s predictable tale is full of cliches and unremarkable characters, eventually getting horribly lost in a sea of magical jargon and convoluted references that completely whiffed on any attempt to make me care about what was happening.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Haroona’s predictable tale is full of cliches and unremarkable characters, eventually getting horribly lost in a sea of magical jargon.</p></div><p>A lot of that wonky journey will provide opportunities for sneaking about to dispatch enemies discreetly, but the stealth is extremely run of the mill and offers few innovations. You’ve got a ghostly rock you can throw to distract people and you will, of course, spend plenty of time hanging out in tall grass where no guardsman has ever thought to look. Unfortunately, the hopelessly dumb AI has a hard time detecting you even when you’re making things explode and leaving bodies in plain view. Still, there’s some small enjoyment to be had in the subpar stealth, as feeling like a master of the shadows who can clear an entire area without being spotted is still rewarding to pull off. Plus, your companions will sometimes comment on how sneaky you are if you can get through a section without being caught – that’s a nice touch.</p><p>Sadly, you’ll have fewer opportunities to engage with stealth than you might think, as Awakening railroads you into outright combat frequently and with great relish. This weirdly seems to happen more and more as you get deeper into the roughly eight-hour story, which wouldn't be as much of a problem if it weren't for the false choices it sets up in its skill trees. This simple three-pronged upgrade system makes you better at combat, stealth, or mind control abilities as you collect barely hidden “Gnosis Points,” and does basic things like allow you to remain invisible for longer or make your melee attacks do more damage. After spending the vast majority of my skill points on the stealth abilities tree only to see those encounters dry up, I began to wonder if I’d wasted my efforts and started hedging my bets by investing in other playstyles.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat is easily one of the things Awakening does worst.</p></div><p>It’s really unfortunate that you’ll find yourself in more straightforward combat as you go, too, because it’s easily one of the things Awakening does worst. These wimpy encounters pit you against the same handful of enemy soldiers who wield guns and melee weapons, and they mostly amount to the typical dodging, light attacks, and heavy attacks recipe you’ll have seen in dozens of games before, only less polished. I played my entire run on the hardest difficulty and the AI is so stupid that the vast majority of the time I was able to fudge my way through battles by spamming the same set of attacks and effortlessly moving out of the way of highly telegraphed moves.</p><p>Whether you’re squatting behind crates or punching dumb minions, at least you’ll be able to enjoy Awakening’s best feature: mind-control powers. You can leap out of your body and into others with the press of a button, then use those dim meat puppets to carry out your twisted designs, including activating that unit’s special ability to wreak havoc on the environment or their fellow villains. For example, you can possess one of the big bruisers and use his ground pound ability near a cluster of his friends to deal a ton of damage, or you can take over one of the sniper enemies and have him shoot at a piece of surveillance equipment to make your stealth job easier.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>TieGuyTravis’ Favorite Crevice Crawlers</h3><p>If you enjoy sad stories that incorporate slowly sidling through rocks, then this playlist is for you!</p></div><p>As you progress, you’ll eventually be able to chain-possess multiple enemies in a row, instructing them to perform various misdeeds, then watch it all play out in slow motion, which can be a lot of fun. It’s not exactly revolutionary stuff and starts to grow a bit tiresome by the time you reach credits, but it’s definitely the most entertaining part of an otherwise disappointing adventure. Also, quite hysterically, if you start making your foes kill each other while remaining hidden nearby, they seem only vaguely aware that you’re messing with them and quickly go back to what they were doing – because, again, they are so very stupid. That's definitely not a <em>good</em> thing, but it did at least crack me up with regularity.</p><p>If sloppy encounters and a weak story aren’t discouraging enough, Awakening also suffers from various performance issues, bugs, and general jankiness throughout. The framerate dipped on a regular basis while I was playing on a Ryzen 9/RTX 4090 PC, including during combat in moments that might get you killed. Haroona likes to get stuck on objects and bounce in place bizarrely, and cutscenes do this really weird thing where they jump abruptly between a bunch of shots that only last a couple seconds each, like they storyboarded the scene but never bothered finishing it. That last one is mostly kind of funny, but it also adds to a general lack of polish that makes an already subpar game feel even more feeble.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Unknown 9: Awakening is the kind of routine action-adventure game that probably wouldn't blow me away even if it was executed well – and the fact that it isn’t just makes the whole thing fall completely flat. Everything from the formulaic story to the shallow and dull combat and stealth are well below the standard set by genre peers, and the consistently disheveled performance and bugs don’t do Awakening any favors. There’s at least some fun to be had in its interesting reality-bending powers, especially the mind-controlling abilities that let you briefly play as your foes and sabotage the enemy in clever ways, but these bright spots run their course quickly, leaving us with a wholly underwhelming adventure.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Former 30-year Sony veteran Shawn Layden, who served as one of Sony's top gaming bosses during his tenure, has commented on the state of video game hardware advancements. He said at Gamescom Asia this week that he believes increased power alone no longer moves the needle.</p><p>"It has plateaued. We're at the stage of hardware development that I call, 'Only dogs can hear the difference,'" he said, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/former-playstation-exec-says-console-arms-race-has-plateaued/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported by VGC</a>. "If you're playing your game and sunlight is coming through your window onto your TV, you're not seeing any ray tracing. It has to be super optimal… you have to have an 8K monitor in a dark room to see these things."</p><p>Layden went on to say Microsoft and Sony are "fighting over teraflops," but he believes this is not the right approach. Instead, he wants to see game companies "compete on content" because he believes video game consoles have "reached the ceiling."</p><p>The real winner of the so-called console war, Layden said, is AMD. The company's chips help power both the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Looking to the future, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-powered-by-familiar-chipmaker-report/1100-6526499/" data-ref-id="1100-6526499">recent report said Sony will partner with AMD once again for the PS6</a>, after Intel reportedly courted Sony for a deal.</p><p>While Sony has yet to officially confirm plans for a new PlayStation console, Microsoft has discussed its intention to create the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">"biggest technological leap"</a> ever for any video game console. It remains to be seen what that means in practice, but a recent report said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">next Xbox could be paired with a handheld device. </a></p><p>Instead of focusing on improvements to gaming hardware, Layden said the video game industry has "reached the precipice" for how games are made, and it's no longer sustainable.</p><p>"We cannot continue to do things that we have done before," he said. "It's time for a real hard reset on the business model, a hard reset on what it is to be a video game."</p><p>Also during his Gamescom Asia speech, Layden spoke about what he believes is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-talks-about-the-collapse-of-creativity-in-aaa-game-development/1100-6527223/" data-ref-id="1100-6527223">"collapse of creativity" in the video game industry</a>.</p>

Since then, there's been little news about the next mainline installment in the Arma franchise. But during Bohemia Interactive's 25th-anniversary concert earlier this week, fans who were in attendance got to see the live announcement that Arma 4 will be released in 2027.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC-uT5rc9HQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cC-uT5rc9HQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Bohemia also streamed the anniversary concert on YouTube, which featured the Czech National Symphony Orchestra playing selections from Arma, DayZ, Ylands, and Vigor.

It wasn't even on screen very long, but it still left an impression on fans of the military tactical-shooter franchise.</p><p>The original Arma was released in 2006, while Arma 2 and Arma 3 followed in 2009 and 2013, respectively. It's one of Bohemia's most successful game series, and Arma 3 was supported by a number of DLC releases through 2021.

			<p>As the long dark nights set it what could be more attractive than some warm Arizona Sunshine? Sure, you are going to fight past hordes of zombies to get a sun lounger by the pool, but that’s a small price to pay if you want to top up your tan.</p>
<p>The original Arizona Sunshine launched in December 2016 with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/27/arizona-sunshine-playstation-vr-review/">favourable reviews</a> and was followed by a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/06/arizona-sunshine-2-review/">sequel last year.&nbsp;</a> Vertigo games have now taken all the improvements from that sequel and applied them to a total remake of the original, bringing new graphics, new mechanics and even a few tweaks to the maps.</p>
<p><iframe title="Arizona Sunshine Remake Compared –&nbsp;An essential upgrade?" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gM9UPrBeUkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story remains the same. Our unnamed protagonist wakes up in their cave seemingly months or years into a zombie apocalypse, but has his spirits lifted when he hears a radio message. Could there be more survivors? A five hour campaign follows which can be played solo or with online co-op as our man works his way through caves, train stations, and factories in a bid to locate the source of the broadcast. </p>
<p>The gameplay loop is fairly predictable, a few zombies at the start of each level and then you reach a blocker of some kind which will require a specific item to let you continue. From then on it’s some exploring, more zombie culling before returning, unblocking the doohicky, and being swarmed by a huge number of zombies.</p>

<p>When I say I huge number I am not exaggerating, the difficulty spikes through the roof. One one encounter I used every single bullet I had but the zombies were still coming and I had to run an lap of the map to lead them away from the exit so I could make a dash for it. You do need to play tactically and take out the fast moving critters first, then the armoured zombies and leave the shamblers till last.</p>

<p>The new graphics allow for plenty of gore with limbs popping off and blood gushing from wounds, plus new lighting, explosions effects. The realistic gun reloading mechanic from the sequel is now in place which really adds the tension, fumbling around for a new magazine, inserting and then cocking the gun may just take a second but when you are being chased by zombies, every second counts.</p>
<p>Arizona Sunshine is fairly simple but a lot of fun, casually head-shotting a zombie in the distance is immensely satisfying and the co-op mode is a laugh, whether it’s waving a bendy sausage at your friend or watching their pained ‘I really need to go to the toilet’ walking animations. </p>
<p>The script is also good. While our man does that video game trope of talking to himself so the player knows what to do, it’s not over used and there’s incidental dialogue which really make you warm to the character. He feels like someone that’s spent a good long while alone and started talking to the Zombies. </p>

<p>Unfortunately the remake has also inherited some of the problems of the sequel, most notably that you can stick you head through certain objects and walls and the screen goes black. When you are being chased by rabid zombies you do not want to lose your vision just because you have backed into the arm of a cactus. The engine does seem to have been improved upon as the pop in that was really annoying in the sequel is not present, although the levels are much smaller. I’m also happy to report I didn’t encounter a single bug, a relief given that the sequel was a bit of a mess when it launched.</p><p>
[agallery ids=”453858,453857,453856″]
</p><p>On top the base game you also a get a Horde mode and both DLC packs in the price which makes up for the shorter campaign, and you can upgrade from the original for $10 which seems very reasonable consdering the huge improvements that have been made.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		It seems odd giving a remake of game a higher score than it's sequel but the Arizona Sunshine Remake takes all of the good elements from it's sequel and thankfully, very few of of the bad elements. Great fun in co-op mode, but playing alone makes it more tense, scary and certainly more of a challenging. 	</p></div>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/denuvo-discord-suspended-inappropriate-content</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-denuvo-discord-temporarily-suspended-after-deluge-of-hate-messages.1012203/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/denuvo-discord-suspended-inappropriate-content<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Denuvo moderators have had to temporarily suspend a recently-opened Discord server created to answer community questions, and I'm pretty sure you can guess the reason for that suspension.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, Denuvo <a href="https://x.com/gamingatdenuvo/status/1846185023650582821" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> that it was opening a new Discord server to, ahem, serve as a "platform" for users to express their queries and "receive the answers [they] have deserved all along".</p>
<p>The server featured a mixture of preset FAQs collated from "dozens of users" and "hundreds of...messages" with the ability to ask your own questions directly, with a real member of the Denuvo team stepping up to answer those questions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/denuvo-drm-discord-closed-inappropriate-content-screen.jpg?itok=egsh0JqV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/denuvo-drm-discord-closed-inappropriate-content-screen.jpg?itok=ehVnQP_7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Denuvo is not exactly popular online, as a recent Discord experiment appears to have proven.</figcaption></figure><p>In a move that will surprise precisely nobody who's familiar with Denuvo's reputation online, however, the DRM maker has now <a href="https://x.com/gamingatdenuvo/status/1846897589527912744" rel="noopener" target="_blank">paused the sending of messages</a> on said Discord server.</p>
<p>Upon its opening, it seems that the Discord server was flooded with "nearly 2,000 people", many of whom wanted to ask Denuvo questions. Some, however, just wanted to express their hatred of Denuvo, and others likely just wanted to post memes or jokes.</p>
<p>Disappointingly but predictably, Denuvo points to the "amount of inappropriate content" received on the server as one of the reasons for the pausing of messages; the DRM maker says its "small team" has found moderation of these messages <a href="https://x.com/gamingatdenuvo/status/1846897627905896676" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"quite challenging"</a>.</p>
<p>It's for this reason that <a href="https://x.com/gamingatdenuvo/status/1846897647635865995" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"changes" to the server are coming</a>. They'll be implemented across the next few days, although Denuvo doesn't say exactly what those changes are yet. I suppose we'll just have to wait and see.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-rise-denuvo.jpg?itok=y9xwbum_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-rise-denuvo.jpg?itok=GkLkcOeA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many games have used Denuvo, including the likes of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Honestly, I'm a little surprised Denuvo itself doesn't seem to have seen this response coming.</p>
<p>It's fair to say Denuvo is probably one of the most hated entities in gaming; <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/reveal-of-dying-light-2-denuvo-drm-angers-fans">players hate it</a>, yes, but it's also been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-director-says-denuvo-behind-recent-performance-issues-on-pc">blamed by developers</a> for causing technical issues, so I can't think Denuvo doesn't know its reputation.</p>
<p>Either way, right now, you can't ask Denuvo questions via the aforementioned Discord server, but you can still <a href="https://discord.com/invite/dQs2DKGAjq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">join it</a> if you want to see what prompted the suspension or prepare for the next round of questioning.</p>

<p>Arizona Sunshine Remake has now been released on all good VR platforms, and I was lucky enough to get hands-on with the game days before it dropped. Being a fan of the first game and having <strong>just </strong>finished Arizona Sunshine 2, I was chomping at the brains to get back into the game and bust some undead Fred heads.</p>



<p>This time around, the Arizona Sunshine Remake features many elements wrapped up in the second game, and as it hadn’t been all that long since I’d played the first title, the improvements were clear as day to me.</p>



<p>Read on to check out my full Arizona Sunshine Remake review.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-zombies-take-two">Zombies, Take Two</h2>



<p>Arizona Sunshine is, for me, one of the best zombie-slaying franchises to ever grace a gaming platform. I don’t just mean one of the best <strong>VR </strong>zombie games, but one of the best zombie games, <strong>period</strong>. The first game sets the scene beautifully, and since it was released way back in 2016, it helped to spearhead the popularisation of VR shooters.</p>



<p>Arizona Sunshine 2 was released just last year, emerging to an overwhelmingly positive reception. It features a dog called Buddy and you can pet that dog, that’s all I’m saying.</p>



<p>Arizona Sunshine Remake takes the scene-setting adventure of the first game and fuses it with the innovations and combat mechanics of the second game, making for a sublime combination. It looks stunning on screen (or on headset), it feels smoother, more responsive, and most importantly, more <strong>visceral</strong>.</p>



<p>The array of weapons players can utilise has been expanded to also include melee weapons and two-handed guns, the first of which you’ll get your hands on <strong>very </strong>early on. There’s a tantalisingly violent cooperative multiplayer mode to explore, and the zombie models look better than ever.</p>



<h2 id="h-worth-every-penny">Worth Every Penny</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Arizona Sunshine Remake might only be around four hours long, but there’s a lot packed into that playtime. It’s a mostly linear adventure with a few puzzles to solve here and there, but the bulk of your entertainment will come from the bloodthirsty combat mechanics. It feels <strong>so satisfying </strong>popping some Fred heads or hacking at them with some kind of bladed article.</p>



<p>I’ll say that the story isn’t as immersive as Arizona Sunshine 2, but it’s a perfect ‘introductory episode’ that sets the stage for the follow-up game. In terms of playing order, I’ll say pick up Arizona Sunshine Remake and then leap <strong>straight into </strong>Arizona Sunshine 2.</p>



<p>One of my favourite elements of both games is the vocal work of Sky Soleil, whose quips keep me energised throughout the entire story (twice over). That paired with the masterful visual creations of Vertigo Studios is enough to keep me well and truly switched on.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Arizona Sunshine Remake is worth the investment, ten times over. It’s a phenomenal VR shooter and one of the most immersive games I’ve played on Meta Quest 3 since picking up a headset. I have struggled to find a fault with the game – if I had one complaint, it’s that it leaves me desperately wanting more by the time it wraps up. Is that really a bad thing?</p>



<h2 id="h-arizona-sunshine-remake-verdict">Arizona Sunshine Remake Verdict</h2>



<p>Arizona Sunshine Remake is a fantastic VR shooter with some brilliant combat mechanics and an immersive atmosphere. It’s a little short, but that’s par for the course for VR games. It won’t overtake the sequel in terms of quality and depth, but it’s an entertaining few hours of zombie-slaying goodness, and with the various improvements made by Vertigo Games, it’s well worth a second dip for those who have already played it.</p>
