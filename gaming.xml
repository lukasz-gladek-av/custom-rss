            <p>
For all of their faults (the list may be endless), the interesting thing about live service games, when done well anyway, is the way they can change from day to day. There's an actual living quality to them that, even if I'll always prefer them, a singleplayer game can't capture as well. One such game that can change quite drastically is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, with its varying map conditions and events, swapping in and out at the whims of its developers. This rotation isn't something universally loved, but CEO Patrick Söderlund has said that they're here to stay.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve">IGN</a> in a broader interview about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>, when asked about Embark's response to those that don't love the rotating schedule of conditions and events, Söderlund explained that they are "on a rotating schedule for multiple reasons. Obviously, we believe that it's a part of how the game should be played, that not everything is available at all times. We believe that creates tension. It's an element of fun. It's a way for us to move people from map to map, which we believe to be important."
</p>
<p>
Söderlund continued to explain how the studio doesn't want all map events to be constantly available, and "that most likely won't change. Sometimes we'll let them stay for longer. Sometimes we run two or three in parallel, but they may be different, but we believe that to be a part of how the game should be experienced." The CEO did also share that while they plan to continue adding more map conditions, some may end up being removed temporarily, with the potential for them to return "with a different edge."
</p>
<p>
This obviously won't be accommodating to everyone, as obviously some will have schedules that constrict the time of day they can play. And there lies the double edged sword of these ever evolving live service games. Mayhaps this reality where FOMO-driven gameplay does not make for entirely great experiences.

            <p>
Last month, Ubisoft pretty unceremoniously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">cancelled a bunch of games</a>, the most notable of the bunch being that long gestating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake. This came as part of a major restructuring at the company, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">putting up to 200 jobs at their Paris HQ at risk</a>, ultimately leading to a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unionised-french-ubisoft-workers-put-out-call-for-an-international-strike-held-by-all-current-employees">call for an international strike</a>, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-reportedly-fire-assassins-creed-designer-who-spoke-out-publicly-against-return-to-office-as-union-reps-call-for-ceo-to-resign">firing of one Assassin's Creed designer</a>. It's all a concerning mess, and now the creator of Prince of Persia and lead designer on the original Sands of Time Jordan Mechner has shared his sympathy to devs affected by the remake's cancellation.
</p>
<p>
"The remake's cancellation as part of Ubisoft's restructuring was disappointing news to all fans who'd been eagerly awaiting it, myself included," Mechner wrote in a <a href="https://www.jordanmechner.com/en/latest-news/#winter-days">blog post</a> on his personal website (ta, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/prince-of-persias-creator-reacts-to-ubisofts-cancellation-of-the-sands-of-time-remake-having-a-project-killed-is-a-brutal-experience/">PC Gamer</a>). "My sympathy goes to the development team in Montreal; I can only imagine how they must feel. Having a project killed is a brutal experience. It's an aspect of the game industry that the public doesn't often see, but developers are all too familiar with."
</p>
<p>
Mechner also highlighted how damaging this can be for the spirit of younger developers who don't have many shipped games on their CV yet. "It's tough to suddenly absorb that the past four years of hard work you were proud of, and looking forward to seeing out in the world as your new calling card, will now never see daylight. Words like loss and grieving might seem exaggerated, but artists put their hearts into their work."
</p>
<p>
I found this line from Mechner to be highly pertinent: "Memories of nights and weekends spent in studio crunch instead of at home with loved ones, sacrifices that felt worth it at the time, only add to the pain retrospectively once their object ceases to exist." Sure would be nice if this whole system of taking nigh on half a decade plus to make a game just kind of ended at some point!
</p><p>
The Sands of Time remake seemingly wasn't the only notable game to get the axe, as it was also recently reported that an online Assassin's Creed game was in the works, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-online-cooperative-game-originally-spun-off-from-assassins-creed-shadows-has-reportedly-been-cancelled">but that's supposedly been canned now too</a>. Anyone else feeling tired? Yeesh.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE 2K26’s gameplay designer, Cornell Gunter, is very excited about the ragdoll physics in the upcoming video game. He says the new gameplay tweaks will allow wrestling moves to connect properly with weapons instead of being hampered by invisible barriers.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a> is set to release worldwide on March 13. This year’s game features the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" id="170273">several match types</a> to WWE video games, including Inferno Matches and 3 Stages of Hell, and several new gameplay improvements. </p>







<h2 id="h-no-more-invisible-walls-when-slamming-wrestlers-onto-weapons-in-wwe-2k26">No More Invisible Walls When Slamming Wrestlers Onto Weapons in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/m935QSZHAfI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">JustBryan,</a> WWE 2K26 gameplay designer Cornell Gunter said his favorite improved gameplay mechanic is the addition of ragdoll physics to the game.</p>



<p>Gunter praised the removal of “invisible walls” and how it allows players to use weapons in more creative ways, enhancing the realism that sometimes occurs in wild, anything-goes matches on WWE television.</p>



<p>“Being able to remove that invisible wall when you’re performing moves and performing certain things like that, which is very important to us,” he said. “Being able to watch the collision and the figures of how the superstars react when they’re hitting weapons and all those kinds of things… Those are the things I’m really excited about for gameplay.”</p>

<h2 id="h-more-features-in-wwe-2k26">More Features in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>WWE 2K26 also features several improvements that give players more control over the realism in matches, starting well before the bell rings. Players can customize how much pyro goes off, which camera angles are used, and more during wrestler entrances this year.</p>



<p>Also, there’s a new AI customization that lets players create sequences of moves the AI will always try to hit in succession, adding realism to every match.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/epic-games-have-ghosted-us-says-santa-ragione-horses-ban/</link>
            <guid>1429105</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>On December 2, 2025, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/santa-ragione-horses-banned-from-epic-games-store-at-last-minute-steam-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that <strong>Epic Games</strong> had decided to ban the controversial game <strong>HORSES</strong> at the last minute before its planned launch. They had previously approved a pre-release build, whereas <a href="https://wccftech.com/santa-ragione-new-horror-game-horses-might-be-its-last-steam-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Valve</strong> had banned it from <strong>Steam</strong> the previous week</a>. Needless to say, this was a huge blow for HORSES developer <strong>Santa Ragione</strong>, a small Italian development studio that suddenly found itself cut off from the two biggest PC game stores. </p>



<p>Now, the controversy has reignited. <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/i/186925441/a-note-about-horses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a recent interview with Game File</a> that was mainly about <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-saw-record-setting-third-party-sales-growth-in-2025-reaches-317m-pc-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <strong>Epic Games Store's 2025 growth figures</strong></a>, Epic Games Store General Manager <strong>Steve Allison</strong> said that the company loves Santa Ragione, but added that the<strong> 'Adult Only' rating</strong> <strong>was a dealbreaker</strong> when it came to publishing HORSES on the store.</p>



<p>Well, Santa Ragione did not take kindly to the comment. Today, they responded with a strong, firm rebuttal <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3mebdvzgim22k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the social network BlueSky</a>:</p>



<p><em>Epic Games made provably incorrect statements about the game’s content, refused to provide details supporting their claims, and has not shared their claimed AO IARC certificate, which normally includes a link for the developer to appeal. They do not ‘love that studio’, they have effectively ghosted us.</em></p>



<p><em>The fact that the game does not deserve an AO rating is apparent from the widely available full walkthroughs on YouTube and Twitch, as well as from its distribution on the Humble Store.</em></p>



<p>According to Santa Ragione, Horses obtained a PEGI 18 and ESRB M rating through the IARC system, not an Adult Only classification.</p>



<p>The game itself is intentionally quite the gut punch. It's set on a farm <strong>where the titular “horses” are actually naked humans wearing permanent horse masks, treated entirely as livestock</strong>: fed like animals, stabled, made to pull ploughs, raced, and ridden on their shoulders. Horses is presented in a bleak, black‑and‑white psychological horror style, and <strong>the player is forced to participate in daily routines and increasingly disturbing tasks</strong> that normalize this ongoing dehumanization. The game also includes sexual assault, mutilation, and torture (the "horses" are punished with beatings and castration if they have sex with each other). </p>



<p>That said, the game's supporters (and the developers themselves) believe that it does not warrant an Adult Only classification, and its content, while disturbing, is not as explicit as, for example, sex animations in more popular games that are normally distributed.</p>



<p>Horses is currently available for purchase on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses?utm_campaign=adtraction&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=adtraction&amp;r=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GOG</a>, <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">itch.io</a>, and <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Humble Store</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/embark-studios/" id="96820">Embark Studios</a> CEO Patrick Söderlund responds to players who aren’t fully satisfied with the current ARC Raiders roadmap.</p>



<p>In a sea of live service games that can turn into a watery grave far too soon, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790">ARC Raiders</a> has managed to catch on and become a hit with players worldwide. It even won Best Multiplayer Game at the Game Awards in 2025.</p>



<p>Embark recently released a roadmap for the game detailing upcoming additions, including new maps and more. However, not all players are fully satisfied with the game’s current direction, as they feel the roadmap doesn’t provide enough incentive to keep playing.</p>







<h2 id="h-embark-ceo-acknowledges-player-frustration-with-arc-raiders-roadmap">Embark CEO Acknowledges Player Frustration With ARC Raiders Roadmap</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In an interview with IGN,</a> Patrick Söderlund was asked what he would say to players who weren’t satisfied with the recent plan. Notably, he wants dissatisfied players to understand that they are heard, and he even claims he would feel the same if he were in their shoes, but only because they do not yet have full details.</p>



<p>“If we get into the studio development schedule and make that public, we’re probably going to be in a world of hurt,” he said.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Söderlund stated that they are developing things as they go. However, he says players will see that the patch notes are very detailed and that the organization wants to be seen as transparent. He knows that some won’t forgive if they cannot deliver on certain wants, but his main goal is to provide continuous updates to the game, saying he feels it’s worth its $40 price tag.</p>



<p>“From the beginning of January, whenever everyone was back, we’re working around the clock to deliver as much content as we can to players,” he said.</p>







<p>Players can check out the full roadmap <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-roadmap/" id="153016">here</a>. Insider Gaming will continue to provide future updates on when new content will come to ARC Raiders.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cold Snap is Coming Back to ARC Raiders as a Regular Map Condition]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cold-snap-coming-back-arc-raiders/</link>
            <guid>1429084</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Cold Snap, the festive-themed update that introduced Candleberries, a new event, and some harsh, inclement weather, is <strong>coming back to ARC Raiders </strong>as a map condition in the regular rotation. This will join the pool made up of the likes of Harvester, Hidden Bunker, and Electromagnetic Storm, even if it <strong>doesn’t make much sense</strong>.</p>



<p>In December, Cold Snap came around because it was a winter-themed event bursting with festive potential. It existing beyond that feels a little strange, and it’s being passed off by Embark Studios as ‘sporadic snowfall’.</p>







<h2 id="h-doesn-t-make-sense-but-okay">Doesn’t Make Sense, But Okay</h2>



<p>Cold Snap was a limited-time map condition that existed to serve a purpose, and that was the facilitation of the new festive LTM and new player project. Now that the festive window is over, the condition has understandably moved on, arguably to make way <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-arc-raiders-map-condition-named-toxic-swamp/"><strong>for more </strong>map conditions</a>, coming as soon as later this month.</p>



<p>But <strong>wait!</strong></p>



<p>Embark Studios has taken Cold Snap and injected it back into the map rotation for ‘the foreseeable future’. From February 10, Cold Snap will be a playable condition once again, with blizzards freezing maps, blanketing them in thick snow, and making it a hazardous concept to even creep outside.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Clear skies and sunny temperatures are predicted for Topside this weekend, but don't pack your winter gear away yet folks; the weather towers are predicting sporadic snowfall in the foreseeable future!<br>The Cold Snap returns to our regular rotation of conditions from February 10… <a href="https://t.co/J4OACyBc9y">pic.twitter.com/J4OACyBc9y</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2020180761849331776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Fans were quick to point out that this is the epitome of reusing and recycling content, and it comes mere weeks after the map condition was <strong>removed </strong>from the pool, which was always going to be the plan.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-four-months-content/">ARC Raiders roadmap</a> suggests we’re getting a new map condition soon, and based on earlier scouting, it should be <strong>Toxic Swamp</strong>, but it could still be up to three weeks away.</p>







<p>Are you happy that Embark Studios has brought Cold Snap back to ARC Raiders, or would you rather have had something totally new? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>
In a few months time we'll be approaching the anniversary of Square Enix realising that actually, their commitment to releasing certain games only on particular platforms <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-might-not-wait-so-long-for-the-next-ff7-remake-as-square-enix-plan-to-win-over-pc-users-with-aggressive-shift-away-from-console-exclusives">isn't that good for them after all</a>. These following two years will supposedly have been a time of internal change for the studio, with that translated externally via the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> Remake games releasing on more than just PlayStation. Perhaps they're finally making smart choices! And then last year, instead of finally showing off something like, I don't know, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>, which was first revealed four years ago now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-follows-up-foamstars-flop-with-traitors-esque-killer-inn">they announced Killer Inn</a>. Okay! And now, you can try it out for yourself.
</p>
<p>
Heading over to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1598230/KILLER_INN/">Steam page</a> allows you to join a playtest taking part this weekend ahead of its early access release next week. No pre-requirements, just click a button, and you're in. But perhaps some context for the uninitiated. You and 23 others find themselves in the titular Killer Inn, where 16 of you are designated as lambs, the rest as wolves. It really is quite like Werewolf, with wolves attempting to sneakily kill the lambs, while the lambs try to figure out who the wolves are.
</p>

<p>
Clues can be left behind at the scene of a crime to be discovered, traps can be set up to trick lambs, and also it looks like just about everyone can have guns to just fully blast each other with. There is a strong Unreal Engine premade vibe to the whole thing, quite honestly, but the overall concept isn't awful, it's just an incredibly strange game for Square Enix to not only publish, but partially make (alongside Tactic Studios). Who knows! This is a streamer bait game if there ever was one, and social games like these are having a big moment right now, so perhaps there's an audience for it somewhere.
</p>
<p>
If you don't manage to try out the beta test, you'll be able to pick it up when Killer Inn releases February 12th, next week.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another week draws to a close, and hopefully, your NYT Connections streak <strong>persists</strong>. We’re cutting fast through February and will be bidding farewell to the winter months soon enough, but you know what we’re <strong>not </strong>bidding farewell to today? That’s right – today’s NYT Connections hints and solutions.</p>



<p>Read on to get the full scope of today’s NYT Connections answers, to get this puzzle done as quickly as possible.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-8">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 8)</h2>



<p>Here are the words from today’s NYT Connections puzzle:</p>



<ul>
<li>TIMER</li>



<li>INHIBIT</li>



<li>SYMBOL</li>



<li>ROUTINE</li>



<li>GAG</li>



<li>LENGTH</li>



<li>CENTS</li>



<li>MUZZLE</li>



<li>FACED</li>



<li>NUMBER</li>



<li>UPPERCASE</li>



<li>DRILL</li>



<li>BIT</li>



<li>SILENCE</li>



<li>HABIT</li>



<li>GRIND</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– To keep things quiet</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – This might describe a regular side gig</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> </em>Designing a password</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – These follow two</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 8:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-february-8-973">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, February 8 (#973)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– GAG, INHIBIT, MUZZLE, SILENCE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DRILL, GRIND, HABIT, ROUTINE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – LENGTH, NUMBER, SYMBOL, UPPERCASE</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BITS, CENTS, FACED, TIMER</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Eric Barone discusses the possibility of a Stardew Valley 2</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/stardew-valley/" id="1072">Stardew Valley</a> was released a decade ago and became a massive hit. The game has inspired many farming sims and cozy games since its release. However, 10 years later, the game’s creator is discussing the possibility of a sequel, including when plans to make one were underway and more.</p>







<h2>Stardew Valley 2 Was in the Works Before Eric Barone Pivoted to An Upcoming Release</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-turns-10-the-big-concernedape-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In an interview with IGN,</a> Eric Barone, aka <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/concernedape/" id="95209">ConcernedApe</a>, noted that he would be interested in the idea of working on a sequel to Stardew. Personally, he would be more interested in creating a new world with new characters. However, he’s worried that players are too attached to Pelican town and the villagers who call it home.</p>



<p>Furthermore, he revealed that he had begun working on a Stardew Valley 2 but ultimately chose to pivot to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/haunted-chocolatier/" id="3546">Haunted Chocolatier</a>, an upcoming release he says could be seen as a follow-up to the popular 2016 farming sim.</p>



<p>“There was a time where I was starting to work on a Stardew Valley 2, but, I don’t know. For various reasons, I moved over to Haunted Chocolatier instead. Haunted Chocolatier, you could say, is like Stardew Valley 2, but it’s a bit different of a game,” he said.</p>







<h2 id="h-still-fans-shouldn-t-expect-stardew-valley-2-from-his-next-game">Still, Fans Shouldn’t Expect Stardew Valley 2 from His Next Game</h2>



<p>Despite saying players can view the upcoming game as “Stardew Valley 2,” it is clearly meant as a spiritual successor. In fact, Barone is concerned that expectations for the upcoming game may be too high. He admits it’s a challenge to decide when the next game will be ready for release because there’s so much to live up to, given the legacy of his previous game.</p>



<p>“I want to just make the game I want to make, but I also don’t want a bunch of people to not like the game because they were expecting a certain thing,” he said.</p>



<p>As of now, there’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/haunted-chocolatier-long-time-to-finish/">no release date planned for Choclatier</a>. Barone acknowledged that any Stardew Valley-related matter would require his full attention. However, he hopes that, at least over the next decade, Haunted Choclatier will be released. He even mentioned that there could be another Stardew Valley project by then.</p>

The rest, as they say, is history: Spider-Man was inarguably Magic’s most disappointing set of at least the last year (maybe longer), and Edge of Eternities was much more well-received but invariably didn’t get its chance in the limelight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I was hoping that Wizards would take some lessons from it, we’re now entering a 2026 roadmap with seven full sets planned. Lorwyn Eclipsed is great, and only just launched, but that’s January’s set. Preorders are now live for <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGrVNq?object_uuid=fcf04366-9d70-4822-9c66-d2bf97a545a8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</u></a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7Rnk8?object_uuid=fcf04366-9d70-4822-9c66-d2bf97a545a8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Secrets of Strixhaven</u></a>, and even <a href="https://zdcs.link/a56LlN?object_uuid=fcf04366-9d70-4822-9c66-d2bf97a545a8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Marvel Super Heroes</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last set, by the way, is around five months from launch. While I appreciate that a company needs a line on a graph to go up to show success by bringing in new players, it’s starting to feel like Wizards of the Coast is trampling on Magic’s own legacy in its desperation to talk about crossover sets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lorwyn Eclipsed should be a celebration, a chance to return to a beloved Plane full of classic creature types, and instead, we’re getting close to the Turtles landing on store shelves. Looking past Strixhaven to a Marvel crossover, this early (and with the taste of the Spider-Man set still lingering), is just a bad look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Please, Wizards - don’t let Secrets of Strixhaven suffer the same way Edge of Eternities is. It’s almost unavoidable with such a packed release calendar, but if you can’t pay enough time to your own universes, the ones that have captivated players for over three decades, does that not tell you a change is required?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Honestly, all of this is moot anyway - I’m part of the problem. I’ve pre-ordered some Marvel Superheroes products, and you can bet your Bilbo Baggins that I’ll be first in line for The Hobbit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Magic’s current set, Lorwyn Eclipsed, be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-most-expensive-cards"><u>our list of the best chase cards</u></a> in the set right now, as well as a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-weird-wonderful-creatures-of-magic-the-gatherings-new-lorwyn-eclipsed-set"><u>all eight creature types</u></a> in the new set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.

            <p>
I'll be truthful with you for a moment: I do, from time to time, enjoy a game where I do not have to be supremely strategic, and get to watch different lights and colours light up on my screen. Something that's got the juice, but doesn't ask too much of me. Everyone needs to turn their brain half off once in a while! And I believe I could quite easily find myself switching off that half to STICKER/BALL once in a while, a "pool game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> from the future."
</p>
<p>
Ok, so, I do have to admit that for the first couple minutes of STICKER/BALL's demo, I had to turn my brain on ever so slightly to figure out what was going on, so let me explain it for you here. You have six balls. When a run starts, there is a single die on the screen, so you shoot the die, and get points, of which there's a minimum you have to make each round, increasing upon a successful one. Once the ball comes back to you, you are granted a choice of one singular sticker amongst three, all of which have different effects to get you even more points.

</span></p><p>
For example, a house sticker spawns a human when you hit it, and said human gives you three points upon spawning, or six if they survive, and eight if they die from getting shot by a bullet. So, you might then want to place a gun sticker on the dice field, of which there are 216 slots, each line unlocking the more stickers you get. You can also choose which stickers go on which numbered die, and they'll randomly appear on the main field, prompting you to determine just where you want to point your ball towards.
</p><p>
The more dice you get, the more opportunities for the ball to bounce around and cause the different stickers to interact with one another. A game of true, honest cause and effect. And as mentioned, one that requires just a smidge of thought, as when there's enough stickers on the field, you can kind of just feel out where it's best to shoot your shot on instinct, resulting in those treasured flashing colours.
</p>
<p>
I think ultimately the game is summarized quite well by the last line of its Steam description: "Enjoy the chaos, it’s on purpose." I will, STICKER/BALL! No exact release date attached to this one, but it's currently slated for release in 2026, and you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3537690/_STICKERBALL/">here</a>.

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <p>
You know, you'd think that with decades worth of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> in existence, side quests would have been more or less figured out by now. And yet, there are still enough games releasing that seem more interested in going for quantity over quality. But for the devs over at Archetype Entertainment, the goal is to make the side quests in their upcoming sci-fi jaunt <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exodus-2027">Exodus</a> not feel just "tacked on."
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/mass-effect-veterans-dont-want-side-quests-to-feel-tacked-on-to-their-new-sci-fi-rpg-and-they-cant-add-everything-or-the-game-would-be-thousands-of-hours/">GamesRadar</a>, former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> writer and current Exodus narrative director Drew Karpyshyn explained that side quests are more about "trying to give players the chance to explore what they want to explore, that will add to the main story." He continued, "We definitely don't want you to feel like you're doing it because you're obligated, like 'I need those three points to get my next level on this skill, so I guess I'll do it'. We want side quests to be something you would do even if you weren't getting a reward - you're going to get rewards, of course, it's a game, but we want you to feel like 'This is something I'm interested in, this is something I want to explore.'"
</p>
<p>
Karpyshyn noted that in turn, Exodus' side quests are tied into its themes and companions you may have. "It's tied into interesting aspects of our game that maybe don't get explored as much on the critical path, but you can see them," he explains. For Karpyshyn it's that age old tricky thing of deciding where is best for the team's focus, as they know they can't add whatever they want without the risk of the game becoming "thousands of hours [long], which sounds great in theory, but isn't realistic."
</p>
<p>
Personally, a game that's thousands of hours long sounds like a nightmare to me, so, I'm happy to see some amount of restraint being enacted here. As it currently stands, though, it'll be a while before we find out if Archetype succeed in making good side quests, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/exodus-devs-want-you-to-know-that-despite-matthew-mcconaugheys-ai-deal-not-a-drop-has-been-used-in-their-game-so-far">as it's not due out until some time in 2027</a>.

            <guid>1428982</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="43db56fcd8b83"><a title="Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/43db56fcd8b83/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Daedalic Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're fans of the final frontier around these parts, so when our combadges chirruped with news of a Star Trek game for Nintendo's newest console, our anticipation grew like a clutch of tribbles in a grain silo.</p>
<p>As you'll have gathered from the title, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Universe</a> is set in the TNG-DS9-VOY era and sees you charged with Captain Janeway's mission of getting her crew home safely after being thrown across the other side of the galaxy by an alien force.</p>
<p>If you've caught the show in the 30+ years since it debuted, you'll know that the Delta quadrant is fraught with hazards of all shapes and sizes — cube-shaped and otherwise — but German dev gameXcite is letting you make different decisions on your journey, exploring what-if scenarios that diverge from canon and really put you in the Captain's chair.</p>
<p>We caught up with Game Director <strong>Daniel Bernard</strong> via email to get confirmation on a couple of points and find out a little more ahead of the demo hitting the eShop on Monday and the game's launch in a couple of weeks...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>You said in your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-beams-onto-switch-2-next-month">combat-focused dev video</a> that you took inspiration from Starfleet Command, Bridge Commander, and Legacy. Beyond Star Trek, what other games did you have in mind when designing Across the Unknown? (Aside: I love FTL and <em>still</em> hold out hope of a Switch port!)</strong></p>
<p>While we benchmarked all kinds of space games — from FTL to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/everspace_2">Everspace 2</a> — we wanted the combat to be as close as possible to what is seen in the show; how it would feel like to be the captain of a Starfleet cruiser, not a fighter jet.</p>
<p>Gene Roddenberry envisioned Captain Kirk as a "space-age Captain Horatio Hornblower," a decisive leader on long voyages, drawing from C.S. Forester's novels about a British naval captain during the Napoleonic Wars. As the Voyager captain, Captain Janeway carries on this tradition.</p>
<p>Naval warfare tactics influence space battles and make them more authentic. Even cloaked vessels are analogues to submerged vessels like German U-boats from WWII and submarines from naval battles that are difficult to detect. We wanted our game to be in this tradition.</p>
<figure data-uuid="cda93774dc500"><a title="Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cda93774dc500/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Daedalic Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>How long have you been working on the game, and when did the Switch 2 version enter the conversation?</strong></p>
<p>We started with the first concepts in summer of 2022, but it took us quite some time to secure the Star Trek license and a publisher. We also first produced a prototype to test some ideas and align everyone on the vision. Full production finally began in September of 2023.</p>
<p>Because the handheld format is ideal for our gameplay style, we wanted to do a Switch 2 version as soon as the console was announced, but of course it took some time to get dev kits. Porting finally started in the fall of 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Voyager seems well-suited to a roguelike structure, with a clear goal/journey and lots of decisions Janeway was forced to make along the way. I imagine several fan-favourite topics jumped out (Tuvix, Kim's non-promotion, warp 10 lizard babies!), but could you talk about some perhaps less obvious elements of the show that you've integrated?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, we should clarify that the game is not a true roguelike. While we started out with this concept, we quickly learned that due to the strong narrative and simple length of the show (and the journey within), that structure was not a great fit. Instead of quick “runs” where you constantly fail and restart, you are playing a 15-hour campaign to bring Voyager home.</p>
<p>To keep subsequent playthroughs interesting, not only can you make very different ship builds — leaning into research and resource production or offensive and defensive capabilities — but also narrative choices that lead to interesting 'What if' scenarios and new ways to solve questlines.</p>
<p>For example, you may offer amnesty to Seska, adding a capable hero, but potentially lose Chakotay out of protest. Or you may find a way to reprogram the Dreadnought that B’Elanna originally used against the Cardassians to become an ally. Lastly, what would happen if you found a cloaking device for Voyager?</p>
<p><strong>From the outside, Across the Unknown seems a PC-first experience. What's been the biggest design challenge adapting it for consoles, and specifically for Switch 2? Mouse mode feels like a natural fit, but the other consoles don't have that.</strong></p>
<p>Indeed, the biggest challenge are the controls - that the game works well with a gamepad. But there are also many people who play PC games with a gamepad from their couch or on handheld devices such as the Steam Deck or ROG Ally. For this reason we have designed the UI/UX from the beginning to work well with both mouse and gamepad.</p>

<p><strong>On average, how long might a successful trip home to the Alpha Quadrant take? Are multiple 'runs' part of the gameplay loop, or are we looking at a longer journey?</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the amount of side missions and exploration a player does, the first trip takes between 15 and 20 hours. As explained above, multiple runs are not part of the game loop, but with branching narrative and different options to build out Voyager, there is plenty of incentive to replay the game.</p>
<p><strong>Was there anything you considered including that was 'off-limits' for whatever reason (beyond the scope of the project/direction from the licence holder/etc.)?</strong></p>
<p>Our campaign follows the events of the series and tells the story of established characters, so while we are giving the player meaningful choices, we took great care that nothing would feel out of place. As a Starfleet ship, you are not outright raiding other species, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Related, are there any characters or elements from the wider franchise in the game, or is this strictly Voyager-only? With so many shows and timelines/universes, the possibilities feel endless (and daunting?).</strong></p>
<p>While we have the rights for all 'Next Generation'-era shows, we are so far concentrating on characters and events from the Voyager TV show - this is also the most logical choice since Voyager is so far away from other Federation ships.</p>
<figure data-uuid="4dd0e6475cf2d"><a title="Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4dd0e6475cf2d/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Daedalic Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>On your Steam page you say that "partial voice over as well as updated music and sound effects" will come in the final version - can you elaborate on that? Will lines and music from the show be in the game?</strong></p>
<p>Star Trek: Voyager – Across the Unknown will feature fully voiced logs by Tuvok and Tom Paris at the start of each sector. It was important to us to bring back the original actors in a way that felt meaningful. These logs recap recent events and set the stage for the mission ahead. The characters are voiced by their original actors, Tim Russ and Robert Duncan McNeill.</p>
<p>Finally, we are also including the main theme from the show for the full release of the game!</p>
<p><strong>In terms of art, do you get access to materials and archival docs from CBS for art assets, or does that all come from personal research?</strong></p>
<p>Both. While our licensor provides us with certain assets from their archives, remember that Voyager is a fairly old show, so most things — such as ship models — are not available in the formats we would need and thus are re-created based on our research.</p>

<p><strong>Trekkies are a notoriously detail-oriented bunch and quick to offer, erm, 'feedback'. How does the team cope with the weight of expectation from players who can be very hard to please?</strong></p>
<p>We were quite nervous before releasing the first trailers and then the demo, but luckily the majority of feedback has been very positive. <em>[Note. The demo was released earlier on other platforms.]</em> Most players realise that we are an indie team but absolutely love the IP - because we are fans ourselves!</p>
<p>For that reason we were very thankful for the feedback and able to correct many small mistakes or lore inconsistencies - which was exactly the reason why we have put out the demo during development!</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, we've got to ask: If you're in Janeway's shoes, do you separate Tuvix or not?</strong></p>
<p>I absolutely would. But as a player, we are allowing you to ask, “What if not…?”</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Many thanks to Daniel for his responses, and to Michal at 32-33 for setting things up.</em></p>
<p><em>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown launches on Switch 2 and other platforms on 18th February for <strong>$39.99 / £32.49</strong>, although there's a 10% d</em><em>iscount in the eShop live until launch day. The demo goes live on the Switch 2 eShop on Monday 9th February.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-ipad-a16-chip-sees-another-drop-catch-a-falling-star-at-a-record-low-near-airpods-pro-pricing-2000666503</link>
            <guid>1428976</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s A16 iPad has never really gotten the love it deserves. With brand-new Air and Minis also being released in 2025, along with killer competitor models from Samsung and even the Kindle Scribe, the A16 (aka 11th Gen) iPad might have gotten short shrift in the praise department. But that’s just creating a great buying opportunity, because <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">the 11-inch A16 iPad is marked down by $50 right now at Amazon, down to just $300</a>.</p>
<p>Considering the wide gulf between the price point of the A16 iPad compared to the elite-level tablets from Apple and its competitors, this $300 Amazon deal is a major score, because the performance and features gulf is nowhere near as large. Many of the features of the higher-priced tablets also exist in the A16 iPad, and at a literal fraction of the price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Goldilocks Tablet</h2>
<p>The A16 iPad sits in the perfect spot between elite-level features and great price. It easily outperforms other accessibly priced tablets, working smoothly and reliably for games, streaming, and everyday productivity chores like email and browsing. And it does it without the hefty price tag of the top-tier tables which may deliver more of a laptop-like performance, but at a laptop-level price. Not too expensive, not too chintzy with the features — it’s just right.</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn’t be an iPad if it didn’t have that super-primo display. It’s an 11-inch Liquid Retina with 2360×1640 resolution and True Tone tech that detects the ambient lighting and automatically adjusts the color temperature. It not only looks incredible, but it’s easier on your eyes. Pair that screen with the Wi-Fi 6 connection and excellent camera setup (12MP in both front and back), and the A16 iPad is a great tablet for FaceTime calls and video conferencing. Apple’s new Center Stage tech also keeps you centered in the frame, automatically adjusting the view as you move.</p>



<h2>Expansion Options Galore</h2>
<p>Another smart tablet-buying tactic: Take some of the money you’re saving by opting for the A16 iPad and invest in an Apple Pencil (1st Gen or USB-C; not the Apple Pencil Pro) and Magic Keyboard Folio and transform the tablet into a mini-laptop and premium note-taking device. All the tools for creative work are already built into the A16 iPad; adding the Apple Pencil is a great way to complete the package.</p>
<p>I like to call the A16 iPad the unsung hero of the iPad family. It checks off so many boxes while keeping the price tag exceptionally accessible despite often flying under the radar. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">Amazon’s current $300 price is a jackpot for anyone looking for a super-steady tablet.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’m an awful rock climber. Being scared of heights probably doesn’t help. But when I’ve tried it, I’ve loved the slow, methodical work of moving from one ledge to the next. It reminds me a lot of why I love running; in both sports, you achieve goals that seem insurmountable by taking them one step at a time. <em>Cairn</em>, a new game from The Game Bakers, is one of the few games I’ve played that truly captures that feeling.</p><p>You play as Aava, a famous climber obsessed with summiting a mountain called Kami. You climb by moving all four of Aava’s limbs, one by one, to find safe cracks, bumps, and ledges to let you inch your way higher, all while managing tools and resources carried in your backpack. Climbing games are becoming something of a trend, but <em>Cairn</em> is different from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRAMoaEp-08"><em>Jusant</em></a>, where you just control the character’s hands, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/783549/baby-steps-review-ps5-steam"><em>Baby Steps</em></a>, a sillier game where you just control the character’s feet.</p><p>It’s been a decade since my short-lived membership at a rock-climbing gym, but <em>Cairn</em>’s mechanics brought back all sorts of memories of my time scaling the walls, especially the importance of good footwork. Based on my amateur experience, it’s a great rock-climbing simulator. By setting spikes into the walls, you can make spots where your rope will catch you if you slip off the mountain face. A robot companion picks up the spikes when you reach safety so you can use them again. By using chalk, you get a temporary boost to your grip. With food and drink, you’ll help keep yourself fed, hydrated, and warm.</p><p>Progress can be grueling. I was almost always on edge as I methodically searched for the next place to put Aava’s hand or foot. Slipping comes at a cost; you’ll fall to your last spike or to the ground, and depending on how far down those are, it could mean another long climb, hitting yourself against the wall, or, in the worst case, death. Rain, wind, snow, and ice make things even more difficult.</p><p>But it’s also peaceful, in a way. I was incredibly focused while playing, and more than once, I caught myself holding my Steam Deck right up to my nose as I hunted for the next step of my climb. I was often completely in the zone. As I journeyed, I even started to internalize Aava’s quest as my own. When she quipped about a good grip, I would be elated that I had a brief moment of safety. When she was precariously close to falling, her breath would speed up in panic, and my stress levels would spike, too. When she would fall, she often shouted in frustration, usually mirroring how I felt about the situation.</p><p>Aava will meet other people during her journey and hear from people who care for her, and they provide companionship during what’s largely a solo quest. But sometimes, she’s also rude to them or will alienate and ignore those who care for her. Aava even takes out her anger on her robot buddy. Still, I could relate. Like Aava, I also just wanted to climb the damn mountain, and usually, I didn’t want anything to get in my way.</p><p>I am predisposed to like <em>Cairn</em>: I love long runs, and to me, there are fewer things more satisfying than the feeling of overcoming a seemingly insurmountable obstacle one step at a time. I’ve fallen out of running lately, and I’ve missed it. <em>Cairn</em> reminded me what’s possible when you focus just on the next thing in front of you — and of the complex feelings that come with persevering through the quest.</p><p><sup>Cairn<em> is available now for PC and PS5.</em></sup></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/874914/cairn-review-pc-playstation-5]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This article contains some </em><em><strong>spoilers </strong></em><em>for Baldur’s Gate 3. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-tv-series-set-for-hbo-will-be-a-continuation-of-baldurs-gate-3s-story">HBO is turning Baldur’s Gate into a TV show</a>. On its own, that’s quite an exciting proposition: a big-budget, live-action series set in Dungeons &amp; Dragons’ most iconic city? Yes please. But the project’s announcement, which came courtesy of <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin-hbo-1236710583/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Deadline</u></a>, contains a line that immediately had me burying my head in my hands. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Baldur’s Gate TV series will be a continuation to the games,” says the report, “telling a story that takes place immediately after the events of Baldur’s Gate 3, as the characters — old and new — are dealing with the ramifications of the events in the third game.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The ramifications of what events, exactly? The defeat of the Netherbrain? Or perhaps the enslavement of it in the name of the Absolute? Or Gale’s choice to turn into a magical nuclear bomb, sacrificing himself to save the city? These are just three of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/baldurs-gate-3/All_Endings">the many ways Baldur’s Gate 3 can end</a>, and that’s before we consider the dozens and dozens of choices that you make on the way to that conclusion. There are approximately 17,000 variations of the game’s final cutscene. How could a TV show possibly “deal with the ramifications of the events of the third game” when every single player has their own version of events? </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/minthara-1770402606565.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">For some players, Minthara is an enemy. To others, she's a lover and a close ally.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The answer, of course, is that showrunner Craig Mazin must decide what choices are “canon.” One half of the duo behind The Last of Us’ HBO adaptation must now set certain events in stone in order to create a baseline to build his story upon. But to decide upon a canon series of events for Baldur’s Gate 3 is not the same as, for instance, determining which of Mass Effect 3’s trio of concluding options would be the starting point for what comes next. It’s not a simple case of how the story ends, but everything that happened on the 100-hour journey up until that point, too.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The entire picture of Baldur’s Gate 3, the story any one player lived, is the result of hundreds of decisions, ranging from the tactical to the emotional to the completely unaware. For some, Minsc and his miniature space hamster, Boo, are vital parts of the story. Yet many won’t even know who he is, having passed by and never recruited him to their party. There are those for whom Shadowheart’s escape from the Church of Shar is a defining moment, yet others will have found an equally defining pathway in encouraging her to embrace the dark goddess. And for those players of a more chaotic leaning, Baldur’s Gate 3 is the tale of an unstoppable serial killer that greedily succumbs to their own Dark Urge, tearing limbs off wizards and letting goblins slaughter refugees. The game is less a single story with a handful of different outcomes, and more like hundreds of character threads that are entwined like rope. A rope that grows thicker and longer with every romance (steady now), argument, betrayal, and surprise you experience. To unravel all that and find a single golden thread for television seems at best foolhardy, at worst impossible. </p><p>Anyone who wants a sequel to Baldur's Gate 3 wants a follow-up to their own experience, not Craig Mazin’s.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">None of this is to say that the show is guaranteed to be bad, or of poor quality. Considering Mazin’s prior work – in particular, Chernobyl – and HBO’s track record with fantasy programming, there’s every chance that Baldur’s Gate will be a fantastic show, at least when viewed in isolation. But it’s difficult to create that isolation when the project is explicitly a continuation of the journey so many of us undertook for hundreds, sometimes even thousands of hours. And because of Baldur's Gate 3's unrivalled branching RPG design, we have all become deeply attached to our own versions of this world and its characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It should be said that details of how the show will be structured are still incredibly thin. It will feature a group of new protagonists, so we don’t know to what extent the now-famous party of heroes and antiheroes that make up Baldur’s Gate 3 cast will feature. By being a “continuation to the games”, could it merely exist in a world where the Netherbrain once existed, and tales of heroes’ journeys to defeat it are muttered in the city's streets like mythical tales? Or will meetings with the likes of Wyll, Astarion, Lae'zel be little more than fleeting encounters, kept somewhat shapeless in an effort to remain relevant to most players’ memories of them? It creates a dilemma: purposefully keep things vague and potentially undercook the history of this world, or pick a defined canon that could alienate large portions of your viewership?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Television adaptations are, of course, designed with more than one eye on wider markets. HBO wants people who have never played Baldur’s Gate 3 to become invested in its world. But that begs the question: why a direct sequel? Why take place immediately after a story that a portion of your audience has no investment in? If half your audience has no attachment to those events, and the other half will almost certainly have experienced a different version of the events you’re building upon, who is winning here? Anyone who does want a sequel wants a follow-up to their own experience, not Craig Mazin’s. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Baldur’s Gate won’t be the first show to tackle this problem. Just this year, the second season of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series">Fallout</a> told a story set after the events of Fallout: New Vegas, an RPG that also concludes with a number of very different, world-defining options. But Fallout has made a number of smart choices. Firstly, it’s not a sequel to the game; it’s just set in the same universe, and thus isn’t trying to continue the plot of New Vegas. Secondly, it’s set over a decade later, and purposefully leaves the events during that time a complete mystery. And so the show’s depiction of the game’s characters and factions doesn’t have to join the dots. Did you hand the Vegas Strip to the Legion in your playthrough? Well, in the 15 years since, they’ve succumbed to infighting and have fallen from their mighty position. You don’t need to know how it happened, it just did. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Using this method, Fallout (sort of) successfully ensures <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-showrunner-explains-whats-going-on-with-mr-house-ahead-of-season-2-finale-and-how-there-still-isnt-a-new-vegas-canon-ending">no one New Vegas ending is cemented as canon</a>. Every outcome could have happened, but the result of your choices may not have endured for the 15 years between the game and the show. Larian Studios, the developer of Baldur’s Gate 3, understood the benefit of this kind of time gap; its gargantuan RPG is set more than a century after the events of its predecessor, ensuring it’s not restricted by the conclusion of Baldur’s Gate 2 and has space to create its own story. By starting immediately after the events of BG3, the show won’t have this luxury. It <em>has </em>to make a choice. It <em>has </em>to invalidate thousands of playthroughs. It can’t be the sequel to <em>your </em>experience of Baldur’s Gate 3. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn’t have to be this way. The real lesson to learn from Fallout is that video game adaptations thrive best when they are decoupled from existing stories. So the big question is, why is this not just a Dungeons &amp; Dragons show? You can set a D&amp;D show in Baldur’s Gate. You can call a D&amp;D show “Baldur’s Gate”. You can even include characters and reference (certain) events from Baldur’s Gate 3. But to purposefully shackle yourself to continuing the story of that game, rather than freely exploring its world, feels like purposefully rolling a critical fail on the first round of combat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/hbos-baldurs-gate-show-wants-to-be-a-sequel-to-bg3-thats-impossible]]></content:encoded>
