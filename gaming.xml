			<p>The latest PlayStation 5 firmware introduced some changes that will heavily impact jailbreaking, making it difficult for users to continue accessing their digital libraries after taking their system offline.</p>
<p>As explained earlier today by well-known Souls series hacker Lance McDonald on <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, the latest firmware update changed the "Restore Licenses" screen so that it is now only possible to download licenses for games that are already installed on the system. Previously, licenses for every owned game would be restored, even for games not installed on the console. This means that once a PlayStation 5 console has taken offline, users won't be able to play the vast majority of the digital games they have purchased, being forced to use pirated backups. This will also prevent users from making backups of games to be shared with others. While this won't be a major issue for any legitimate use cases, this will make jailbreaking the console and modding games much harder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The screen used to look like this. You could download every single license to everything you’ve ever bought, even if it’s not currently installed. Then you could take your PS5 offline, jailbreak it, yet still have access to all your legitimately purchased digital games. <a href="https://t.co/fxvbCQO4dT">pic.twitter.com/fxvbCQO4dT</a></p>
<p>— Lance McDonald (@manfightdragon) <a href="https://twitter.com/manfightdragon/status/1841650827448221915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Won’t have any impact on legitimate use cases. Just a pain in the ass for people who want to take their PS5 offline hoping in the future to jailbreak it and mod/hack digital games they own.</p>
<p>— Lance McDonald (@manfightdragon) <a href="https://twitter.com/manfightdragon/status/1841651366076547412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The latest major PlayStation 5 firmware update is update <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-24-06-3d-audio/">24.06</a>, which introduced the new Welcome hub, a personalized space that users can customize with various widgets, a new Party Share feature, personalized 3D audio profiles, and a new Remote Play setting. This update was soon followed by <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-24-06-10-01-00/">another</a> that fixed issues for select games, such as Final Fantasy XVI, caused by some changes made by the 24.06 update.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/earth-defense-force-6-drops-epic-account-requirement-for-online-multiplayer.999603/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earth-defense-force-6-epic-account-dropped<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Sandlot and publisher D3Publisher have announced that you'll no longer need to sign into an Epic Games account if you want to play&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>online via Steam.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2291060/announcements/detail/4674264042200462235" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement on Steam</a>, the two studios say that you can now play online missions in&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>without signing into your Epic account if you wish.</p>
<p>Sandlot and D3Publisher also provide a link to <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_EpicAccount/c-EpicAccountServices/how-do-i-disable-access-to-my-epic-account-for-a-specific-product-or-service-such-as-a-site-game-or-app-a000084959" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic's page about unlinking your Epic account from services like Steam</a>, so if you want to go full scorched earth and get rid of your Epic credentials from Steam altogether, that's how you go about doing so.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earth-defense-force-6-epic-online-requirement-alien.jpg?itok=G9BCEW4Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earth-defense-force-6-epic-online-requirement-alien.jpg?itok=IJbCpJiX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>no longer needs you to sign into an Epic account to play online.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Earth Defense Force 6</em>'s requirement that players use an Epic account if they wanted to play online on Steam has been the source of some consternation among the game's player base.</p>
<p>The third-person bug-splattering shooter was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earth-defense-force-6-review-bomb-epic">review bombed close to release</a> thanks to its Epic account requirement, and even a quick glance at the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2291060/EARTH_DEFENSE_FORCE_6/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">most recent Steam reviews</a> shows that many of them - including the positive ones - mention Epic.</p>
<p>It's fair to say that a lot of PC gamers have pretty strong feelings about the Epic Games Store, although that didn't stop them <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-games-store-year-in-review-2023">spending around $950 million</a> on games and apps from the store last year.</p>
<p>Still, if you're an&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force&nbsp;</em>fan and you've been holding off on picking up this sixth installment for fear you'd need to sign into an Epic account to play online, now's the time to dive in.</p>

<p><em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>is, as the title suggests, the sixth mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force&nbsp;</em>series (although it's far from the sixth game, thanks to the existence of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earth-defense-force-world-brothers-2-release-date-set-for-september">various spinoffs</a>).</p>
<p>It's a multiplayer-focused third-person shooter in which your goal is to attempt to reclaim a ravaged Earth from an invasion of malevolent alien insects and other beasties. You can think of it as a way more over-the-top&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, if you can imagine such a thing.</p>
<p>You can play&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2291060/EARTH_DEFENSE_FORCE_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10002862" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>.

            <p>Out 17th October on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127660/Mask_Quest/">Steam</a>, Mask Quest is a platform game in which you hold and release a button to refill your character's lungs while dodging police batons, bullets, gas grenades and drones. Neglect to do so, and you'll pop your clogs. It's the kind of mechanical tomfoolery you'd associate with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-many-people-in-this-crowd-have-seen-molyjam">Peter Molydeux</a>, but in this case, it's all the fine work of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stephens-sausage-roll">Stephen's Sausage Roll</a> developer increpare and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quadrant-rhythm-game-demo">Quadrant</a> developer undef. The developers have somehow gotten 50 levels out of this meme-ish premise, and it looks like quite an elaborate hop-and-bopper with some less-cheerful political overtones. Here's the trailer.</p> <!--more-->

<p>So, those complexities. From what I can glean, the levels evolve beyond the initial "do what you do in most platformers + remember to inhale/exhale" conceit, with setups that make the breathing mechanic more feature than constraint. For example: you can breathe out to shunt away quadrotor drones before they knock you off ladders, and blow on sails to inflate them. There's a bit where it looks like you're expelling air to lower your mass and fall through surfaces. There's also the prospect of hyperventilation, which seemingly requires you to preserve the rhythm of your respiration, however frenzied your surroundings: breathe too rapidly and you'll empty out your carbon dioxide gauge.</p>
<p>As for the political overtones: 1) your objective is, as you'd guess, to find a mask, which is "sold out everywhere". It feels like an allusion to "post"-pandemic politics and the expectation that clinically vulnerable people must now see to their own protection, without state support. And 2) your character is Black, your enemies all appear to be cops, and the breath mechanic may refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_can't_breathe">the murder of Eric Garner</a>. I am likely reaching horribly with all this, or at best, lumpishly unearthing the subtext.</p><p>For reasons best known only to themselves, the developers have localised Mask Quest in Latin, a "dead" language, and Toki Pona, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona">Wikipedia</a> calls "a philosophical artistic constructed language known for its small vocabulary, simplicity, and ease of acquisition", devised by Canadian linguist Sonja Lang around the turn of the millennium. It's all absolutely in keeping with the eccentricity of increpare's past creations, which you can read about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/increpare">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some fans obtained a copy early, however, and while <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-remake-leak-reveals-revamped-intro-in-3-hours-of-ps5-gameplay">one player already shared the revamped opening of the game</a>, essentially the entire thing has now leaked online.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-comes-to-playstation-5-and-pc-in-october-2024">The Until Dawn remake has many changes previously announced</a>, such as revised cinematography that uses a combination of fixed and over-the-shoulder camera views, new accessibility and usability settings such as an alternative to the Don't Move mechanic, and, now revealed via these leaks, some even more significant changes too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Until Dawn on PS5 and PC — <em><strong>and final spoiler warning before we divulge these changes</strong></em> — features not just a remade opening but new ending scenes too.</p><p>Reddit user crawplays shared the post-credit scenes, below, which add new endings and a potential sequel tease. Until Dawn is a horror game where all eight main characters can live, die, or anything in between, and these two scenes come at the end of both Josh and Sam's "good" endings particularly.</p><p>Josh's is the smaller of the two and clears up some of the ambiguity surrounding his ending in the original Until Dawn. While his story perhaps had the most tragic end, with even his positive outcome seeing him taken by his sister turned spindly murdering monster, the remake puts a definitively more hopeful spin on things.</p><p>A cutscene shows Josh, played by Rami Malek, survive the wendigo encounter while a voiceover from Doctor Hill, the therapist who speaks with him and the player between each chapter, talks of Josh finally finding redemption.</p><p>The larger of the two scenes is what some players believe sets up a sequel, however. It's the first scene not set within the single night the rest of Until Dawn takes place in, instead showing Sam, played by Hayden Panettiere, years later.</p><p>Aptly waking up at dawn in her Los Angeles apartment, with medicine and a book about myths on her bedside table, Sam swipes to unlock her phone and blood smears across the screen. She opens her palm and sees blood trickling down from a nasty scar on her arm that doesn't quite appear to be real. Following a knock at the door and further wipes at her arm, a voice from behind her whispers "Sam" before the scene cuts to black.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Best PC Games</h3></div></output><p>Original developer Supermassive Games hasn't otherwise indicated a sequel is on the way and is plenty busy with its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-dark-pictures-anthology-the-devil-in-me-review">Dark Pictures Anthology games</a>. While it's released several of these in the years since Until Dawn arrived, alongside a full spiritual sequel in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-quarry-review">The Quarry</a>, perhaps none have been as well received as Until Dawn itself.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-announced-for-ps5-and-pc-alongside-a-release-window-state-of-play-2024">The PS5 and PC version was announced in January 2024</a> as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-are-all-the-ps5-games">the latest in a long line of ports and remasters from Sony</a>.

It will be made for both PC and consoles and tell a new story in the universe that's being developed in "close collaboration" with Avatar Studios, the announcement notes. </p><p>It'll put players in the role of an "all-new, never-before-seen Avatar" and take place thousands of years in the past. According to Paramount and Saber, players "can expect to be immersed in a vibrant world, master all four elements, engage in dynamic combat alongside companions, and experience the challenges and decisions that come with being the keeper of balance in the world." It adds that, story-wise, it'll feature elements both new and familiar to fans of the franchise.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/03/alta-1727916033734.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Avatar: The Last Airbender is getting its first AAA RPG. </figcaption></figure></output><p>“We know loyal fans of Avatar: The Last Airbender have been eager for more stories that bring them into the universe of the show, and through gaming, we’re able to expand the world-building and allow fans to experience the new content in a completely immersive way,” said Doug Rosen, SVP, Games and Emerging Media at Paramount. “Saber Interactive has a proven track record in bringing IP-based games to life, and we are excited to co-fund this AAA title alongside them and let fans experience this world first-hand.”</p><p>“At Saber, we are all truly fans of the IP we work with,” said Josh Austin, Head of IP Development &amp; Licensing, Saber Interactive. “Our team members are some of the most devoted, passionate creatives out there and it’s an honor to join forces with Avatar Studios and Paramount Games to further expand the Avatar Legends universe in video games.

One example he cited was <em>Macross</em>, an ‘80s mech series that has found numerous ways to be about way more than just mechs. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2784620/ROGUE_FLIGHT/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Rogue Flight</em></a>, a space combat game coming later this year, wears that influence on its sleeve.&nbsp;</p><p>The game’s trailer speaks ominously of the world burning at the hands of a “watchman system” that took control of the solar defense force and turned on humanity, then shows off some slick-looking animated scenes and even slicker-looking space combat. The ships do flips. I’m into it.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Rogue Flight - Coming Late 2024" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IX_GefjbJbE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This one’s also touting a seriously stacked voice cast. <em>Rogue Flight</em>’s Steam page says that it features “Japanese talent from<em> Sailor Moon</em>, <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>, <em>Gundam</em>, <em>Naruto </em>&amp; <em>One Piece</em>, and English voice talent featured in <em>Overwatch </em>and <em>Fallout 76</em>, <em>League of Legends</em> and Marvel's <em>Avengers</em>.” It seems like, at least on that front, developer Truant Pixel understood the assignment. But can its story measure up to the likes of <em>Macross Plus</em> and <em>Macross: Do You Remember Love</em>, which Luke, Chris, and I derailed an Aftermath meeting to gush about last week? It’s a tall order, but here’s hoping.</p><p>All of this got me thinking: What are some other games that do justice to the retro anime vibe? As far as released stuff goes, there’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/jumplight-odyssey-rip-impressions-review-league-geeks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the sadly-discontinued <em>Jumplight Odyssey</em></a>, as well as better-faring fare like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/447530/VA11_HallA_Cyberpunk_Bartender_Action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>VA-11 HALL-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/29619/River_City_Girls_1_2_and_Zero/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent <em>River City</em> games</a>. On the horizon, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD_smAWp8OQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Vivarium</em></a><em> </em>looks super promising if you’re into cozy stuff, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXfldahdjM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Nightshift Galaxy</em></a> appears to be approaching mechanized space combat from a slightly different angle than <em>Rogue Flight</em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avatar-last-airbender-aaa-rpg-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive and Paramount have announced a new AAA action RPG based on Nickelodeon's iconic animation&nbsp;<em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, and the two studios are working in collaboration with Avatar Studios on the project.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-is-getting-a-aaa-rpg-with-saber-interactive-and-paramount-game-studios-exclusive" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an IGN report</a>, the project will be part of the Avatar Legends universe and will tell a completely original story, so it won't be adapting either&nbsp;<em>The Last Airbender&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Korra</em>.</p>
<p>Instead, the game will cast players as an all-new Avatar who's never been seen before in the lore of the show, and it'll take place "thousands of years in the past", according to IGN. That's right; it's a prequel!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avatar-the-last-airbender-rpg-saber-quest-for-balance.jpg?itok=tH-LJUIR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avatar-the-last-airbender-rpg-saber-quest-for-balance.jpg?itok=FXgkDI6Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Other&nbsp;<em>Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;</em>games exist, but they're...of varying quality.</figcaption></figure><p>A press release given to IGN by Paramount and Saber says players can expect a "vibrant world" from the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Avatar&nbsp;</em>game (no, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">not that <em>Avatar</em></a>), as well as the ability to "master all four elements", as you'd expect from an Avatar.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to "engage in dynamic combat alongside companions" and face "the challenges and decisions that come with being the keeper of balance in the world".&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two studios are promising story elements that are, to quote IGN, "both new and familiar to fans of the franchise". It's all pretty vague at the moment. Presumably, we'll hear more about the project in the coming months.</p>
<p>Paramount gaming SVP Doug Rosen says the&nbsp;<em>Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;</em>RPG represents a chance to "expand the world-building" and allow&nbsp;<em>Avatar&nbsp;</em>fans to "experience the new content in a completely immersive way".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nickelodeon-kart-racers-3-slime-speedway-aang.jpg?itok=A__k6XE6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nickelodeon-kart-racers-3-slime-speedway-aang.jpg?itok=q3EJx7Hl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This won't be&nbsp;<em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>'s first foray into the gaming world.</figcaption></figure><p>While this will, according to Saber and Paramount, be "the biggest video game in franchise history", it won't be&nbsp;<em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>'s first journey into the gaming world.</p>
<p>A number of direct&nbsp;<em>The Last Airbender&nbsp;</em>adaptations have been made, and characters from the show have also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avatar-last-airbender-characters-to-join-smite">joined the ranks of god-bothering MOBA&nbsp;<em>Smite</em></a>, of all things. Still, this project looks like it might be a bit more substantial than the ones that have come before.</p>

Paramount and Saber Interactive are teaming up to make the action RPG, which will put you in control of an “all-new, never-before-seen Avatar.”</p><p>Details about the upcoming game are still slim, but the companies tell <em>IGN</em> that it will let players master all four elements with “dynamic combat alongside companions” as well as “experience the challenges and decisions that come with being the keeper of balance in the world.”</p><p>Since the release of the animated <em>ATLA</em> series in 2005, we’ve seen several video game and live-action adaptations, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24071094/netflix-avatar-last-airbender-review">including one on Netflix</a>. Last year, Bamtang Games released <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender - Quest for Balance</em> — a co-op title that lets you play as&nbsp;Aang, Toph, Sokka, and Katara — but it didn’t <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-quest-for-balance-review">receive the most positive reviews</a>. </p><p>I’m looking forward to seeing how Paramount and Saber Interactive handle this upcoming game, especially since you’ll be playing as a new Avatar that’s not Aang or Korra. Saber Interactive is behind several successful titles as both a developer and publisher, including <em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 </em>and <em>Teardown</em>, along with adaptations like <em>Evil Dead: The Game</em> and <em>World War Z</em>.</p><p>“We know loyal fans of <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> have been eager for more stories that bring them into the universe of the show, and through gaming, we’re able to expand the world-building and allow fans to experience the new content in a completely immersive way,” Doug Rosen, the senior vice president of games and emerging media at Paramount, said in a statement to <em>IGN</em>.</p><p>This isn’t the only new <em>ATLA</em> game we’re getting, either. In February, a presentation from publisher Maximum Games revealed that it’s <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/02/avatar-the-last-airbender-competitive-multiplayer-fighting-game-announced">working on a competitive multiplayer fighting game</a> in the <em>ATLA</em> universe.</p><p><em><strong>Correction, October 3rd: </strong>An earlier version of the article stated Saber Interactive was behind </em>Vampyr <em>but it only developed the Switch version.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/3/24260550/blizzard-entertainment-play-nice-jason-schreier-activision-gaming-microsoft-xbox-decoder-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><p>On this week’s episode of <em>Decoder</em>, I’m talking to Jason Schreier, a <em>Bloomberg</em> journalist and author of the new book <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jason-schreier/play-nice/9781538725443/?lens=grand-central-publishing"><em>Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment</em></a>. </p></div><p>If you don’t know Blizzard, you know its games — the studio behind <em>Warcraft</em>, <em>Diablo,</em> and <em>Overwatch</em> is more than 30 years old, and it’s achieved legendary status. At the same time, Blizzard has become emblematic of many of the industry’s biggest failings, from the shareholder pressures to prioritize monetization over creativity to the deep sexism that still pervades so much of gaming today.&nbsp;</p><p>Jason’s book is out on October 8th, and it’s an incredible, detailed accounting of how Blizzard started, grew into one of the most beloved (and most controversial) companies in the world of video games, and eventually became a victim of its own mismanagement. Oh, and there are a series of chaotic, culture-clashing acquisitions along the way, culminating with Microsoft closing its deal to buy the combined company known as Activision Blizzard last year in the most expensive acquisition in gaming history. </p><p>As you’ll hear Jason tell it, the story of Blizzard really revolves around two central themes. One is the inherent tension that exists between art and commerce and how Blizzard’s journey from a small startup in California to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">subsidiary of Microsoft</a> with thousands of employees has been about as close to M&amp;A hell as you can imagine. </p><div><p>In particular, Jason goes into detail about how merging with Activision, the company behind <em>Call of Duty</em>, set Blizzard on a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-09-25/book-excerpt-play-nice-the-rise-fall-and-future-of-blizzard-entertainment">collision course that would rob it of much of the creative agency</a> that allowed it to flourish back in the ’90s.&nbsp;</p></div><p>The other big theme is how industries in intense insular fandoms, like gaming, often have deeply problematic workplace cultures that take root from the very beginning and refuse to let go. That makes these companies almost impossible to change without industry-shaking upheaval. </p><div><p>Listen to <em>Decoder</em>, a show hosted by <em>The Verge</em>’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems.&nbsp;Subscribe&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/welcome-to-decoder/id1011668648?i=1000496212371&amp;itsct=podcast_box&amp;itscg=30200&amp;ls=1&amp;at=1001l7uV&amp;ct=verge091322">here</a>!</p></div><p>The state of California filed a massive sexism and discrimination lawsuit against Activision Blizzard in 2021, a moment that would change the course of the company and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-blizzard-microsoft-deal-11642557922">precipitate its sale to Microsoft’s Xbox division</a> the following year. (Activision Blizzard and California <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/15/24003556/california-activision-blizzard-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement">settled the suit in 2023</a>, shortly after the Microsoft deal closed.)</p><p>There’s a lot going on here. And as you’ll hear Jason say, the story of Blizzard is a quintessential tale about the perils of capitalism — about what growth and scale will do to a business, especially those in the business of making art, and the compromises that have to be made along the way to keep all that money flowing. </p><p>It’s also a cautionary tale, about a fundamentally creative industry that has, at many times in its history, utterly failed to make room for more diverse voices, creating a ticking time bomb at the heart of even the most beloved institutions. </p><p>If you want to read more about the history of Blizzard, including excerpts from Jason’s book and deeper reporting on the Microsoft-Activision saga, check out these links below: </p><div><ul><li><em>Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment </em>| <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jason-schreier/play-nice/9781538725443/?lens=grand-central-publishing"><em>Hachette</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></li><li>How Blizzard’s canceled MMO Titan fell apart | <a href="https://www.polygon.com/excerpt/458330/why-blizzard-mmo-titan-was-cancelled"><em>Polygon</em></a></li><li>Blizzard was built on crunch, co-founder says, but it’s ‘not sustainable’ | <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/27/18761120/video-games-crunch-developers-unionize-mike-morhaime-comments-blizzard-world-of-warcraft"><em>Polygon</em></a></li><li>Inside Activision and Blizzard’s corporate warcraft | <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-09-25/book-excerpt-play-nice-the-rise-fall-and-future-of-blizzard-entertainment"><em>Bloomberg</em></a></li><li>Blizzard cofounder’s new company Dreamhaven aims to recreate old magic | <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-18/blizzard-co-founder-s-new-company-dreamhaven-aims-to-recreate-the-old-magic"><em>Bloomberg</em></a></li><li>Activision Blizzard’s rot goes all the way to the CEO, alleges report | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"><em>The Verge</em></a></li><li>Activision Blizzard’s workplace problems spurred $75 billion Microsoft deal | <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-blizzard-microsoft-deal-11642557922"><em>WSJ</em></a></li><li>California settles Activision Blizzard gender discrimination lawsuit | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/15/24003556/california-activision-blizzard-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement"><em>The Verge</em></a></li><li>Microsoft completes Activision Blizzard acquisition | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized"><em>The Verge</em></a></li><li>Microsoft lays off 1,900 Activision Blizzard and Xbox employees | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs"><em>The Verge</em></a></li></ul></div><div><div><h2>Decoder with Nilay Patel<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>A podcast from The Verge about big ideas and other problems.</p></div><p><a href="https://pod.link/decoder">SUBSCRIBE NOW!</a></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Konami producers have revealed that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater was easier to remake than Metal Gear Solid 1 and 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202410/19148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1841640650359656919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genki</a>), game producer Noriaki Okamura and creative producer Yuji Korekado explained why it would be harder to remake MGS1/2 than Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Okamura stated that to remake those two games, the developers must make some parts from scratch, including level design. With the remake of MGS 3, the developers only needed to create a few new parts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okamura added that they first want players to play the Metal Gear Solid: Delta remake, get feedback, and move forward accordingly. Also, very few staff members left were involved with Metal Gear Solid 1/2. Hence, they plan to “create a path to preserve the Metal Gear series for 10 or 50 years into the future” before all those involved with the original titles leave.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Korekado further stated that releasing the Metal Gear Solid Remake on PC will increase the game’s chances of being enjoyed for the next “10 to 20 years,” and their goal is to achieve that.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hametsu-core-rulebook-review.999504/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hametsu-core-rulebook-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Set in late 16th Century Japan, after an event known as the cataclysm opened a portal and released demons into the world, <em>Hametsu</em> sees groups of survivors battling for survival, seeking answers, or simply seeking glory in this apocalyptic fantasy wargame.</p>
<p>This is our first article covering <em>Hametsu</em>, and we'll focus on the Core Rulebook here and how to play, but in future articles, we'll be looking at the <em>Hametsu</em> miniatures available from <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/en-gb/pages/hametsu">Black Site Studios</a>, and other supplements as they release.</p>
<h2>What Is Hametsu?</h2>
<p><em>Hametsu</em> is a tabletop wargame for 1 to 4 players, which means it can be played solo or cooperatively against AI-controlled enemies. While Black Site Studios produces miniatures for the heroes and enemies for <em>Hametsu</em> (along with some awesome scenery), it's a miniature agnostic system, so you can use any miniatures you wish to play.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-2.jpg?itok=T3qcSxxw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-2.jpg?itok=IlWE5ljJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>How Do You Play Hametsu?</h2>
<p><em>Hametsu</em> has an extremely simple set of core rules, they take up about 11 pages in total in the Core Rulebook and include details of how enemies work, and all the actions available to the players. Characters and enemies have 4 core stats (Mind, Melee, Ranged, and Resilience), along with a Move, Body, Divine Favor, and Base Size stat. When making a test, players roll dice equal to the stat and need to score the number of successes required for the test. In some cases, like combat, this is a roll-off between the attacker's melee or ranged, and the defender's resilience stat.</p>
<p>Games of <em>Hametsu</em> take place over 3 unique phases. In the Stealth phase, players try to sneak around, avoiding the AI-controlled enemies who use the orders detailed in the scenario. In the Clash phase, enemies are aware of the players and attack them using their individual instinct rules. During both phases, players try to investigate clues, where they roll a D6 and add 1 for each previously investigated clue. Once a 9 is rolled on a clue investigation, the game moves into the Boss phase, and the lesser enemies flee to make way for a larger and more dangerous enemy.</p>
<p>Once a game is won, or lost, the players get a chance to upgrade their characters and move on to the next mission, with enemies scaling based on the combined levels of the players.</p>

<p><em>Hametsu</em> contains 4 schools, each containing 3 types of Hunters that players can choose from. The hunting party can contain any combination of hunters that players wish.</p>
<p>School of Magic</p>
<ul><li>Onmyoji - Magic users of elemental energies</li>
<li>Bunraku - Students of death magic</li>
<li>Monk - Spiritual magic users</li>
</ul><p>School of Stealth</p>
<ul><li>Shinobi - Ninjas, the masters of stealth</li>
<li>Geisha - Performers who use their abilities for distraction</li>
<li>Matagi - Ranged warriors</li>
</ul><p>School of Strength</p>
<ul><li>Ronin - Masterless samurai</li>
<li>Gaijin - Foreign warriors</li>
<li>Sumo - Large fighters who specialize in hand-to-hand</li>
</ul><p>School of Corruption</p>
<p>The <em>Hametsu</em> Core Rulebook includes the School of Corruption as a bonus school. These powerful classes can be played from the start, but using the core 3 schools for your first few games is advised, especially to play through the included campaign in the book.</p>
<ul><li>Ketto - Fast dual-wielding warriors</li>
<li>Kaeru - Stealthy acrobatic hunters</li>
<li>Doku - Poison users</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-4.jpg?itok=kAooaVgk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-4.jpg?itok=eljeFtQf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What Does The Hametsu Core Rulebook Contain?</h2>
<p>As well as the fantastic art, that captures the feel of an apocalyptic feudal Japan and lore in the form of notes and stories to get you into the setting, the <em>Hametsu</em> Core Rulebook contains the core rules, along with detailed rules for combat and how to create a hunter (using the 4 schools and 12 hunter types detailed above). It also contains details about how to randomly generate a game (along with some fixed scenarios), using the 6 enemy profiles and 6 boss profiles. The book also details the post-game sequence for leveling up your hunters, and advanced rules for mounts and companions, along with tables for random weather and events to add variety to your games.</p>
<p>When Hunters get to level 8, they can also take part in Raids, which are high-level boss battles against raid targets. These games don't have any stealth or clash phase, just the hunters and a boss. The <em>Hametsu</em> Core Rulebook contains details of the Raid game type, and the first raid boss, the giant Omukade. The book closes with a narrative campaign, The Wolf and the Devil, which is perfect for 4 level 1 Hunters to start their <em>Hametsu</em> journey.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, <em>Hametsu</em> is a miniatures agnostic system, so you can use any miniatures you wish, but Black Site Studios produce a range of miniatures for all the hunters, enemies, and bosses in the Core Rulebook. You can also pick up the Black Site Studios scenery, or create your own awesome landscapes to battle on.</p>
<p>The first expansion for <em>Hametsu</em> is also currently up for preorder, <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/products/hametsu-season-1-digital-bundle?variant=45362731155697">The Ryu and the Rain</a>, and also the&nbsp;<em>Hametsu</em> Legends: Mushashi solo expansion booklet. We'll look at these in detail in a future article.</p>
<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Hametsu Core Rulebook?</h2>
<p><em>Hametsu</em> perfectly blends a simplistic ruleset, thematic setting, and challenging enemies. The leveling up of hunters is fast and uncomplicated, but the skills you chose, along with the combination of hunters still has a lot to explore. The simple core rules and the AI controls of the enemies mean that your games won't be bogged down in checking rules pages, but you might have to flick between enemy stats (the enemy and boss references are available on the <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/pages/hametsu-resources">BSS website</a>). With <em>Hametsu</em> already expanding with a new campaign, new raid bosses, and new Hunters, there's a great future to see <em>Hametsu</em> expand even further.</p>
<h2>Should I Buy The Hametsu Core Rulebook?</h2>
<p>If the setting and simple ruleset for solo/cooperative play appeals to you, then there's a lot to love with <em>Hametsu</em>. Your Hunters don't have a huge amount of variety if you're looking for roleplaying game-level complexity in your characters, but there's enough variation that 4 players all playing the same Hunter type could have very different hunters by level 4 or 5. For solo games, the simplicity of the Hunters makes controlling 4 Hunter much easier, and the focus will be on the combinations your Hunters can work with rather than the individual focus on a single character.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/best-served-cold-bartending-murder-mystery<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Rogueside has announced&nbsp;<em>Best Served Cold</em>, a narrative-driven murder mystery adventure game in which you play a bartender in a city inspired by 1920s Bucharest.</p>
<p>The game is set in a fictional city called Bukovie, and you'll play as the owner of a speakeasy joint called the Nightcap, where you'll learn your customers' deepest, darkest secrets while pouring them the drinks they most desire.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>Best Served Cold&nbsp;</em>is reminding you of games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/va-11-hall">VA-11 Hall-A</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-adventure-red-strings-club-heads-to-steam-jan-22"><em>The Red Strings Club</em></a>, rest assured you're not alone, but the historical setting and more down-to-earth vibe of this one could well set it apart.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/best-served-cold-bartending-murder-mystery-dialogue.jpg?itok=kgE6yXaw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/best-served-cold-bartending-murder-mystery-dialogue.jpg?itok=sSYmEFP7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Best Served Cold&nbsp;</em>tells a story of murder and revenge in a city inspired by 1920s Bucharest.</figcaption></figure><p>You're getting away with running your speakeasy because a local detective has recruited you to help solve cases in return for the police looking the other way, so if you were wondering how you're getting away with it, now you've got your answer.</p>
<p>Rogueside is promising a "fascinating cast of intriguing characters" with their own backstories and agendas in&nbsp;<em>Best Served Cold</em>, as well as a "richly crafted world inspired by the cultural and artistic revival of 1920s Bucharest".</p>
<p>As you tend your bar, you'll gather clues about the crimes you're investigating.&nbsp;<em>Best Served Cold&nbsp;</em>will offer five cases, akin to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/great-ace-attorney-chronicles">typical&nbsp;<em>Ace Attorney&nbsp;</em>game</a>, so it should give you plenty of bang for your investigative buck.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>Best Served Cold</em>, which shows off the game's art style (but doesn't give too much away about its gameplay mechanics or plot), right here.</p>

<p><em>Best Served Cold&nbsp;</em>will feature writing from&nbsp;<em>Cloudpunk</em>'s Thomas Welsh, alongside Joshua Aldred, and its cases will "serve as a lens" to learn about the city's political and economic background, according to Rogueside.</p>
<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Best Served Cold&nbsp;</em>yet, but it's landing on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch when it does arrive. Stay tuned for more, and in the meantime, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3218530/Best_Served_Cold/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist the game on Steam here</a>.</p>

As I type these words, specialist wifeguy assessor Brendy is rambling through the fog of Bloober's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>. Knowing Brendy, he'll be sauntering down Neely Street like a gentleman dandy from 1920s Oxford, throwing out his cuffs and elbows and winking merrily at all the shambling depression metaphors who are trying to chew his legs off. While we await his verdict, here's another excerpt from a chat with Bloober earlier this summer, in which I pop the extremely imaginative question of what they'll do <em>after</em> remaking Silent Hill 2. The answer, in brief, is more games with a manual third-person view that rely on ambience, suspense and the thrill of the unknown, rather than monsters going "boo!"
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"Back in the day when we were working on the first Layers Of Fear, we were much more counting on jump scares and things that appear in a very sudden way," lead producer Maciej Głomb told me. "And I think that with every game afterward and especially right now, with Silent Hill 2, we went much more in the direction of just creating this tense atmosphere - again, [this sense of] the unknown, you're not sure what's going to happen next. If you can actually deliver on this feeling, you don't actually need to 'make' something happen because this is already working on players, they're having that experience." </p>
<p>These observations are "more on the creative side". In more practical terms, Bloober haven't spent years getting a manual third-person camera up and running only to pop it on the shelf come 7th October.</p>
<p>"[The Silent Hill 2 remake] is also the first game where we've created a third person camera and going forward, I think this is also the direction that we want to keep exploring," Głomb continued. "Because we feel that it actually helps you experience the story, and understand the emotions, the motivation of the characters, and keeps the overall experience much more personal. Because seeing the character, you identify with them, in my opinion, much more than, for example, when you play in first-person."
</p>
<p>
The remake's creative director Mateusz Lenart also told me that Bloober try to treat every project very deliberately as a foundation for the next.</p>
<p>"If you track our evolution over time, you can see that every single project was actually preparation to do that again, that kind of game," he said. "We're adding elements very slowly to grow as a company, to gain confidence, to gain experience, etcetera.</p><p>"And it was while we were doing The Medium, that we did this proposition - we felt we had the technology, the experience and knowledge to try and deal with Silent Hill, an iconic title. For us it was the cherry on the top, but we still want to progress, we've learned so much about technology, about combat systems, so many things that we can bring to new titles."
</p>
<p>A chaser: Bloober Team's CEO Piotr Babieno recently hinted to <a href="https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Bloober-Team-spodziewa-sie-kolejnych-rozliczen-z-Konami-za-kamienie-milowe-8818376.html">Bankier.pl</a> that we "can expect that [Silent Hill 2] is not the end of the adventure with Konami." Will they be allowed to develop the next numbered sequel? Or will Konami hand them another elder Hill to revamp, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-didnt-silent-hill-2-remake-devs-bloober-start-by-remaking-silent-hill-1-the-devs-explain">perhaps even the original game</a>?</p>
<p>
As I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-hours-of-bloobers-silent-hill-2-its-unclear-who-is-remaking-who">explored rather showily</a> in my preview, there's a sense in which Bloober have been making Silent Hill games since their founding. While distinct productions that form a discreet connected universe, their projects have always been heavily indebted to Konami's ashen psychodrama. This is especially true of The Medium, which puts a splitscreen spin on Silent Hill's alternate-dimension premise.</p>
<p>While I can respect the logic of building directly on the design of the Silent Hill 2 remake, I'd personally love Bloober to swing for the fences a little, with their next horror game concept. It's not like there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/every-new-silent-hill-project-announced-including-the-silent-hill-2-remake">any shortage of Silent Hill games</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-you-need-a-horror-game-to-tide-you-over-till-the-silent-hill-2-remake-you-can-do-a-lot-worse-than-becrowneds-demo">Silent Hill-inspired games</a> in the offing.

These will reward you with seven points and a similar item type as Easy Challenges.</li><li>Weekly Challenges rotate every week. <strong>The key differences here are that they can only be cleared once a week and their reward is 50 points and Dragon Krystals.</strong></li></ul><p>While you might want to just aim for the premium currency Dragon Krystals, it can be worth grinding these out for the points too. Similar to Kombat League, you’ll be ranked by how many points you earn. Your rank will naturally fall as more players rack up points. That means if you want the highest rewards that require a Top 10 percent or Top 5 percent ranking, you need to keep on grinding before the two-week timer runs out.</p><p>A future update will also add points to the different Towers themselves, instead of just with challenges. This should make ranking up a little less monotonous, but for now, it’s best to focus on the challenges.</p><p>If you’re not a fan of the grind in these games, this mode might not be up your alley. That being said, I do feel that <em>Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reign</em>’s Towers of Time is less grindy than the previous iteration. Having to check in on the rank rewards once every two weeks is more convenient than finding out through social media you only have a few hours to unlock a rare skin.</p><p>Remember that playing through Invasions mode will help a lot in buffing your characters’ stats for the tougher fights. Keep on tackling these towers and you’ll earn plenty of awesome cosmetics that will look great while brutalizing your opponents.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new AAA action-RPG based on the popular animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender is on the way.</p>
<p>Though still early in development, it's being made by Paramount Game Studios and Saber Interactive in "close collaboration" with Avatar Studios to tell a new story that's set to be "the biggest video game in franchise history".</p>
<p>Players will take on the role of an "all-new, never-before-seen Avatar", reports <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-is-getting-a-aaa-rpg-with-saber-interactive-and-paramount-game-studios-exclusive">IGN</a>, and will take place thousands of years in the past. The development team promises a vibrant world in which to master all four elements, dynamic combat alongside companions, and "the challenges and decisions that come with being the keeper of balance in the world".</p>

<p>Although there's no release date yet, it's set for release across PC and consoles.</p>
<p>Avatar Studios was set up in 2021 by original show creators Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko to expand the Avatar universe.</p>
<p>"At Saber, we are all truly fans of the IP we work with," said Josh Austin, head of IP development and licensing, Saber Interactive. "Our team members are some of the most devoted, passionate creatives out there and it's an honor to join forces with Avatar Studios and Paramount Games to further expand the Avatar Legends universe in video games. This unique co-fund structure is a result of our ever-expanding collaboration with Paramount, which started over a decade ago with WWZ, and we’re excited for all that’s on the horizon."</p>
<p>The Avatar: The Last Airbender series began on Nickelodeon in 2005 and was inspired by Chinese martial arts in its story of "Avatars" capable of "bending" the elements.</p>
<p>A number of video games based on the series have been released over the years, from the 2006 game of the same name right up to last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-mobile-avatar-the-last-airbender-game-is-on-the-way">mobile game Avatar: Generations</a>.</p>
<p>However, this new action-RPG will be the biggest adaptation yet.</p>
<p>Saber is fresh off its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 success</a>, with other games also based on famous IP on the way. That includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jurassic-park-survival-will-revisit-locations-from-1993-film-but-also-introduce-new-ones">Jurassic Park: Survival</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-revealed-for-pc-and-consoles">A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-boss-refuses-to-comment-on-knights-of-the-old-republic-remakes-fate">troubled Star Wars: The Old Republic Remake</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Just Add Water and Wired Productions have announced that excavation ’em up DIG VR is coming out on 24th October for Meta Quest.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/aV-JYNBZ3iA</p>


<p>Channelling every young boy’s love of big yellow diggers, Dig VR puts you in the cabin of a bunch of diesel-powered construction gear, offering both authentic and simplified control schemes. The emphasis is on going down, though, with a range of jobs that will have you dig, delve, dredge and more with dynamically dig-able terrain that can be moved around the environment.</p>
<p>There’s a career campaign taking you to jobs across Diglington and the County of Digshire, featuring four machines in a range of sizes and seven different tool heads – a bucket, Breaker, Circular Saw, Auger, Trimmer, Compactor and Grabber – and having you complete quirky minigames as you go. Alternatively, there’s a zen sandbox mode. That zen vibe can be enhanced by turning on the radio, with 45 songs that include music from Kieron Pepper (ex-Prodigy live drummer), Stu Brootal (Ivar &amp; The Horde), Pascal Magdinier, Lania Kea, and more.</p>
<p>Dig VR comes from a similar space as another zen breakout success, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/13/powerwash-simulator-vr-review/">PowerWash Simulator.</a> Starting off as an escapist lockdown project, it’s grown into something more.</p>

<p>Leo Zullo, Co-Founder &amp; Managing Director of Wired Productions, explained, “The pandemic was a terrible period for many, but one positive outcome was the concept of DIG VR, which came about whilst quarantined on my father’s farm in Italy. Using a digger in real life, with those controls and a steep learning curve, made the idea of a digging game in VR pop. Coming back to the UK and talking to the Just Add Water team, and of course, Meta, the idea took shape and DIG VR began its journey.”</p>
<p>“The game is deeply personal, but should resonate with many folks, from VR fans to construction workers, to simulation fans, and more importantly parents and their children.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-closed-beta-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-gamescom-hands-on-preview-vast-potential/">Gamescom 2024</a>, I had the chance to get a first taste of The First Berserker: Khazan's experience and, despite the limited time and a testing environment that was far from being ideal for a challenging action role-playing game inspired by FromSoftware's Souls series, I couldn't help but notice how the game is shaping up as a solid title with a personable, distinct feel that is sure to set it apart from similar games released in the past few years. So much so that I thought it was among the best games I played during the show alongside <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-brutally-engaging/">Phantom Blade Zero.</a></p>
<p>Last week, I had the chance to try out The First Berserker: Khazan Technical Closed Beta Test before its debut on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later this month. My four hours or so with it not only confirmed my positive opinion about the game but also improved it a bit, as I was able to see more of the beginning of the game, test out the skill system, and gain a better understanding of the flow of combat.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/01-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The First Berserker: Khazan Technical Closed Beta Test build features the game's first three missions - Heinmach, Stormpass, and Embars. In the first one, former general Khazan is released from imprisonment, obtaining a mysterious power that allows him to survive the harsh environment and defeat the many enemies on his way. In the Stormpass mission, the long-haired warrior visits one of the sacred sites of Bantu, revered since ancient times, where he gains a better understanding of his powers. The journey continues in Embars, with more enemies that bar his way and more information on his backstory and how he ended up where he is. The three missions may be a little light on story compared to other role-playing games, but I feel they set the experience up rather well, making the Dungeon and Fighter universe interesting right from the get-go, even for those with little knowledge of it. This was one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-interview-discussing-setting-gameplay-pc-features/">goals</a> developer Neople set for itself with this project, and the Closed Beta made me feel they will definitely achieve what they set out to do, in this regard.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, being able to try out The First Berserker: Khazan without a strict time constraint allowed me to get a better feel of many of the game's elements and how they come together to offer what could be one of the best action role-playing game experiences in a long time. For starters, I feel like much of the game has been designed around combat. Locations, for example, with their multiple paths and all, feel like they have been made in a certain way for the combat system to show its prowess, offering a variety of scenarios that force players to utilize Khazan's toolkit to its full extent. Exploring just for the sake of experiencing a unique location, like in FromSoftware's Elden Ring, doesn't seem to be a thing in The First Berserker: Khazan. Exploration leads to treasure and, more often than not, a unique combat encounter that puts the player's skills to the test. This could be disappointing for some, but I think this sort of intensity will greatly benefit the experience in the long run.</p>
<p>The longer playtime of The First Berserker: Khazan Technical Closed Beta Test also allowed me to appreciate combat more. While it is undeniable that the stamina-based combat system is very reminiscent of the Souls series, the Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Nioh series influences are more prominent. For starters, the evade maneuver doesn't have a whole lot of invincibility frames, making it a little risky to use in close-quarter. The parry, called Brink Guard, on the other hand, is a much more effective defensive technique as it is generally easy to pull off and allows Khazan to stay on the offensive since there's a small cancel window at the end of each move that allows going into the guarding stance immediately, and it restores stamina while depleting the enemy's. An instant evade technique called Brink Evade, is also in, but it seems to interrupt the flow of combat when used to avoid attacks that could be parried.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/03.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>All this, alongside the fast pace of combat, makes the combat system feel like a mix between Sekiro and Nioh,&nbsp; with the latter's influence being more prominent due to the skill and gear systems, as The First Berserker: Khazan features gear sets with different beneficial properties, and a dedicated skill tree for all three weapon types - Dual Wield, Great Sword and Spear - which allow the player to unlock different skills that can be assigned to different button combinations ala Nioh. These skills truly elevate the combat, in my opinion, and I can't wait to see what else Khazan can learn to take down the many enemies he will find on his path. The first three missions feature a decent selection of mobs and bosses, and hopefully, the rest of the game will feature a similarly well-designed mix.</p>
<p>The First Berserker: Khazan may have been influenced by the Souls series for many of its game systems, but I feel, now more than ever, that the game will have what it takes to emerge from the competition. My time with the Technical Closed Beta Test build made me even more excited about the game, and I really cannot wait to experience more of the game when it launches next year on PC and consoles.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-review-howling-good-time</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-review-howling-good-time.999465/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-review-howling-good-time<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Darkness falls on the world of Marvel Crisis Protocol with the release of Monsters Unleashed, a new character box featuring Dracula, N’Kantu, The Living Mummy, Frankenstein’s Monster, and Werewolf By Night. And whether you’ve been following these characters’ Marvel stories for decades, or you clicked on this article thinking “Huh, I didn’t know Dracula was in Marvel,” I’m here with the spooky scoop on this incredible new character pack and the Tomb of Dracula scenery kit - provided to TechRaptor as review copies by Atomic Mass Games.</p>
<p>We’ve recently featured a review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/apocalypse-unleashed-marvel-crisis-protocol-figure-and-terrain-review">Apocalypse and his terrain</a>, and our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-crisis-protocol-asgardian-character-pack-review">Asgardians Affiliation Pack review</a>, but now it’s time to brace ourselves for the terror that is Monsters Unleashed. I’m going to quickly cover each model, highlighting what I think they each do best, and how to use them most effectively.</p>
<h2>Monsters Unleashed: Werewolf By Night</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-werewolf-by-night.jpeg?itok=ak0K1Ilq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-werewolf-by-night.jpeg?itok=jYnvIVM6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>What Werewolf By Night does best:</em> Werewolf By Night is a very aggressive character, and wants to really get into the mix and start slashing. His builder attack automatically dishes out Bleed tokens (useful in combo with Dracula, more on that later), and there’s no better way to spend 3 Power than his Pounce ability, which lets you throw him S.</p>
<p><em>How to run him: </em>As will become clear when we talk about Dracula and his Affiliation card, Werewolf by Night fits well in a group that really cares about Bleed. But his other abilities are also stacking special conditions on your opponents as well. I think you really want to play Werewolf as a character dedicated to chasing down and harassing your opponent’s characters.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monsters-unleashed-werewolf-by-night-stat-card.jpeg?itok=KRTIpMy1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monsters-unleashed-werewolf-by-night-stat-card.jpeg?itok=Y_DQ-t0X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Between Pounce, his Healing Factor (2), and his Midnight Massacre ability which slashes back after he’s been dealt damage, Werewolf By Night could do a lot of good work harrying your opponent, chasing someone with an important Extract token around the board all game.</p>
<p>His unaffiliated Phases of the Moon card allows you to choose either a more defensive ability, or the ability to preroll 1 die in his attack for each special condition the target of his attack has. Choose the latter, even though you won’t be allowed to interact with, contest, or hold Extract objective tokens for the rest of the game, and don’t look back as you unleash Werewolf as your own personal attack wolf!</p>
<h2>Monsters Unleashed: N’Kantu, The Living Mummy</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-nkantu-the-living-mummy.jpeg?itok=KJj-zzz8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-nkantu-the-living-mummy.jpeg?itok=oL-eHpLk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>What N’Kantu, The Living Mummy does best:</em> N’Kantu, The Living Mummy is an interesting character, dedicated to collecting souls for Anubis. As such, he’s constantly gathering Captured Soul Tokens (whenever a character - on either team! - is dazed of KO’ed). He can use these tokens to use his special card (more on that below), turn failed roll dice into wilds, or heal itself. But what does he do best? Nothing exceptionally, except for his special card.</p>
<p><em>How to run him:</em> It’s admittedly a little hard to imagine a list that really wants to run him, unless you’re looking to slot him into your Midnight Sons roster for his 3 Threat (though I think there are better options there). The only place where this unit really shines is his special card, Service to Anubis.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-unleashed-nkatu-mummy-stat-card.jpeg?itok=_NIkGPef 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-unleashed-nkatu-mummy-stat-card.jpeg?itok=_cSKaZgq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With Service to Anubis, you spend Capture Soul Tokens to create an area attack equal to the number of tokens spent (max 3), and you spend a number of energy tokens to determine how many dice you roll.</p>
<p>So there’s a world where you get a bunch of captured soul tokens, get him into place amongst other enemies, and pop this card (remember, special cards are a one-off) for 6 or more dice… but is that really going to happen? This feels like a trick shot character tied to one card, which is a shame, because the model looks SO cool.</p>
<h2>Monsters Unleashed: Frankenstein’s Monster</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-frankensteins-monster.jpeg?itok=ri3tdE3D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-frankensteins-monster.jpeg?itok=mOILkFCy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>What Frankenstein’s Monster does best:</em> Though he doesn’t have a Builder attack (and only gains 1 energy), Frank is an absolute brute of a character, as you’d hope and expect! And the weird thing is - he’s super-mobile!</p>
<p>He’s on a big base, and with his Medium speed and his Charge special power, he can really move across the board. He can even spend some energy to heal himself. So he is, in essence, best at dealing out lots of damage.</p>
<p><em>How to run him: </em>The best way to run Frankenstein’s Monster is to get him into the thick of things and have him start to really mess up the board. He can throw Size 4 or less terrain, he can bash characters with his “Thick Skull” ability (I love the naming there), and he’s also, flavorfully, immune to shock!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-unleashed-frankensteins-monster.jpeg?itok=YZ2Q4nTe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-unleashed-frankensteins-monster.jpeg?itok=fAbidERq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>And his special card, Hideous Monster, shows off his good natured heart. Basically, it allows you to have him swoop in, take damage instead of an ally, and then potentially even dish back some damage to the attack and pull them closer to him. Like a lumbering monster raging at their friends being hurt, Frank is so pure.</p>
<h2>Monsters Unleashed: Dracula</h2>
<p>Finally, we’re getting to who I would consider the star of this box: Dracula (though I have to admit, I’m impressed by Frankenstein’s Monster).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-dracula-hero-shot.jpeg?itok=HUsd05K3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-dracula-hero-shot.jpeg?itok=vu3VtUba 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>What Dracula does best:</em> Dracula does everything you’d want him to do in the game, whether you know him from the comics or from mythology. He can transform into a bat (giving him flight), a wolf (letting him move L instead of M), or mist (which lets him drop any conditions he has and heal two wounds).&nbsp;</p>
<p>He can also hit hard with his Ancestral Blade, can use his Feast of Blood ability to heal which dishing out damage, and has a Hypnotic Stare ability which can force an enemy character to advance S toward him. So what does he do best? He does “being a vampire lord” best!</p>
<p><em>How to run him:</em> Dracula is an aggressive character with decent defenses and strong (very strong, even) attacks. From a sheer damage output perspective, I think he’s one of the stronger 5 Threat characters out there. And then there’s his special card, “Thralls of Dracula”. Though you can also run him in a Cabal Affiliation, he makes his own ad hoc affiliation with this card.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-dracula.jpeg?itok=VJbCOb-I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-dracula.jpeg?itok=tyrXMjoG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Basically, if you build an unaffiliated squad with him in it, you can use this card to make it a Thralls of Dracula affiliation, giving everyone the Bloodlust ability, which lets them dish out the Bleed special ability (or, if their target opponent already has the bleed special ability, lets them heal 1 damage). This benefit from Bleed is to be expected from a vampire, and it’s why I mentioned above that Werewolf By Night and he make such a nice pairing.</p>
<h2>Tomb of Dracula Terrain Kit</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-tomb-of-dracula.jpeg?itok=4LiNWeF2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-tomb-of-dracula.jpeg?itok=itv5AgL1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Now let’s take a look at the Tomb of Dracula terrain set, which I had the absolute pleasure of building and painting up (albeit quickly to get it together in time for this review, don’t judge my signature Giaco sloppiness!). This is a towering piece of terrain, designed to look just like a slice of Dracula’s tomb taken straight from the comics (you could even put Moon Knight on these steps, looking for his money).</p>
<p>It even contains two One-Shots. The first, and more straightforward of the two, is Darkness Falls, which casts unnatural darkness on the realm, making it so each character has Stealth (they must be within 3 range of the character to target it with attacks).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-tomb-of-dracula-detail.jpeg?itok=n7qeSYmZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-tomb-of-dracula-detail.jpeg?itok=HUwCJqJV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Even more interesting, in my opinion, is the Hunter Seeks Vengeance One-Shot, which really mixes things up by allowing your opponent to field an <i>additional</i> Threat 3 or less character from their Roster to serve as a Vampire Hunter who only wants to kill Dracula (and can only move toward and attack Dracula). How fun, how strange, and how wonderfully different this is! I love this outside the box thinking.</p>
<h2>Marvel Crisis Protocol Monsters Unleashed - Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This is a very powerful box set of miniatures, and I love that they all follow a theme instead of all belonging to one Affiliation (though, to be fair, I guess <i>any</i> character can belong to Dracula’s Affiliation). The downside to following a theme, however, is that you might not get use out of this entire box.</p>
<p>And as for the Tomb of Dracula, what can I say? It’s one of the single-most impressive pieces of terrain they’ve ever released for Marvel Crisis Protocol. It’s evocative, and even though there isn’t any other terrain made for the game that really matches the vibe of it, you can always imagine a world where Dracula’s lair has blasted through a rift and landed in the middle of Manhattan!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-citizen-debacle-reportedly-continues-with-mandated-crunch.999462/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-debacle-crunch-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report claims that&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>developer Cloud Imperium Games is mandating its developers work seven days a week in order to meet their deadlines for an upcoming convention.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson</a>, a staff email was sent by Cloud Imperium management earlier this week, and in that email, the studio says that developers need to "double down over the next 18 days" in order to finalize an upcoming&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>patch and a demo for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizens-single-player-squadron-42-is-feature-complete-celebrates-with-spectacular">shooter&nbsp;<em>Squadron 42</em></a>.</p>
<p>The email apparently continues by saying that "for the next two weekends, [Cloud Imperium] will be mandating extra time for all those working on deliverables for [Citizencon]".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-citizen-crunch-report-misc-odyssey.jpg?itok=qc3IegPs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-citizen-crunch-report-misc-odyssey.jpg?itok=zQAykZbB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>developers are apparently being told to crunch before Citizencon later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>The mandate includes necessitated office working on the Fridays of October 4th and October 11th, which are, according to Henderson's report, usually times when the studio would be working from home.</p>
<p>Additionally, Cloud Imperium will require workers to be in the office on the weekends of October 5th and October 12th for both Saturday and Sunday. Staff will supposedly receive time off in lieu for these weekends, which they can then use at a later time.</p>
<p>According to Insider Gaming's report, this isn't the first time Cloud Imperium has made unreasonable demands of its employees in recent months, either; staff were apparently also told they would only receive&nbsp;<em>Squadron 42</em>-related time off in lieu when the game ships, and only if they're still with the studio when it does.</p>
<p>Following the initial email, Cloud Imperium apparently sent another to staff, offering them the day off on Monday, October 21st to "give a little break for everyone to rest after our long Citizencon weekend".</p>

<p><em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>is an ambitious space sim that's been in development since 2010. It was first Kickstarted back in 2012, and its initial campaign raised more than $2 million.</p>
<p>Since then, the game has gone on to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-citizen-pushes-through-the-700-million-raised-mark-and-no-there-still-isnt-a-release-date" rel="noopener" target="_blank">amass more than $700 million in crowdfunding</a>, but despite that staggering total and the length of time since it began development, there's still no&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>1.0 release date.</p>
<p>Cloud Imperium has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-roadmap-release-2024">promised to reveal a roadmap to release</a> at some point this year, but at time of writing, that roadmap has yet to materialize.</p>
<p>What definitely did materialize, though, were a tribunal's findings earlier this year that Cloud Imperium <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal">discriminated against a disabled employee</a>&nbsp;by mandating a return to the office with no provision for said employee's disability.</p>
<p>We'll keep you posted on&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>and bring you more as soon as we get it. Stay tuned.</p>

                <p>For the first time since 1977, dockworkers at ports from Maine to Texas are on strike for higher wages and better working conditions, prompting fears of product shortages. But will the strike, which covers 45,000+ dockworkers at 36 ports on the US East and Gulf coasts, impact video games?</p><p>The short answer: probably not, at least not in the short term. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter tells GameSpot that nearly every major product manufactured in Asia comes into the US through ports on the West coast. Video game consoles like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch devices are manufactured in China and are known to come into the US through ports on the West coast. As such, the impact of the strike on video game console availability may be limited.</p><p>The availability of video game consoles was constrained during the pandemic due in part to global semiconductor shortages and supply chain challenges. These issues impacted Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, along with a number of other video game companies.</p><p>Workers on the US West coast are represented by a different union (<a href="https://www.pmanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-06-29-2022_MOU_and_LOUs-COMPLETE-conformed.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">which itself went on strike in 2023 for higher wages, and earned them</a>) than the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) that is currently on strike. ILA workers went on strike on Tuesday, calling for higher wages and protections against additional automation.</p><p>Mat Piscatella of Circana tells GameSpot that, without being an expert on supply chain logistics, he believes the dock strikes were anticipated by major companies, who stocked up as much as they could. "For the short term at least, significant disruption for video game product availability should not be expected as contingency planning was already in place," Piscatella said.</p><p>That being said, Piscatella said if the strike goes on for an extended period of time, "some impact could be seen."</p><p>"If the strikes go ahead, they will cause enormous delays across the supply chain, a ripple effect which will no doubt roll into 2025 and cause chaos across the industry," supply chain management and logistics firm Pro3PL founder Jay Dhokia told <a href="https://apnews.com/article/port-strike-ila-dockworkers-begins-e5468e760f46a64e4322d1702beb1f72" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Associated Press</a>.</p><p>While video game consoles are unlikely to be significantly affected by the latest dockworker strikes, the same cannot be said for a delectable, potassium-filled fruit. The American Farm Bureau Federation reported that 75% of the United States' supply of bananas comes through East and Gulf coast ports, putting them and other perishable imports at risk.</p><p>The ILA is seeking a 77% pay raise over six years; ILA union workers currently start with a base salary of $81,000 per year with those who work generous amounts of overtime capable of earning $200,000 or more annually. The union is also seeking a total ban on automation. The US Maritime Alliance, which represents the ports, has countered with 50% raises over six years and a pledge to limit automation.</p><p>President Joe Biden can intervene by using the <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/who-we-are/our-history/1947-taft-hartley-substantive-provisions" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Taft-Harley Act</a> to enact an 80-day cooling off period to get people back to work, but the president has said he will not do this.</p>
