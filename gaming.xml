                <p>Earlier this month, NetherRealm Studios released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-gets-the-definitive-edition-treatment-and-its-out-now/1100-6531544/" data-ref-id="1100-6531544">Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition</a>, a digital-only package that includes the base game, the Khaos Reigns DLC expansion, and two rounds of fighter packs. Players took it as a sign that MK1 wouldn't be getting any more updates, and bombarded NetherRealm for continued DLC support. Now, NetherRealm has confirmed that Mortal Kombat 1's reign is coming to a close.</p><p>"We are hearing players' requests for continued game support of Mortal Kombat 1," noted the game's official account on <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020816879206810" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>. "And, while we will continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes, there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released from this point on."</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020818363924598" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a later message</a>, NetherRealm acknowledged that fans may be disappointed by the news, before adding that the devs need "to shift focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can."</p><p>NetherRealm hasn't officially announced which game is coming next from the studio, but the most likely choice would be Mortal Kombat 2. DC fighting game fans would probably also like to see NeatherRealm get around to Injustice 3, since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/injustice-2-review/1900-6416680/" data-ref-id="1900-6416680">Injustice 2</a> was released eight years ago without getting a proper sequel.</p><p>Earlier this year, NetherRealm added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-adds-a-secret-fight-against-pink-floyd-kind-of/1100-6528939/" data-ref-id="1100-6528939">a pink ninja named Floyd</a> as a hidden battle in Mortal Kombat 1, which may be the final piece of bonus content in the game. Warner Bros. has also recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-2-johnny-cage-is-a-list-material-in-new-images/1100-6530158/" data-ref-id="1100-6530158">new images from the Mortal Kombat 2 movie</a>, which will hit theaters on October 24.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Most notably, both the Light and Heavy Bowguns are receiving some substantial buffs, as are the Hammer and Hunting Horn. For the bowguns, various ammo types are seeing a damage increase, as well as an increase to the number of hits when using Dragon Ammo. There are other smaller adjustments too, with the only nerf to come out of the Bowgun changes being a decrease to Elemental Ammo damage.</p><p dir="ltr">For the Hammer and Hunting Horn, both blunt weapons are seeing some major improvements. Hammer is having the "overall" power of its attacks increased, as well as improvements to responsiveness when charging an attack. The hitbox has also been increased for Upswing and sneak attacks. Hunting Horn has seen the damage of some of its key attacks (Echo Bubble, Performance, and Focus Strike: Reverb) increased, as well as a "significant" increase to Encore damage. Capcom has also toned down the visual effects of Echo Bubbles in order to help improve visibility during hunts.</p><p dir="ltr">Those caught up in Monster Hunter Wilds' endgame grind will find more to do soon, as the latest patch makes it so higher-difficulty quests should now appear more frequently as a player's Hunter Rank increases. As detailed in the patch notes, that translates to increased spawn rates for quests with multiple monsters and increased Tempered monster spawn rates. As for monster balance changes, the main change is that monsters resistant to paralysis with now gain more resistance to the ailment each time it's triggered on them, which should make it harder to keep monsters locked down.</p><p dir="ltr">Going hand-in-hand with the more frequent Tempered monster spawns are five additional Tempered monsters for players to hunt. At Hunter Rank 41 and higher, players can encounter eight star versions of Tempered Gore Magala, Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad.</p><p dir="ltr">Fashion Hunters will have more to do as well, with new Hunter and Palico armor sets, outfits for Alma, and additional gestures, pendants, and stickers. Other additions in the patch include the addition of Mandarin Chinese as a language option, the ability to use the rest feature while in tents in Suja and the Grand Hub, and a whole lot of bug fixes. You can find the full patch notes below.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Wilds has proven to be a huge success for Capcom. It's currently the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">best-selling game of 2025 so far</a>, having sold more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hits-a-massive-milestone-free-item-pack-coming-to-celebrate/1100-6530490/" data-ref-id="1100-6530490">10 million copies in its first month</a>, and has helped cement Monster Hunter as one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/capcoms-best-selling-game-franchises-of-all-time-and-whats-next-for-each/2900-6294/" data-ref-id="2900-6294">Capcom's best-selling game franchises</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Wilds Patch 1.011.00.00 Notes</h2><h3>Major Additions and Changes</h3><ul><li>– Street Fighter 6 Special Collaboration is now available.</li><li>– Street Fighter 6 Special Collaboration side missions have been added.</li><li>– Street Fighter 6 Special Collaboration Arena Quests have been added.</li><li>– Akuma has been added as an NPC.</li><li>– Akuma-only actions have been added, which can also deal damage to monsters.</li><li>– Five more Tempered Monsters (8★) have been added to the game.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-days-of-play-2025-brings-discounts-on-ps5-consoles-accessories-ps-plus.1199667/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/playstation-days-of-play-2025-brings-discounts-on-ps5-consoles-accessories-ps-plus/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has revealed the Days of Play 2025 promotion, running from 28th May through 11th June to coincide with Summer Games Fest, and bringing discounts for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> consoles, accessories, games, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a>.</p>
<p>This includes some significant sale pricing on PlayStation 5 consoles. In the US and Canada, the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 bundle is starting at $399.99 USD / $509.99 CAD for the digital edition, saving up to $120 if bought separately. Meanwhile, standalone consoles in Europe and Asia will also be on sale, starting at €399.99 / £339.99 / ¥65,980 for the digital edition. There will also be a $50 USD discount on the PS5 Pro.</p>


<p>That’s potentially a good set of savings, bringing the price of the digital consoles down significantly <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/10/new-ps5-slim-revealed-with-uhd-blu-ray-drive-add-on-1tb-ssd/">below what the MSRP was</a> prior to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/ps5-price-increases-hit-uk-eu-aus-nz-but-at-least-the-disc-drive-is-getting-cheaper/">the price hikes in April this year</a>. I’m not sure why Sony aren’t saying the price of disk drive consoles, outside of “starting from” giving lower numbers.</p>
<p>There will also be offers for PS5 accessories and games, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>$50 USD off PlayStation VR2 and PlayStation VR2 Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle</li>
<li>$30 USD off Pulse Explore wireless earbuds</li>
<li>$30 USD off DualSense Edge wireless controller</li>
<li>$20 USD off Access controller</li>
<li>$20 USD off DualSense wireless controller</li>
</ul>
<p>Discounts will also be rolling out through the PlayStation Store on hundreds of games, and there’s also some savings to be had on PlayStation Plus. New subscribers can save up to 33% on a 12-month membership, though this will depend on region and tier – PS Plus Essential typically only has a 20% discount in these deals now, though Sony has not yet stated what the discount will be, sticking with the “up to” descriptor.&nbsp;If you upgrade from PS Plus Essential or Extra to PS Plus Premium, then you will also save 33%.</p>

<p>Sony’s revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/the-june-2025-ps-plus-monthly-games-include-jet-set-radios-spiritual-successor/">PS Plus Monthly Games for June</a>, with a bonus fourth title, the Destiny 2: The Final Shape year-long expansion.</p>
<p>For PS Plus Extra, games added through the next fortnight include Another Crab’s Treasure (PS5), Skull and Bones (PS5), Destiny 2: Legacy Collection (PS5, PS4) and Grand Theft Auto III (PS4, PS5). Meanwhile, Myst and Riven are added to the PS Plus Premium Classics library.&nbsp;There’s also PS Plus trials for Kingdom Come: Deliverance II and Sid Meier’s Civilization VII.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sandfall Interactive announced that its debut smash-hit RPG, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, has hit <strong>3.3 million copies sold</strong>, 33 days after the game launched.</p>
<p>"<em>We couldn't make that up</em>," a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1927364988219383892">post on X</a> from the game's official account reads. "<em>Another entry on the long list of surreal moments that your support has made real. Thank you all.</em>"</p>
<p>It's the latest sign that the stars definitely aligned to help Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 reach the audience of players looking for RPG's like Clair Obscur. Even the fact that the week it launched, it did so days after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered arrived, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-shadow-drop-actually-helped-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">ended up helping out Clair Obscur instead of overshadowing it</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond not getting overlooked by an Oblivion remaster, the other major aspect of this milestone is the fact that, like Oblivion Remastered, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 also launched into Xbox Game Pass, so millions of players didn't necessarily need to buy it to check it out. All in all, for a small team like Sandfall Interactive, they couldn't have asked for a better launch for their debut game.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed Clair Obscur</a>, he had nothing but praise for it, writing:</p>
<p>"<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may not be the most innovative role-playing game, but its core elements come together beautifully, delivering an emotional journey that is as moving as it is engaging and fun. It may be Sandfall Interactive's first expedition, but the French developer has shown it has the passion and the chops to craft a memorable experience worthy of a Game of the Year nomination, if not the award itself</em>."</p>

But in Japan, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/2025/250527.html">announced a new partnership</a> with Japanese third-party retail sites to combat fraudulent Switch 2 listings.</p><p>Mercari, Yahoo Auctions and Yahoo Flea Market, and Rakuten Rakuma are the participating websites that will, according to a machine translation of Nintendo’s announcement, “proactively remove listings” and establish “a collaborative system for sharing information.” Nintendo says only “fraudulent listings” that violated the sites’ terms of service agreement would be targeted for removal.</p><p>In <a href="https://support.yahoo-net.jp/PccAuctions/s/article/H000014527">a translated statement on Yahoo Japan’s website</a>, the retailer stated that there will be a probationary period for the Switch 2 starting June 5th in which Yahoo Japan will remove listings for the console or suspending the accounts selling them. According to Yahoo Japan, it will revise the probationary period as necessary.</p><p>Scalpers are the bane of any console launch. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/25/23137789/aio-buying-bots-ps5-xbox-series-x-console-shortage">Bots flood online buying queues</a> to snap up units before real humans can click “Add to Cart.” Bot users then take advantage of consumer FOMO by listing consoles for exorbitant prices. Meanwhile, other sellers use deception to trick people into buying what they think is a console but is actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ebay-issues-warning-to-scammers-selling-photos-of-ps5s">a picture of a box</a> or some other worthless item. (Anti-scalpers would later use <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nintendeal.com/post/3lnjzg2iswk2w">a version of this practice</a> for the Switch 2.)</p><p>Hopefully, Nintendo’s plan with third-party sites in Japan works well enough to expand it to other regions.</p><div><p>To cut down on scalpers during the Switch 2 preorder window, Nintendo sent out preorder invitations to users with over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">50 hours of gameplay and a Nintendo Switch Online subscription</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It's nice when you have some extra time to do things that aren't that important but would make you 0.0001% happier knowing they are no longer around. Take my PC desktop, for example. In backing up my old <em>VICE</em> email, it built a bunch of weird files on my desktop and made it cluttered. I like a clean desktop. Put that shit into folders, you know? But I only use my PC desktop to stream games, having moved into a Mac for most of my writing and admin work. But I still hate that cluttered desktop!!!! Every time I turn on the PC!!! But given that I'm almost immediately booting into a game, does it matter? No. Does it mater 0.0001%? Yes, yes it does, and when I had a few hours to myself on Friday ahead of family stuff, I finally turned on the PC, figured out why the weird files were there, and got rid of them. I now have a clean PC desktop. It is inconsequential, but I am genuinely 0.0001% happier.</p><p>-pk, who is spooked about seeing <em>Bring Her Back </em>later this week</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MEMORIAL DAY: </strong>A day off where I realized part of my deck is falling apart, thanks to an animal. Is it <em>good</em> if a squirrel finds a way to rip through part of a post and make it their home? It's not a terribly fun way to spend the final hours of a day off, scrambling to send photos to contractors and wondering "how much is this gonna cost?" Something to chat about on a future <em>HOA</em>, I guess.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Hopshot</em> – The last stream did not go well. A bad jump sent me spiraling, forcing the kindest version of a rage quit, where I realized I just did not have the energy to center myself back into place. Sorry. I think we're going to give this <em>one</em> last go before I give <em>Hopshot</em> a break? I do want to finish it, and I promise I will finish it on camera, but there might be logic to doing one of two things: 1) playing for an hourish once per day, letting me walk away without feeling fully defeated or 2) coming back in a month.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio </em>– Rob is out, but Rob is now back. </li><li><strong>VIDEO: </strong>An opportunity came up that'll make sense when the video goes live. Should be fun, though. It's not a way we usually cover a video game, but Chia is out on Friday, forcing us to be a little more creative on pulling this one off.</li><li><strong>LETTER SERIES:</strong> Once again, topic TBD. Any ideas?</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

In this short, but sweet, adventure, players control a chicken named Chick and his sidekick Nugget as they set out on an adventure to rescue stolen eggs. It’s a simple but cute premise for a game, and it should provide a worthwhile experience for fans of platformers and cozier games. If you’re wondering just how many hours you’ll be spending with Chick and Nugget, let’s dig into how long it takes to beat <em>PaperKlay</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,196215,196923" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h25605"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to beat <em>PaperKlay</em>?</h2><p><strong><em>PaperKlay</em> is a fairly brief little game that should take most players around 6 hours to see through to its conclusion</strong>. Given its launch price of only $15, though, that ends up feeling like a pretty decent amount of content for platforming enthusiasts to sink their teeth into. </p><p>Like many other games in the genre, <em>PaperKlay</em> is also a collect-a-thon with plenty of things to seek out in each of its levels.</p><p>If you want to collect every button, orb, and egg in <em>PaperKlay</em>, you will almost certainly need to play through various levels multiple times. And a few orbs, in particular, require you to have a lot of environmental awareness. You’ll need to engage in puzzles (such as flipping parts of the level to line up platforms), find items in the world to return to their owners, or even rapidly track down red orbs before a timer runs out.</p><p><strong>Doing everything in <em>PaperKlay</em> can certainly increase your playtime by a few additional hours, possibly even double the amount of time you’d spend if you just played through it once</strong>. Collectibles can be used to upgrade your abilities, so you might find return trips to previous levels a bit speedier once your health, glider, and jumping abilities are all improved. You’re also likely to earn most of the game’s achievements by the time you play through each level a few times. </p><p>All in all, it’s worth investing the time in this adorable platformer, even if the journey is over quicker than we may wish. Here’s to hoping WhyKev is eyeballing some DLC for the future so that we can all spend a bit more time with Chick and Nugget.</p><p><em>PaperKlay</em> is available now on Windows PCs, with a Nintendo Switch version on the way at an unspecified date in the future.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What contributed to the game's big success? No doubt a number of factors, including its lower price and smaller scope, according to publisher Kepler Interactive.</p><p>Kepler's Matthew Handrahan told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-clair-obscur-expedition-33-interview-sandfall-and-kepler-on-team-size-the-return-of-aa-games-and-whats-next" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that Expedition 33 "really respects the player's time;" it's not a game that offers size for the sake of size. "It gives them plenty to do, and it gives them plenty of satisfaction, but it isn't arbitrarily 500 hours of gameplay," he said. "It's impactful because it's scoped correctly. […] It doesn't have any sense of bloat or extraneous things that are put there just to make it larger and larger and larger."</p>

<p>Handrahan went on to say he believes "brevity should be more of a virtue in gaming," adding that "something can be better by being shorter."</p><p>What he's saying sounds similar to what 2K said about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531409/" data-ref-id="1100-6531409">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, which is a $50 linear game that doesn't require a "massive time commitment." 2K has said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-isnt-open-world-and-doesnt-require-a-massive-time-commitment/1100-6531408/" data-ref-id="1100-6531408">believes there is an audience for just such a game</a>, and Expedition 33's sales results thus far may lend credence to that possibility.</p><p>Also in the interview, Handrahan reacted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-80-games-are-a-steal-based-on-what-they-offer-former-playstation-exec-says/1100-6531628/" data-ref-id="1100-6531628">rising prices in gaming</a>, saying Expedition 33's $50 price point might have helped the game reach more people. As the price of AAA games goes up and up, it creates an opportunity for "sensibly scoped games" in the $40-$50 range, he said.</p><p>"I don't think anyone that played Expedition 33 would think they didn't get their money's worth out of that," he said. When the $50 price was announced, the company got backlash online, Sandfall COO and producer François Meurisse said, because people feared Expedition 33 might be a 12-hour game with "unfinished content."</p><p><b>"</b>But in the end we stuck with the price, we doubled down on it, [and] we provided some context about the fact that it wasn't a AAA," the developer said. "In the end, it was a win-win situation, because it was a way to attract more players towards the game, to have good player satisfaction about their buying [decision], and it could actually end up doing more sales. So maybe players' perception can change a bit about that kind of price [point]."</p><p>Expedition 33 also launched into the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a> library--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-didnt-steamroll-expedition-33-publisher-says/1100-6531269/" data-ref-id="1100-6531269">the same week as Oblivion Remastered</a>--and some theorized that this might have negatively impacted the number of copies sold outright. Kepler rejected that idea, though, saying launching near Oblivion Remastered didn't seem to hurt "at all."</p><p>Other developers have admitted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-dev-discusses-game-pass-launch-and-risk-of-cannibalizing-sales/1100-6530925/" data-ref-id="1100-6530925">launching into Game Pass might cannibalize game sales</a>, but any potential losses could be mitigated by a payment from Microsoft to launch on Game Pass. The business specifics of any such deal between Microsoft and Kepler for Expedition 33 are unknown.</p><p>Given the big success of Expedition 33 thus far, many are wondering if Sandfall will release any DLC or expansions for the game, but nothing has been announced. The studio is, however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unsurprisingly-another-game-from-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dev-is-coming/1100-6531816/" data-ref-id="1100-6531816">gearing up for its next game.</a></p>

                <p>Uncapped Games has announced that it is ceasing development on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battle-aces/" data-ref-id="5000-631828">Battle Aces</a>, a fast-paced real-time strategy (RTS) spearheaded by a former StarCraft 2 developer.</p><p>This decision was announced on <a href="https://www.playbattleaces.com/news/development-of-battle-aces-has-ended" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battle Aces' website</a>. The only real reasoning Uncapped Games provided for the cancellation was that "the returns from early testing were not strong enough to support continued development." In the announcement, Uncapped Games went on to thank the community. "We’ll always be proud of what we built, and the community that formed around Battle Aces," the studio's statement explains. "While the game’s journey ends here, the connections, ideas, and memories we have shared will remain with us forever."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0VRoyKP9r8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c0VRoyKP9r8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Battle Aces was first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5449/" data-ref-id="2900-5449">announced at Summer Game Fest 2024</a> by Uncapped Games, a subsidiary of the Tencent-owned LightSpeed Studios. Its game director was David Kim, a designer who worked on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/" data-ref-id="5000-30719">StarCraft 2</a> at Blizzard Entertainment, and wanted to make an RTS that stripped back much of the complexity and unit micromanagement common in the genre. Battle Aces matches were short, as players could quickly spawn units and issue simple commands to outflank their enemy and ultimately destroy their base.</p><p>Uncapped Games had held several betas following the announcement of Battle Aces. Invited players had opportunities to try it out in June 2024, November 2024, and April of this year. Although I enjoyed what I played in those betas, after all that public-facing testing, it appears that those behind Battle Aces ultimately determined that it would not be successful enough to launch. For now, there is currently no word on whether Battle Aces' cancellation will result in layoffs at Uncapped Games.</p><p>Those looking for new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-strategy-games/2900-5977/" data-ref-id="2900-5977">RTS games</a> to carry on StarCraft's legacy will now have to check out the likes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stormgate/" data-ref-id="5000-565942">Stormgate</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mechabellum/" data-ref-id="5000-511161">Mechabellum</a>, which are backed by former Blizzard developers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/the-june-2025-ps-plus-monthly-games-include-jet-set-radios-spiritual-successor/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony is kicking off the Days of Play promotion for June, and as part of that, they’ve announced the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> Monthly Games. There’s four games this time, including the spiritual successor to Jet Set Radio, with the added freebie being Destiny 2: The Final Shape, which is actually available from tomorrow!</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus June 2025 games?</span></p>


<p>Three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be 3rd June and they will be available until 30th June. That fourth game, Destiny 2: The Final Shape, will be available from tomorrow, 28th May.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NBA 2K25</strong> | PS5, PS4 (available June 3)</li>
<li><strong>Alone in the Dark (2024)</strong> | PS5 (available June 3)</li>
<li><strong>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</strong> | PS5, PS4 (available June 3)</li>
<li><strong>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</strong> | PS5, PS4 (available May 28)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s go in reverse order. <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a></strong> is the culmination of a ten year epic story woven by Bungie… though it’s not the end of the game, with more expansions and content still coming to the online looter shooter. Still, for many, The Final Shape was a fitting end to the tale and characters. In our review, Tuff said, “The Final Shape is Destiny 2 back to its best for its grand narrative finale. It’s the ultimate space wizards with a machine gun fantasy combined with emotional story beats and characters you truly care for. Despite all the odds, Bungie has crafted the perfect endgame.”</p>


<p>We don’t actually have a review of <strong>Bomb Rush Cyberpunk</strong>, but the 2023 game is a spiritual successor to the coolest Dreamcast game out there, Jet Set Radio. Coming from Team Reptile, you’re kitted out with bootpacks and set into the streets to dance, graffiti, collect beats, and combo tricks together in New Amsterdam.</p>

<p>Trading beats and streets for squeaks and courts, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/16/nba-2k25-review/"><strong>NBA 2K25</strong></a> “is both a great and a frustrating experience,” Aran said. “Beneath the layers of VC and the slow grind is a very good basketball game. The presentation is top notch and MyGM is the best mode to play to get the full NBA experience. MyCareer can be fun and it is a shame it is so bogged down where players have to choose to grind very slowly to improve, or to spend quite a bit of additional money to improve their players.”</p>

<p>And finally we have the <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/20/alone-in-the-dark-review/">Alone in the Dark</a></strong> reboot from Pieces Interactive, which Jim said, “While it’s great to witness the return of survival horror royalty, Alone in the Dark haphazardly follows modern genre trends where it once invented them. While it mostly succeeds at drawing players into a Lovecraftian mystery, it’s hard to ignore the underbaked action elements used to patch these story beats together.”</p>
<h2>Can you still get the May 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>Yes! You’ve got until Monday 2nd June to claim your PS Plus games, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a> | PS5</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-boltgun">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> | PS5, PS4</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/balatro">Balatro</a> | PS5, PS4</strong></li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/f1-25-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-avowed-and-more-add-support-for-nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen.1199616/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/f1-25-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-avowed-and-more-add-support-for-nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA has <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/f1-25-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-ray-reconstruction-path-tracing/">announced</a> the latest batch of games that have added support for its DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen and DLSS Super Resolution technology, including F1 25, which launches today for those with paid early access, and with support for DLSS 4.</p>
<p>Seven games in total officially added support for DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation: F1 25, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/">Avowed</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/everspace-2-titans-qa-rockfish-talks-about-the-upcoming-dlc-and-more/">Everspace 2</a>, Storror Parkour Pro, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-complete-ray-tracing-8k/">The Last of Us Part II Remastered</a>, Torque Drift 2, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckfest-2-goes-into-early-access-on-pc-on-march-20/">Wreckfest 2</a>. Two more games added support for DLSS Super Resolution: <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-is-out-now-on-pc-and-mobile/">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a>.</p>
<p>Players jumping into F1 25 today or in a few days when it launches for everyone who didn't pay to play a few days early will also be able to take advantage of DLSS Ray Reconstruction for a more stable gameplay experience without losing the graphical impact that comes with ray-tracing, and those who have one of the GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards from NVIDIA will be able to take full advantage of DLSS 4.</p>
<p>And just in time for HBO's The Last of Us concluding its second season, players can jump into The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC with DLSS 4 support, which was missed when we checked it out for its PC launch at the beginning of last month. Though to the credit of Naughty Dog and Nixxes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-report-no-nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-but-still-smooth/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo still found it to be a smooth experience</a> at launch. Now with DLSS 4 support, it should be even smoother for players looking to compare and contrast how the story is portrayed in HBO's premiere TV version of it versus Naughty Dog's original game.</p>
<p>The seven games announced today now join the more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-125-games-doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-update-june-more-dlss-titles/">125 games and applications</a> that support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation technology, a milestone that NVIDIA recently confirmed.</p>

        <p>Did they even have roguelikes back then?</p>

            <p>
A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> update is here, version 1.0.5, with this one mostly having a focus on parkour improvements. There are, however, a couple of collaborations that have arrived in the game too, one with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>, and another with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>. We'll get to those in a second, for now let's take a look at those parkour tweaks. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters, you can jump now! Well, you can do a vertical jump to be specific, letting both Naoe and Yusuke hop in an upwards direction to grab ledges or overhangs within reach. There's also now a sprint toggle lock option, meaning as long as you're moving, you won't stop sprinting if you use the parkour up or down options. 
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Some enhanced back and side ejects have been added in too, specifically the distance and height of them, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> noting that foot landings will be favoured over hand landings. Naoe specifically will have some new animations when she does a height-gaining side eject.
</p>
<p>
You'll find a good few new photo mode features alongside all of this, with things like the ability to change the time of day, playing music while you're tweaking your shots, the ability to save custom filters, and for PC specifically, a fullscreen option.
</p>
<p>
Now, about those collabs. The first is a Dead by Daylight event, which Ubisoft describes as follows: "As villagers begin to disappear, Naoe becomes suspicious of the strange presence attacking the local people of Harima. To succeed, you will need to master unique mechanics and confront a formidable otherworldly threat…" You can start this new quest from your hideout once you've unlocked Yasuke, and once you've beaten it you'll get a trinket and banner.
</p>
<p>
Then there's the Balatro collab. That damn card game really has it's hooks in all of us, 'ey? This one is just a new trinket for Naoe and amulet for Yasuke called Winning Hand. These both offer a legendary perk that "gives you a chance to trigger a random affliction effect on combo enders." How do you get these new items? "You will need to work together to figure out how to get it!" says Ubisoft.
</p>
<p>
There's a bunch of other general fixes with this update to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> game too, but you can read about all of those over on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/3hJ2jNQEK4AXQGMg79pm2h">patch notes</a>.

For comparison, the original <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> earned $145 million total domestically across its nearly four-month run in theaters back in the summer of 2002. The live-action remake’s worldwide box office haul over Memorial Weekend is an astounding $341 million. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0275847/?ref_=bo_se_r_2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0275847/?ref_=bo_se_r_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The OG film brought in less than $275 million globally during its initial run</a></span>. </p><p>So yeah, the new <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>is a blockbuster hit.

                <p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest has not been as ubiquitous as Final Fantasy in recent years, but the two series are intertwined in the history of defining and formalizing Japanese RPGs. And just as the Pixel Remaster remakes of Final Fantasy have given players a fresh and modernized way to reexperience history, Dragon Quest is aiming to give players a dose of history with the Erdrick Trilogy--the first three Dragon Quest games, remastered across two packages. Dragon Quest 3 was a treat, and now DQ1+2 will round out the set with Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake. Despite my affection for retro RPGs, early Dragon Quest is a relative blind spot for me, and after a little hands-on time I'm eager to play each of them to completion.</p><p dir="ltr">For starters, the games are a stunning marriage of classic pixel art and modern touches. I hadn't realized how much better Square Enix's "HD-2D" aesthetic had become in recent years. My impression from the Octopath Traveler games and the tactics game Triangle Strategy was still that HD-2D tends to be fairly muted and muddy. As much as I enjoyed those games, the art style didn't wow me. Dragon Quest 1+2, on the other hand, applies the structure of HD-2D to a much more vibrant world. The color palette and saturation feels reminiscent of 8-bit classics, which makes the beautiful sprite artwork pop.</p><p dir="ltr">This package includes both the first and second Dragon Quest games, which are rudimentary by today's standards, but that's also what makes them so endearing. The very first Dragon Quest game was a very early blueprint for the series, featuring just one hero character taking on the legions of slimes and monsters to overcome evil. The second game is a bit more reminiscent of early Final Fantasy games, with party members that come and go as the story demands. Even then, though, the options were set by default to give you direct control over the main hero and let the other party members move autonomously.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501980-dq2_battle_pc.png" data-ref-id="1300-4501980" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501980-dq2_battle_pc.png" data-ref-id="1300-4501980"></a><figcaption>A battle in Dragon Quest 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501980-dq2_battle_pc.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501971-06_dq1_ss02.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501972-dq1_battle_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501973-dq1_event_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501974-dq1_field_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501975-dq2_battle_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501976-dq2_event_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501977-dq2_field_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501978-dqi%EF%BC%86ii_01_07_en_web.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501979-dqi%EF%BC%86ii_01_18_en_web.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4501971,1300-4501972,1300-4501973,1300-4501974,1300-4501975,1300-4501976,1300-4501977,1300-4501978,1300-4501979" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4501971-06_dq1_ss02.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4501972-dq1_battle_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4501973-dq1_event_pc.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4501974-dq1_field_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4501975-dq2_battle_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4501976-dq2_event_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4501977-dq2_field_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4501978-dqi%EF%BC%86ii_01_07_en_web.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4501979-dqi%EF%BC%86ii_01_18_en_web.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501971-06_dq1_ss02.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501972-dq1_battle_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501973-dq1_event_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501974-dq1_field_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501975-dq2_battle_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501976-dq2_event_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501977-dq2_field_pc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501978-dqi%EF%BC%86ii_01_07_en_web.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4501979-dqi%EF%BC%86ii_01_18_en_web.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I got the impression from my preview session that these two games are packaged together because they're each comparatively limited in scope. But together with Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake, which was released last year, they represent a "trilogy" of the original Dragon Quest games. DQ3 is a prequel to the other two, so Square Enix decided to release them in chronological story order. But arranged in the original order--1, 2, 3--they represent a closer look at the evolution of early RPGs. First a lone hero, then a nomadic party, and finally a customizable party with job classes. Square Enix said it has also added an epilogue to the end of DQ1+2 that neatly ties the trilogy together.</p><p dir="ltr">I only played a couple of early areas in both games, which means I didn't have much opportunity for more complex strategies and managing equipment. But Square Enix seems to understand that some of the battles, especially the simpler ones at the outset, need a fast-forward function to make battles more light and breezy. You can swap middle-battle, so it's worth slowing down to see the charming animations of the enemy attacks once or twice, but after that there's no harm in making everything move a bit faster.</p><p dir="ltr">The story also leans into the olde English style of translation, and from my limited time it seemed more pronounced than I remember in the DQ3 remake. It feels a little goofy, but it's tongue-in-cheek, so after a little adjustment I enjoyed it.</p><p dir="ltr">And what makes Dragon Quest feel so special--forgive me for being late to the party on this, Dragon Quest fans--is its sense of character. Everything from the score to the enemy designs feels at once grand in scope and adorably bubbly and chipper. The enemy designs especially, presented in first-person in DQ, have a comical sensibility. It just makes a fun world to live and adventure in, and I can't wait to continue on and finish the quest.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake is coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and Switch 2 on October 30.</p>

Starting May 28th and lasting till June 11th, Sony’s putting on its annual Days of Play summer event in which PS5s, PS5 accessories, and some of the console’s most popular games will go on sale. The sale is Sony’s first time discounting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">the PS5 Pro</a>, which launched last year. </p><p>You can check out the details of the sale on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/27/celebrate-days-of-play-2025-starting-on-may-28/?sf277411446=1">PlayStation’s website</a>, but here’s a short list of what you can get.</p><div><ul><li><span>In the United States and Canada, you can get a PlayStation 5 console plus Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Bundle (Digital and Standard) starting at $399.99 USD / $509.99 CAD, a savings of up to $119.99 USD / $159.99 CAD compared to buying each separately.</span></li><li><span>In select regions such as Europe and Asia, the PlayStation 5 console (Digital and Standard) will be on sale starting at €399.99 / £339.99 / ¥65,980.</span></li><li><span>$50 USD off PlayStation 5 Pro console </span></li></ul></div><div><p>Though traditionally timed to take advantage of all the announcements made during the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603313/summer-game-fest-returns-on-june-6th">Summer Game Fest starting June 6th</a>, this year’s Days of Play sale has an interesting significance for Sony and the other console manufacturers, specifically Nintendo. Xbox has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659430/microsoft-xbox-console-controller-game-price-increases-worldwide">raised the prices on its console globally</a>. Meanwhile, Sony recently cited <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/">high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates</a> as the reason for<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/647869/sony-ps5-price-rise-uk-europe-australia-new-zealand"> increasing the price of its consoles in Europe, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand</a>. In light of the Trump Administration’s chaotic tariff policy, that increase <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/666584/sony-earnings-tariffs-ps5-price-us-manufacturing">is expected to</a> (but has not yet) hit North America. The Play Days sale may be your last chance to get a PS5 in the US before those prices potentially go up.</p></div><p>Additionally, with single digit days left until the Switch 2 launches, the PS5’s $399.99 sale price, which includes one of the console’s most popular and most played games, is a cheaper and better deal than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">$450 Nintendo wants from you for a Switch 2</a> (or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer">$500 it wants for the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle</a>.)

Even like 2014, it was already an idea floating around the studio that she's next. In Witcher 3, Geralt is just helping out… he is there for her. So it was pretty clear we want her as the next... main character."</p>

<p>Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-is-not-woke-for-starring-ciri-geralt-voice-actor-says/1100-6531680/" data-ref-id="1100-6531680">defended the choice to put Ciri in the lead</a> and denounced the idea that doing so was "woke."</p><p>"There's nothing woke about it," said Cockle. "[Ciri]'s a cool character from The Witcher, and they're gonna focus on that character, and that's awesome... If you read the books, then you understand why CD Projekt went down this avenue. There's a whole rich world of stuff to explore with Ciri, that they didn't do when they put her into Witcher 3, because the story was about Geralt. But she hints at it."</p><p>Sebastian Kalemba, the director of The Witcher 4, has said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-on-ciri-gwent-and-in-game-romance/1100-6528580/" data-ref-id="1100-6528580">there will be romance in the game</a>, and indicated a desire for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-wants-players-to-feel-the-rewards-for-their-choices/1100-6531667/" data-ref-id="1100-6531667">players to feel rewarded</a> for their choices as Ciri.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/f1-25-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>With the Monaco Grand Prix now in the tiny little wing mirrors of this year’s F1 season, it feels like the perfect time to drop into the latest F1 game from Codemasters and EA. Interest in the premier motorsport category has never been higher, and this yearly game series has sought to make steady improvement, adding much-requested gameplay features while pushing ever closer to visual realism in the cars and tracks year-on-year. While F1 25 is undoubtedly a further refinement, rather than a revolution, this is, incrementally, the best F1 game to date.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 25 Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u5rWBgBjDsc?list=PLdeld3cKzBQ_WW7TUUJIQCGVu6DgEzdhB" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>F1 25 gives you a full digital representation of the sport of F1. That means you can play through full seasons of multiple grand prix events, with real-life stars like Lando Norris and Max Verstappen, fresh-faced rookies such as Gabriel Bortoleto or Isack Hadjar, or your own created character aiming for greatness on track. It’s as compelling as it ever has been.</p>


<p>Alongside that, this year sees the return of Braking Point, the extensive story-led mode that focuses on the fictional Konnersport team. The hateful Davidoff Butler is now owner of Konnersport, and he looms like a grim figure over the opening chapters of this year’s tale. There’s a huge change to come though, throwing the team into disarray, and though the emotional beats don’t consistently hit home, I really enjoyed playing through the team’s dramatic rollercoaster season.</p>
<p>Alongside the on-track action, where you take control of both Callie Mayer and Aiden Jackson, you have to take some light control of the team’s leadership, deciding on the right time for press and marketing, or focusing more on elements that will improve your car’s performance.</p>

<p>Besides that, you have to court the press, getting to choose Callie or Aiden’s responses in their post-race interviews, again aiming to boost various stats. While those incremental gains feel less essential, getting to embody and take part in a fuller spectrum of your team and driver’s activities helps to put you at the centre of the action.</p>

<p>Once you’re done with Konnersport’s dramas, you can carry the team through into the main career mode, taking up an 11th spot in the pits. It’ll be interesting to see if they’re there again next year, as Cadillac will fill that slot, but for now, Konnersport feel like a legitimate addition, if not for fans of ultra-realism.</p>
<p>Of course, Braking Point doesn’t have the sole place on the drama grid this year, with the F1 Movie also coming along for the ride. The film, due out in June and starring Brad Pitt, appears here as a series of playable chapters alongside clips from the film. The first is in place at launch, with the rest due to arrive on the 30th of June. It’s a pleasing inclusion, but it’s very much a small taster of what is to come. The most important aspect? Being able to take that 11th spot in Career mode away from Konnersport and putting APXGP there instead. Honestly, Brad Pitt’s character model is worth it alone.</p>
<p>I assume that the majority of players are here to play multiple seasons of the Career mode, taking their favourite team, whether a proven winner like Mclaren, a fan-favourite like Haas, or a fictional creation (which can be of your own making) to the Constructors’ Championship. Various improvements have been made to the behind the scenes action here, from research and development being unique to each of the cars in your garage, to more in-depth facility expansions. They’re solid improvements, and the overall process is now more satisfying rather than perfunctory.</p>
<p>Adapting from the previous year’s outing to the altered handling in F1 25 proved to be surprisingly tricky at first. For all that F1 24’s handling model came under fire from the community, we’ve continued to play the game throughout the past 12 months, and though it had various foibles, we never felt at a disadvantage. The new model is fundamentally more realistic, with less grip and increased differences between the different tyre types, including clearer and more incremental tyre degradation.</p>

<p>That said, playing on controller is now much tougher, requiring even more precise and granular trigger inputs, while there’s seemingly far more chance of locking up. The wheel handling, meanwhile, has been significantly improved, feeling far more settled and precise, making it the better choice for F1 25 right now. For those members of the community looking for a more realistic and enjoyable experience, I think that Codemasters have nailed it.</p>
<p>The computer AI for other racers helps to cement that. While last year’s opponents tended to be more timid, here the AI has been made far more aggressive, pushing harder and racing as though they actually want to win.</p>
<p>There’s also more humanity to them, with genuine variation and variability to their performances. While you can rely on the best racers continuing to perform as you’d expect, the game offers more chances of an unusual result, or a racer having a spectacular race, than we probably get in the real world. It doesn’t undo the push for realism, instead injecting some excitement, but some players may dislike it.</p>
<p>Visually, this is the best-looking F1 game we’ve ever had. Everything here looks more detailed, and five tracks – Melbourne, Bahrain, Miami, Imola and Suzuka – have received the laser-scanning LIDAR treatment, making them even more precise to the actual circuit. These are now so close to the real-life track as to be nearly indistinguishable; it’s only disappointing that it’s limited to a small percentage of the overall whole. We reviewed on PS5, where the game looks great, but PC players can push for more ray tracing features, right up to a full path-traced option.</p>

<p>For those who’ve been racing around the same tracks for years, F1 25 also adds in the option to race some of them in reverse. Silverstone, Austria and Zandvoort can now be experienced backwards, making those well-known corners and racing lines completely null and void. It’s another interesting inclusion, and probably best for those most invested in the series, but it does open up some possibilities if the real-world sport ever needs a shake-up.</p>
<p>The improved visuals extend off track, particularly in Braking Point, and Codemasters have clearly worked on the character and facial animations to make the whole experience feel closer to watching an F1 production, or a TV show like Drive to Survive. Each of the racers also look closer than ever before to their real-life counterparts, and it just brings F1 25 closer to the real-life sport, which is exactly what every fan wants.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-credits-soundtrack</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-credits-soundtrack<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm woefully behind on checking out <em>Skin Deep</em>, an immersive sim by Blendo Games that came out at the end of April, despite the fact that it is an immersive sim and thus the ideal Riley game. I finally started playing last night; while I'm still coming to grips with what feels like its intentionally clunky controls, I absolutely love its opening credits.</p><p><strong>(Light spoilers for the narrative setup of <em>Skin Deep</em>.)</strong></p><p>Playing the early hours last night, I forgot that we hadn't seen a title sequence until the game smash-cut into an intro. Like a reward for having to suffer through a <a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">camera quest</a>, the game suddenly launches into a jazzy, Bond movie-style opening. It has some clever rhymes, some great riffs, and you even get to walk around a bit in an arena of giant props and furniture.    </p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Skin Deep (2025) — Opening/Intro Scene" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z4DdKOf6f9s?start=97&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The song tells a little narrative of facing off against a powerful enemy (who is... also you?) and shifts the vibes of the game from a slapstick comedy into something classy and intriguing. It ends, satisfyingly, on the game's title, something I'm always a sucker for. I love how the style of the song paints a contrast to my experience so far of getting myself stuck in dusty vents and running around spaceships desperately looking for a place to dump angry heads before someone else finds me. </p><p>In a <a href="https://www.startmenu.co.uk/home/skin-deep-music-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conversation with Start Menu</a>, composer Priscilla Snow said the current opening was their second take, with the first being a "slinky lounge song." Snow brought on collaborators and added the song's excellent brass arrangement, and said that while the song was “definitely the most difficult track to get through... I went from dreading the theme song and being stressed and anxious about it to being excited about it" through these changes. </p><p>The whole <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5FsGxEbvms3LEiofVe8b06" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">soundtrack</a>, or what I've heard of it so far, is a banger. It's 59 tracks, a wild amount for a game that folks say <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/91393" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn't too long</a>. I was charmed to catch a weird electronic wisp of viral sea shanty "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellerman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wellerman</a>" that has an incongruous harpsichord-sounding breakdown in it, and I'm excited to hear what else is out there as I play more of the game.

                <p dir="ltr">This is what you might describe as a no-brainer: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 maker Sandfall Interactive plans to make another video game.

"There will be another video game, for sure," Meurisse said. The executive wasn't ready to announce specifics necessarily, which makes sense considering Clair Obscur launched only just over a month ago. But he did say the team's experience from making the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-rpgs/2900-5272/" data-ref-id="2900-5272">RPG</a> will be beneficial going forward.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"Plus the team has grown up, has acquired new skills throughout production," said Meurisse. "Many of them were junior when we started. We learned to work together. So I can't wait to get to the next project, because we'll start from a more efficient position than when we started the company five years ago.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer Build a Rocket Boy has debuted a new trailer for its upcoming game, MindsEye, ahead of its release in just a couple of weeks, at the time of writing on<a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-gets-june-10-release-date-pre-orders-and-new-story-trailer/"> June 10, 2025</a>.</p>
<p>The new trailer is a six-and-a-half-minute 'introduction' to MindsEye, showcasing plenty of details about the game's story, some new looks at gameplay, and digging a bit into the post-launch content and the level-creation tools that are featured in the PC version of the game.</p>
<p>MindsEye's creation tool gives PC players access to the game's assets, and according to the trailer, allows players to create "<em>anything</em>" they can think of, and touts that Build a Rocket Boy is "<em>passionate about democratizing video game development</em>."</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Regarding MindsEye's roadmap, the game will launch with its single-player campaign and several different additional gameplay scenarios, with more to be added later in the year during the summer, fall, and winter. There's also a 'premium pass' that players can purchase that'll provide what Build a Rocket Boy classifies as 'extra' missions, along with each of the planned free updates and cosmetic packs.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing MindsEye - Explainer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4s3jVJaFrbM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"<em>We're beyond excited to bring MindsEye to players worldwide,</em>" said Leslie Benzies, former Rockstar producer who worked on the Grand Theft Auto series since GTA III, now founder of Build a Rocket Boy and director of MindsEye, in a press release.</p>
<p>"<em>Our team has poured their passion and dedication into creating MindsEye and the Game Creation System for almost a decade, to deliver players an unforgettable story campaign and empower them to craft their own world-class experiences. Continuous updates and fresh new content from our studio ensure MindsEye is an endless adventure.</em>"</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how players react to MindsEye when it launches. There's pedigree behind the game due to Benzies' history, and everything we've seen in gameplay trailers so far looks incredibly flashy.</p>
<p>But recent previews haven't been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aob_eBUBwNU">too high on what was shown</a>, and as recently as this past weekend, <a href="https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Build-a-Rocket-Boy-Reviews-E2397452.htm?filter.iso3Language=eng">Glassdoor</a> reviews from former and current employees are making the rounds on <a href="https://x.com/GameRoll_/status/1926754035144536233">social media</a> describing Build a Rocket Boy as bad place to work, with some reviews telling developers to "<em>avoid</em>" the studio "<em>at all costs</em>," others call out Benzies directly for his poor management of the studio, and many describe Build a Rocket Boy to be a toxic place to work.</p>
<p>Realistically, Build a Rocket Boy wouldn't be the first, nor would it be the last game studio to have poor internal working conditions and is still able to release an amazing game. So all this concern about the poor previews and bad internal conditions at the studio could be quickly forgotten by players as they're enamored with the next-best-game of 2025. We'll see what happens on June 10.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3-3m-33-days</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3-3m-33-days<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sandfall Interactive has announced that its turn-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has reached a fun sales milestone in a very appropriate number of days.</p>

<p>Speaking on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:kazma5qkd2r37qfwftqh3lct/post/3lq5u7no5522n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, Sandfall says that&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has reached 3.3 million sales in 33 days. As the studio says, it "couldn't make that up"; Sandfall describes the milestone as "another entry on the long list of surreal moments that [fans'] support has made real".</p>

<p>The new sales milestone means that&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur&nbsp;</em>has picked up another 1.3 million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">in the last three weeks</a>, so while sales have perhaps slowed down a tad since launch, the game is still performing admirably.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3.3m-maelle.jpg?itok=t3W0Lz5f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3.3m-maelle.jpg?itok=J2Xr7oRW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>is still selling pretty well.</figcaption></figure><p>Right out of the gate,&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>proved popular with players, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k" rel="nofollow">managing to sell 500,000 copies</a> within its first 24 hours on sale.</p>

<p>These sales milestones are particularly impressive considering that Sandfall's game is available via Game Pass, which means that 3.3 million players have picked the game up outside of Microsoft's subscription service.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, it's a turn-based RPG in which you play as the titular Expedition 33, a group who must set out from the Paris-inspired city of Lumiere to seek out and defeat a figure known as the Paintress.</p>

<p>In the world of the game, the Paintress paints a number each year, and everyone of that age dies. The number decreases by one each year, and so it's up to Expedition 33 to figure out what's going on and put a stop to it if possible.</p>




<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>mixes traditional JRPG-style overworld and dungeon exploration with a turn-based combat system that also includes a real-time parry mechanic, so if you like your turn-based battling with a bit more spice, this one's for you.</p>
