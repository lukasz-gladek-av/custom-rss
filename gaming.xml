            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-rumors-director<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>director&nbsp;Daniel Vávra has taken to social media in order to address what he calls "wild claims" surrounding the game, including a ban in Saudi Arabia, unskippable cutscenes, and more.</p>

<p>In a lengthy <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/1881081082612944935" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">thread</a> on social media platform X,&nbsp;Vávra points to claims that have been circulating in recent days. He says these claims are "based just on one screenshot and a poorly translated tweet", likely pointing to <a href="https://x.com/VGA4A/status/1879150290680893691" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this post</a> from Saudi Arabian outlet VGA4A.</p>

<p>When machine translated, the post seems to say that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has been banned in Saudi Arabia due to "unskippable gay scenes in story mode", and it's likely that this is the claim&nbsp;Vávra wants to address.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-ban-rumors-battle.jpg?itok=QI1P_6G4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-ban-rumors-battle.jpg?itok=wLFVadf6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Recent rumors surrounding&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>are, according to its director, unfounded.</figcaption></figure><p>According to&nbsp;Vávra,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>will feature "NO unskippable cutscenes", a claim he extends to the entirety of his studio Warhorse's output.</p>

<p>He then says that his studio's game is not, nor ever was, banned in any country, "at least not that we know of". It is, of course, possible that the game was banned in Saudi Arabia without&nbsp;Vávra's knowledge, but since he's the head of Warhorse, that seems unlikely.</p>

<p>Vávra then goes on to say that while he doesn't like "forced diversity", he and his team were not forced to do anything, nor are they "forcing anyone to do certain things".</p>

<p>Again pointing to the rumors of "unskippable gay scenes" propagated by the aforementioned post,&nbsp;Vávra says gay characters were already present in&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, and that "you are responsible for your decisions".</p>

<p>He says that if you want Henry to have a "same-sex adventure", you can, but "if you don't want to, you don't have to".</p>




<p>The rest of&nbsp;Vávra's thread contains some story details for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, as well as historical context explaining some of the creative decisions behind the game.</p>

<p>Vávra says, for instance, that the city in which the game takes place was "one of the richest" in Europe and was "besieged by a massive foreign army", which is why it's "more diverse than the life in the villages which were featured in the first game".</p>

<p>He closes by saying that he doesn't want his game to "be used as clickbait by people who didn't even play it yet", and that some followers have been "turned into exactly the same narrative they pretend to be fighting against".</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is set to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9N4W31HSMVVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward" rel="nofollow">February 4th</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[A first look at Nvidia’s flagship RTX 5090 compared to the RTX 4090]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24347693/nvidia-rtx-5090-vs-rtx-4090-design-fans-hardware</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-first-look-at-nvidia%E2%80%99s-flagship-rtx-5090-compared-to-the-rtx-4090.1086924/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24347693/nvidia-rtx-5090-vs-rtx-4090-design-fans-hardware<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition graphics card is arriving later this month, and we’ve managed to unbox one and compare its design to the RTX 4090. Just like our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339760/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-photos">first look at the RTX 5090</a>, this isn’t a review. Performance figures, benchmarks, and impressions beyond the hardware are coming later.</p><p>The first thing that’s notable about the RTX 5090 is the packaging design has totally changed since the Founders Edition RTX 40-series. Nvidia has switched to housing the RTX 5090 inside a smaller bone-shaped gray cardboard shell that sits inside a much larger brown cardboard box.</p><div><figcaption><em>A dog and his RTX 5090 bone.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The outer box — which reads “Inspired by gamers. Enhanced by AI. Built by Nvidia.” —  holds a new power adapter cable for the RTX 5090 that includes an updated version of the regular 12VHPWR connector. You’ll need to use four regular PCIe eight-pin power connectors with this adapter, or a new 12V-2x6 cable. The 12V-2x6 is almost identical to the existing 12VHPWR, as the new connector has shorter sensing pins and slightly longer conductor terminals. The slight variation means that existing 12VHPWR cables will work with the RTX 5090 just fine.</p><p>The RTX 5090 itself is the same width and length as an RTX 4090, but it’s a lot slimmer now because it’s just a two-slot card. Compared to the three-slot RTX 4090, it’s impressive to see that Nvidia has managed to shrink its latest flagship GPU into this smaller form factor.</p><div><figcaption><em>The RTX 4090 is a lot thicker than the RTX 5090.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>These exterior design changes also mean Nvidia has overhauled its cooling for the RTX 5090. It has moved to double flow-through fans that suck cooler air from below and exhaust it above the RTX 5090 into the rest of the case. There’s no rear exhaust on the RTX 5090 like there is on the RTX 40-series Founders Edition cards, but there are two little slots on either side to create an airflow boundary of sorts so that the warm air that’s exhausting out the top doesn’t recirculate below.</p><p>The PCB of the RTX 5090 is now located in the middle of the GPU, surrounded by big heat pipes that get cool air from the dual flow-through fans. This allows Nvidia to make the RTX 5090 Founders Edition small form factor certified, so it can fit into a variety of small cases. Nvidia has also relocated the power connector to be angled at the side, so it should be easier to fit into cases where the side panel comes close to touching the power cable.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->11</p><div><figcaption><em>The RTX 5090 inside its packaging.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>At the rear there are three DisplayPort 2.1b ports and a single HDMI 2.1b port. Interestingly, Nvidia has flipped the ports upside down, so if you’re used to plugging your cables in a particular way or you have some tight cable management at the rear of your PC you’ll need to flip your cables accordingly.</p><p>Much like previous Founders Edition cards, the RTX 5090 also has LEDs that light up at the top and side of the card in white. Nvidia has also picked a slightly darker gray for the metal housing of the RTX 5090. It’s not as light as the regular RTX 40-series Founders Edition cards, but it’s also nowhere near as black as the RTX 40-series Super variants. It’s a refined color between the two.</p><p>We aren’t allowed to show the RTX 5090 inside a PC or powered on with its LED lights blazing just yet, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkc9E726K3I">Jayztwocents got</a> “special permission” to do a small form factor build if you’re interested in seeing how it squeezes into a small case. We’ll be back soon with a full review of the RTX 5090 to see exactly how it compares to the RTX 4090.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Avowed Release Date & Platforms]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-release-date-platforms/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-release-date-platforms.1086915/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-release-date-platforms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Avowed is a new IP from the big brains at Obsidian Entertainment. The ARPG is a diverse experience taking the best bits from action games and the depth of role-playing titles. It comes in a busy year for the company, so let’s check out Avowed’s release date, and where you can find the release.</p>



<p>Obsidian Entertainment is all hands on deck in 2025. The developer is preparing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2 sequel</a>—another ARPG—whereas Avowed takes on a more magical feel. It’s fresh, looks exciting, and it’s the sort of magical fun the world needs. Spells, weapons, swords, and axes are part and parcel of this jaw-dropping, semi-open-world release. </p>



<p>There are big expectations, and rightly so, and we’re here to see what Obsidian is cooking up for launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-avowed-s-release-date">When is Avowed’s Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The big, bad bear. Credit to Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Avowed launches on February 18, meaning the full release date is almost here.</strong></p>



<p>February and March are always a competitive period for gaming. Companies are keen to capitalize on the quieter January and post-Xmas lull. If you check your calendar, you’ll notice Avowed is only a few days after Valentine’s Day, making it a perfect late present. </p>



<p>Keep the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-confirmed-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed release date</a> in mind if you need gift ideas!</p>



<h2 id="h-avowed-release-time">Avowed Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>Avowed doesn’t have a special launch time yet, meaning a midnight launch is likely.</strong></p>



<p>Very few games come with unique launch windows. Avowed also looks to be heading this way—unless Obsidian intervenes and ruins my theory—so you can ready yourself for midnight in your region. </p>



<p>New Zealand users get their usual benefit of first access due to the time difference. Make sure to keep off of social media until Avowed is installed and ready to go on your format.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-avowed-platforms">All Avowed Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Xbox Series X|S and PC are the only platforms you can find Avowed for now.</strong></p>



<p>Avowed is published by Xbox Game Studios, meaning it’s a <strong>Microsoft-exclusive title</strong>. So bizarre is the gaming landscape in 2025 that I wouldn’t rule out Avowed coming to PS5. Exclusivity means a lot less than it used to—with Sony publishing exclusive games on PC too—and the PlayStation and Xbox crossover is only getting stronger.</p>



<p>Reports are abound that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-2-and-gears-of-war-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-playstation-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellblade 2 and Gears of War are coming to PS5</a>. There are rumors about Halo dropping too. If this is all possible, an Avowed PlayStation port doesn’t seem beyond the realms of possibility.</p>



<hr>



<p>Does Avowed catch your eye in 2025? Or is it a standalone interest, is The Outer Worlds 2 also sending you to space? Let us know your thoughts on both games.</p>



<p>For more on Avowed, we know its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heres-your-look-at-the-avowed-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">system requirements</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-pre-order-details-and-game-editions-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">different editions</a>, and a cool tidbit about the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-game-director-reveals-new-details-about-companions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">companions</a>.</p>

Following <em><a title="Games > Stronghold: Definitive Edition [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/stronghold-definitive-edition">Stronghold: Definitive Edition</a></em> in 2023, which has sold over half a million copies, Firefly can now reveal their best-selling <em>Crusader</em> title will return with a new definitive edition releasing this year on July 15, 2025! This fan-favorite entry in the BAFTA-nominated <em>Stronghold</em> series has been rebuilt with the game’s original developers adding brand new content, elevated graphics, and extensive player-requested features.</p><p>Command war-honed Crusader warriors as they brave the merciless desert sands, then, as Saladin, lead a mighty army drawn from every corner of the Middle East and repel the invading zealots.</p><p>In <em>Stronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition</em>, players dominate the greatest frontier of the medieval age, waging brutal war across timeless battlefronts and sieging epic fortresses, to relive the glorious clashes that have shaped human history. Journey across the heart of the medieval world and take part in the legendary Crusades for the holy land. Witness the struggle of wills between Richard the Lionheart, King of England, and Sultan Saladin ibn Ayyub, spearhead of the Islamic domain and founder of the Ayyubid dynasty. Command war-honed Crusader warriors as they brave the merciless desert sands, then, as Saladin, lead a mighty army drawn from every corner of the Middle East and repel the invading zealots.</p><p>Rebuilt from the ground up as a testament to the collective talent of the veteran developers, artists, actors and series composer Robert L.

Four new AI opponents, eight Bedouin warrior units, two historical campaigns to learn how to command these soldiers and four “Sands of Time” skirmish trails to test your skill means there is plenty to look forward to. Skirmish mode lovers meanwhile will also be rewarded with larger map sizes and new maps to battle across, along with enhanced graphics and audio. Add to this a new <a title="Genres > Co-Op [227 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> skirmish trail, custom options and other player-requested changes, and it is clear that <em>Stronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition</em> aims to realize the full vision of the development talent behind the multi-million selling original “castle sim.”</p><p>In upgrading the old and leaving the gold, the core essence of <em>Crusader</em> has been both carefully rebuilt and expanded on.                                             </p><p>Interlacing fresh gameplay content, technical improvements, customizable conveniences and highly requested quality of life additions, <em>Stronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition</em> allows veterans and newcomers to rediscover a strategy classic and play it the way they want to.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-roadmap-january-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-roadmap-includes-co-op-new-pals-and-more.1086891/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-roadmap-january-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has shared a brand new&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>roadmap to celebrate the game's first anniversary, and it includes some pretty major features, although it's not clear exactly when these features are set to debut.</p>

<p>In a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/596264277969469557" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Pocketpair celebrates&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s first birthday by announcing a number of initiatives related to the game, only one of which is the aforementioned roadmap. The studio will also be holding a "worldwide Pal popularity poll", and a soundtrack has been released for free, too.</p>

<p>The roadmap promises a number of new "future" features without committing to timeframes, including major new features and miscellaneous improvements alike.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-roadmap-2025-full.jpg?itok=4YxKjWvl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-roadmap-2025-full.jpg?itok=q5EYRdU4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lots of new features are coming to&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>this year.</figcaption></figure><p>The roadmap promises the likes of co-op crossplay between different platforms, as well as being able to transfer Pals between worlds and "further ways to strengthen and improve Pals". You can also look forward to new Pals and technologies, as well as a new "ending scenario".</p>

<p>Pocketpair also promises "game collaborations", including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-crossover-2025" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Terraria&nbsp;</em>collab</a>, so it sounds like there will be more&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>crossovers in the future. Just <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">don't expect a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>crossover</a> anytime soon.</p>

<p>Improvements coming to&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>in the future include tweaks for "world object placement", Pals, game optimization, and UX, so&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>should be a smoother experience overall once those have been applied.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this roadmap doesn't commit to even a vague time window for when we can expect these improvements to arrive. Pocketpair simply pledges to "continue updating <i>Palworld&nbsp;</i>as we prepare for the official release".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-roadmap-2025-1st-anniversary-artwork.jpg?itok=WVQPoUeA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-roadmap-2025-1st-anniversary-artwork.jpg?itok=JYUDmmg2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pocketpair shared this cute artwork to celebrate&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s first anniversary.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not au fait with&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, it's a survival game that mashes up the creature collecting of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>with the base-building and exploration of games like&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>.</p>

<p>Often distilled (perhaps unfairly) down to "<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>with guns",&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>was a breakout hit when it was released, attracting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet" rel="nofollow">tens of millions of players</a>&nbsp;during the first month or two of its release.</p>

<p>Those&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>comparisons might not be fair, but Nintendo clearly doesn't think so; the Japanese gaming giant is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">currently suing Pocketpair</a> over some rather arcane patents, a situation which led to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release-japan" rel="nofollow">delay of the game's PS5 release</a> in Japan.</p>

While most POTUSes need to be rescued from evil terrorists or rivals, there are times when the Big Cheese takes matters into their own hands. You don’t get to win the Electoral College without making a few enemies, after all.</p><p>In Section 3 of the United States Constitution, which details a few critical duties of the President of the United States (POTUS), one passage reads: “He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.” What it doesn’t say is that, also from time to time, the president shall roll up their sleeves and open a can of whoop-ass. And we’ve seen people assume the role of president in movies and have to save the country by any means necessary.</p><p>As Donald Trump returns to office as the 47th President, it’s a good time to look at some cinematic chief executives to remember what responsibility, initiative, and cunning look like. From disaster epics to alien invasions, here are 13 of the most badass presidents in action movies.</p></div></div><div><p>Making the low end of this list is President Charlotte Field, played by the alluring Charlize Theron in the 2019 rom-com <em>Long Shot</em>. The low placement is purely a technicality: She doesn’t actually become president until the <em>end </em>of the movie.  But, president-elect Field deserves greater recognition, as only Theron could pull off a tense hostage negotiation while utterly zonked out on ecstasy. Remember: Never negotiate with terrorists, only with homies.</p></div><div><p>Before <em>Inception</em>, there was <em>Dreamscape</em>. Dennis Quaid leads this overlooked sci-fi movie from 1984 as a psychic and con artist who joins a study that allows him to enter people’s dreams. Halfway through the movie, Eddie Albert appears as a POTUS haunted by recurring nightmares—an Achilles’ heel the villains exploit to attempt his assassination. Oscar nominee Albert is more or less sleepwalking through his part, though in the climax, he stands up to a gnarly stop-motion snake monster until a knocked-out Quaid gets back on his feet.</p></div><div><p>Snake Plissken is tasked with saving President John Harker in John Carpenter’s dystopic sci-fi (and all-time great) movie <em>Escape from New York</em>. But the slimy Harker gets a moment to shine as he saves Snake’s ass by shooting up The Duke (Isaac Hayes) and taunting him in the process. Plissken is no fan of Harker, and by the end of the movie, it’s unlikely audiences would vote for him either. However, getting the final kill without upstaging Kurt Russell is kind of cool.</p></div><div><p>Danny Glover’s President Wilson isn’t a badass because he rushes before the enemy, guns blazing and dodging bullets. In Roland Emmerich’s disaster flick <em>2012</em>, which toys with the hoopla around the Mayan calendar, President Wilson is a badass because of how he commands a dignified aura as he soothes a hysterical nation bombarded by Mother Nature’s wrath. Not one to hide in a comfy bunker, Wilson provides additional comfort to everyone around him in the immediate vicinity of the White House—or at least, he tries to. You can imagine how hard it is to get things done when cataclysmic earthquakes tear up the North Lawn.</p></div><div><p>Jonathan Pryce returns as the unnamed Commander-in-Chief from 2009's <em>G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra</em> for the Jon M. Chu-directed sequel <em>Retaliation</em> (2013). Though Pryce has much more to do in <em>Retaliation</em>—with not one but two standout scenes, telling off world leaders at a G8 Summit in one and disavowing the G.I. Joes in another—he’s actually not the president at all. He’s Zartan in disguise, continuing a plot thread left at the end of <em>Rise of Cobra</em>. But as far as the world of <em>G.I. Joe</em> is concerned, their president has suddenly turned into a stone-cold badass.</p></div><div><p>On paper, having Sam Jackson playing the role should instantly make his president, William Alan Moore, the most badass movie president of all time. But Jalmari Helander’s cartoonish buddy adventure <em>Big Game</em>—in which Air Force One is shot down over the wilds of Finland—has Jackson step aside to let Onni Tommila, a 13-year-old deer hunter, soak up most of the movie’s crowning moments. But President Moore isn’t made of glass, and he survives a steep fall into a ravine inside an ice cooler and wins a knife fight with a terrorist. He may not be a bad motherfucker, but he’s no lame duck either.</p></div><div><p>On one hand, President Tom Beck of <em>Deep Impact</em> fulfills his job description to a T: he leads America with solemnity and grace. But it’s an entirely different matter to lead the nation through an extinction-level catastrophe. While Morgan Freeman is a distinguished president, his first meeting with an ambitious MSNBC journalist (Téa Leoni)—who suspects the big secret around “Ellie” is some garden-variety extramarital affair—paints Beck more like a mafia boss than a democratically elected leader of the free world. If you think Freeman can only play stately gentlemen and wise elders, his introduction in <em>Deep Impact</em> will make you see him in a new light.</p></div><div><p>The ...<em>Has Fallen</em> movies are all about Gerard Butler’s Secret Service agent Mike Banning breathlessly racing to protect the President of the United States or going on the run after being framed for trying to assassinate the president. In the first two films, Butler puts himself in front of many, many bullets for President Benjamin Asher, played by Aaron Eckhart—a vanilla but not flavorless action-movie POTUS. Asher isn’t afraid of picking up a gun or headbutting a dude. But, like all good presidents, he delegates those duties to a capable agent.</p></div><div><p>“I want the people to know they still have two out of three branches of the government working for them. And that ain’t bad.” Jack Nicholson weaponizes his smarmy charm as President James Dale in Tim Burton’s ludicrous <em>Mars Attacks!</em> Though the Martians are ostensibly the villains, Burton’s film revels in the rotten core of humankind—a doomed species even without help from alien invaders. Look beyond Dale’s impassioned speech about brotherhood across boundaries to spot hints of self-serving motives; even the Martians know better than to trust a politician. Still, credit to President Dale for getting them to listen in the first place.</p></div><div><p>You’ve got to give it up to <em>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter</em>. That title is upfront and unambiguous: it’s about Abraham Lincoln, who hunts vampires. (And frankly, he does it pretty well.) Both Seth Grahame-Smith’s original novel and Timur Bekmambetov’s film version are tongue-in-cheek farces that maintain a straight-faced facade, but star Benjamin Walker puts in an honest effort to give Honest Abe some action-hero swagger. Abe isn’t as cool as Blade or Buffy, but he’s got more chops as a vampire hunter than Hansel and Gretel do as witch hunters.</p></div><div><p>Jamie Foxx’s President Sawyer, from Roland Emmerich’s witty action-thriller <em>White House Down</em>, is an unsubtle Barack Obama analog, down to a minor—but circa 2013, timely—subplot involving the withdrawal of troops in the Middle East. But Obama never wore Jordans, not during his time in office, anyway. Nor did the 44th president aim a rocket launcher at the front gate of the White House. That’s all Sawyer, an eloquent statesman who takes questions from an 11-year-old YouTuber like she’s Anderson Cooper. While a sweaty Channing Tatum takes charge in most of the action in <em>White House Down</em>, Foxx isn’t afraid to get his presidential hands dirty.</p></div><div><p>President Thomas J. Whitmore, played by Bill Pullman in Roland Emmerich’s smash hit <em>Independence Day</em>, taught us all how to celebrate. Whitmore is such a badass that getting into the cockpit of a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet to fight aliens isn’t even the most memorable thing he does in the movie. After noticing that the eerily young pilots about to fight an invasive species are “a little nervous,” Whitmore grabs a loudspeaker to bid his brave soldiers a good morning—and then some. “Mankind—that word should have new meaning for all of us today,” he says. Go ahead. Finish it. You know the rest.</p></div><div><p>A thousand action movies revolve around protecting the President of the United States. So it’s a hell of a thing how Wolfgang Petersen’s <em>Air Force One</em> follows a hero’s journey in which the POTUS who has to save himself. Who else but Harrison Ford could play the ready-to-rumble Head of State? After <em>Air Force One</em> is sabotaged by neo-Soviet terrorists, President Ford—sorry, President Marshall—gets down and dirty at over 35,000 feet, knocking out goons and shooting up others before ordering Gary Oldman to “get off my plane.” Hail to the Chief, baby.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Netease’s latest hero-shooter, Marvel Rivals, has managed to wow fans worldwide in a very short time, so much so that it is receiving a comic book adaptation by Marvel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals is an original story woven by the game’s developers to create this hero-shooter. After seeing the numbers it has pulled off, Marvel has decided to adopt the game’s narrative in a comic book. Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-infinity-comic-physical-print-release-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, a new <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/new-marvel-rivals-comic-book-spins-out-of-the-hit-video-game-sensation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on the Marvel website revealed that “MARVEL RIVALS #1, a special one-shot inspired by the game’s story,” is set to arrive in April 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Marvel Rivals comic book is written by Paul Allor and drawn by Luca Claretti. The comic will receive “all six issues of Marvel Unlimited’s Marvel Rivals Infinity Comic in print for the first time.” Players can grab a digital copy of the comic through the Marvel Unlimited App or purchase a physical copy from their local comic book store when it arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the story of Marvel Rivals #1 comic book, the events are set in Tokyo 2099, where a time rift has hampered the Web of Life and Destiny. Two groups have been formed with their own opinions on solving the problem. The first group is led by Peni Parker, who wishes to plug the Web into Cyberspace, and the second group is led by Spider-Man, who wants to use Chronovium to strengthen the Web so that it repairs itself.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals #1 comic book series will take us through “an epic battle between two squads” composed of characters from the game’s original roster. This means we will see heavy hitters like Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Jeff the Land Shark, Peni Parker, and more battle it out.&nbsp;Which group do you think will emerge victorious in this battle?</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals could receive a ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-red-hulk-mystery-skin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mystery skin</a>‘ to celebrate Captain America: Brave New World’s release. Also, the developers have issued a warning for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-issues-warning-for-keyboard-and-mouse-adapters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keyboard and mouse adapters</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-insists-the-game-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-as-fans-obsess-over-a-picture-of-chocolate-cake<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight fans have been through the wringer recently, with cryptic X/Twitter activity from one developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake">sparking rampant speculation that the hotly anticipated follow-up Hollow Knight: Silksong will finally re-emerge at Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct in April</a> — and potentially even release on Nintendo’s next-gen console as a timed launch exclusive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all started when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i31gas/what_we_know_so_far_about_the_william_pellen/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>supersleuths on the Hollow Knight subreddit</u></a> noticed that on January 15, co-director of Team Cherry William Pellen had changed his Twitter/X profile picture to a picture of a chocolate cake. Alongside this, Pellen tweeted: “something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Nintendo’s Switch 2 reveal was rumored for January 16, and so it proved — that was the day <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name"><u>Nintendo finally announced the Switch 2</u></a>. Had Pellen really asked followers to keep an eye out for the Switch 2 reveal? If so, why?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans then reverse-searched the picture of the cake, leading them to a recipe for Brooklyn Blackout Cake on cooking website <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/blackout-cake" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bon Appétit</u></a>. The date the recipe was published: April 2, 2024. The date of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct is April 2, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans also wondered what Pellen’s new X/Twitter handle, @everydruidwaswr, meant, if anything. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i36zi6/comment/m7l3uqu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Redditor Representative-True speculated</u></a> that the “wr” in “everydruidwaswr” was the start of a word, perhaps “wrong,” or perhaps stands for “was wrong,” and pointed to the Druid of the Moss Temple Silksong NPC as evidence of… something.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pellen had a new X/Twitter name to go along with the new handle and profile picture: “little bomey.” Fans noticed Little Boomey is a wine from Southern Australia, where Team Cherry is based, but the spelling is different. The upshot of all this was that some fans thought Pellen had kicked off a Silksong alternate reality game (ARG), but over the weekend comments appeared to pour cold water on this theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, Hollow Knight YouTuber fireb0rn <a href="https://x.com/fireb0rn/status/1880411907552911626" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to say Team Cherry marketing and publishing chief Matthew 'Leth' Griffin had got in touch “to confirm there was no Silksong ARG and that the changes to William's account and the tweet were a nothingburger. Apologies to have misled everyone. The cake was a lie."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/283467363729408000/586931790208434203/1330100156518891571" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on the Hollow Knight Discord</a>, Griffin backed this up, saying: "It wasn’t [an ARG]. But it was still some impressive sleuthing skills by the fans... like ya’ll are WAY beyond those 2020 riddles now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Griffin himself followed up to respond to one fan who wondered if Team Cherry had given up on Hollow Knight: Silksong. “Yes the game is real, progressing and will release,” <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Griffin tweeted</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This has done little to calm all the speculation, as you can perhaps imagine. And at the time of this article’s publication, Pellen’s tweet remains online. Pellen himself has yet to explain whatever his X/Twitter activity is all about, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth remembering that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/14/hollow-knight-sequel-announced-for-pc-and-nintendo-switch"><u>when Hollow Knight: Silksong was announced</u></a>, Team Cherry confirmed the launch platforms as Windows, Mac, Linux, and Nintendo Switch. But that was six years ago. We have a few months to find out what this all means, but in the meantime, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-heres-everything-announced-and-confirmed"><u>everything announced at Nintendo's Switch 2 reveal</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-growth-engine-pricing/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A lot seems to be riding on Grand Theft Auto 6, as the next entry in the series by Rockstar Games is considered to be among the growth engines for the entire game industry this year.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive State of Video Gaming in 2025 presentation</a> by CEO of Epyllion Matthew Ball, the new entry in the Rockstar Games series is among the potential growth engines for the industry this year together with the Nintendo Switch 2, other handhelds, non-core markets and more, which could help pull the industry from the cycle it has been in for a while. Specifically speaking about Grand Theft Auto 6, it is highlighted in the presentation how the game's release this year will have a mixed impact on the industry due to how the game will only be released on consoles and will severely cannibalize hours and spend in other titles, but some publishers hope the game's pricing will break the $70 barrier, and re-establish packaged game pricing after decades of deflation despite rampant cost growth.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have heard about the potential impact Grand Theft Auto 6 will likely have on the entire video game industry. <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-publishers/">Last month</a>, we learned that some publishers have yet to commit to Fall 2025 release dates for their games to be sure to launch their games as far away as possible from Rockstar Games' open-world game. Unfortunately, all of this planning could be for naught, as there's still the concrete possibility the game will be delayed to 2026, which wouldn't be very surprising, considering we have seen nothing of the game since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-quality/">first trailer</a> released in late 2023.</p>

            <p>Please excuse the eyeball jelly. I've just got done tearing my face away from the screen it was attached to by the glitter and amphetamine-infused superglue secreted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindwave">Mindwave</a>'s minigame barrage. The current <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2741670/MINDWAVE_Demo/">Steam demo</a> is a generous slice of a wonderful thing its developers describe as a "cerebral microgame frenzy". It's the sort of thing you play for five minutes before realising, not unpleasantly, that you are most definitely inside of it now. It has wrapped you all up, and it's going to be quite difficult to escape. Trailer below:</p>

<p>It's set in a "cognitive reality game" tournament, and your role as Pandora is to play frenetic rounds of minigames - most last just a few seconds before jumping to the next - in between chatting to the other contestants. "MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE TOP OF MINDSCAPE TOWER. DELVE INTO THE MINDS OF YOUR OPPONENTS. BE CONSUMED BY THE TRUTH THEY SPEAK TO YOU, IN THIS CEREBRAL BATTLE OF SIGHT AND SOUND HIDDEN WITHIN EACH OF US", reads the Steam page. I'd usually reformat the caps there but honestly, Mindwave earns it caps.</p>
<p>In the short time I've played, I have: won a pistol duel to the death, fed some Tamagotchi-like creatures, caught a cat, brushed some hair, popped bubblewrap, spammed some typing, and several other things that went by too fast for me to remember. It's all very twee but quietly insidious at the same time.</p><p>It looks to have taken off in a big way already. The game is currently raising funds for a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/holohammer/mindwave">full release on Kickstarter</a>, but development team HoloHammer's socials are already brimming <a href="https://x.com/holohammer_">with fanart</a>. Members of the team have previously worked on several smaller games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1618580/Run_Doodleguy/">Run, Doodleguy!</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/P_s9pjiB7qY">INSOMNIARY</a>, but say this is their biggest project yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/JwFiIUAa5Jg">Dorkus64's soundtrack</a> is a real highlight here, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo's average annual salary may have dropped by 2.3 percent in 2024, but it's still the second-highest-paying company in western Japan.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-average-annual-salary-decreased-in-2024-but-ranked-second-highest-in-japanese-regional-ranking/">Automaton</a>, the business journal <a href="https://diamond.jp/articles/-/357677">Diamond Online</a> detailed salary information for firms based in Japan's Kansai region (sans Osaka), revealing Nintendo employees take home an average salary of ¥9.627m - that's around $61,500 or £50,800.</p>

<p>Nintendo took second place after semiconductor manufacturer Screen Holdings, which had an average salary of ¥10.248m ($65.5K / £53.7K).</p>
<p>Diamond Online hypothesises that Nintendo's average earnings have fallen due to the drop in net sales and operating profit - down 5.5 and 14.9 per cent, respectively - in 2023.</p>
<p>By the end of the 2024 fiscal year in March 2024, however, sales were up 4.4 percent, and operating profit had bounced back by 4.9 per cent, intimating the average salary will possibly increase for Nintendo employees by the end of this financial year.</p>
<p>Nintendo is the only video game company to have been included in the list.</p>
<p>In case you've been hiding under a rock for the last few days, Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting"><em>finally</em> revealed Switch 2 last week</a> after months of rumours, leaks and oodles of speculation.</p>

            <p>Isn't <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a> a pleasing word to say? <em>Straftat</em>. It almost demands an angry bark, an accusatory finger. <em><strong>Straftat!</strong></em> The bite-sized two-player shooter was one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-24-favourite-games-of-2024">our favourite games of last year</a>, summoning the fast-paced killthrills of ancient <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> servers as much as the quickfire 1v1 scraps of the gulag in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Call of Duty: Warzone</a>. And now it has a bunch of new maps. Not content with making the powerful pew-pew 'em up completely free (WHAT), the developers have added new weapons, features and a further 30 bullet-pocked arenas. And look, an icy and divisive fan-made map of ye olde <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike">Counter-Strike</a> appears among them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Included in the update you'll find 15 maps named some variation of "TheSamePlace". If you know your Counter-Strike history you will recognise the layout of fy_iceworld. A simple boxy set of corridors with a few waist-high cover spots, and a cramped central buy zone where you will certainly perish. The image above is Counter-Strike's Iceworld, I should clarify, not the one in Straftat. That, you can see in the pics below.</p>

<p>Iceworld was a love-or-hate arena that was beautiful, panicky, and funny in its abstract simplicity. If there's a game where this map belongs in 2025, it is undoubtedly Straftat. Yes, some existing arenas in the shooter already feel a lot like Iceworld. But this is a truly unfettered reproduction. And there are a bunch of other variations on the same layout.</p><p>There's at least one other fun homage too. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a>'s <a href="https://unreal.fandom.com/wiki/DM-MorbiasII">DM_Morbias</a> also makes an appearance, with its panopticon-like lobby inviting all into the embrace of death (did you know you can now also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/classic-shooters-unreal-and-unreal-tournament-are-now-free-and-preserved-on-the-internet-archive">get Unreal Tournament for free</a> too?). There might be other mappy tributes in the big expandopack, but my arena shooter history fails me at this point. </p>

<p>The update also adds nine new weapons, including a katana and the Hill H15, an unusual prototype submachine gun from the 1950s that had a transparent magazine on the top. You can now also play a tutorial level, and set all the "active" maps you want into a playlist for more customised multiplayer shenanigans. All these additions and more are detailed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2386720/view/764023363746136681">an update post</a> by developers Lemaitre Bros.</p>
<p>Straftat launched with 70 maps - but you could buy a DLC pack that added 70 more. With this update an extra three DLC maps have been added to that buyable expansion pack. And another seven maps got quietly <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/ogg/2386720/announcements/detail/4453592738017837305?snr=2___">added back in November</a>. All this brings the total number of murder playgrounds to a vertigo-inducing 180. Probably more if I've missed a few "alt maps". That is wonderful. A playlist of death zones on shuffle. Or as our reviewer Rick Lane put it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-review">"an anarchic first-person speed dater"</a>. </p><p>As for Iceworld specifically, level designer Robert Yang once <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-legacy-of-fy_iceworld-counter-strikes-divisive-and-hugely-popular-custom-map">wrote a piece for us about the fan-made map's legacy</a>, comparing it to "the last desperate fight in the final circle of a battle royale, over and over". He even went in search of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/who-made-fy_iceworld-a-forensic-investigation">the map's original author</a>. If you're at all into mapping or just want to indulge in some multiplayer nostalgia, it's a good read. <strong><em>STRAFTAT!</em></strong></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>An unannounced Warhammer RPG was seemingly on the cards, however the project was cancelled towards the end of last year.</p>
<p>A report by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/unannounced-warhammer-rpg-cancelled-games-workshop">MP1st</a> details posts by former employees of a developer known as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/thought-pennies/">Thought Pennies</a> - a "role-playing game studio creating games focused on social storytelling" - who had an unannounced Warhammer game listed on their LinkedIn profiles.</p>

<p>As with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-weeks-into-2025-three-studios-are-already-closing-down">many other companies over the years</a>, Thought Pennies has been affected by layoffs recently. Two months ago, Thought Pennies' CCO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/daniel-aidan-erickson_over-the-last-three-years-at-thought-pennies-activity-7264324075357941760-nQCJ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">Daniel Erickson posted</a>:</p>
<p>"Over the last three years at Thought Pennies we built something amazing. We never missed a milestone, our feedback was great, our partnerships strong. We went from two people and a PowerPoint to a team of almost sixty heavily-vetted, incredibly independent, passionate professionals. Our publisher changed strategic direction, however, and our previous project is now without funding."</p><p>This change meant Thought Pennies was required to "shrink the size of the studio". While Erickson did not specify what the developer was working on prior to his post, others who previously worked with the company listed an "unannounced Warhammer" project being made in Unreal Engine 5 on their own pages, with one stating a "fantasy live service RPG" had been cancelled.</p>
<p>One post seen by MP1st described the game as a third person "Co-Op PvE Action RPG with a cast of unique heroes and playstyles", whcih would feature melee and ranged combat, as well as 'monstrous enemies set in a dark fantasy world'.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Thought Pennies for further information on its recent projects, and the reported cancellation of a Warhammer RPG game.</p>

<p>This week's report follows word earlier in the month that Games Workshop is looking to expand on the Warhammer series further, and is on the hunt for "the next one" following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/space-marine-2-most-successful-steam-launch-for-warhammer-40k-series">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2's success last year</a>.</p>
<p>"We recognize that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games. Clearly we are looking for the next one.

			<p>Season 2 will begin next week for both <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone 2 with some <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-community-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big tweaks and new features</a>. For example, console users will get the long-requested option to disable cross-play functionality in Ranked Play. To clarify, this will only disable matchmaking against PC users, who may have unfair advantages due to their hardware configuration; players will still be matchmade against players from another console.</p>
<p>Ranked Play mode will also see the addition of a 'Vote to Forfeit' feature, allowing players to vote for their team to forfeit a match if they're about to be eliminated or have lost a teammate. Forfeited matches will count as a standard loss and won't result in SR penalties or suspensions. Later in Season 2, players will also be able to rejoin a Ranked Play match if they suffered from a temporary connection issue. The developers believe this should help maintain fuller matches.</p>
<p>For Season 2, Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Zombies is getting a new map called Into The Tomb. Further quality-of-life updates coming later to this mode include the ability for the host to pause the game (only if everyone is in the same party) and restoring a player's loadout, Essence, and Salvage when they rejoin a match they were kicked from due to going AFK.</p>
<p>There will be a slew of gameplay improvements coming to all modes, like reduced collisions with teammates for improved maneuverability, bullet penetration updates, a weapon balance pass, reduced weapon movement when jumping, sliding, and diving with the Dexterity perk equipped, and improved player visibility in Kill Confirmed by reducing the height of dog tags. Later in Season 2, players with the War Cry perk active will be tagged with an icon over their heads so others know they are receiving faster health regeneration.</p>
<p>When it comes to Call of Duty Warzone 2, the new Season is set to bring several gameplay tweaks, such as faster reload speeds, reduced penalty when sprint-to-fire jumping, increased weapon swap speed, increased jump speed and successive jump height with one unmodified successive jump. Parachuting will also get quicker thanks to a faster parachute cut animation and increased player velocity when landing from a cut parachute.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Treyarch continues the fight against cheaters with improved client and server-side detections and systems, a major kernel-level driver update, driver security enhancement, an enhanced encryption process, and a brand-new tamper detection system.</p>

<p>It was recently claimed that Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 was banned in Saudi Arabia due to “unskippable gay scenes” in the game; however, the writer of the game, Daniel Vávra, has just provided clarification on the situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vávra is a Czech video game writer who has worked on several popular franchises, such as Mafia and Kingdom Come Deliverance. Vávra recently took to <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/1881081082612944935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) to address the claims about “unskippable gay scenes” <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-banned-saudi-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and the game being banned in Saudi Arabia</a>. However, his clarification included some spoilers for the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vávra’s clarification started by confirming that there are “no unskippable scenes” in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and that they haven’t been banned in any country, to their knowledge. Vávra added that he doesn’t like “forced diversity,” and neither are they forced to do anything nor force anyone to do specific things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Vávra spoke about the fact that gay characters were already part of the original Kingdom Come Deliverance, and it’s not new for KCD 2. Also, KCD 2 is an RPG so players can choose “a same-sex adventure” or not. Vávra confirmed that “All affairs are (and were in KCD1) purely optional”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vávra’s clarification on Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 claims also included some story points and the upcoming game’s setting, which comes with some spoilers. He explained that KCD 2 “takes place in one of the richest cities in Europe, which was besieged by a massive foreign army,” so players might see the city life “as more diverse” compared to the previous game set in villages. If you want more context about KCD 2’s story, check out Vávra’s entire thread <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/1881081082612944935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Also, check whether you must play the original title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-need-to-play-kingdom-come-deliverance-before-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before jumping into the sequel</a>.

Katsuhiro Harada, the boss of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken">Tekken</a>, has moved to reassure fans of the series who spotted him post on LinkedIn that he was now open to new job oppurtunities. 
</p>
<p>
Harada's LinkedIn page still lists him as executive game director, chief producer and general manager at Bandai Namco, where he has served for 30 years and become the face of the Tekken franchise.
</p>
<p>
But Harada has also set his profile to "open to work" status and in a short <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7286913589884465152/">post</a> wrote: "I would like to broaden my horizons by connecting with more people as I look toward the future. I'm interested in roles such as executive producer, executive game director, vice president, business development, business development executive, and marketing."

<p>
"Oh, don't worry about this," Harada <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1881164805060567212">wrote</a> on X in response to fans questioning whether he was leaving Bandai Namco and the Tekken series behind. "I meet a lot of people on a regular basis (but I don't actually have that many friends in my private world LOL), I just want to meet more people and expand my horizons in the future. 
</p>
<p>
"I can talk to a lot of people when I turn this option on," he concluded. "Just that."
</p>
<p>
It's now been 12 months since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> launched for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in January 2024. The game has since been kept updated with new characters, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16s-clive-coming-to-tekken-8-as-first-seasons-final-dlc-character">including Final Fantasy 16's Clive</a>, with a second season pass announced for 2025.
</p>
<p>
"A marked improvement over <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-7">Tekken 7</a> and a perfectly executed balancing act," Lewis Parker wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-review">Eurogamer's Tekken 8 review</a>, "keeping older players happy while revealing its trademark freedom to newcomers".
</p>
<p>Late last year, we learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-boss-asked-kfc-to-let-colonel-sanders-join-the-games-roster">Harada had once asked KFC to let Colonel Sanders join the Tekken series' roster</a> - a suggestion that was turned down with a disapproving look.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Team Cherry's Matthew 'Leth' Griffin, in charge of PR and marketing, has stated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is "real, progressing and will release".</p>
<p>Multiple rumours have been circulating about the game, sparked by co-creator William Pellen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-fans-believe-creators-switch-2-hint-points-to-april-announcement-and-its-all-thanks-to-a-slice-of-cake">switching his social media profile picture to a cake</a>, which led to fans speculating about an ARG to lead towards a release date.</p>
<p>Sadly, this has now been debunked as a "nothingburger".</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/the-hollow-knight-silksong-arg-turned-out-to-be-us-clutching-at-straws-but-dev-says-the-game-is-real-progressing-and-will-release/">GamesRadar</a> reported, YouTuber <a href="https://x.com/fireb0rn/status/1880411907552911626">fireb0rn posted</a>: "Leth reached out to me to confirm there was no Silksong ARG and that the changes to William's account and the tweet were a nothingburger. Apologies to have misled everyone. The cake was a lie."</p>
<p>Griffin himself then followed up to confirm the game is still in development.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Yes the game is real, progressing and will release. &lt;3</p>— Matthew Griffin (@griffinmatta) <a href="https://twitter.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>

<p>So what was that supposed ARG? Last week, Pellen changed his social media handle and switched his profile picture to a slice of chocolate cake. Eager <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> fans reverse image searched the picture to discover it was from a recipe page posted on 2nd April 2024 - a year ahead of the newly announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> Nintendo Direct.</p>
<p>Coupled with Pellen's post ahead of last week's Switch 2 reveal - "something big is coming" - and fans were riled up with anticipation. It seems that was all for nothing, despite the game still being on the way.</p>
<p>Silksong is the hugely anticipated follow up to popular Metroidvania Hollow Knight. It was first announced in 2019 - and Eurogamer went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-the-fast-paced-and-fluid-sequel-hollow-knight-deserves">hands-on with a Silksong demo</a> - but after multiple delays the game is still yet to be released.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Marking the first anniversary of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/palworld">Palworld’s</a> early access release, developer Pocketpair has released a roadmap of what to expect in future updates through 2025. Most exciting are major new features including co-op crossplay, world transfers for Pals, and a World Tree ending scenario</p>
<p>It’s less of a roadmap, and more of a to-do list, to be honest, as there’s no timeline to go with the list of features and content that Pocketpair has outlines. We’ve no idea when to expect crossplay, for example. Still, it’s great to see the team targeting some rather key features for the game.</p>


<p>The future Palworld roadmap includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Co-op Crossplay</li>
<li>World Transfers for Pals</li>
<li>World Tree / Ending Scenario</li>
<li>Further ways to strengthen and improve Pals</li>
<li>Various new content such as new Pals and technologies</li>
<li>Game Collaborations (Including Terraria)</li>
<li>Improvements to world object placement</li>
<li>Improvements to base Pals</li>
<li>Improvements to optimization</li>
<li>Improvements to UX</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the game roadmap, Pocketpair has also marked the first anniversary by putting the game’s soundtrack on YouTube with 28 tracks included.</p>

<p>Palworld is available across PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/palworld-is-out-today-on-ps5/">since last September</a>, across PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. December saw <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/29/palworld-december-update-new-island/">a major new update for the game that added a whole new island region</a> for players to explore.</p>
<p>Palworld has enjoyed a huge amount of success, its meme-worthy blend of Pokémon-like monsters, base building, crafting and guns proving to be an immediate hit last January.&nbsp;That success, however, has brought a lot of scrutiny. Back in September,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/nintendo-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-maker/">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company announced a lawsuit against the indie developer</a>, seemingly for infringing a recently acquired patent for capturing and summoning monsters in battle. <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/news16">Pocketpair promised to fight this lawsuit</a>, and it feels like Nintendo’s case could be a little bit shaky and tenuous… though we don’t really know how Japanese courts will view the case.</p>

			<p>The sci-fi future of Freedom Wars Remastered makes George Orwell’s 1984 look like a holiday brochure. Forget worrying about the government tracking you, or whether what you read is the truth, in Freedom Wars you’re born with a 1,000,000 year prison sentence. One. Million. Years. From birth. This dystopian vision of the future is so ruthless, you have to earn the right to lie down. What happens if you forget? That’s a crime, and you’ll find another batch of years being added to your sentence.</p>
<p>This brutality paves the way for Sinners like you to work in indentured servitude to your Panopticon – a prison city – earning your right to essential things like lying down, or frivolities like running for more than five seconds. Each contribution to the greater good knocks a few years off your sentence, hopefully moving things in the right direction. Unless, of course, you callously go for a little run. Then it’s going back up again.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/11/10/freedom-wars-review/">Freedom Wars</a> was originally a PS Vita exclusive, and it’s remained one of the most talked about and sought-after titles in the handheld’s catalogue. Arriving here in Remastered form, there are minimal quality of life changes, but the key thing is that the game is here to experience across a raft of modern platforms. That’s well worth celebrating, but it’s a shame that the team at Dimps didn’t take the chance to bring us a more modern interpretation of the game’s iconic gameplay to go alongside it.</p>
<p>Freedom Wars belongs to the Monster Hunter branch of the action-RPG genre’s family tree, its combat centring on taking down huge foes called Abductors with a team of other players – either real-life allies or AI controlled. You follow that up by collecting various parts and components from that fallen foe, and using them to upgrade and improve your weaponry, or turning them in to your Panopticon in a bid to bring that sentence further down.</p>


<p>In 2024, Freedom Wars Remastered is showing its age and its portable origins. While the technical improvements bring the game up to a 4K resolution and 60fps refresh rate, they don’t do anything for the clunky gameplay, and it feels incredibly stilted when you compare it to modern genre entries like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/23/monster-hunter-rise-review-nintendo-switch/">Monster Hunter Rise</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/16/wild-hearts-review-ps5-pc-xbox-series-x/">Wild Hearts</a>, paling before the imminent arrival of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> next month.</p>
<p>While the use of your Thorn – a binding device that lets you pull enemies to their knees or climb up them to attack – still feels fun, it’s not as fluid as you’d want it to be, and though you can swap between two weapons on the fly – an idea that Monster Hunter is only just cribbing from – there are various annoying limitations like the questionable hit detection that wear on you the longer you spend with the game.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that Freedom Wars isn’t enjoyable. The far-flung future setting is one of Freedom Wars greatest strengths, and I love the overarching ideas and themes that push you to improve your character’s loadout, and their position within the Panopticon. The gameplay remains as solid as it was at release, and if you’re looking for a timesink while you wait for Monster Hunter Wilds, there are flashes of greatness through the game’s runtime that make it worth picking up.</p>
<p>It is a case of missed opportunity, though. The PC port has launched in an awful state, and while the first patches have improved things considerably, I wouldn’t expect to be experiencing any level of frame skipping in a basic remaster of a ten-year-old game. On top of that, the different graphical options are extremely limited, and you can’t make any changes to the frame rate whatsoever – surely this is a game that could run at 120Hz without breaking a sweat?</p>

<p>There is one addition that the remastering team have added, but it’s not necessarily an improvement. The original Japanese release of the game used text to speech for some of its AI-driven characters, as it made sense thematically, and was an impressive inclusion in a handheld title at the time. They’ve added that to the English dub this time around as well, and it’s fair to say that its decade-old synthesised speech will be an acquired taste for many. Various words are mispronounced in every single conversation with your Accessory or the Panopticon’s AI, and confusingly, you can’t even escape it by setting the voices to Japanese as these characters speak in English regardless.</p>
