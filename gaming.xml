<p>Bethesda has surprised <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a> fans on the Switch 2 this week with a new update, which adds a "60Hz mode" and allows players to prioritise either the game's visuals or performance. The frame rate has also been locked to 30Hz in the visuals mode, and the patch improves other aspects, such as the FPS performance drops in certain areas of the game.</p>
<p>The tech comparison <a href="https://youtu.be/Op5s6dTuod4">YouTube channel ElAnalistaDeBits</a> has now taken a look at Update 1.2 - sharing a side-by-side video of the visual mode running alongside the game's performance mode. In some scenes, it's also shared footage of the existing update (Version 1.1, which was limited to 30fps).</p>
<p>While it might not look quite as impressive as it does in the visual mode, as you can see, the performance mode makes the experience smoother. According to this same video comparison, the game aims for 60fps in this mode, and while there is a solid frame rate in some segments, it can also be seen slightly dipping from time to time.</p>

<p>In terms of the compromises in performance mode, there appears to be less detail in terms of shadows and foliage. Other more noticeable things include more pop-in. Still, if you haven't already tried out this mode, it is worth a look, and might just end up being the mode you prefer playing on.</p>
<p>If you're still not sure if now is a good time to revisit (or jump into this title) on the Switch 2, we've shared our own <a href="https://youtu.be/0oU8yjp-m2Y">comparison video on Nintendo Life</a>, which you can see in our previous story covering the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/bethesda-releases-skyrim-update-1-2-for-switch-2-includes-60hz-mode-and-much-more">patch notes for Skyrim's Update 1.2</a>.</p>

<p>It addresses multiple issues and makes some adjustments on both the Switch and Switch 2. There are also some updates specific to the Switch 2 version of the game. This includes an issue with clouds that's now been resolved, and also an update to the controller vibration intensity.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h3>Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Version 3.0.1 (18th February 2026)</h3>
<h4>The following updates have been made when playing the game on Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch:</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where the game would run slower than normal after exiting the island hotel to an outdoor area.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where, when asking Resetti to clean up the island, fences that were put away or in storage could change into different customizations or be duplicated, and some cleaned-up items could disappear.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where Timmy and Tommy would sometimes stop following the player inside Nook’s Cranny.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where items could pop out of a rock before the shovel made contact when hitting it.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where, after playing with another player on a slumber island, home remodeling or relocation could become unavailable on the slumber island.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where the Camera app installation sequence could play when redeeming the Island Designer license at Nook Stop.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where some items were displayed in incorrect positions in the catalog used for photo studios and hotel decorating.</em></li>
<li><em>Other adjustments and corrections were made to improve the game play experience.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4>The following updates have been made when playing the game on Nintendo Switch 2:</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where clouds near the horizon could appear misaligned outdoors on the island, causing parts of the sky to show unnaturally.</em></li>
<li><em>Adjusted controller vibration intensity to match the level when playing on Nintendo Switch.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Once again, this follows the release of the Switch 2 Edition last month. If you haven't already got it, it's a paid upgrade for existing Animal Crossing Switch owners. Here's a sample of what we had to say about it in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Life review</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is perfectly fine. It makes things a bit prettier, has a few more options to take advantage of the console’s new features, but all in all, it’s not an especially exciting upgrade."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was also a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/animal-crossing-new-horizons-free-3-0-update-2026-and-nintendo-switch-2-edition-everything-included">free 3.0 update</a> released alongside the Switch 2 release, which added new content and features to both versions of the game.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo also updated the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> this week.</p>

<p>The creator ConcernedApe has now rolled out the first major update for the title in 2026. It's a bug fix patch addressing multiple issues, including some improvements to mouse mode on Switch 2 and some fixes for GameShare.</p>
<p>Here is the full rundown via social media:</p>
<h3>Stardew Valley - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Update (19th February 2026)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>- Fix for bug where crafting certain items could remove incorrect ingredients from the inventory.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>- Improved mouse mode on Switch 2, with the option to disable it entirely.</p>
<p>- Fixed some graphics corruption in Switch 2 GameShare.</p>
<p>- Ensure network maintenance messages appear on co-op startup.</p>
<p>- Obey parental controls when joining Switch 2 GameShare sessions.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>ConcernedApe also notes how there is a patch for the game on the original Switch which fixes the same crafting bug.</p>
<p>The game's creator has also provided an update on the European and Japanese release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Stardew Valley - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>. These locations will apparently receive the game and upgrade on their respective eShops in "a few weeks". The bug fix patch above will also be included.</p>

<p>If you are eager to jump into the Switch 2 Edition right now but aren't located in North America, you can still access the free Switch 2 upgrade for the Switch version from the US eShop. You'll just need a Nintendo account for this region.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/destiny-2/" id="52052">Destiny 2</a>’s next major update has been officially delayed until June 9, 2026.</p>



<p>Destiny 2: Shadow and Order will not be released at the expected time. The game’s development team announced the delay on social media. They explained that the delay is due to “large revisions” and sizable quality-of-life updates.</p>



<p>It was noted that additional details would be disclosed closer to the release, including the previously announced weapons-tier upgrade and other updates. </p>



<p>It was also stated that routine fixes and stability improvements will continue throughout June. There will also be continued portal modifiers, Guardian Games in March, and the return of a more frequent Iron Bar Cadence in April.</p>



<p>The team has also clarified that they will continue to provide updates on live game content, community activations, and general news on their social media channels.</p>

<h2 id="h-destiny-2-shadow-and-order-delay-was-previously-rumored">Destiny 2: Shadow and Order Delay Was Previously Rumored</h2>



<p>In January, it was reported that the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-2-shadow-and-order-has-reportedly-been-delayed/" id="170645">expected to be delayed</a> to avoid interfering with the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99">Bungie’s </a>Marathon, the upcoming extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Speaking of Marathon, there will be crossovers between the two games. Pre-ordering Bungie’s new game rewards Destiny players with new cosmetics, Sparrows, and Ships. There are also new shaders, emotes, and more to celebrate the upcoming release.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will continue to provide updates on the forthcoming DLC closer to release.</p>







<p>For more on the Marathon, see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/limited-edition-marathon-dualsense-and-headset-revealed/" id="170619">the limited-edition PS5 DualSense controller</a> being sold to promote the game.</p>

With all that remained of <a href="https://playhighguard.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>playhighguard.com</u></a> being a “site unavailable” message and social media links, many believed the full experience, which launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S just weeks ago, would soon be taken offline for good.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As concerns that Highguard could soon <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">go the way of Concord</a> boiled, Wildlight finally stepped in (via <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/2024081430674800915?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>CharlieIntel</u></a>). Discord server admin and moderator WL_Coronach replied to one fan’s question about the website’s status earlier today, assuring them and others it would eventually come back online – even if it’s currently a “low priority” issue. Instead, the developer has put most of its focus on “updates and content.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Not sure on the timeframe, but basically needs to be transferred and simplified,” the full message says. “Low priority [at the moment] ( reputational damage already done ).

Still, those who have stuck by the free-to-play game seem to be satisfied with any additional content at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Once we lock in the patch date I’ll see if we can get a patch preview up for you guys a bit beforehand,” WL_Coronach added in a follow-up reply.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Highguard Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-highguard-developer-reflects-on-disastrous-announcement-and-launch-we-were-turned-into-a-joke-from-minute-1"><u>Highguard’s woes</u></a> began the moment Geoff Keighley showed it as the one-last-thing announcement at The Game Awards 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Fortunately, "the majority of people who made Skyrim are still here."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls 6 is going to be a return to Bethesda's "classic style" of games, according to Bethesda director Todd Howard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from an interview done by Howard with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX4rKpB97L4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KindaFunny</a> today, in which he talked about why he can't really provide too much of an update on The Elder Scrolls 6, and admits he would have preferred not to have announced it so early (in 2018).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, he says players can expect it to be a return to Bethesda's classic form, after the studio took "creative detour[s]" with both Starfield and Fallout 76. Here's the full quote from Howard:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We do have a certain style that we like and that our fans like that we want to get better and better at. I think in some ways Fallout 76 and Starfield are a little bit of a creative detour from that classic Elder Scrolls, Fallout, a Skyrim or a Fallout 3 or a Fallout 4, Oblivion, where you're exploring a world in a certain way. And as we come back to Elder Scrolls 6 that we're doing now, we're coming back to that classic style that we've missed, that we know really really well."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Howard goes on, confirming that the studio has spent the last several years improving on Creation Engine 2, which is the game engine behind Starfield, and bringing it up to Creation Engine 3, which will power "Elder Scrolls 6 and beyond."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in the interview, he adds that "the majority of people who made Skyrim are still here," while new faces have also joined the studio, bringing experiences from other studios to lend to The Elder Scrolls 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a long, agonizing wait for The Elder Scrolls 6 since it was first announced – wow, okay, <em>almost eight years ago.</em> It has in fact been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced">longer between the announcement and now</a> than it was between The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and the announcement of The Elder Scrolls 6. Howard has warned eager fans as recently as last November that the game is "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-preaching-patience-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-warns-fans-teases-potential-shadowdrop">still a long way off</a>" and has even teased that he may just shadow drop it, something he alluded to again today with KindaFunny. He reiterated today that "it's gonna be a while yet," and confirmed that, "We're able to play it, we're about to pass a big milestone internally, the majority of the studio is on the game and some of our partners."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Howard also claims all this waiting is necessary for the game to be great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What do fans really want?” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-dev-says-were-going-to-take-our-time-and-as-long-as-it-needs-to-be-great-points-to-gta-6-delay-as-the-smartest-thing-they-could-do">he said in December of last year</a>. “Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn’t meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know? That’s what I think people are going to want. So, we’re going to take our time and as long as it needs to be great.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

            <guid>1439914</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bungie have announced that their next large update to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>,&nbsp; titled Shadow and Order, has been delayed.<br>
<em><br>
“Our next Major Update, Destiny 2: Shadow and Order, is undergoing large revisions and will be delayed. This update is being changed and expanded to include sizable quality-of-life updates and as a result, will also be renamed. This update will now launch on June 9, 2026. </em></p>
<p><em>We will provide exact details closer to release covering previously announced Weapon Tier Upgrading, but also additions like expanding Tiered Gear to all Raid and Dungeon activities, Pantheon 2.0, Tier 5 stats for Exotic Armors, and more. Through June, we will continue to have routine bug fixes and stability improvements, continued portal modifiers, Guardian Games (March), and the return of a more frequent Iron Banner cadence</em></p>


<p><em>In terms of communications, we will be focusing on providing you with updates about our live game content, community activations, and general upkeep through the TWID and our Destiny social channels. Thank you for your continued patience and support. We will have more information on our next major update and future plans for Destiny 2 closer to launch.</em></p>
<p><em>See You Starside.”</em></p>
<p>The Shadow and Order update had been due to arrive just after the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/the-marathon-server-slam-takes-place-a-week-before-launch/">Marathon Server Slam</a> and just before <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/19/marathon-gets-a-march-5th-release-date/">Marathon itself launched,</a> so it seemed inevitable that it would be moved to allow Bungie some space for that.</p>

<p>Bungie have not released a roadmap for future updates but if Shadow and Order – or whatever it gets called – is delayed by three months then there is a very good chance that the next expansion, Shattered Cycle, will also get pushed back.</p>
<p>Bungie are clearly prioritising Marathon, and they really have to as they need another big hit. Destiny 2 is a shadow(keep) of its former self, and delaying big updates for months on end is not going to incentivise the players left.</p>

<p>Todd Howard discusses <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-elder-scrolls-6/" id="2711">The Elder Scrolls 6.</a></p>



<p>During a recent interview with the <a href="https://youtu.be/sX4rKpB97L4">Kinda Funny Gamescast,</a> Todd Howard commented on the progression of the sixth Elder Scrolls game. He noted that the game will be powered by Creation Engine 3. Creation Engine 2 powered Starfield, and now, Howard says that CE3 will power Elder Scrolls 6 and beyond.</p>



<p>“That’s going to power Elder Scrolls VI and beyond… We have a game style that we really, really like, and I think people expect from us. There’s a lot of innovation to be done there still, so that when you step into a world, you feel like you’re experiencing it really for the first time, a game like that. I think we’re happy with where it’s headed right now. That’s what I could say.”</p>

<h2 id="h-todd-howard-says-it-s-not-his-preference-to-announce-games-too-early">Todd Howard Says It’s Not His Preference to Announce Games Too Early</h2>



<p>When asked about the 7 years since the announcement of The Elder Scrolls 6, Todd Howard said that if he had his way, he would never announce anything; one day, a game would just appear. However, he reiterated that they’re satisfied with the game’s current state and indicated they were about to pass a significant development milestone.</p>



<p>Regarding earlier pitches for the sixth Elder Scrolls game, Kurt Kuhlmann, a former <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bethesda-2/" id="3469">Bethesda </a>employee, noted that he wanted to incorporate elements of Star Wars into the game’s lore. Ultimately, he did not write the script. Read those comments <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-loremaster-says-tes6-could-have-taken-star-wars-inspired-turn/" id="170375">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Sonic the Hedgehog is one of the most beloved characters in video games, and the success of his recent trilogy of live-action movies has only further proved that fact. As the franchise has continued, each movie has introduced more characters from Sonic's lore, with a post-credits scene in the latest movie announcing the arrival of Amy Rose. While she's silent in that scene, today, we learned actress Kristen Bell will be portraying her in the upcoming <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4, </em>according to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/sonic-4-kristen-bell-voice-amy-rose-1236508342/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>.</p><p>Bell is known for her starring roles in <em>The Good Place, Veronica Mars, </em>and the <em>Frozen </em>movies, though video game fans might also remember her performance as Lucy in the first three Assassin's Creed games. She's performed alongside Sonic's voice actor, Ben Schwartz, many times, with both on the main cast for all five seasons of <em>House of Lies</em>.</p>

      <p>Amy Rose in Sonic Dream Team</p>
  
</article>

<p>Amy is one of Sonic's most commonly appearing sidekicks, being featured in just about every modern iteration of the series and being playable in a few, as well. She's loud, passionate, wields a disproportionately massive hammer, and is often depicted as being absolutely in love with Sonic, though he rarely reciprocates. Personality-wise, she's got a lot in common with Miss Piggy and Harley Quinn. We recently encountered her as the Lady of the Lake <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUawaRsbij0">in our Super Replay of Sonic and the Black Knight</a>, but she's featured in good games too.</p><p>Given that this is the first we've heard of Bell's involvement, it will probably be a few months until we see our first trailer. In any case, Sonic the Hedgehog 4 hits theaters in March 19, 2027. Interestingly, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/09/live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-delayed-by-a-few-weeks" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="98b449b2-d68e-4a5a-9ed3-d4722dc3276f" data-entity-substitution="canonical">that's just seven weeks before Nintendo's live-action Zelda movie is slated to come out</a> – it's going to be a big spring for video game adaptations.</p><p><em>[Source: </em><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/sonic-4-kristen-bell-voice-amy-rose-1236508342/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a><em>]</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/18/kristen-bell-will-voice-amy-rose-in-sonic-the-hedgehog-4]]></content:encoded>

      <p>Like so many other consumer electronics companies out there at the moment, Sony is about to be in a lot of trouble thanks to the AI-fuelled rush on computer components like storage and memory. The company's solution, at this stage at least, seems to have come from an evening spent looking at the trolley problem.</p><p>As<a href="https://www.inside-games.jp/article/2026/02/09/177151.html?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Inside</u></a> report (via<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-could-offset-rising-ram-costs-by-monetizing-the-ps5-install-base/1100-6538266/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky"> <u>GameSpot</u></a>), Sony CFO Lin Tao spoke about the company's mitigation plans during their latest financial results presentation, saying that while Sony are "[negotiating] with various suppliers to secure enough supply to meet the demand of our customers" when it comes to being able to manufacture more PS5 hardware (there's enough to get them through the 2026 holiday season, apparently), they've decided that in order to "minimize the impact" of<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>further console price increases</u></a>, they're going to really start "monetizing the installed base" across both games and "network services".</p><p>That's all she said, but it doesn't take a crystal ball to see what she means: most likely it'll result in stuff like PlayStation Plus price increases and more expensive games (or more games launching at the most expensive price point). I get the impulse; it's probably easier to squeeze each existing customer a little than try to sell a new one a console that, if costs were passed directly onto <em>them</em>, could be $600-700 by Christmas. And I sympathise to some extent with individuals at Sony who are just trying to sell PlayStations and cameras in a world where the deluded impulses of 13 trillionaires are going to drive us all mad.</p><p>But also, as a company, Sony can't "<a href="https://ai.sony/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>we're all trying to find the guy who did this</u></a>" their way out of this either.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/missed-potential-or-a-campy-classic-switch-2-exclusive-tokyo-scramble-hasnt-been-a-hit</link>
            <guid>1439857</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Cast your minds back to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> earlier this month. One of the most surprising games featured during the presentation was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tokyo-scramble">Tokyo Scramble</a>, a stealth-horror hybrid where you have to escape from dinosaur-esque creatures. And you can do so alone or with the help of friends via GameChat and GameShare.</p>
<p>Not only was the announcement a surprise, but so was the release date — 11th February 2026, just less than a week after the Direct. Well, that's cool! Plus, the game was developed by one of the co-devs of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_lilies_quietus_of_the_knights">Ender Lilies</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_magnolia_bloom_in_the_mist">Ender Magnolia</a>. Sounds interesting, right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, just a week after release, it seems like people aren't <em>too</em> hot on the game. We haven't managed to check it out ourselves, but looking at reviews and discussion online, opinions range to "a neat experiment" to "campy" to "very rough".</p>
<p>With only three critic reviews <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/tokyo-scramble/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">on Metacritic</a> — all of which score the game at 5 or below — and an average score of <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/20062/tokyo-scramble/reviews">37 on OpenCritic</a> (after 11 reviews), Tokyo Scramble's big reveal doesn't seem to have paid off.</p>

<p>Take <a href="https://monstervine.com/2026/02/tokyo-scramble-review/">Monster Vine's Spencer Legacy's thoughts</a> on the main gameplay element, for example: "The stealth mechanics that serve as the very core of Tokyo Scramble are more irritating than compelling, especially since you die in a single hit." Technical issues and poor writing hampered what was otherwise a game with "some neat ideas", with the outlet landing on a 2/5 score.</p>
<p><a href="https://noisypixel.net/tokyo-scramble-review/">Azario Lopez over at Noisy Pixel</a> similarly sees the potential, but says Tokyo Scramble takes the "campy moments... too far". Again, mechanics, gameplay, and visual issues hinder the experience a lot, with Lopez concluding: "I respect the ambition behind trying something strange and new, especially for a fresh IP, but ambition alone doesn’t carry a game this far", scoring it a 4/10.</p>
<p>It's not <em>all</em> bad, of course; <a href="https://www.nintendoblast.com.br/2026/02/analise-tokyo-scramble-sobrevivencia-e-drama.html">Fernando Lorde at Brazilian outlet Nintendo Blast</a> awarded the game a 7/10, praising that ambition, while acknowledging that (translated via Google): "it feels like a melting pot of ideas and mechanics lost in a feverish teenage dream about relationships and subterranean monsters."</p>
<p>Outside of reviews and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/casualnintendo/comments/1r23fnb/so_i_bought_tokyo_scramble/">odd Reddit thread</a> about the game, online chatter seems pretty muted about the game overall. But the consensus seems to be that Tokyo Scramble is a swing and a miss for most, though if you like campy, ambitious experiences, you might find something to love.</p>

<p>Of course, we're just going by what others have said, so we'd love to hear from any of you lovely readers who have actually played the game — or are even a little bit interested in it! Do you think Tokyo Scramble is a misunderstood gem? Perhaps the camp and clunk have won you over? Or are you disappointed you jumped in head-first?</p>

			<p><strong>Highguard</strong> has become one of the most talked-about games to kick off 2026, but all for the wrong reasons. After its maligned reveal at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/">The Game Awards</a></strong>, despite its <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/">launch drawing <strong>97K</strong> concurrent players </a>on Steam alone, those players didn't stick around, and it lost the vast majority of its player base almost immediately. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-ripped-apart-steam-user-reviews/">review-bombed on Steam</a>, and barely two weeks after it had arrived on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, "<em>most</em>" of the team at developer <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-weeks-after-launch-highguard-developer-wildlight-has-already-had-layoffs-reportedly-cutting-most-of-the-team/">had been <strong>laid off</strong>.</a></p>



<p>After one of the laid-off developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-highguard-dev-calls-out-players-for-slandering-the-game-before-they-played-it/">took to X (formerly Twitter) to call out players</a> who wrote the game off after barely giving it a chance and a new report revealed some <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-website-remains-down-fans-worry-this-is-it/">details about the game's funding</a>, the latest development is that some of the laid-off staffers have been given permission to start sharing what they worked on at Wildlight as part of their public portfolios. </p>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/concept-art-and-videos-of-completed-highguard-characters-and-wip-map-posted-online-by-ex-staffers.1439296/">ResetEra</a>, Wildlight allowing the former artists to share their work is a good-faith move by the studio, and it gives these artists a better chance to find work by being able to show off these videos and images of currently unreleased characters from the game. That said, the fact that these designs are being released at all raises even more questions about the game's longevity.</p>



<p>Of course, it's possible that the characters shared were concepts that made it far into development, but were ultimately not chosen to be part of any future updates. Though with how things have been going for Highguard so far, seeing unreleased characters appear online in this fashion has players wondering if Wildlilght is allowing them to be shared because the game won't be around long enough for them to be released.</p>



<p>It's definitely not common to see unreleased characters from a live service game that is currently still active, so while the speculation surrounding the release of these images could turn out to be just that, it could also be another sign of Highguard's upcoming shuttering. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[The 12 Best Games On The Nintendo Switch 2]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-best-games-mario-kart-donkey-kong-1851786840</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Switch 2 is quickly approaching its one-year anniversary. Nine months in, how is the game library on Nintendo’s new flagship console shaping up? Quite well. What it lacks in the big exclusives we saw during the first year of its predecessor, it’s making up for with great versions of some of the best big-budget games around, as well as perfectly timed sequels from storied indie franchises. If you’re thinking of buying a Switch 2 or already have one, here are the 12 best games to check out on Nintendo’s latest handheld hybrid.</p> <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-the-kotaku-review-1842697312"><b><i>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</i></b></a></h2>  <p>One of the best RPGs ever got one of the best remakes ever and the whole thing is finally on Switch 2. <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> preserves the irresistible mix of grim and goofy that seared the original into so many people’s brains while elevating its story and gameplay to new heights with beautiful cinematic setpieces and solid real-time hybrid action combat. Everything from the original’s incredible soundtrack to its story’s most unforgettable moments are reimagined and stretched out in service of a journey that feels both epic and compact. <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-handheld-performance-2000661851">The Switch 2 port</a> offers all of that with even fewer compromises than expected, making <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> <em>Intergrade</em> the platform’s biggest and more rewarding big-budget RPG adventure yet. — Ethan Gach</p>

 <p><strong>A good match for:&nbsp;</strong>brooding eco-terrorists who love the city in <em>Blade Runner</em> and collecting crystals.<br> <strong>Not a good match for:&nbsp;</strong>players who hate when games pause the action for lots of cutscenes.</p> <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-review-switch-sakurai-2000651657"><b><i>Kirby Air Riders</i></b></a></h2>  <p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is a tricked-out hotrod that’s as fun to tinker with as it is to drive. It’s overflowing with systems, mechanics, and stylish details, all packaged into fun and easy-to-manage bite-size morsels. What <em>Smash Bros.</em> is to fighting games, <em>Air Riders</em> is to racing games. It’s first and foremost a party game you’re meant to hang out and mess around in. Competition and heated rivalries are secondary to frenetic moment-to-moment action and a quintessentially satisfying game feel that makes every turn, boost, and attack so good, you forget that underneath all the ostentatious ornamentation there’s not a ton of depth. Who cares? Splashing in puddles can be just as fun as surfing over waves. — Ethan Gach</p>

 <p><strong>A good match for: </strong>people who wish go-karting felt more like smashing gumball machines.<br> <strong>Not a good match for: </strong>anyone who enjoys being anywhere near an actual race track.</p> <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123"><b><i>Star Wars Outlaws</i></b></a></h2>  <p>Ubisoft’s <i>Star Wars </i>scoundrel sim <i>Outlaws</i>, like so many of the company’s big open-world games, feels a bit awkward and unrefined in spots. Enemy behavior can be too simplistic, and some of your tricks for manipulating them can make you feel more like a Jedi than a smuggler. But, in the immortal words of Han Solo, “she’s got it where it counts.” <i>Outlaws </i>puts you in the world of <i>Star Wars </i>like few games have, letting you soak up the atmosphere of backwater cantinas and more bustling city joints, claim victory at sabacc tables far and wide against some of the steeliest gamblers in the Outer Rim, and rise up the ranks of the criminal underworld as you assemble a crew for the one big job that’s gonna set you up for life. It’s also one of the most impressive games on Switch 2, where a masterful port keeps it looking great and running smooth with few visible compromises. — Carolyn Petit</p>

 <p><strong>A good match for:</strong> people who want to soak in the vibes of every bar and cantina from Tatooine to Toshara.<strong>Not a good match for:</strong> people seeking <i>Hitman </i>or <i>Metal Gear</i>-level stealth gameplay.</p> <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-ii-the-kotaku-review-2000628064"><b><i>Hades 2</i></b></a></h2>  <p><i>Hades 2</i>&nbsp;feels less like a sequel than a standalone expansion. It will never escape the shadow of the first game. But it is more&nbsp;<i>Hades</i>, a roguelike action-RPG that’s still setting the bar in each of those genres. It doesn’t feel as warm and personal and as accessible as the original, but it’s expertly balanced, beautifully presented, and still so hard to put down. — Ethan Gach</p>

 <p><strong>A good match for: </strong>fans of Greek mythology who think it needs more buildcrafting.<br> <strong>Not a good match for: </strong>folks who hate playing the same great levels over and over again.</p> <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><b><i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i></b></a></h2>  <p>After a year or two, every <em>Pokémon</em> game inevitably gets to a point where the community looks back fondly on it. So while there are plenty of folks still in the rage phase with this one, I’m just gonna forgo the waiting period and say that <i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </i>is one of the best, boldest games in the long-running monster-taming series. The single-city setting allows you to hang out with one of the series’ best casts for far longer than any of previous games have, and its real-time battle system is full of new nuances and strategies you won’t find in your average turn-based <em>Pokémon</em> game. After two games, we know the <i>Legends</i> subseries has become Game Freak’s place to experiment, so it’s entirely possible the next one won’t look or play anything like <i>Z-A</i>, but it would be nice if these action systems made their way to more games. They’re too good to toss aside after just one entry. — Kenneth Shepard</p> <p><b>A Good Match For: </b>people who want a <em>Pokémon</em> experience that doesn’t feel like more of the same.<b>Not A Good Match For: </b>people who want windows to be lovingly rendered.</p>

 <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review-hornet-team-cherry-2000639568"><b><i>Hollow Knight: Silksong</i></b></a></h2>  <p>There are no half-measures in <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. Exploration is carefully crafted and uncompromisingly exacting. Boss fights will force you to learn and improve before unblocking your path. The music is excellent, the little sound effects amazing, and every part of <em>Silksong</em>‘s gothic underground labyrinth is full of rich veins of lore and character to mine. It’s a game that thrives in the tension between limitation and mastery and never fails to reward those who soldier on no matter how often their effort and ambition is momentarily shunted.&nbsp; — Ethan Gach</p> <p><strong>A good match for: </strong>Metroidvania nerds who love exploring dangerous tunnels.<br> <strong>Not a good match for: </strong>Anyone who hates dying in Soulslikes.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>  <p>CD Projekt Red’s open-world RPG is one of the most impressive technical showcases for the Switch 2 thus far. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> once broke PlayStation 4s and Xbox Ones across the globe, but it runs well on Nintendo’s system. Driving around Night City is still a dream, and the Switch 2’s optional mouse controls are pretty intuitive in the game’s shooting segments. There are certainly better ways to play <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, but seeing it running on a Switch 2 is a reminder that while the system might seem like a pretty lowkey upgrade from the original, playing console-quality games on the go is still a novel experience eight years later. — Kenneth Shepard</p> <p><strong>A good match for: </strong>story-driven RPG fans.<br> <strong>Not a good match for: </strong>people with a weak stomach for some tough subject matter.</p> <h2><em><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>Tears of the Kingdom</strong></em></h2>  <p>It’s no surprise that the two best games on the original Switch are vastly improved in their Switch 2 incarnations. <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>run at a smooth 60fps on the Switch 2, and if seeing these games running on a device that doesn’t feel like it’s struggling to keep them afloat isn’t enough, the Switch 2 editions come with new content thanks to the Zelda Notes app that adds new challenges and lore to two already dense games. If you played them before, they’re worth revisiting. If you never touched Link’s open-world adventures, they’re even more essential on the Switch 2. — Kenneth Shepard</p>

 <p><strong>A good match for: </strong>people who want peak.<br> <strong>Not a good match for: </strong>people who get overwhelmed with dense systems.</p> <h2><em><strong>Mario Kart World</strong></em></h2>  <p>Nintendo’s biggest launch title for the Switch 2 is still arguably the best game the system has to offer. <em>Mario Kart World </em>is a sublime addition to the kart racer series’ long line of quality party game staples. Though it’s not without its frustrations, <em>World </em>presents&nbsp;the chaotic, rollicking fun of throwing a blue shell down a track or barreling through your enemies as a Bullet Bill at its best. The open world is kind of empty, but it’s a fun playground to practice all the cool stunts you can do now, like riding on the wall and grinding on rails. <em>Mario Kart World </em>is all about giving you the freedom to race how you want, and that means giving you more tools, more players on the track at once, and more bothersome items to chuck at your foes. This is only the beginning, and Nintendo will likely be updating the game for years to come. <em>Mario Kart World </em>will undoubtedly be a staple of the Switch 2’s lifetime. — Kenneth Shepard</p> <p><strong>A good match for: </strong>everyone, really.<br> <strong>Not a good match for: </strong>anyone looking for something chill.</p> <h2><em><strong>Split Fiction</strong></em></h2>  <p>Hazelight’s co-op platformer <a href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470"><em>Split Fiction</em></a> doesn’t feel built for the Switch 2. Its split-screen format makes it a pain to play in tabletop mode, so it’s really best played on a TV like you would on PS5 or Xbox. But once you’ve got it running on a big screen, the game is still a hoot. Though its cheesy writing leaves much to be desired, as a cooperative platformer with a ton of mechanical and environmental variety, it’s easily the best in Hazelight’s long line of co-op games. <a href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-final-level-mio-zoe-rader-ending-1851768868">That final level still whips ass, too</a>. — Kenneth Shepard</p>

 <p><strong>A good match for: </strong>someone with a friend to play with.<br> <strong>Not a good match for: </strong>someone who doesn’t have a friend to play with.</p> <h2><em><strong>Street Fighter 6</strong></em></h2>  <p>Fighting games were always going to be one of the biggest tests of the Switch 2’s technical capabilities, and Capcom thankfully managed to bring one of the best genre entries in recent years to the system without much compromise in <a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a>. Some of its Switch 2 features, like amiibo support and motion controls with the Joy-Cons, feel like cute nods to the system’s original features rather than something that fundamentally changes the game, so you’ll most likely go right back to standard play before long. Once you do, though, you’ll find a really great version of an already stellar game running at a smooth 60fps. Sure, it’s probably not going to be the version people are playing at EVO, but it’s more than good enough to break out at the function and play with friends. — Kenneth Shepard</p>

 <p><strong>A good match for: </strong>the fighting game sickos.<br> <strong>Not a good match for: </strong>people who don’t like to memorize combos.</p> <h2><em><strong>Donkey Kong Bananza</strong></em></h2>  <p>Donkey Kong and Pauline’s latest adventure is one of the Switch 2’s most impressive technical achievements. Its breakable environments are so malleable that they’re a <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-destructible-environments-ocd-1851786630">bit of a distraction</a>, but its tight platforming, creative problem-solving, and booming personality make it one of the most joyful games on the Switch 2 right now. Is it the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352">cultural moment the system needed to bring people in out of the gate</a>? Maybe not. But it’s still an absolute delight on its own terms. — Kenneth Shepard</p>

 <p><strong>A good match for: </strong>people who wanted <em>King Kong </em>to have a happier ending.<br> <strong>Not a good match for: </strong>people who can’t move on without finding every collectable in a level.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Todd Howard Admitted Which Fallout He’s ‘Most Proud Of’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-admitted-which-fallout-proud-of/</link>
            <guid>1439833</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Todd Howard has been around the block when it comes to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bethesda/" id="419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bethesda Game Studios’</a> titles. He has contributed greatly to the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fallout/" id="311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-elder-scrolls/" id="976" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/starfield/" id="307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfield</a>, so he’s qualified to speak at length about any of them.</p>



<p>During a recent interview, the head honcho himself took a deep dive into <strong>every game </strong>on that list, stopping briefly to explain which Fallout game he’s <strong>the most proud of</strong> from all the titles he’s worked on. That includes Fallout 3, Fallout 4, Fallout Shelter (kind of), and Fallout 76.</p>



<p>But which one of them is the gem for Todd Howard?</p>







<h2 id="h-you-might-not-expect-it">You Might Not Expect It</h2>



<p>Out of the slew of Fallout games released in the last two decades or so (discounting New Vegas, as Todd didn’t really work on that one), there’s <strong>one </strong>that stands out for the visionary developer.</p>



<p>In a recent super-sized interview on the Kinda Funny Gamescast, Todd Howard gushed over <strong>Fallout 76</strong>, declaring it the post-apocalyptic epic that he’s most proud of.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In many respects, it’s the game that we’ve done that I’m the most proud of. It’s so hard to do and then maintain as a relevent game, and I think if you look across the industry, the amount of games like it that there have been or come and gone, and here’s 76 still there with big numbers and doing well.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of energy in the studio.</p>



<p>Look, people love it. The team on it, led by Jon Rush, they just do a fantastic, fantastic job, and you see the roadmap that’s planned for the game, and it gets even better.</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>Todd Howard also admitted that they designed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fallout-76/" id="438">Fallout 76</a> as a multiplayer title despite knowing that it wouldn’t be ‘for everyone’. That was always an expectation, given how Fallout was a single-player game for twenty years before Fallout 76 landed on the market.</p>



<p>He also stressed that more people need to recognize the work they’re putting into Fallout 76. It’s kind of a sticking point because everyone just keeps crying out for Fallout 5, which is <strong>many years away</strong> from even being revealed. But at the same time, Bethesda Game Studios has this phenomenal MMORPG that they’re keeping updated with reams of <strong>free content drops</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[WWE 2K26 MyRise Details Revealed by Developer]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-myrise-details-revealed-by-developer/</link>
            <guid>1439830</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a> developer is providing new details on this year’s MyRise mode.</p>



<p>WWE 2K26 will be released in about 3 weeks, on March 13. One of the key game modes every year is MyRise. This is the professional wrestling take on NBA 2K’s MyCareer. Every year, players take their created wrestlers on a journey to the top of WWE, with each year bringing a new storyline to the squared circle.</p>







<h2>Details on WWE 2K26 MyRise Are Starting to Be Revealed</h2>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/wwe-2k26-myrise-lead-talks-this-years-campaign-and-why-fan-favorite-jordynne-grace-is-taking-on-the-role-of-a-villain-we-work-so-far-ahead-from-wwe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TechRadar Gaming</a>, WWE 2K26’s MyRise lead narrative designer, Sean Conaway, shared details of this year’s storyline, dubbed “The Comeback.” This year, the bones of the campaign mode remain the same regardless of whether you choose to play as a male or female WWE Superstar. In this year’s game, you play as a superstar returning to WWE after a long hiatus, something that has become more common on actual WWE television in recent years.</p>



<p>Your character, known as “The Archetype,” will run afoul of Paul Heyman. Paul Heyman’s main client in the campaign will either be Bron Breakker or Jordynne Grace, depending on the gender you choose for your character. Heyman and Breakker are currently paired on WWE television, but Conway says 2K had the idea to align them before WWE did, as game development takes considerable time.</p>



<p>“We work so far ahead from WWE that we kind of have to look in our crystal balls and try to forecast as best as we can who we think is going to be hot a year from now,” he said.</p>



<p>As for the decision to turn Grace into a villain, something she has yet to portray on WWE television, it was noted that the team at 2K sees a lot of potential in Grace, and that’s why they chose her for the role.</p>







<h2 id="h-don-t-expect-the-story-to-play-out-completely-the-same-depending-on-the-main-villain">Don’t Expect the Story to Play Out Completely the Same Depending on the Main Villain</h2>



<p>While the decision was made not to create two different stories and allow players to craft “The Archetype” as either a man or a woman, it is noted that the decision you make and the division you’re playing through will have substantial differences from its counterpart.</p>



<p>Also, with regard to some players feeling fatigued after being forced to play the WWE 2K25 MyRise multiple times in order to unlock the most content, Conway acknowledged that they were aware of the fatigue and noted it wouldn’t be like that this year.</p>



<p>Speaking of unlockables, learn how the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-dev-confident-fans-will-like-new-ringside-pass/" id="175166">Ringside Pass system</a> shakes up unlockables in WWE 2K26.</p>

Your job is to explore the world to reunite with your comrades and rebuild what’s been lost. As you do so, you’ll forge new alliances and discover even more dangerous threats looming over the land.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The journey takes you through all sorts of environments, from plains to deserts to mountains. You can ride mounts ranging from horses to wolves and dragons.

It calls Crimson Desert “an open-world action-adventure game.” That’s because it doesn’t have character leveling or experience points. You do expand your capabilities, but you do so by finding items in the open world, like in an action-adventure game like Zelda or a Metroid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on the trailers, it does look like a hodgepodge of popular game elements.

The system will combine fast-paced, narrative-driven mechanics, with philosophical depth. A fitting mix, given the source material.</p><p>The influence Ghost in the Shell has had on cyberpunk sci-fi cannot be understated. The manga pushed the visual identity of cyberpunk dystopias with it s juxtaposition of urban decay and futuristic technology. It explored ideas of transhumanism and identity in a world where consciousness can be downloaded.</p><p><em>Ghost in the Shell's </em>influence is so ubiquitous, from aesthetics to themes, it can be found everywhere. From feature films like <em>The Matrix</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em> to games like Mike Pondsmith's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/cyberpunk-red-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Cyberpunk </em>TTRPG</a> or the iconic immersive sim, <em>Deus Ex</em>.</p><blockquote><p>“We’re absolutely thrilled to be bringing The Ghost in the Shell to the world of tabletop roleplaying” said Ronnie Renton, CEO of Mantic Games. “This is one of the most iconic and influential science fiction worlds ever created, and we’re honoured to be entrusted with the official license. Alessio and Zak have worked tirelessly to ensure every story told at the table feels true to the original manga, allowing players to live, think, and fight in the world of Major Kusanagi and the iconic Section 9.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> RPG is a departure from Mantic Games' past history of licensed work. Most of the licensed games they have produced are miniature-based tactical experiences like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/halo-flashpoint-war-games-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Halo: Flashpoint</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/walking-dead-all-out-war-comes-to-end" rel="nofollow"><em>The Walking Dead: All Out War</em></a>. That experience will undoubtedly be useful given the source material's history of gunfights and mech battles.</p><p>The <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> RPG is set to come out in Summer 2026.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 is finally here, and the twisted story of murderous toys continues. However, before it arrived, plenty of fans were theorising that this could be the final Chapter in the series, with a natural conclusion seemingly drawing near. </p>







<p>Well, now that the game is in the hands of the masses, the answer is pretty clear, and it seems like the fanbase is pretty divided on the outcome. If you’re wondering whether <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime</a> will continue after Chapter 5, then you’re in the right place, as Insider Gaming has it all figured out.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-chapter-5-of-poppy-playtime-the-final-chapter">Is Chapter 5 Of Poppy Playtime The Final Chapter?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s not over yet. Image by Mob Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 is not the final chapter. Judging by the ending of Chapter 5, a sixth chapter is all but guaranteed.</strong></p>



<p>Without spoiling the ending, which raises even more questions, it’s clear that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mob-entertainment/" id="3160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mob Entertainment</a> aren’t quite ready to cut the cord and wrap up Poppy Playtime just yet.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>For fans of the franchise, this is great news, as that means there is bound to be even more monstrous cuddly toys to evade and mysteries to uncover. But it also raises a new question: When will Chapter 6 be released? </p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-poppy-playtime-chapter-6-release">When Will Poppy Playtime Chapter 6 Release? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t let him catch you! Image by Mob Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Although it may be obvious that Poppy Playtime Chapter 6 is a given, no official confirmation of its existence has been made by Mob Entertainment. Therefore, there’s no official release date to share. </strong></p>



<p>However, chapters for Poppy Playtime have released fairly regularly, with a new one dropping pretty much every year since the franchise began back in 2021. </p>



<ul>

</ul>







<p>With that in mind, it’s highly likely that Chapter 6 will be released sometime in 2027, though that’s purely speculation. The franchise missed a year of content back in 2023, so it’s not a guarantee, but that would imply that it’d arrive by 2028 at the absolute latest.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[After Working 80-Hour Weeks For Eight Years, Blue Prince Creator Says Next Game Probably Won't Be Quite As Ambitious]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-final-update-tonda-ros-interview/</link>
            <guid>1439797</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><em>Blue Prince</em>, as outlined by our own Chris Person in <a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-impressions-review/"><u>fittingly meticulous detail</u></a>, is a marvel. It’s also a game whose ending has <a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-real-ending/"><u>proven elusive</u></a> both structurally and thematically. But there is a light at the end of the epically lengthy tunnel – at least for creator Tonda Ros.&nbsp;</p><p>When I asked Ros at DICE in Las Vegas last week if <em>Blue Prince</em>’s brain-pulverizing labyrinth contained any remaining secrets, he reacted with a coy smile.</p><p>“[Players] have certainly mined it pretty well,” he told Aftermath. “Now, is that well enough? I’m gonna leave that for future generations to answer.”</p><p>But <em>Blue Prince</em> will get one last major update before Ros gracefully bows out.</p><p>“There is a little bit still coming that I’m working on – some final touches on the game before I button it up and move on to more projects,” he said. “So even if the people mining [for more secrets] currently turn up empty handed, there will at least be something on the horizon that they can look forward to.”</p><p>This is not to say that Ros feels like he asked players to solve a puzzle sans all the pieces at launch. His goal was to release something that felt complete in a sense that harked back to bygone days; updates, in his mind, are about polish and clarity.</p><p>"I really wanted to get it all in for launch, and I feel like that was my ultimate desire, because I really like the old-school games where they put it out there, and that's the game,” he said. “It's definitive from day one. It's on a disc, and it's timeless. Obviously we have a big temptation in the modern world: You can continually update and tinker with your things, and oftentimes maybe tinker too much, and you'll start dividing your audience. So I really tried my hardest, but it's my first game. Ultimately, it wasn't worth the crunch. ... [I decided to] focus on bugs and catch up on my own time afterwards. But it's gonna be one big final update, and then it's gonna be final forever."</p><p><em>Blue Prince</em>’s last update, Ros said, will not stray from the game’s current path; the plan is just to refine what’s already there.</p><p>"Nothing I'm going to do will fundamentally change any of the narrative according to the structure,” said Ros. “It's mostly just polish details. There'll be a couple more cinematics because I didn't have time to do all the cinematics I planned. I really want to put everything I wanted into the game. ... So I'm gonna finish my vision on the cinematics, and that'll provide more details for people. But fundamentally, I made sure from day one that all the puzzles were in the game – all the narrative and overall structure."</p><p>There’s a reason Ros wasn’t able to include absolutely everything he’d mapped out in <em>Blue Prince</em>’s release version: He was already working himself to the bone.</p><p>"I was working, I think, 80 hours a week for eight years straight," he said.</p><p>Whatever comes after, he added, will necessarily dial things back at least<em> a bit</em> in terms of ambition.</p><p>"<em>Blue Prince</em> will likely be the most ambitious game I ever make, because I don't think I physically can do this again,” Ros said. “It was an incredibly long journey, so it might take as much time [to make my next game], but I certainly won't be working as hard. ... That's just not sustainable now. It's a young man's game."</p><p>Still, Ros, a filmmaker who decided to devote eight years of his life to his first major video game project, hasn’t burnt himself out on games yet.&nbsp;</p><p>“The recognition [<em>Blue Prince</em> has received] certainly helps the decision, but I think I did fall in love with game development,” said Ros, who had just received the DICE game design and independent game awards. “I come from a filmmaking background, but game development just suits me really well. It’s fun to take your time and to be able to fulfill your vision without the stress of running a set. I just kind of love it right now, so I’ll continue doing it as long as I find it enjoyable.”</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-real-ending/"><div><p>Does Blue Prince Never End? - Aftermath</p><p>There is so much more to Blue Prince than its stated goal.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Publisher <strong>CI Games</strong> and developer <strong>Hexworks</strong> have released the minimum and recommended PC system requirements for <strong>Lords of the Fallen 2</strong>, the sequel to 2023's Soulslike game. </p>



<p>The specs are listed <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-58d924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the game's Epic Games Store page</a> and match the previous game's CPU and RAM requirements. However, <strong>the GPU requirements have increased</strong>: from Lords of the Fallen's GTX 1060/RX 590 and RTX 2080/RX 6700 to Lords of the Fallen 2's RTX 2060/RX 5700 and RTX 3080/RX 6800 XT. As a reminder, the game is powered by <strong>Epic's Unreal Engine 5</strong>, just like the previous installment.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Spec</th><th>Minimum</th><th>Recommended</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 11</td><td>Windows 11</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>Intel i5-8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</td><td>Intel i7-8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 3600</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>12 GB RAM</td><td>16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>NVIDIA RTX 2060 / AMD Radeon RX 5700</td><td>NVIDIA RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Login Required</strong></td><td>Epic ID</td><td>Epic ID</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Audio Language</strong></td><td>English</td><td>English</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Text Languages</strong></td><td>English, French, German, Italian, Spanish (Spain), Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Japanese, Polish, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Russian</td><td>English, French, German, Italian, Spanish (Spain), Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Japanese, Polish, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Russian</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-2026-egs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced in June 2024</a> as an <strong>Epic Games Store exclusive</strong> for PC. However, earlier this week, CI Games CEO <strong>Marek Tyminski</strong> <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/2023059329600119256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemed to tease that this could change</a>, <strong>suggesting a Steam launch on day one</strong>.</p>



<p>We'll see. On another note, this afternoon, Ryan Hill (Creative Strategist at CI Games) noted that the reception to <a href="https://wccftech.com/bolder-braver-bloodier-ci-games-digs-into-lords-of-the-fallen-2-combat-in-new-developer-deep-dive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last week's gameplay deep dive</a> has been "<strong>incredible</strong>".</p>



<p><em>I'm seeing the age-old 'blame the customer' rhetoric popping up again in the games industry. No gamer wants to waste time, money or effort, just to be disappointed by a gameplay experience. It is nearly always the game at fault.</em></p>



<p><em>It would have been very easy for us to 'blame the customer' in 2023 when Lords of the Fallen launched. Instead, we took it on the chin, rolled our sleeves up, and released 70+ updates. Three years later, and we've just revealed the first alpha footage of Lords of the Fallen 2. And the response has been incredible. We listened, we acted. And guess what? It worked. But we're far from done yet. Gamers want good games. End of.</em></p>



<p>Lords of the Fallen 2 will be released this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Global Video Game Content Sales Grew to $195.6B in 2025 While Private Funding Took a Massive Dip]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/global-video-game-content-sales-grew-to-195-6b-in-2025-while-private-funding-took-a-massive-dip/</link>
            <guid>1439782</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The new <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/presentation-the-state-of-video-gaming-in-2026"><strong>State of Video Gaming 2026 Report</strong> </a>from <strong>Matthew Ball</strong>, chief executive officer at <strong>Epyllion,</strong> is now available, and as usual, there are more than a few solid insights and takeaways to make note of. Like how software sales for the global video game market in 2025 rose by <strong>5.3%</strong> to a staggering <strong>$195.6 billion</strong>, but at the same time, funding from private investors hit another major dip, dropping by <strong>55%.</strong></p>



<p>Console software sales also hit an all-time high, recovering from the post-COVID slump to hit <strong>$41.6 billion</strong> in spending, a <strong>2.3% increase</strong> compared to the highs of the 2020 pandemic. That said, the majority of that spending has gone to <strong>platform services</strong>, which would include things like <strong>PlayStation Plus,</strong> <strong>Xbox Game Pass</strong> and <strong>Nintendo Switch Online</strong>. </p>



<p>Actual game sales and transactions were down nearly <strong>11%</strong> compared to last year, which is a tangible example of why subscription services have become so important for platform holders. That's why, while the entire industry faces concerns about hardware sales, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-memory-shortages-ps5-ps5-pro/">Sony in particular is less concerned</a> due to its software revenue. It's also why the company plans <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increases-monetizing-install-base/">to lean more on its current install base,</a> and why we could likely see a price increase on PS Plus if the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dram-nand-shortages-will-extend-beyond-2030-warns-phison-ceo/">memory crisis continues to worsen</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, when comparing PC gaming to console gaming, PC gaming not only didn't have to endure a post-COVID slump, but PC content sales have grown by <strong>30% since 2020</strong>.</p>



<p>It's also worth noting that a huge chunk of that spending and growth comes from players in China, who account for <strong>20% of global player spending.</strong> But even without factoring in the spending that comes from China, the PC market still sits above the console market growth by a solid <strong>$6.7 billion</strong>.</p>



<p>The lack of investment coming into the industry, however, continues to have a major impact on the industry. Outside of some of the biggest companies, like when <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-boss-christoph-hartmann-departs-amidst-mass-16000-layoff/">Amazon lays off thousands of employees at once</a>, layoffs like what we see from studios like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-three-fields-entertainment-staff-at-risk-layoffs/">Three Fields Entertainment</a></strong> don't just come from disappointing game sales. A lack of private investment means that smaller teams like Three Fields can't survive if their projects aren't huge hits.</p>



<p>Another side-effect of this that's noted in the report is that, where possible, studios will look to outsource more of the development process to try and keep internal costs down. And while PC gaming continues to outpace console gaming, one platform that is growing, which Ball also believes will become one of the industry's biggest factors, is <strong>Roblox</strong>.</p>



<p>The platform was one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/top-five-played-games-in-us-2025-playstation-xbox-the-same-as-2024/">top-played games in 2024 and 2025</a>, and reached <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sets-record-concurrent-users-gaming-platform/">a staggering <strong>47.3 million concurrent users</strong></a> in August 2025. That said, as big as Roblox is, it'll be interesting to see how much the platform continues to be impacted <a href="https://wccftech.com/texas-attorney-general-sues-roblox-claims-it-puts-pedophiles-and-profits-over-safety-of-children/">by the legal efforts against the company</a>, as it has earned a reputation for a lax approach to child safety on the platform. Now, at least, the company is trying to <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-will-require-age-verification-with-facial-recognition-to-unlock-chat/">improve its ability to protect children on the platform</a>.</p>
