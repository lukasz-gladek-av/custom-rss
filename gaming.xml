		<p>A The Horizon TV show was revealed by Sony in an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/27/gran-turismo-god-of-war-and-horizon-tv-shows-announced-by-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investor briefing </a>in April 2022 and later on it was revealed that the show would be heading to Netflix. However,&nbsp; Steve Blackman, the showrunner for The Umbrella Academy and the Horizon series, was accused of “toxic, bullying, manipulative, and retaliatory behaviour”, claims that he denied, and the Horizon series was cancelled.</p>
<p>In January this year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/helldivers-and-horizon-zero-dawn-movies-announced-by-sony/">Sony announced that a movie based</a> on the franchise was in the works at Columbia, the studio that made the Uncharted and Gran Turismo movies</p>


<p>Thanks to documents released as part of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/11/all-similarities-between-light-of-motiram-and-horizon-have-been-wiped-from-steam/">Sony’s ongoing battle with Tencent over Light of Motiram</a>, we now know that a Horizon movie is moving forward and could be on the big screens by 2027.&nbsp; The document reveals that Asad Qizilbash, head of PlayStation Productions has stated that they already have a script and are looking for a director, with filming taking place next year.</p>
<p>A Horizon television show always seemed implausible as almost everything would have to be CGI, including the many robot creatures, and that would be very expensive. A movie will have a bigger budget and can focus on a smaller part of the Horizon mythology.&nbsp; Personally, I would like a story set right at the start of the mythology as the human race races to save itself, but ultimately becomes food for the self-replicating robots they created.</p>
<p>Sony also has a Helldivers movie on the cards, but no details have been revealed for that project.&nbsp; A sequel to the Uncharted movie was announced in 2024 and in December of that year producer Charles Roven said that a script was in place.</p>

<p>The issue seems to be the rather busy Tom Holland who spent this year filming Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey and is currently zipping around in spandex filming Spider-Man: Brand New Day.&nbsp; After that, he’s got American Speed on schedule, will Uncharted film after that?</p>

			<p>NetEase has announced that the popular free-to-play team-based 6v6 third-person online action game Marvel Rivals is getting its first PvE mode on October 23. It will be inspired by Marvel Zombies, the four-episode adult animated television miniseries released on September 24 via Disney+.</p>



<p>The announcement came with a brief video where Marvel Games Executive Producer Danny Koo explained:</p>



<p><em>In this Marvel Zombies inspired mode, you get to play as Thor, Blade, Magik, Jeff the Land Shark, and The Punisher, taking on endless waves of zombies. You'll have to survive the Horde, go toe-to-toe with zombie Namor and the Queen of the Dead as bosses and fight to save the world from getting totally zombified. We have also given each hero some unique abilities. Charge through the hordes as Jeff, slice and dice with Blade's bouncing Moon Blades, shock zombies with Thor in his persistent Awakened state. Or go berserk as Magik in her unlimited Darkchild form. Showcase your epic combat skills against the zombie swarms and tough bosses.</em></p>

<p>More details are yet to come, such as when this limited-time event will end.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-4-5-launches-next-week-daredevil-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is currently up to its Season 4.5 'Heart of the Dragon'</a>, which launched last week and delivered the long-requested cross-platform progression feature. Moreover, it introduced Daredevil as the 43rd playable character. In the game, Daredevil is a combo-oriented Duelist (the archetype for high-damage characters) with plenty of mobility. The character also has a team-up ability with The Punisher.</p>

			<p>Thanks to Sony and PlayStation's <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-calls-tencent-defence-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram-nonsense/">lawsuit against Tencent over Horizon knock-off, Light of Motiram</a>, we have an update for the previously confirmed Horizon Zero Dawn movie that's in the works. First reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-filming-release/">The Game Post</a>, the movie is set to start filming sometime in 2026, and is intended to be out in theatres the following year, in 2027.</p>



<p>The confirmation came as part of the sworn declaration from Asad Qizilbash, head of PlayStation Productions, the branch Sony opened specifically for its film and TV collaborations and adaptations. According to Qizilbash, there's already a script in place, and PlayStation Productions is currently looking for a director.</p>



<p>"<em>We are in development for a film based on Horizon in partnership with Columbia Pictures</em>. <em>We already have a working script and are actively searching for a director, with the goal of shooting the picture in 2026 and releasing it in 2027. The live-action film follows the recent collaborations between Columbia Pictures and PlayStation Productions on the 2022 film Uncharted and the 2023 film Gran Turismo</em>," Qizilbash writes in his declaration, per The Game Post.</p>



<p>Initially, PlayStation's adaptation of Horizon was intended to be a TV series produced in collaboration with Netflix, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstations-horizon-zero-dawn-tv-show-adaptation-will-now-be-a-movie-adaptation-instead/">though those plans were scrapped this past April</a> in favour of making a movie instead. Since the film still doesn't have a director attached to it, we're still a ways out from hearing about any casting decisions or ideas around what the film will cover.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see who PlayStation Productions is able to find to direct, and then where the search for who will play Aloy ends up.</p>

              <p>We all have our own sets of small inconveniences that make us irrationally angry. Mine is spotty internet, especially when its my own home. Occasionally when I’m in the bathroom, my router will just decide all by itself to cut its range in half, and then I’m left there caught in loop or refreshing before I give up and resort to reading the back of a shampoo bottle like it’s the dark ages.

Upgrade to a Wi-Fi mesh network to achieve total coverage around every corner. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4837/">Amazon has the TP-Link Deco S4 mesh Wi-Fi system on sale right now.

You can have your smart TV, Alexa, toaster, laptops, Nintendo Switches, and every phone in the family on the Wi-Fi plus a ton of extra tech without any hogging up the speeds and slowing down the other devices.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review.1327759/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like the thought of becoming an actual vampire, there are some things I really like about Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2, and some I really don't care for. Developer The Chinese Room has undeniably done a remarkable job breaking out of its typically slow-paced and linear realm to give us a streetlight-soaked, open world Seattle that's enjoyable to explore, with a side of positively exquisite writing and voice acting. But combat never rises much above the level of being merely pretty good, and a lack of payoff for both mechanical and story choices hold this nocturnal sojourn back from greatness.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The slice of Seattle that serves as a hub for Bloodlines 2's searching, stalking, and politicking is impressive to behold, though don't expect GTA scale here. At around five by five blocks with most buildings climbable and rooftops fully navigable, there’s quite a bit more room to prowl than in Bloodlines 1's Santa Monica, with several distinct and memorable areas from the charming Pioneer Square to the lantern-lit Chinatown. Moving around it by clamoring, leaping, and gliding is some of the most fun I had.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is also where your semi-customizable elder, Phyre, will hunt their prey, in the form of hapless humans who can be provoked, scared, or seduced depending on your hunting style. I appreciate that feeding is a major, unavoidable part of the nightly routine, but I think it could have been done better in a couple ways. For one, you only need to feed to recharge your combat powers. In the tabletop game, you get thirsty upon waking up every night, and in Bloodlines 1, your blood pool would steadily drop over time. I don't think this needs to be a hardcore survival game, but something like that would have helped sell that vampires need blood like we need food and water, adding a sense of desperation, because right now it’s just something you need to top up before going into battle.<br>For another, there just isn't enough variety in the NPC models and voices to keep me fooled across the 30-plus hours my first playthrough took. I probably fed on one specific woman wearing the same exact hat at least a couple dozen times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You are required to maintain the Masquerade while at street level, meaning no using your powers or feeding in front of normies, which is appropriate. You can't have a Vampire: The Masquerade game without, well, the Masquerade. But I did find it was a bit too easy to shake off any suspicion if I messed up.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Bloodlines 2 can feel like a generic vampire game rather than a <em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em> game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The key component of Vampire: The Masquerade lore that is almost completely missing (outside of one cutscene that happens no matter what you do) is The Beast, the dark and ravenous voice inside each vampire that drives them to do terrible things and can provoke an uncontrollable state called Frenzy. The absolute best mechanic in the 5th Edition of the Vampire: The Masquerade tabletop game, upon which Bloodines 2 is based, is an increasing hunger track that makes your character more likely to behave in a monstrous or unpredictable manner the longer they've gone without feeding. I get that people don't usually like losing control of their character. But this is so crucial to the vampire fantasy that its absence is an almost fatal flaw. It's the one choice that really consistently made me feel like I was playing some generic vampire game, not a <em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em> game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At least the combat is challenging, pulse-pounding, and overall pretty decent. It can get a little disorienting, and I really wish there was more of a "hard" lock-on ability given it's all in third-person and both you and your opponents are constantly zipping around at high speeds. But there are some exciting nuances to master like the various kicks, parries, and telekinetic grabs. At least for a melee build, it could be really exhilarating once I got the hang of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stealth is satisfying and rewarding as well, though it's limited in certain segments like boss fights in a way that can come across as punishing you for deciding to focus on it. Some of the more esoteric fighting styles like Tremere Blood Sorcery are absolutely sick nasty amazing the first few times you pull them off – boiling someone's blood from the inside is every bit as bombastically brutal as you'd imagine – but can come to seem like more of a gimmick than a playstyle after a while. Overall, though, the frantic and action-packed sequences that combined my abilities to use the environment, my movement powers, and even my enemies against each other were some of the high points of Bloodlines 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where it falls down the most, unfortunately, is as an RPG. You are playing as an elder vampire, so it's not exactly a typical zero-to-hero story. But just to give a representative example, the damage your melee attacks do at the very beginning is exactly the same as it will be in the final boss fight. You awaken new powers called Disciplines, like being able to turn invisible or smooch an enemy to turn them to your side, but you'll get all of them for your chosen clan within the first eight hours or so, after which point anything else is mostly a sidegrade. You can upgrade your health track by finding hidden symbols painted in blood across Seattle, but overall there isn't much of a sense of power progression throughout most of the campaign.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The action-packed sequences that combined my abilities were high points.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is further limited by the fact that you can only equip four Disciplines at a time, and only one from each category – so, for example, you can't mix and match two different clans' movement abilities to create your own hyper-mobile playstyle. I don't see the wisdom in these restrictions at all. I also don't really enjoy that each Discipline can only be used once in battle before having to feed again, since they each have their own separate pool of power points, instead of having them draw from a common pool of stored blood that I could spend however I like. Sometimes restrictions are good. I just don't think any of these ones are. I'm a dang vampire. Just let me do what I want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I did really appreciate the options Phyre has for visual customization. Each clan has four different outfits to unlock from the punk rock streetwear of the Brujah to the sharp business attire of the Ventrue. NPCs will actually react differently to you based on what you're wearing, such as being easier to seduce if you show a little more skin. That is honestly amazing. But what we're missing is a weapon slot, and that is definitely not amazing. I get that Phyre is an elder and a living weapon herself. She can telekinetically use a gun as a sort of one-off combat consumable, or throw a fire extinguisher across the room. But melee is always a hand-to-hand affair. And again, this is just cramping my style from a character customization angle. Do I need weapons to kill these chumps? Nah. But a vampire with a trenchcoat and dual pistols or a sweet-ass katana is just too cool and iconic to not allow in your vampire RPG. It's part of character creation and self-expression in the tabletop game. What are we doing here?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story about solving a series of dramatic murders and navigating court politics is overall extremely well-written and voiced by a fantastic cast, from the sarcastic Nosferatu Tolly to the self-indulgent queen of seattle herself, Lou Graham. It's so good, in fact, that for the last few hours, I was ready to throw the windows open and start yelling into the night that everyone needed to experience this.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Top 10 Open World RPGs</h3><p>The best open world RPGs to play in 2025</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But then it absolutely broke my cold, dead heart. <strong>I'll do my best to avoid spoilers here, but you can skip ahead to the verdict if you're really sensitive to that kind of thing</strong>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Basically, every interesting decision I made throughout the entire chronicle was unceremoniously chewed up and spit onto the pavement before being crushed under the uncaring bootheel of anticlimax. All of the machinations I had put into motion, the allies I had made, the chess pieces I had manipulated, all of the <em>awesome vampire elder shit </em>I had been vibrating about in the magnificently inspired lead up to the finale… were resolved in a 30-second epilogue voice-over that completely denied me the real showdown I had been dreaming of all this time. I was devastated. This might be worse than the original ending of Mass Effect 3. It's like they ripped out the last chapter of the book and burned it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also the fact that you play maybe about a third of the story through the eyes of the Malkavian film noir detective Fabien, who somehow ended up in Phyre's head. And I love Fabien. I really do. He made me cry at one point. His segments are just as skillfully penned, and give you an interesting look into the history of Seattle. But his mind-altering Malkavian powers, like getting someone to recognize you as a different person or reading their surface thoughts? Cool idea, but every time you are allowed to use them, it is for a railroaded story beat. There is never a point at which they can be combined or deployed in a clever way that would make me feel like <em>I </em>solved the case, which is another huge wasted opportunity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the night, this is a story that seems almost annoyed by the fact that it has to offer you any kind of choice at all.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-gets-free-test-for-everyone-this-weekend-on-all-platforms/1100-6535422/" data-ref-id="1100-6535422">announced previously</a>, the Arc Raiders free test allows people to try the Dam Battleground map and experience the progression, crafting, and quest systems. For Embark Studios, the test is being undertaken to help the studio prepare its servers for launch.</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone who takes part in the test will get the Server Slammer backpack cosmetic reward when the full game launches on October 30. Progress from the test does not carry forward to the full launch.</p><p>Embark Studios was founded by a team of industry veterans, including former longtime EA and Battlefield executive Patrick Soderlund. Arc Raiders, a $40 game, is coming to market just after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-already-doing-huge-numbers-on-steam/1100-6535398/" data-ref-id="1100-6535398">EA's Battlefield 6 launched on October 10 and had a huge debut.</a></p><p>Arc Raiders is set in the future and has players going underground to take shelter from "Arc" robots. Players venture out into the land above ground to collect resources and fight. Take a look at the trailer above to get a closer look at Arc Raiders.</p><p>Following Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders, the shooter space gets another jolt in November when Activision's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches.</a></p>

                <p>Next year marks the 25th anniversary of Halo, and it's been apparent for some time that there's a game on the horizon.

She explains that doesn't mean shelving major productions and believes there is still plenty of value (both creatively and financially) in greenlighting new entires in truly blockbuster franchises like Call of Duty and God of War because the "payoff is potentially really large."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, she feels those companies with the deepest pockets need to be investing more in smaller titles. "I do also think there is an opportunity for those big players to also look to diversify into double-A and single-A, and then perhaps indie as well right? And what size, shape, or form does that take? I don't know [...] but I think we need to look beyond the knee-jerk reaction of the pandemic and post-pandemic couple of years and really think about who do we want to be? What kind of product do we want to put out? We need to plot out intentionally how we're going to get there," she continues.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/2k-hires-former-apex-legends-head-of-production-to-lead-31st-union" target="_self" data-discover="true">2K hires former Apex Legends head of production to lead 31st Union</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;I inherently believe in the power of creativity and innovation in our industry&quot;">"I inherently believe in the power of creativity and innovation in our industry"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Referring to recent releases such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Split Fiction</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Morgan Juinio believes there is evidently an appetite and appreciation for titles that eschew big-budget conventions such as life-consuming playtimes and mammoth production cycles. Case in point: at GDC this year we learned that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-it-s-okay-to-make-a-small-game-astro-bot-director-nicolas-doucet-says-tiny-ideas-contain-huge-potential">only in development for around three-and-a-half years</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Notably, she also believes players are drawn to those titles because they often showcase more innovation than their comparatively pricey counterparts. "What I believe is that we have to make great video games," she adds. "It doesn't matter what shape. I think gamers right now are a little bit desensitized to beautiful graphics and size and scale and scope. It's almost a given, right? If a game isn't fun, it doesn't matter hows pretty it is. If a game isn't engaging or delivering some hook, then it's not going to connect with players."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-metroid-dread-developer-mercurysteamworks-accused-of-retaliation-and-forced-crunch" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: Metroid Dread developer MercurySteamworks accused of retaliation and forced crunch</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, Morgan Juinio believes the industry will find a way through the current storm because anybody who chooses to spend their life making video games simply will not accept the current status quo. "I am an eternal glass-half-full type thinker and I think the doom-and-gloom may continue," says Morgan, who understands why the ongoing wave of mass layoffs and investments from questionable entities such as the Saudi-backed Public Investment Fund are raising alarm bells.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She also, however, believes there is room for hope.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think the very nature of who we are, as developers and creators, won't allow it to stay doom and gloom. They won't accept that state of the world," she says. "Does that mean, though, that we're going to go back to the types of games that came out five years ago or during the pre-pandemic times? No. I think it's going to be something new. We don't know yet what it is, but I inherently believe in the power of creativity and innovation in our industry. And I believe that even if the powers that be structurally change or completely get upended, there is still a demand out there for great games."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-employees-and-cwa-slam-saudi-led-ea-buyout-call-for-regulatory-scrutiny" target="_self" data-discover="true">EA employees and UVW-CWA slam Saudi-led EA buyout, call for regulatory scrutiny</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer is attending Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show 2025 as a media partner, with flights and accommodation being covered by event organizers.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> players are downright infatuated with one of the more bizarre Mega Evolutions tucked away in the later portion of the game. A Mega Evolution that is making strides in general memery and ridiculous-factor.</p>

<p>That Mega Evolution is of course Mega Starmie, which in Pokémon Legends: Z-A has been given a pair of pointy legs it uses to stroll around the place. It's frankly a silly design, one that many players can't help but scratch their heads at. You can see it for yourself below, but it's literally just Starmie with big purple legs.</p>
<div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>

<p>With these legs Mega Starmie has been running around in a peculiar fashion, and that's about it. They don't get any extra gems or a <em>third</em> spinning star on their back. Nope, just legs. It is both incredibly underwhelming and a masterclass in how doing less can sometimes mean doing more. These legs are better eye catchers than the other bells and whistles Pokémon Legends: Z-A has slapped on other Mega Evolutions.</p><p>The reaction to these legs has been coming in droves from members of the Pokémon community, who have wasted no time creating art of Starmie's two strong legs. Some believe Starmie's new form to be menacing, having them sprint directly at the viewer with malicious intent.</p>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>

<p>Others, obviously, find Mega Starmie's legs awesome. Some see it as a display of strength, viewing Starmie's legs as bulky pylons on which Mega Starmie asserts its dominance.</p>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>

<p>Others see them as appealing in an altogether different way. As shown below, with user Steve Ly on Twitter who interprets Starmie's new legs as sexy boots, and recreating Patrick Star's provocative dance from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCPDVVLUw-4">The Spongebob Squarepants movie's "I'm a Goofy Goober" song</a>.</p>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>

<p>Others, I believe with justice in their hearts, feel sorry for Mega Starmie and all the ridicule they have been exposed to. To them, Starmie going out there and expressing themselves was a moment of celebration. The online reaction, a moment of tragedy for the starfish.</p>
<div>

<p>Look, whether you are amused, inspired, aroused, or emotionally attached to Mega Starmie's new legs, there's no debate that Starmie has stolen the show in terms of Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Evolutions. All it took was two legs and a funny run. Perhaps in creating such discussion, Mega Starmie's new look has proven itself a masterpiece in virality, and ultimately a success when it comes to taking a beloved Pokémon to new heights. Literally, new heights.</p>
<p>It also turns out Mega Starmie might poop too, yet another nugget of joy from Pokémon Legends: Z-A. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-pokemon-do-poop-legends-z-a-confirms-and-have-tummy-troubles-too">If you want to read more about that, you can of course do so on Eurogamer</a>.</p>

		<p>Sports Interactive has announced that it has, for the first time, signed a deal with football’s governing body FIFA, and this will have an impact on international management in Football Manager 26 and beyond. This includes adding the FIFA World Cup, FIFA Women’s World Cup and FIFA Club World Cup to the game at a later date as part of a international management content update due next year.</p>
<p>Sports Interactive Studio Director Miles Jacobson said, <em>“Revealing this partnership with FIFA is an incredibly historic moment for the studio.Heading into a World Cup year, revamping International Management and making it a much more feature-rich module for our players was important. To be able to do that with the support of FIFA with an official licence, giving us the tournament broadcast graphics and tournament kits in-game, is a real honour and something we’re delighted our fans will be able to experience next year. And this is just the start of our relationship – stay tuned for more to come in 2026 and beyond.”</em></p>


<p>This partnership means in Football Manager 26 all of the teams taking part in the 2026 World Cup will have their official kits in the game. Further details are to follow at a later date about what else this partnership and the international management update will bring when it launches in 2026. Football Manager 26 is due to release on November 4th.</p>

<p>Switch 2 used String Shot!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has finally arrived on Switch and Switch 2, but with all the marketing focused on the latter edition, you may well be wondering how TPC's latest fares on Nintendo's old hardware.</p>
<p>Well, the wonderful Felix Sanchez is here to demonstrate. In the above side-by-side comparison video, you can get a glimpse at how Legends: Z-A runs on both Switch 1 and Switch 2, showcasing standard gameplay, cutscenes and load times.</p>
<p>As you'll see, the Switch 2 implements many of the improvements that we'd expect. The 60fps boost is a welcome sight compared to the last gen's 30, resolution and texturing are vastly improved, and a lot of the load times have moved in the right direction — though not <em>all</em> of them, as the video shows.</p>
<p>That said, the Switch 1 side of things looks... surprisingly <em>fine</em>. It's certainly a lot choppier and slower than the Switch 2 edition (as you'd expect), but at least it looks reasonably stable. It's no <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">TOTK</a>, of course, but nobody was really anticipating that, were they?</p>

            <p>The Galaxies Showcase games show – which, if you missed the Spring edition, is a game reveal showcase with more of an indie/lower-budget focus – is back next Thursday, October 23rd.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Full disclosure: RPS, along with fellow Gamer Networkers Eurogamer and VG247, have been deemed 'Galaxies media partners', which I understand to basically mean you can watch the livestream on the homepage. Also full disclosure, nobody said I <em>couldn’t </em>spend this post being hyperfixated on confirmed Galaxies-featured game and wonderfully batshit train stuntfest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/denshattack">Denshattack</a>, my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/at-a-largely-humourless-gamescom-train-kickflipper-denshattack-was-a-golden-streak-of-joy">personal most-craved</a> unreleased creative work currently in existence. Denshattack! It’s got what kickflipping rail conductors crave. Galaxies will also show off some non-Denshattack games, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>, old-timey cartoon FPS Mouse: PI For Hire, band management sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockbeasts-is-about-managing-an-animal-band-in-a-bojack-style-world-but-itll-need-to-do-more-than-horse-around">Rockbeasts</a>, and boomer shooter sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2-is-coming-2026-but-theres-a-typing-of-the-dead-esque-spinoff-you-can-play-for-free-right-now">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2</a>, among dozens of others.</p> <figure>

<p>There’ll also be as-yet mysterious announcements and reveals from the likes of Devolver Digital, Turnbound devs 1TK, sim specialists Excalibur Games, and Code Coven, an academy for marginalised game dev talent. Kepler Interactive will also have a new look tabeltoppish RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/solasta-crown-of-the-magister-is-getting-a-sequel-starring-baldurs-gate-3s-narrator">Solasta II</a>, with Team17 adding a few games including the Twin Peaks-inspired survival horror Silver Pines. I hear from my sources that Denshattack, which looks rad, may be involved as well. Denshattack.</p>
<p>Galaxies goes live on <strong>October 23rd at 8pm GMT/ 9pm CEST / 12pm PST / 3pm EST</strong>. Watching it will be easy enough, as you can simply just visit RPS, where again, it’ll be beamed onto our homepage. Much like that Gamescom stream was back in August, except this time we’ll be expecting it, so Edwin won’t go to the tech department and get it removed in a panic. Alternatively, it’s going out on both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GalaxiesShow">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://lynn.gamer-network.net/content/rockpapershotgun/content-article/new/news/twitch.tv/galaxiesshow">Twitch</a>.</p>

              <p>I can’t think of a better pair of brands than Minecraft and LEGO. Minecraft is already comprised of individual blocks so it doesn’t take that much of a stretch of the imagination to adapt the world and it’s inhabitants into LEGO brick form. The two have collaborated, bringing us a whole slew of LEGO Minecraft sets including this one based on the Badlands biome which happens to be on sale.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4835/"> It normally goes for $60, but the discount has it for 27% off for a limited time</a>. That shaves the price down by $17 so you only have to pay $44.</p>
<p>Minecraft has already been sitting comfortably towards the top of the list of the most popular video games of all time. Following the movie this year starring Jack Black, the name has been launched into the stratosphere. So if you’re an aunt or uncle, looking to find a gift this holiday season for a video game-obsessed niece or nephew, chances are they know what a Chicken Jockey is and they’d be more than delighted to receive a LEGO Minecraft set.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4835/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Play and Creativity Set</h2>
<p>The buildable Minecraft set includes a number of minifigures including a Badlands Explorer, a Creeper, cave spiders, a husk, a baby rabbit, a donkey with saddlebags, 2 slimes and a bat. The bat can even hang upside down with its wings folded up. the people-shaped minifigures are kind of genius in their implementation here to achieve the Minecraft look. They use the standard LEGO torso and legs, but then swap out the head for a box. It’s perfect.</p>



<p>The 538-piece LEGO set has interactive elements. You can blast stones across your play area with the TNT to operate the explode function. The set is filled with tools like the coveted diamond pickaxe. You load load up your different tools into the donkey’s satchel too. Your Minecraft explorer has a bed to sleep in and a set of rails to ride in a minecart down. There are different colored bricks representing precious ores like copper, gold, redstone, and amethyst crystals.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4835/">The LEGO Minecraft The Badlands Mineshaft set is only one part of a much larger collection.</a> You can also shop for LEGO versions of a pirate ship voyage, a cherry blossom garden, a wolf stronghold, a windmill farm, as well as the ender dragon and end ship. Right now, the Badlands Mineshaft set is on sale for its lowest price on Amazon yet. That’s just $43, down from $60.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Marvel Rivals</i> is shedding its PvP-only identity this October with a PvE mode in which you and your friends&nbsp; are gonna have to use super powers to mop up a zombie-infested city. The event kicks off later this month as a collaboration with Marvel Animation following the four-episode <i>Marvel Zombies</i> miniseries on Disney+.</p> <p>Developer NetEase shared the news of its upcoming PvE zombies mode this morning <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1979053687340408847">over on X</a> with a post showing off some fun animation and a slice of the gameplay, as well as a few details of how it’ll work. Though you won’t have access to the full roster of heroes available in PvP, you can choose among Thor, Blade, Magik, Jeff the Shark, and the Punisher to sweep through zombie hordes and take on Zombie Namoor and the Queen of the Dead, who serve as bosses. It all launches on October 23, 2025, just in time for Halloween.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first-ever PvE mode: Marvel Zombies is coming on Oct 23, 2025 UTC. </p> <p>This new mode throws you and your squad into a relentless fight for survival against endless waves of the undead. </p> <p>The city's burning, the infected are rising – and it's up to you to hold the line. <br>Get a… <a href="https://t.co/DodsnAzoRB">pic.twitter.com/DodsnAzoRB</a></p> <p>— Marvel Rivals (@MarvelRivals) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/1979053687340408847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>These heroes will work a little differently from how they do in the base game, too. Thor, for example, is described in the teaser as having a “persistent awakened state” and Magik has access to an “unlimited Darkchild form.”</p>

 <h2><i>Marvel Rivals</i> could use a Hail Mary</h2> <p>The news follows a pretty significant dip in popularity for the superhero-themed hero shooter. As <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/10/12/marvel-rivals-has-lost-85-of-its-players-in-10-months/">reported by <i>Forbes</i>’ Paul Tassi</a>, the once white-hot shooter has cooled, losing 85 percent of the player base it enjoyed earlier in the year. As Tassi notes, the player count is still quite healthy, with concurrents peaking at 98,000 in recent days. But clearly Marvel Studios could use a bit of a shot in the arm if it wants to reclaim its previous numbers, which saw things top out at 644,000 concurrents.</p> <p>Zombies and horde PvE modes are nothing we haven’t seen before in shooters. The upcoming <i>Black Ops 7</i> this November, for example, continues <i>CoD</i>’s long-running zombies mode alongside its standard multiplayer offerings. That said, <i>Rivals</i>’ PvE gameplay does look pretty fresh in motion. We’ll see if it’s enough to put some spring in <i>Rivals</i>’ step.</p>

              <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is having a big week with </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>out now for Switch and Switch 2, but before fans headed back to Kalos, they learned a whole lot about the future of the series after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>a second massive Game Freak Teraleak</span></a><span>. The info dump included information about future games, including the Generation X games </span><i><span>Pokémon Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i><span>. If you were wondering about the legitimacy of the whole thing, well, it looks like The Pokémon Company is targeting prominent leakers with DMCA takedowns.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978966734452248960"><span>Centro Leaks</span></a><span>, an X account that compiles </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>leaks when they sprout up in places like 4chan or Discord, claims that TPC COO Takato Utsunomiya has contacted X about multiple copyright infringements from the leaks, saying that these posts include images and videos that have been “reproduced and distributed to the public without [the company’s] permission.” Among the posts listed in the screenshotted email are the </span><i><span>Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave </span></i><span>logos, and a list of Pokémon supposedly returning in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>. Do with that information what you will.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688"><span>Teraleak happened last year</span></a><span>, and included not only information about upcoming projects but also several documents and pieces of concept art for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-budget-canceled-masuda-black-white-remake-2000635371"><span>older games, as well as some canceled ones</span></a><span> that never saw the light of day. Almost exactly a year later, this second wave of information spread, revealing new development footage and design docs for games like </span><i><span>Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i><span>, a </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game set in the Galar region from </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>, and an MMO-style game that would take place in multiple regions from previous games. Whether or not these leaks shift plans for any of the games Game Freak has coming down the pipeline remains to be seen, but by trying to take these down, The Pokémon Company may have confirmed their legitimacy. We’ve reached out to the company for comment and will update the story if we hear back.</span></p>

            <p>Do Pokémon poop? Perhaps that's not a question you've ever considered after decades of this franchise's existence, but it's a question that's now been answered in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>
<p>There's certainly some colourful dialogue in this latest Pokémon spin-off (even if it's not voiced, but let's not go there now), but some conversations are proving more revelatory than others.</p>
<p>Japanese fans, as <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-dialogue-confirms-that-pikachu-does-in-fact-poop/">Automaton</a> has reported, have become particularly concerned with an <a href="https://x.com/teso_026/status/1978541393812291872">NPC whose Pikachu is "pooping more than usual"</a>, leading to "Pikachu's poop" becoming a trending topic on social media.</p>

<p>Eurogamer has spotted the NPC in the English-language version too. "My Pikachu's been having tummy troubles recently," the kid says. "I'm worried…"</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The offending Pikachu doesn't look any different standing in front of the child, who sits on a bench showing little actual worry or, you know, helping the poor thing. But maybe this Pikachu is simply putting on a brave face in public, holding it in before scampering to defecate in a nearby bush - hey, we've all been there (the brave face bit at least).</p>
<p>This pair aren't alone either, as Eurogamer also spotted another Pokémon trainer who's been busy "cleaning up the, um, droppings of wild Pokémon". Why are they doing that? The mysteries continue.</p>

<p>Thankfully none of this poop is seen in-game, so the pristine streets of Lumiose City remain smear free.</p>
<p>If you've been wondering how long it takes to run around the city, picking up poop or not, then Eurogamer has investigated for you - it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-long-does-it-take-to-run-around-the-entire-pokemon-legends-z-a-map-weve-tested-it-and-its-shorter-that-youd-think">shorter than you might think</a>.</p>

<p>Now that be some Mario magic</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="c3910dd7fbe44"><a title="Switch 2 Box" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c3910dd7fbe44/switch-2-box.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has apparently requested its global suppliers to pump out as many as 25 million Switch 2 console units by the end of March 2026, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-17/nintendo-switch-2-production-plan-25-million-units-by-march-2026?leadSource=reddit_wall">Bloomberg reports</a> (paywalled).</p>
<p>If the Big N can manage this, it would set the company up for meeting the demands of what's set to be a record-breaking first year of sales for the new console.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, "people familiar with the matter" say that Nintendo has requested a boost in production in order to maximise potential sales across Christmas as Switch 2 continues to crush expectations.</p>
<p>Analysts were already predicting it will sell 17.6 million devices by the end of March 2026, so with these production figures, that figure looks to be comfortably surpassed and reach 20 million, at least based on shipping estimates from its assembly partners.</p>
<p>Bloomberg Intelligence industry analyst Nathan Naidu says that this "reinforces our view that its 15 million unit-sales target is conservative and a guidance upgrade appears imminent."</p>
<figure data-uuid="70e32915428ff"><a title="25 million switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/70e32915428ff/25-million-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"The console sold 5.8 million units in its first month globally vs. the original Switch’s 2.7 million launch sales" he continues, though still considers that there are risks regarding US tariffs, and that Nintendo "might need to follow Microsoft and Sony in raising US prices of its consoles."</p>
<p>Still, with Nintendo already looking comfortable to surpass industry sales predictions (and thrashing its own modest predictions) for Switch 2 in its first year, and despite controversies over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/digital-foundry-is-happy-with-switch-2-but-feels-the-screen-is-problematic">screen quality</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-employee-explains-why-star-wars-outlaws-is-a-game-key-card">Game-Key cards</a> and the general state of the economy overall not having the kind of impact on sales some may have feared, it seems they are keen to push the advantage while the going is good for the console.</p>
<p>Indeed, and as pointed out by Bloomberg, it shows a company in full flight, going all-out to secure success for their flagship device. Sales are already trending 77% ahead of the original Switch's launch in the US (as per <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/switch-2-reportedly-sold-2-4-million-units-in-first-three-months-on-the-market-us">Circana</a>), it's clear Nintendo is trying to make the most of the general excitement of the console.</p>
<p>In the past year, overall shares in Nintendo having also risen by 50%; and, the time of writing, its Tokyo-traded shares actually rose by an additional 2.6%.</p>
<p>So, with a predicted 68% growth in annual revenue expected to be announced next month; things are certainly looking rosy for the Mario and pals just now.</p>

<p><em>Reckon they'll manage to surpass 20 million sales, or match the units produced, by March? Let us know your thoughts!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Days after Battlefield 6 went live, while EA and Battlefield Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/">were enjoying watching sales numbers go up</a>, and players were still having a good time amid the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-troubleshooting-guide-how-to-fix-common-pc-errors/">myriad of issues cropping up for PC players</a>, one element of the game became clear to everyone playing. It took far too long to level up and unlock weapons and attachments in the current progression and XP system.</p>



<p>In response, players found a way to farm XP by jumping into Portal and creating Bot-filled matches where you could level up extremely quickly. EA responded <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-players-advantage-xp-farms-portal-ea-tries-to-stop-them/">by trying to play whack-a-mole with these XP farms</a>, shutting some of the most popular ones down, but more bot server-moles kept appearing until Portal's server capacity was at its max.</p>



<p>Now, in a new <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979107918185157116">Community Update post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, EA and Battlefield Studios are trying a slightly different approach, one that's arguably what they should have tried doing in the first place. On the one hand, it is still clamping down on XP farms. On the other hand, the amount of XP you'll gain through regular matches and daily bonuses is going up, and the requirements for unlocking the first 20 attachment ranks are going down. Assignments that previously required career ranks 20, 23, and 26 are also being reduced to only require ranks 10, 15, and 20.</p>



<p>"<em>We've heard your feedback around the pace of progression, especially how long it can take to unlock hardware such as gadgets and weapon attachments</em>," Battlefield Studios writes. "<em>We know progression is an important part of feeling rewarded for your time on the battlefield</em>."</p>



<p>The update listed three changes that Battlefield Studios will implement sometime within the next week: </p>



<ul>
<li><em>The XP gained from match completion and the daily bonus are being increased by 10% and 40% respectively</em>.</li>



<li><em>The XP needed to unlock the first 20 attachment ranks is being reduced, so you'll start earning useful attachments almost twice as fast</em>.</li>



<li><em>The assignments that required career ranks 20, 23, and 26 to begin will now require career ranks 10, 15, and 20, respectively</em>.</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>When it comes to XP farms in Portal and how Battlefield Studios and EA are actually addressing it, the studio wrote, "<em>We are developing adjustments that are intended to diminish the number of XP farms taking up server space while further emphasizing playing with friends on both custom and verified experiences.</em>"</p>



<p>All of these updates, as previously mentioned, will be implemented in the game at some point in the next week, though Battlefield Studios says several times in its full post that these changes will require further tweaking and adjustments over time, so nothing will be set in stone once the updates are live. Also, when the update for Portal goes live, Battlefield Studios expects that "<em>all experiences, both custom and verified, will need to be republished by players before they can create an active server</em>."</p>



<p>It's good that EA and Battlefield Studios are trying to address the root problem with progression and adjust it to make it feel like less of a slog instead of only trying to further clamp down on XP farms. Hopefully these changes are at least meaningful enough to start that the early experience for players is improved.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dell’s Cleaning House on Its 5-Star Ryzen 7 Laptop at 69% Off (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD), $399 Worth of Free Accessories Included]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dells-cleaning-house-on-their-inspiron-15-touchscreen-laptops-grab-one-now-for-69-off-2000636182</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell%E2%80%99s-cleaning-house-on-its-5-star-ryzen-7-laptop-at-69-off-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-399-worth-of-free-accessories-included.1327678/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It seems kind of early to be clearing out the shelves ahead of the big Black Friday and Cyber Week sales to come at the end of next month, but if that’s what Dell is thinking by putting some of their top-shelf touchscreen laptops on sale at massively reduced prices, why say no? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4836/">This time it’s the Inspiron 15 3535 touchscreen business laptop that’s showing up at Amazon for over $1,500 off — it’s just $750 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>The specs of this business laptop and the $399 accessories bundle it’s paired with basically scream for a higher price, especially with the big holiday sales events still over a month away. The Dell Inspiron 15 3535 has an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor with 8 cores and 16 threads, capable of speeds up to 5.0GHz. It comes loaded with 32GB of RAM, expandable to 64GB, and a generous 1TB SSD for storage. Windows 11 Professional with Microsoft Copilot come preloaded.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4836/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Perfect Touch</h2>
<p>The 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen is an underrated feature. With the huge advances made by tablets, a touchscreen laptop doesn’t quite have the cache it once had, but it’s exceptionally useful. The one on the Dell Inspiron 15 is full-HD with Dolby Atmos and anti-glare coating, so it’s a solid display even before you use the touchscreen features. For our money’s worth, a good touchscreen beats a trackpad any day for ultimate control and ease of use.</p>
<p>We also love the fact that while 32GB of RAM is a real score, and definitely enough to power the Dell Inspiron 15 through multitasking, streaming, and even creative work like photo and video editing, this Dell comes with an empty slot to give you the option of doubling the RAM by adding another 32GB chip. Memory prices have been pleasantly low as of late, so this is a great bit of future-proofing for this laptop.</p>



<h2>Not Just Business</h2>
<p>Dell calls the Inspiron 15 a business laptop, and it’s certainly more than capable if you’re strictly looking for an everyday productivity superstar at a great price. But it would almost be a waste to not use it for more, since it has enough graphics power and a sharp enough screen to lend itself to creative endeavors, and with the FHD Dolby Atmos screen, a little streaming might be in order as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4836/">The 69% off deal at Amazon that knocks the price of the Inspiron 15 and its accessory bundle down from $2,400 to just $750</a> shows that Dell is serious about reducing its stock of these great touchscreen laptops ahead of the holiday tech deals. There’s going to be no shortage of tech shoppers willing to lend them a hand, so don’t wait too long or the supply might run out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo is making <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-review-best-things-list-hate-love-nintendo-1851783873">a lot of Switch 2s</a>. Like, a <em>lot</em> a lot. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, suppliers have been asked to ramp up production enough for the company to sell up to 25 million Switch 2s by the end of the current fiscal year. Nintendo clearly has ambitious expectations for the pricey sequel to its most successful home console ever. The good news for fans is that basically anyone who wants to buy one has been able to.</p> <p>Sources <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-17/nintendo-switch-2-production-plan-25-million-units-by-march-2026?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDY2MzU1NCwiZXhwIjoxNzYxMjY4MzU0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUM1VMNUZHT1QwSkswMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.LE6GP3UTebmLsJ8NMH5owMDSVfAgjvJ76QZvezdERSM">told<em> Bloomberg</em></a> Nintendo will likely surpass analysts’ sales estimates that have the Switch 2 selling 17.6 million units by the end of March 2026, and could go on to sell roughly 20 million in the device’s first 10 months on the market. If that turns out to be the case, it would put sales of the Switch 2 squarely within the peak years of the original hardware, blowing the Switch 1’s already strong debut out of the water.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636575" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636575"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636575">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>Nintendo sold roughly 15 million Switches in that console’s first year, peaking at over 27 million sold in 2020. Between the global pandemic and <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, that may have been an anomaly. Still, the console has also had an impressively long tail, thanks in part to the release of revised models and special editions. Basically, if the Switch 2 sales curve starts at a higher point and can draft off similar momentum with hit game releases, it could certainly have the potential to match or even outdo the (at least for now) second-best-selling console of all time.</p> <p>For fans though, this big production push has resulted in a comfortable supply of Switch 2 units on store shelves. Despite the pre-order mess and <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-day-one-update-live-eshop-mario-kart-1851783549">initial launch chaos</a>, you’ve basically been able to walk into most big box stores and pick up a Switch 2 if you wanted one over the last few months. And that’s despite the ongoing trade war and uncertainty around a <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-prices-pro-controllers-tariffs-amiibo-2000614471">possible future Switch 2 price hike</a>. For the device’s first holiday season though, it should be smooth sailing.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Poor Ryu. Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There’s a grand total of 45 PlayStation Trophies for you to collect during your Ninja Gaiden 4 journey, and 44 Xbox Achievements if you’re on Xbox Series X|S.</strong></p>



<p>From the Platinum Trophy on PlayStation to objectives offering small amounts of Gamerscore, there’s a lot to keep you occupied. Here’s a quick table showing you how the trophies are distributed throughout NG4.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Trophy Type</th><th data-align="center">Quantity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Platinum Trophy</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Gold Trophies</td><td data-align="center">3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Silver Trophies</td><td data-align="center">5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Bronze Trophies</td><td data-align="center">36</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>This is going to be a Platinum and full set of Gamerscore that few people on the planet will be able to get. Previous Ninja Gaiden games have asked something similar, and they are notoriously some of the hardest games in the world to fully complete.</p>



<p>Let us know if you intend to take on the challenge, and you can do so through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>, which is as alive as ever!</p>

                <p>Glen Schofield, a video game industry veteran known for co-creating the Dead Space series and working on multiple Call of Duty games, has said the gaming industry is facing major challenges and that developers can look to artificial intelligence technologies to help solve some of the issues. Schofield made these comments at the same time that many in the video game industry have raised <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-employees-slam-55-billion-buyout-in-open-letter/1100-6535484/" data-ref-id="1100-6535484">concerns, objections, and fears about the further adoption and implementation of AI.</a></p><p>"We need to fix the gaming industry right now," Schofield said at Gamescom Asia recently, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-thinks-the-games-industry-is-broken-beaten-and-battered" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "It's broken. It's beaten, it's battered, our developers are battered, they've been taking it on the chin for the last couple of years. We need to bring it back to what it was. Instead of all this negativity."</p><p>The games industry <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">should embrace AI, not fear it</a>, Schofield said.</p><p>"AI isn't here to replace us," he said. "It's here to make us faster, better, and more efficient. And AI is for all of us, it really is. It's not just for directors and artists; it's for writers and marketing execs."</p><p>Schofield called upon games industry executives, owners, and founders to start training developers on AI and begin to use the tools "as soon as you can." This is already happening, as a survey from 2024 found that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">the majority of game developers worldwide already use AI in their development pipelines</a>, despite misgivings from workers about it.</p><p>A concern about AI voiced by many is that it could replace people and human creativity, but Schofield said humans will always be vital to the process. "Remember, ideas are the lifeblood of the industry," he said to developers in the room. "And those ideas? They come from you."</p><p>Previously, Schofield said the adoption of AI in the games business <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">might cause some "disruption" in the job market in the short term</a>, but more jobs will be created overall on a long-enough timeline.

                <p dir="ltr">The former creative lead of the Assassin's Creed series wants to clarify that it wasn't his choice to step away from the franchise. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-after-two-decades/1100-6535413/">Marc-Alexis Côté left Ubisoft</a> after roughly 20 years with the company--including the last three as vice president and executive producer of Assassin's Creed.</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7384672277055012864/" rel="nofollow ">LinkedIn</a>, Côté stated that he's still passionate about Assassin's Creed, and he didn't "make that choice" to leave the series. "I did not walk away. I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside," said Côté, who prefaced this by saying he's not resentful toward Ubisoft.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Why We Gave Assassin's Creed Shadows An 8</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, Ubisoft announced that a new subsidiary named<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-announces-vantage-studios-a-creative-house-focused-on-three-major-franchises/1100-6535136/"> Vantage Studios will oversee the Assassin's Creed franchise</a>, along with Rainbow Six and Far Cry. With this reorganization, Côté noted that Ubisoft "decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise." As previously reported, a "different position was mentioned" to Côté, but he said "it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity" of what he was doing over the past few years.</p><p dir="ltr">Côté helped launch the latest game in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, earlier this year on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. While still unofficial, mounting evidence and leaks point to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-release-date-reportedly-leaks/1100-6535405/">Assassin's Creed Shadows heading to Switch 2 in December</a>. It was also reported earlier this month that Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-canceled-civil-war-based-assassins-creed-over-controversy-concerns-report/1100-6535320/">canceled an Assassin's Creed game that was set during the American Civil War</a> because the company was worried it was too controversial.</p>

                <p>After less than two days, Battlefield Studios has announced that it's reverting the recent Battlefield 6 ticket changes based on feedback. For anyone just catching up, the developer said on Wednesday that<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-conquest-matches-are-speeding-up/1100-6535444/" data-ref-id="1100-6535444"> ticket numbers for Conquest maps would drop from 1000 to lower values</a>, but less than 48 hours later, the developer <a href="https://x.com/battlefieldcomm/status/1979118925699747944?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> the ticket numbers are reverting back to 1000 for all maps.</p><p>All Conquest matches now begin with 1,000 tickets for each side and a 45-minute time limit. The developer previously dropped the starting ticket numbers down to 700-900 depending on the map, a decision the company made to help speed up matches. But that's all changing now, and Battlefield Studios said people may face longer matches on larger maps like Mirak Valley and Firestorm.</p><p>"We'll continue monitoring player feedback and gameplay data to ensure the pacing and overall flow of matches feel right," the developer said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4586666-screenshot2025-10-17at9.06.50%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4586666" data-ratio="0.56003430531732" data-width="1166" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4586666-screenshot2025-10-17at9.06.50%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4586666"></a><figcaption>More Battlefield 6 changes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4586666-screenshot2025-10-17at9.06.50%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p>This was one of a few major changes that Battlefield Studios announced recently, as the developer also said it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-xp-farms-will-be-patched-out-soon-but-player-progression-will-be-dramatically-improved/1100-6535517/" data-ref-id="1100-6535517">patch out XP farm exploits and improve player progression.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">Battlefield 6 Season 1 </a>launches on October 28, which is also the day the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">game's battle royale mode is rumored to launch.</a></p><p>In other news, Battlefield 6 sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-sells-7-million-copies-for-biggest-opening-of-all-time-for-the-series/1100-6535488/" data-ref-id="1100-6535488">more than 7 million copies out of the gate</a>, making it the "biggest opening" ever for the esteemed FPS series.
