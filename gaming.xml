			<p>Wolcen Studio has finally revealed the real title of its PvPvE extraction game, which, up until now, we've only known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolcen-studios-project-pantheon-will-host-its-second-closed-alpha-test-later-this-month/">Project Pantheon</a>. It's officially called Gods, Death, and Reapers, and we just got a new gameplay trailer showcased during the Future Games Show at Gamescom 2025.</p>



<p>The isometric RPG is still fairly early in development, as there was no release date or even release window announced alongside the official title reveal, but it is available for you to try if you're interested. Just head over to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3086590/Gods_Death__Reapers/">Steam page</a> and request access for the closed playtest to jump in now.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Gamescom 2025 marks a huge milestone for us as we finally get to share&nbsp;</em><em>Gods, Death &amp; Reaper</em>'s official name and gameplay with the world," said game director Andrei Chirculete in a press release. "<em></em><em>Gods, Death &amp; Reapers</em>&nbsp;is a game that started from one simple idea: what if you could play an extraction game that looks like a top-down ARPG? Now that this idea has turned into&nbsp;<em>Gods, Death &amp; Reapers</em>, we can't wait to hear from our players what they think, as it will help us shape up the best version throughout the coming Closed Alpha tests!"</p>



<p>To learn more about Project Pantheon, now Gods, Death, &amp; Reapers, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-pantheon-qa-a-post-apocalyptic-fantasy-extraction-arpg-from-the-makers-of-wolcen/">check out our interview with Wolcen Studio from earlier this year</a>, after a conversation with the team at Gamescom 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Publisher Xbox Game Studios and developers Team Ninja/PlatinumGames have unveiled the official PC system requirements for Ninja Gaiden 4 on the game's store pages. From the looks of it, the game will be very easy to run, considering that the GPU listed in the minimum requirements is the GTX 1060 which launched nine years ago. Granted, this will be at 1080p resolution, 30 frames per second, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution set to Quality, and everything set to Low. To play at 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second with Medium settings, you will need an RTX 2060 SUPER.</p>



<p><strong>Minimum:<br></strong>OS: Windows® 10/11, 64bit<br>Processor: Intel® Core™ i5-8400 or AMD Ryzen™ 5 3400G<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1060 (VRAM 6GB) or ​ AMD Radeon™ RX 590(VRAM 8GB)<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Storage: 100 GB available space<br>Sound Card: 16bit 48kHz ステレオ<br>Additional Notes: SSD Required. ​ 1080p / 30FPS​ FSR quality "Low"​ Object Quality "Low"</p>



<p><br><strong>Recommended:<br></strong>OS: Windows® 10/11, 64bit<br>Processor: Intel® Core™ i5-10400 or AMD Ryzen™ 5 3600<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA® GeForce® RTX 2060 Super(VRAM 8GB) or AMD Radeon™ RX 5700XT(VRAM 8GB)<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Storage: 100 GB available space<br>Sound Card: 16bit 48kHz ステレオ<br>Additional Notes: SSD Required. ​ 1080p / 60FPS ​ FSR Quality "Middle"​ Object Quality "Middle"</p>



<p>Unlike <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>, which was remade with Unreal Engine 5, Ninja Gaiden 4 is believed to run on PlatinumGames' proprietary engine. This engine prioritizes performance over visuals, especially for this type of action games that require low latency (and, therefore, high frame rates) to execute pitch-perfect moves.  </p>



<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-gameplay-gamescom-onl-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable for the first time at Gamescom 2025</a>. Our Francesco De Meo checked it out earlier today, so stay tuned for his hands-on impressions. Hint: as a long-time fan, he was favorably impressed.</p>



<p>The full game will be released on October 21 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-layoffs-2k-games-delay-2000618914</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bioshock-4-reportedly-cuts-80-developers-following-development-delays.1276308/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The other shoe has dropped at Cloud Chamber. Following an internal delay and management shakeup, the studio making <em>BioShock 4</em> has now laid off 80 people, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/take-two-guts-bioshock-studio-after-a-decade-of-development"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a>. Originally, the sequel had supposedly been targeting a late 2026 release, but it will likely take longer now as significant aspects of the game, including the story, are reworked.</p> <p>Layoffs announced on Tuesday amounted to about a third of the staff at the roughly 250-person studio. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, the next <em>BioShock</em> has gone through multiple studios and leadership teams over the last decade, with problems arising at Cloud Chamber in part due to the need to create a new studio while also meeting sky-high expectations for the franchise. One of the stumbling blocks was reportedly its rapid growth and the game’s shift to the newest version of Unreal Engine.</p> <p>“While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a <em>BioShock</em> game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development,” 2K Games president David Ismailer <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-delay-layoffs-rod-fergusson-diablo-gears-2000618449">wrote in a memo to staff</a> this week that was shared with <em>Kotaku</em>.</p> <p><em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-delay-cloud-chamber-2k-take-two-remake-2000614413">reported</a> earlier this month that<em> BioShock</em> 4’s latest stumble occurred following a negative internal review with executives, with particular concern about the game’s narrative. Publicly, 2K Games has said that the new <em>BioShock</em> is good but not good enough. “Some of our competitors have realized maybe a little late in the day that consumers are not okay with okay,” Strauss Zelnick, CEO of 2K parent company Take-Two, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question">told <em>IGN</em></a> in a recent interview. Industry veteran Rod Fergusson is now leading the project, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-infinite-update-multiplayer-modes-cut-gears-5933119">the second time</a> he’s been tasked with clawing a <em>BioShock</em> game out of development hell.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Take-Two Interactive has laid off around 30% of staff at Cloud Chamber, the studio behind the next BioShock game, reports state.</p>



<p>Already a decade into development, the next BioShock game was due to be released in late 2026 or early 2027, but it will be delayed further, with the decision made to give the game more time in development.</p>



<p>More than 80 jobs were cut in the changes, with the studio said to have around 250 employees before the layoffs, representing a huge portion of the workforce.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Long wait. Image via 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>The details are shared by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/take-two-guts-bioshock-studio-after-a-decade-of-development?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTcxNDU0NSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzE5MzQ1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUIxVEZHUFFRN1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.zVepbosqQPRpkHaMvUcaBAlKk73_0IkMGOvNKaKU6mE&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, which includes an email sent to staff by 2K President David Ismailer that states a decision was made to “rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game.”</p>



<p>This resulted in “reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development,” although BioShock is already one of the longest-running productions in gaming history.</p>



<p>Plans for the next BioShock instalment began in 2014, the year after the release of BioShock Infinite, though there were significant changes as Irrational Games, originally at the helm, was shattered by 2K after director Ken Levine left to start a smaller studio within Take-Two.</p>



<p>The report from Bloomberg says the trouble didn’t end there, with Certain Affinity taking the reins and working on the game for roughly two years, and a deal to acquire the studio fell through. Take-Two then decided to start an in-house studio to lead development, hiring in 2017 for what would become Cloud Chamber.</p>



<p>It’s not clear what the plan is now for the next BioShock game, though it’s clear that there won’t be a release window anytime soon, as the long wait will rumble on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Infinity Nikki is getting some sort of crossover collaboration with Stardew Valley beginning September 1, and though we really have no idea what all it involves, there are already some surprisingly mixed reactions coming from the community in the wake of the announcement. But it's not Stardew Valley's fault - it's the result of five months of increasing community frustration directed at Infinity Nikki's developer, Infold.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🌟 Dear Stylists,</p><p>We're overjoyed to announce an official collaboration with the beloved Stardew Valley!</p><p>Cozy surprises await you, and adventure is in the air. Prepare your senses for a harvest of wonders.</p><p>The collaboration begins on September 1st (UTC-7). The first seeds of… <a href="https://t.co/JfnYECzqpr" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/JfnYECzqpr</a></p></div>— Infinity Nikki (@InfinityNikkiEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1958125632539558069?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a video posted to the official Infinity Nikki Twitter/X account, that shows Stardew Valley's Junimos entering the world of Infinity Nikki. "Cozy surprises await you, and adventure is in the air," reads the post. "Prepare your senses for a harvest of wonders." While it's fairly likely this means new outfits for Nikki, there's really nothing to indicate exactly what the collaboration entails. It's also impossible to tell if anything Infinity Nikki will show up on the Stardew Valley side, especially since Stardew crossovers have been few and far between over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this news seems like it would be entirely positive, one glance at the community suggests that's not the case. What players are mad about isn't the collaboration itself, though, but the announcement's timing and framing following ongoing tension between the Infinity Nikki community and developer Infold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The community has been riled up for some time, ever since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-players-threaten-to-uninstall-the-game-as-dev-introduces-controversial-changes-with-update-15">update 1.5 this past April</a> added some controversial changes to the game. The changes were multifaceted - some seemed to retcon Infinity Nikki's story, while others caused player frustration by ramping up the money and time investments required to collect full outfits. In response, the community launched a boycott campaign that they ultimately had to rename a "girlcott" when official Infinity Nikki channels appeared to block the use of the word "boycott" entirely. While Infold did apologize and rectify some of the issues, not all of them were fixed, the community remained dissatisfied, and the studio <a href="https://www.pockettactics.com/infinity-nikki/interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dodged further questions posed by reporters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But more recently, a new controversy has struck. Infold notoriously doesn't reveal new outfits or new updates until right before they're due to launch, which over time has led to leakers sharing outfits in advance so the community can make better decisions about whether or not to spend money on certain outfits, or wait for the next update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early this week, however, Infold decided it had enough, and <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1957367080074007028" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published a lengthy essay on its social channels</a> denouncing leakers, complete with an image that reads, "<strong>LEAKS</strong>, [sic] ARE <strong>POISON</strong> TO ALL CREATION!!"</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Dear Stylists, </p><p>We recently became aware that some unauthorized development materials from our game have been illegally shared on multiple platforms. These creative works were meant to be revealed at the right time, but instead have been exposed through improper channels.</p><p>Since… <a href="https://t.co/q6oeze3dk5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/q6oeze3dk5</a></p></div>— Infinity Nikki (@InfinityNikkiEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1957367080074007028?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the message in full:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not all, though. That "Pounding Hammer" given out in the game alongside this message? It's got a fascinating item description in-game: "There are moments when one's hands itch, eager to raise a mighty hammer toward a certain target."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Needless to say, the community is <em>not thrilled.</em> Since this message, players have been expressing frustration on various Infinity Nikki social channels, arguing that the message was juvenile, unnecessarily harsh, and ignored the real issue the community is facing: that people feel they can't make informed decisions about how to spend their money because the studio doesn't communicate its plans well. Players are rallying in support of the leakers now, though others are pushing back, arguing that Infold has a right to go after leakers and announce updates when and how it chooses.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/20/hiwtmqm2rujf1-1755712261781.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityNikki/comments/1mu0c6z/until_the_day_i_die_ill_never_rat_on_a_leaker/">https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityNikki/comments/1mu0c6z/until_the_day_i_die_ill_never_rat_on_a_leaker/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which brings us back to Stardew Valley. No one's actually mad about Stardew Valley - in fact, there's plenty of fun speculation about what outfits might be tied to the collaboration. What players are upset about is the timing, which some are suggesting is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityNikki/comments/1mvdn1d/infinity_nikki_community/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all-too-convenient</a> to distract from the controversy around leakers. While most recognize that the timing is coincidental (Gamescom is this week, it's understandable Infold would have something big to announce), the fundamental problems the community has with the studio continue to go unanswered, and seem likely to be swept under the rug again in the wake of another cute outfit reveal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's just too bad for Stardew and its fans, who rarely get crossovers like this and are now caught in the middle. Poor Junimos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social. Got a story tip?

The player takes on the role of a broken but powerful ex-soldier named Clem, a war veteran, talented fighter and expert mech pilot. Clem attempts to shed the guilt and shame of her past and become a legitimate force for good in the Red Expanse, a post-post-apocalyptic version of the American Southwest.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Customizable Mech Action</strong> – You pilot the Desert Raptor MKII, a Mech of extraordinary power. It is a highly-customizable battle vehicle that can be equipped with a variety of offensive systems: heavy, high-powered melee weapons, steam powered hydraulic siege weapons, explosive firearms, and more. It can also be equipped with a variety of defensive systems; high-speed thrusters, boosters for dashing, riot shields, among others.</li><li><strong>Become a Bounty Hunter</strong> – The Red Expanse is a rich farming and mercantile region plagued by violent <a title="Companies > crim [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>inals and dangerous beasts. The government that remains outsources justice to experts like Clem—bounty hunters who are free to pursue their targets into whatever dangerous corners of the world they hide. She’ll fight her way through many corners of the region and deal with these marks as she sees fit.</li><li><strong>Repair and Upgrade Your Homestead</strong> – Clem comes into an isolated and run-down garage that serves as a suitable base of operations and home—just barely. Build out water and power supply lines, grow and cook food, produce ammunition and fuel for combat, and raise animals. This decrepit ruin has a lot of potential, but it will have to grow alongside Clem.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

			<p>Fellowship, a multiplayer online dungeon adventure game, or "<em>MODA</em>," as its developer Chief Rebel calls it, will launch in Early Access on Steam this coming October 9, 2025, developer Chief Rebel and publisher Arc Games have announced during the Future Games Show 2025 presentation. You'll be able to try it out ahead of that launch, though, as it'll have an open beta for players next month, from September 18-23.</p>



<p> "<em>All dungeons, all the time</em>," the trailer from today's Future Games Show boasts as it showcases new gameplay from the co-op adventure game, and that really is Fellowship's whole pitch. When <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-hands-on-and-qa-a-game-all-about-mmo-like-dungeons/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo played the upcoming MODA earlier this year</a> ahead of one of its public playtests, he noted that "<em>strips practically everything else, such as open world and narrative content, focusing entirely on the dungeon mechanics, with the goal of providing a highly replayable cooperative experience with some competitive elements through leaderboards and the like."</em></p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>According to a press release, Chief Rebel plans to keep the game in early access for six months before reaching its 1.0 launch next year. While the early access version will include all the dungeons you might've already seen during public playtests or that you will see in the upcoming open beta, Chief Rebel is planning to have more playable content arrive as part of the 1.0 version. </p>



<p>The studio will also launch a cosmetics store with the full-game launch, though these cosmetics will remain optional and will not have an impact on gameplay. </p>



<p>Fellowship will be available for $24.99 USD on PC when it launches on October 9.</p>

			<p>Ubisoft doesn't have the biggest presence at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, but it's not entirely absent from the festivities. <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-xbox-game-pass/">The Rogue Prince of Persia was shadow-dropped</a>, and now a new province coming to Anno 117: Pax Romana has been debuted at the convention, alongside the news that fans will get their first chance to play it next month with a free demo launching on September 2, 2025.</p>



<p>The new province is Albion, bringing its wet lands and expanding on Latium, the province that was first shown off and the one that houses Rome. </p>



<p>Albion is a Celtic province, and it'll be your choice whether you want to keep and encourage Celtic traditions or assimilate the province under Roman customs. Either is viable, but whatever you choose will require its own unique approach and will further shape your own journey in Anno 117: Pax Romana.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regarding the demo coming next month, it'll only be available for a limited time, from September 2-16 on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and of course, Ubisoft Connect. So if you want to check it out ahead of its launch this coming <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reveals-release-date-for-anno-117-pax-romana-a-1-0-release-window-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-and-showcases-a-new-game-morbid-metal-at-sgf-2025/">November 13</a>, then make sure to clear your gaming schedule for those two weeks, since there's no limit on how many times you can replay the demo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We recently reviewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/witcher-path-of-destiny-review-when-theme-is-only-skin-deep" rel="nofollow">The Witcher: Path of Destiny</a>, and while we were unimpressed by its lack of strategic depth and paper-thin&nbsp;<em>The Witcher </em>theme, we persevered with the available expansions to see if they added anything more to it. Some of these expansions are crowd-funding only, and we'll specify which are available and retail and which aren't.</p>

<p>We previously covered <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/witcher-old-world-review" rel="nofollow">The Witcher: Old World</a> and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/witcher-old-world-expansions-review" rel="nofollow">expansions</a>, as well as the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/unmatched-witcher-realms-fall-and-steel-and-silver-review" rel="nofollow">Unmatched sets</a>, featuring characters from <em>The Witcher</em>. You can also read our review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/witcher-3-wild-hunt-review-new-benchmark-for-rpgs" rel="nofollow">The Witcher 3</a>, and check out our&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-4-official-reveal" rel="nofollow">news</a> for the upcoming <em>The Witcher 4</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-2.jpg?itok=ELtz6eF_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-2.jpg?itok=rDRLM61Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny</em>&nbsp;Stretch Goals boxes includes more of the same from the core box, but also with some fantastic legacy elements.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Witcher: Path of Destiny Stretch Goals</h2>

<p>In <em>The Wticher: Path of Destiny</em> Stretch Goals box from the crowdfunding campaign, there are several new characters, stories, and extra play options, some of which will be available at retail eventually, and some are exclusive to the crowdfunding.</p>

<p>The <em>Path of Destiny</em> stretch goals box includes:</p>

<ul><li>5 new characters</li>
	<li>5 new tales</li>
	<li>Companion and Villain additional play options</li>
	<li>Voice of Reason additional play options</li>
	<li>A new solo opponent board</li>
</ul><p>The 5 new characters offer more of the same from the core game. They're a welcome addition, providing multiple options, including for solo opponents, but they still lack the depth and feeling I'd like in order for them to feel like real characters. Dijkstra and Letho feel the most thematic, with Dijkstra's initiative interaction and card selection abilities, and Letho's messing with other players, but they're all still let down by the once-per-game abilities that don't have a consistent enough impact to make you feel any different from any other character.</p>

<p>The 5 new tales offer a huge amount of replayability from those in the core set, giving 8 in total when all combined, but they all suffer from the core mechanics' lack of depth. The Skellige tale is the most stand-out, with a built-in mini-game where you try to work out who the killer could be.</p>

<p>The Companion and Villain cards add some more interaction with a companion card being placed by one of the face-up card drafts and offering use of their ability if the player picks those cards. 5 companions are available, each with 5 cards (except Zoltan, who has 6, including the crowdfunding exclusive Field Marshal Windbag card). The villains are all crowdfunding exclusives, with 2 of them, Leo and Vilgefortz, having 3 of their cards suffed into the normal card deck, gaining the players victory points when they're defeated, and Gaunter offering a pact, with a victory point bonus or loss if its condition is met or not.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-3.jpg?itok=EyaP72ZF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-3.jpg?itok=3HdBfg_q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny </em>Triss A Grain of Truth expansion sees the first of the stretch goals box releasing to retail.</figcaption></figure><p>The Voice of Reason envelopes offer a legacy element to the game, with 9 envelopes (1 for each of the 8 tales and 1 for the <em>Path of Destiny Ronin</em> tale). Once the conditions on the envelopes are met, they can be opened and their components added to your game. We won't spoil any here, but it is very cool to have elements permanently added when playing through new tales, especially if you're playing with the same group, or through a solo play-through campaign.</p>

<p>The stretch goals also include a double-sided solo board for playing against the Crimson Avenger/Crimson Asshole, which adds a bit more variety on top of the 5 extra solo boards for the new characters in this pack.</p>

<p>The first retail release that includes the strech goals products is Triss A Grain of Truth, which has the Triss character, the Grain of Truth tale and the miniatures for both in the pack.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-4.jpg?itok=pIUNfgm2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-4.jpg?itok=AsjAYn7u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny </em>Legendary Monsters pack remove the tales cards and as a result, improves its grasp of theme and makes it more fun.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Witcher: Path of Destiny Legendary Monsters</h2>

<p>The Legendary Monsters expansion for<em> The Witcher: Path of Destiny </em>feels like what I wanted the core game to be. The focus is on fighting 1 of 4 available monsters, Ancient Leshen, Hym, Katakan, and Aguara. There are no tale cards, and the sole symbol is the fight symbol, with players needing to convert the other symbols to deal damage, or keep them to meet condition cards to gain experience.</p>

<p>This focus feels like it should have been the core gameplay all along. It doesn't even need to be monsters, the story cards could have contained the element players needed to work towards, chipping away at the target number, rather than the disconnected focus of trying to get symbols and work out what others might be getting. It's such a simple change, but the Legendary Monsters expansion completely changed my <em>Path of Destiny</em> experience and brought the theme to the front. The characters still don't feel unique or thematic enough for me, but the end experience was much more rewarding, it's just a shame it focuses on combat and not the other elements that make <em>The Witcher</em> so great.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-5.jpg?itok=JoCwos2c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-5.jpg?itok=G6CmsxGm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny </em>Wild Hunt makes the core game 1 v many, and again improves the gameplay considerably.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Wild Hunt is another great <em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny</em> expansion that changes the gameplay to either 1 player controlling the Wild Hunt vs all the other players, or a solo player playing against the automa Wild Hunt. It uses the expansions' own Tale and follows mostly the same rules as the core game, only this time you are competing directly against the Wild Hunt, with their own character board.</p>

<p>On top of their character board, there is also a general's play mat that each of the 4 Wild Hunt generals advances on a track, gaining effects as they do. Each general also has an ability card that usually causes issues for the other players. These abilities, combined with the standard abilities on the player board, go some way to making the Wild Hunt feel thematically worthwhile, which will leave the other player feeling pretty jealous with their bland characters with limited in-game effects.</p>

<p>As with Legendary Monsters, it's such a shame that this is an expansion, and not the core gameplay, because it locks you into the single tale in this pack, rather than being able to take the most thematically feeling parts of the expansions, and use them in the core game. This means that while both of these expansions are fun, the replayability is limited, while the core, more lifeless game, has 8 tales for a lot more replayability.</p>

<p>The Naglfar mini expansion for <em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny</em> is a crowdfunding excuslive expansion for the Wild Hunt, or Legendary Monsters expansions, and requires the core game and one of those expansions to use.</p>

<p>In the Wild Hunt, the Naglfar ship protects a general from the players, and the players get access to the Broken Sextant cards to offset that, which do things like ignore the ability of the general protected by the Naglfar. In Legendary Monsters, you can use the Naglfar expansion to make the Wild Hunt a monster against which the players battle.</p>

<p>It's a nice expansion, adding another dynamic to the game, but if you missed it at crowdfunding, it's not an essential gameplay inclusion, unless you love Legendary Monsters, in which case this adds more than it does to the Wild Hunt expansion.</p>

<p>The Geralt on Roach expansion for <em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny</em> is a crowdfunding-only expansion and won't be available at retail. Luckily, it doesn't add much to games, so if you missed it, you're not missing out on much. The expansion includes a miniature, a player board, and 5 starting cards for Geralt on Roach.</p>

<p>The miniature, as you would expect, shows Geralt mounted on Roach, drawing one of his trademark swords from his back. The player board changes Geralts' once-per-game abilities from the core set, adding in some randomness, allowing you to reveal a random card for an effect. The 5 starting cards are exactly the same as those in the core set, just with different art.</p>

<p>The one area that would have made this expansion interesting would have been a change to the starting cards. They're what gives you the most strategy in game, and differentiate the characters the most from each other. The once-per-game effects have little serious effect, and Geralt on Roach's are completely random, so beyond using the expansion once for fun, you'll be back using the core set Geralt.</p>

<p><em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny Ronin</em> isn't an expansion for <em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny,</em>&nbsp;it's a standalone game that uses most of the rules from the core game, with a few subtle differences. The main difference in the mechanics is that between each player, an alliance board is placed. These boards allow players to unlock their partner's abilities for use, which is done by playing matching symbols on the cards used in the draft, which include teacups facing different directions. Players need to play these cards facing each other to progress on the alliance board.</p>

<p>The other difference is that the tale cards don't have any text on them, the chapter cards simply detail which symbols are the active symbol for that chapter, and 2 of the 4 active symbol cards are put on the board. Victory and experience points are also reversed from the core game, with players now scoring victory points for the active symbol they have the least of, and experience points for the active symbol they have the most of.</p>

<p>Aside from the aesthetics, which are thematically glorious, <em>Path of Destiny: Ronin</em> doesn't feel that much different from the core game, which is still that the characters don't feel much different from each other, and apart from the focus on partnerships, it doesn't really feel much like <em>The Witcher,</em> and the card playing to match symbols feels a bit lifeless when compared to the art and components.</p>

<p>The art throughout is great, and when combined with the bamboo play mat, it looks amazing on the tabletop. It's just a shame that it won't be out much, because the core gameplay isn't up to scratch, and the fact that it is completely standalone, so the good parts of Legendary Monsters, the Wild Hunt, and the tale elements of the core game can't even be used as part of it.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Witcher: Path of Destiny Expansions?</h2>

<p><em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny</em> has some great expansions. Wild Hunt and Legendary Monsters both make the game feel like <em>The Witcher</em>, and should have been the core game. The fact that most are incompatible with each other just emphasizes the lack of join up with the products. The stretch goals, with the extra characters and tales, just add more of the same, and don't help the mechanics grip the theme, or add much variety beyond the tales' flavor text and once-per-game abilities of the characters. The voice of reason envelopes are a great addition, and add a fantastic legacy feel to the game, especially when playing in a consistent group, but I'm not sure the mechanics have the scope for that level of replayability, when all the new character and tale variety just add more of the same lack of depth.</p>

<p><em>Path of Destiny Ronin</em> looks glorious, and the gameplay changes are interesting, but it changes nothing in terms of how light the gameplay feels, and the lack of difference between the characters fails to capture any feeling of theme with them. It's also frustrating that it's completely standalone, and none of the other expansions, which are what save the core game, can be added to this.</p>

An open beta test will run from <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20250918T1700" target="_blank">September 18 at 10:00 a.m. PT / 1:00 p.m. ET</a> to <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20250923T1700" target="_blank">September 23 at 10:00 a.m. PT / 1:00 p.m. ET</a>. <span id="more-984530"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ About Early Access on October 9</strong></p><p><em>Fellowship</em> is a new title in development from Chief Rebel, a brand-new studio with industry veterans who’ve worked on major titles like <em>World of Warcraft</em>, <em><a title="Games > Diablo IV [25 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo IV</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Helldivers II [16 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers II</a></em>, the <em>Just Cause</em> and <em>Battlefield</em> series and more. With Fellowship being the first title from the studio, Chief Rebel is thrilled to bring <em>Fellowship</em> into Early Access in under two months, letting players experience this truly unique and challenging yet accessible player-versus-environment dungeon crawling adventure and are involving the community more directly with the creation of the game. The upcoming Early Access launch will mark just the beginning of <em>Fellowship</em>, as this new title will be a constantly evolving adventure with a slew of content that will be added and evolve thanks to player feedback throughout the course of Early Access.</p><p>Those who embark on this adventure from the very beginning of Early Access will be able to experience the core vision of <em>Fellowship</em>: all dungeons, all the time—giving players the <a title="Genres > Action [2,951 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> they want right from the start. Following Early Access launch, there are plans for optimal cosmetic purchases to be available. However, these items will be purely cosmetic and not affect gameplay. More details on these items will be revealed sometime closer to Early Access launch. For the full 1.0 version of the game, the Chief Rebel team is planning on including more content, systems, and features. The team has several plans in-mind for content and features, however, they will also take feedback from our players to heart and may make adjustments if they hear that there’s something the community really wants to see. <em>Fellowship</em> is planned to be in Early Access for approximately six months, but this can change depending on community feedback—as Chief Rebel will strive to discover what the community wants in Fellowship to help shape it into the best possible game it can be before it enters 1.0 launch next year.</p><p><strong>■ About the Upcoming Open Beta</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The upcoming open beta for <em>Fellowship</em> via Steam will kick off on <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20250918T1700" target="_blank">Thursday, September 18 at 10:00 a.m. PT</a> and end on <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20250923T1700" target="_blank">Tuesday, September 23 at 10:00 a.m. PT</a>. For the Open Beta, there will be a North America, Europe and Asia server available. This playtest will give players the chance to experience seven heroes (two Tanks, three DPS—including a recently-revealed DPS, Mara, and two Healers) who will be in <em>Fellowship</em>’s diverse roster of heroes, go on dungeon runs (both Ranked Dungeons and Quick Play Dungeons), take on challenging enemies and acquire epic loot along the way. Compared to the Steam Next Fest demo back in February, in addition to introducing a new DPS hero, Mara, the Open Beta will introduce new gameplay systems, including a fresh take on matchmaking and group finding, and an engaging progression system including Weapons, Gems, Talents, <a title="Genres > Crafting [42 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">Crafting</a>, Legendary items and more. Additionally, the Open Beta will introduce a new dungeon “Urrak Markets,” new gameplay features like cosmetic customization allowing players to change the look of different pieces of armor, new Gear, new Mounts, new visual element improvements and improvements on previous gameplay mechanics based on Steam Next Fest player feedback. The Open Beta will allow Chief Rebel to test multiplayer matchmaking improvements they’ve made, and give the team the chance to get one final round of player feedback before <em>Fellowship</em>’s Early Access launch.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_984531"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>■ About the Game</strong></p><p><em>Fellowship</em> is a multiplayer online dungeon adventure set in an exciting fantasy setting, with endlessly scaling dungeon runs. Players must focus on working together as a team, with an emphasis on skill, cooperation, and strategy to defeat bosses, collect loot, and work together to overcome ever-present challenges. <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> the “Holy Trinity” and build the ultimate team of tanks, healers and damage dealers to take down hordes of enemies and imposing bosses. Work together with your friends to overcome the greatest challenges, creating unbreakable bonds and memorable moments. Players can also flex their individual skills on the competitive leaderboards that show where you stand in <em>Fellowship</em>. Persevere, overcome and ascend through the top ranks in <em>Fellowship</em>!</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Gather Your Perfect Team</strong> – Play alongside your friends in teams with 4 Player Co-op Multiplayer in a rich, fantasy world full of challenging enemies and exciting rewards. Swap between a large pool of tank, healer and DPS roles with unique kits to build the perfect balance for your team.</li><li><strong>Endless Scaling Replayability</strong> – Every run will feel like a brand-new challenge with dungeons that will get more difficult as players progress and level up. Players will never out level the game with seasonal updates, dungeon modifiers, new features and rewards that will keep each run fresh and exciting, adding another layer of replayability.</li><li><strong>Unique and Complex Boss Mechanics</strong> – Each boss has unique and varied mechanics, for a fresh experience every run. Enemy skills grow as difficulty increases and additional modifiers continue to challenge players as they grow and improve.</li><li><strong>Rewards, Loot, and Gear Galore</strong> – After each completed dungeon run, players will earn loot to make their characters even more powerful! The tougher the dungeon, the better the rewards.</li><li>Players will find that <em>Fellowship</em>‘s most unique feature that sets it apart is how it streamlines the dungeon running experience and how players can take part in endlessly scaling dungeon runs. Instead of grinding and spending hours to be able to access and go on endgame-like dungeon runs, with <em>Fellowship</em>, players can dive right into these types of dungeon runs from the beginning. Unlike other titles, including <a title="Genres > Massively Multiplayer Online [53 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/mmo">MMOs</a>, there’s no barrier of entry at all—whether it’s time commitment-specific or needing to get through a ton of prerequisite content—for being able to jump into endgame dungeons in <em>Fellowship</em>. Both newcomers and seasoned veterans will discover they can get the dungeon experience they want from the start, as they can choose to play Quick Play that offer more casual 10-15-minute dungeon runs or Ranked that offers a more competitive experience with Curses, Ascensions and difficulty scaling that drastically change the dungeon running experience.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

                <p>Gamescom had a flurry of announcements during the ONL presentation, but also glimpses of already-announced games, including the long-awaited sequel to Hollow Knight, Hollow Knight: Silksong. Taking on the role of Hornet this time around, the princess-protector is on a deadly pilgrimage in an unfamiliar world. At Gamescom, we got to go hands-on with the game, and you can check out the new gameplay in the video below.</p><p>As the game was delayed time and time again, fans became increasingly angsty about when it would actually be released. But here we are, and yes, we've played it, but there's a small caveat...which we'll get into.</p>

      </div>
<p>While it's not the best audio, so you can't appreciate the somber tones of Christopher Larkin's score, you get the idea of how Hornet moves and how her attacks work. As she was in the first Hollow Knight game, Hornet is equipped with her trusty needle, which also features a charged-up attack to do a little bit more damage. The boss fight with Mother was simple enough, and it's great to finally dive back into the world of Hollow Knight again.</p><p>However, you may recognize the footage, as we got to play this same portion of the game back at E3 in 2019. Maybe Team Cherry doesn't want to give anything away and felt this was the most put-together level to start out with for players who might have played either Hollow Knight or didn't get a chance six years ago.</p><p>There is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-teasing-a-special-announcement-this-week/1100-6534072/" data-ref-id="1100-6534072">special presentation for the game on Thursday</a>, which could finally reveal an official release date and more information on the story itself. Team Cherry has said the game will be ready in time for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-still-coming-in-2025-according-to-team-cherry/1100-6533575/" data-ref-id="1100-6533575">a 2025 release</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fifteen years after being canceled on Fox, <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/arts-entertainment/king-of-the-hill-texas-season-14-hulu/?fbclid=IwY2xjawMB9QNleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFxNmJ5SHA1Ukh5ZE00ek1hAR6Eho8jFHZ1dguQy86TWfSc28TM5aErfFTg2PUOqZSRubzgGY4zmjknFyOb7w_aem_k9HwRj0yMTJjBQUVV9cv9g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>King of the Hill</em></a> is back. Its fourteenth season doesn’t only mark the return of Hank Hill, America’s dad before <em>American Dad</em>; it canonizes the <a href="https://x.com/RABtoons/status/1953969295698145748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme-belief</a> that the long-running animated sitcom is, in fact, our nation’s greatest anime. And it does so by pulling off a shonen classic narrative trope straight out of <em>Naruto</em>’s playbook: a timeskip arc.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="King of the Hill Season 14 | Credit Sequence Reveal | Hulu" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R189-YSWvsY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>If the original run of <em>King of the Hill</em> was its <a href="https://kotaku.com/naruto-shippuden-anime-director-s-ocean-cut-filler-fan-1848765385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Naruto</em> </a>era, then season 14 is its sequel series, <em>Naruto Shippuden</em>. <em>King of the Hill</em>’s time-lapse opening, which used to show a lazy afternoon with Hank and the crew drinking beers in the alley, now provides an update that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R189-YSWvsY&amp;pp=ygUia2luZyBvZiB0aGUgaGlsbCBzZWFzb24gMTQgb3BlbmluZw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fills in the gaps of what happened during the show’s break</a>—like Bobby Hill moving out and Hank and Peggy going to work in Saudi Arabia before returning home—cleverly helping viewers catch up. Like its viewers (present party included), Bobby Hill has grown up, and so has the series. Like <em>Naruto</em>, <em>King of the Hill</em>’s timeskip serves as a narrative reorientation, graduating Bobby Hill from being the show's emotional core to its main character.&nbsp;</p><p><em>King of the Hill</em>’s timeskip doubles as a worthwhile thematic addition to what the show’s been cooking narratively (with propane, naturally) since 1997. The madcap adults who once shaped its younger cast’s suburban living now sit comfortably in the background with their narrative arcs largely complete. Now, they’ve become the mentor figures, Kakashis and Jirayas clad in denim jeans, saying “Yep” in a back alley with brewskies in hand, while Bobby, Joseph Gribble, and Connie Souphanousinphone navigate the messy landscape of adulthood in a world that’s changed just as much as they have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout its 10 episodes, the new season leans into shonen tropes with surprising sincerity. Topics such as generational tension, inherited trauma, the burden of legacy, and the slow, painful process of self-actualization are as present for Bobby as they were for his father in the original series. Growing up, Bobby Hill was my Naruto Uzumaki before I ever watched <em>Naruto</em>. And Bobby’s journey mirrors Naruto Uzumaki’s in ways that feel eerily similar. He was the weird kid who didn’t necessarily fit in, questioned everything, and had the uncanny ability to make folks laugh with how infectiously likable he was. Whereas Hank once grimaced at Bobby’s love of improv, yoga, and anything he deemed remotely “unmanly,” the new season reframes those moments as foundational to Bobby as an adult.&nbsp;</p><p>All lessons that followed in <em>Naruto Shippuden</em>, where Naruto, after a three-year absence from his hometown, made&nbsp;his grand return as a young man who would eventually become the hero he had always claimed to be. Although Bobby doesn’t return as a ninja, he defies traditional career paths laid out before him by sticking to his guns, not attending college, and becoming the head chef at an Asian fusion restaurant. Our boy smokes weed and fucks, all while following his nindo to live a curious life unafraid of celebrating what makes him happy, gender norms be damned. Granted, not everything is perfect for Bobby, but watching him navigate those early adulting struggles is as compelling as watching him navigate adolescence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="King of the Hill S14 | Official Trailer | Hulu" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GleTI7jDWOs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Like any good shonen sequel, <em>King of the Hill</em> doesn’t just rely on nostalgia by playing familiar hits—it questions what it means to be a sequel that relies on cheap pop culture <a href="https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Memberberries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memberberries</a>. <em>King of the Hill</em>’s timeskip forces its characters and viewers to reckon with what’s changed and what hasn’t in good old Arlen, Texas, and whether it’s better to leave things in the past instead of wishing for things to be the way they used to be. Hank, now retired, returns to Arlen and finds himself bewildered by Uber review etiquette, all-gender bathrooms, and maonsphere influencers poisoning the minds of young men. But the show doesn’t resign itself to mocking cultural shifts. It explores them with the same quiet dignity and dry wit that made it a standout in the first place. Hank’s arc is no longer about raising Bobby right—it’s about learning to let go and trust that the boy he raised can carry on himself (and ask for help if needed).</p><p>Having watched the show as a kid, seeing Hank’s newfound trust in adult Bobby was a hard-won milestone. Since the show’s start, Bobby’s existence was always considered miraculous. He was famously born to a man with a narrow urethra and no butt, to a married couple who adopted their bloodhound, Ladybird, believing they would never have children. As a pudgy little guy and the son of a football quarterback who peaked in high school, Bobby’s coming-of-age was never going to be easy. He wasn’t athletic, didn’t conform to gender norms, and often clashed with Hank’s conservative worldview. Hank's complicated relationship with his son is also shaped by his troubled bond with his father, Cotton Hill, a Hall of Fame sexist who routinely tried to mold Bobby in his image. But that tension was the show’s beating heart. It gave viewers a father who learned to love his son not despite his differences, but because of them. It also gave viewers a son who never stopped being himself, even when his father said “he ain’t right.”&nbsp;</p><p>Season 14 doesn’t erase the legacy the show built as an animated sitcom that was not mean-spirited about child rearing — it expands on it. The only difference this time is that the show’s revival no longer reflects the world as it once did. If anything, its world is far kinder than ours. Still, <em>King of the Hill</em> addresses modern issues with the same conservative-liberal back-and-forth it always has, now with a bit more nuance, with Bobby as our main character. Throughout the show, Bobby questions progressive phenomena, such as Connie’s ethical non-monogamous relationships and the fine line between cultural appropriation and appreciation, as well as weighty existential fears like making space for his parents in his life before it's too late. All of these elements exceeded my wary expectations as a '90s baby who grew up alongside Bobby.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="King of the Hill | Recap | Hulu" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jwG1PjiBmi0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>King of the Hill</em>’s cult status as an anime has as much to do with <a href="https://www.cracked.com/article_43623_japanese-king-of-the-hill-fans-have-been-arguing-over-subs-vs-dubs-for-decades.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subs vs. dub debates</a>, its relaxing slice-of-life pacing, and expressive character animation as it does with its emotional arcs. Speaking with IGN at San Diego Comic-Con, series co-creator Mike Judge acknowledged the fandom’s comparisons to anime, and it’s easy to see why in retrospect. The way its characters moved with a fluidity that rivals any Studio Ghibli work. What’s more, the show’s signature soft, comfy watercolor background art, which remained a series constant up until its thirteenth season, remains truly remarkable to watch all these years later. It was so spectacular that Judge felt it behooved him to note season 14’s digital animation, saying its watercolor look and hand-drawn style are <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/king-of-the-hill-hulu-f-bombs-voice-recasting-animation-criticism-1236335752/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the relics of a bygone era</a>. That’s as monogamous to the anime industry’s refrain about <a href="https://kotaku.com/anime-cels-are-starting-to-get-more-valuable-than-ever-1847242159" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why modern shows aren’t cel animated</a> like <em>Akira </em>anymore as it gets.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="King of the Hill is a slice-of-life anime #sdcc" width="563" height="1000" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_6DPS-uAL4s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Sure, my <em>King of the Hill</em> <em>Naruto </em>comparison would be more apt had I drawn a parallel to <em>Naruto</em>’s spin-off series, <em>Boruto</em>, which follows Naruto’s eponymous son and the next generation of brightly-colored superpowered heroes. But I haven’t watched <em>Boruto</em>, and frankly, I don’t have the spoons to commit to another shonen saga with no end in sight. What I do have is an infinite curiosity to see how the new <em>King of the Hill</em> fully Kakashi Hatake’s Hank Hill—letting him fade into the background while Bobby, Connie, and Joseph take center stage. Like me, they’re not the kids anymore, and they’re just as clueless as their parents when it comes to scraping by in a world that’s just as confusing, hilarious, and profoundly courteous as Arlen ever was. Long live<em> King of the Hill: Shippuden</em>.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/naked-gun-2025-review-movie"><h3>The Naked Gun Will Heal Cinema</h3></a><p>The Naked Gun is a glorious return to lowbrow humor, and an acknowledgement that we're not better than an extended poop joke.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bioshock-4-rod-fergusson-cloud-chamber-layoffs-2k-games"><h3>History Doesn’t Repeat, But It Often Rhymes</h3></a><p>There’s always a lighthouse, there’s always a man (Rod Fergusson), there’s always a city</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ai-voice-acting-soundalike-video-games"><h3>‘It’s Just Not Impressive If A Robot Is Doing It:’ Soundalike Voice Actors On AI</h3></a><p>Jennifer Hale joins voice actors calling for ethical boundaries as AI reshapes (and erases) the traditions of soundalike performances</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mafia-old-country-review-impressions"><h3>Curling Up With A Sandwich, A Warm Drink And Mafia: The Old Country</h3></a><p>'I'm genuinely wistful for a good 'ol 7/10, last-days-of -summer video game'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/king-of-the-hill-season-14-anime]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizard of the Coast's and Archetype Entertainment's <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG is now out. This tabletop adaptation of the AAA sci-fi game, announced with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/upcoming-sci-fi-game-exodus-is-getting-official-ttrpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">limited info in 2024</a>, is shipping out, and it provides a spacefaring twist on the rules of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The Exodus TTRPG Release</h2>

<p>On their official webpage, Wizards of the Coast are selling two <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG books. The <em>Traveler's Handbook</em> contains rules for both players and Game Masters to help them get started. The <em>Exodus Encyclopedia</em> contains rules on alien creatures, beings that inhabit abandoned starships, and uncharted worlds.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/exodus-ttrpg-book-artwork.jpg?itok=A5qt_aNP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/exodus-ttrpg-book-artwork.jpg?itok=UzYIC2rs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The <em>Exodus</em> videogame was announced at the 2023 Game Awards. The game's creative head is James Ohlen, a game industry veteran whose work includes the original <em>Baldur's Gate</em>, <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, and <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em>. Aside from some pre-rendered trailers and an episode in the Prime Video anthology series, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-level-brings-videogame-anthology-to-prime-video" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Secret Level</em></a>, not much else is known about its core gameplay or its setting.</p>

<p>The <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG helps shed some light in this regard. According to a deep dive <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/exodus/dnd-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">by Wargamer</a>, players take on the role of Travelers. They are a community of space explorers who seek riches and advanced technology to bring back to their home world. The catch is that there is time dilation with FTL travel, meaning by the time they return home, years will have passed.</p>

<p>As for the RPG system at its core, it's <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition with some sci-fi tweaks. Gameplay caps at level 10 instead of level 20, but players' stats increase faster thanks to a Constellation tattoo mechanic. The game features four classes, each with two subclasses. Lastly, magic and magic items are replaced with substantive equipment, gear, augmentations, and spaceships.</p>

<p>The <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG is the latest part of a transmedia marketing approach to the Exodus game. This transmedia approach includes a novel, and the Star Heist actual play series.</p>

<p>The <em>Traveler's Handbook</em> is available at an MSRP of $28.55. The <em>Exodus Encyclopedia</em> is being sold for $35.99. Alternatively, the two-book bundle is available for $64.54.</p>

One of the nude mods replaced Isabella Torrisi’s in-game model with a nude version.&nbsp; The other mod, “Extended Textures For Nude Isabella,” allowed players to modify the character’s model, letting them give her “bigger nipples, bigger areola,” and even offering “cute pubic hair” options, according to text still indexed on Google search results. Both of these mods were created by Nexus user norskpl.</p> <p>“A takedown/DMCA request was issued by Lisa Deere [on behalf of Take Two Interactive Software, Inc.] on 08/12/2025,” posted a Nexus mod rep on the forums. “We were able to internally verify the legitimacy of this claim through the requesting of additional evidence to prove the identity of the claimant and the rights they hold over the content in question.”</p> <p>Interestingly, screenshots of the mod seem to indicate that norskpl didn’t create the nude model of Isabella themselves, but instead ripped it out of a different part of <em>The </em><em>Old Country</em> which features a nude Torrisi in bed with another character. It seems that they then tweaked the model and added options to modify it using mods. So in a way, this is like Take-Two Interactive’s lawyers DMCAing their own content. It’s an odd situation, but not surprising, <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-is-removing-old-gta-mods-using-dmca-notices-1847315391">as in the past, Take-Two has used DMCA requests</a> to <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-interactive-removes-more-gta-mods-using-dmca-s-1848053219">yank down mods they don’t approve of in other games</a>, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-goes-on-another-grand-theft-auto-mod-killing-s-1847467984"><em>Grand Theft Auto V. </em></a></p> <p>Perhaps using the <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>‘s own pre-existing nude model is the problem, as it is content owned by Take-Two being used in a way they likely don’t approve of. I wonder, had the modder had just replaced the don’s daughter with a nude Shrek or Thanos, if Take-Two lawyers would have shown up at all.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals continues to get plenty of attention, and with the launch of a new limited-time game mode, several balance changes have also been made.</p>



<p>Now deep into Season 3.5, players will be forgiven for starting to look ahead to Season 4 and wondering what’s in store, but the launch of Klyntar’s Resource Rumble mode should keep you busy for the time being.</p>



<p>It’s worth keeping on top of all the balance changes, however, so you’re familiar with all the buffs and nerfs. We’ve got all the details for you here.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-marvel-rivals-august-20-buffs-amp-nerfs">All Marvel Rivals August 20 Buffs &amp; Nerfs</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Buffed. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Marvel Rivals balance changes on August 20 impact three heroes, with Blade, recently added at the start of Season 3.5, given a buff, while Human Torch and Loki receive a nerf.</strong></p>



<p>Blade has boosted Lifesteal gained during Bloodline Awakening, boosted from 60% to 65%, while the self-healing reduction has been lowered from 40% to 35%.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Human Torch’s Flame Field damage over time has been reduced to 20/s from 25/s, with Pyro-Prison damage also reduced from 50/s to 40/s.</p>



<p>In the Strategist department, Loki’s Mythical Missile damage dealt by the God of Mischief and his illusions has been reduced from 30 to 25, although healing for teammates remains unchanged.</p>



<p>All other characters in the game remain untouched, though don’t expect it to remain that way for long as the big end of season balance patch is now just a few weeks out.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-marvel-rivals-version-20250821-patch-notes">Full Marvel Rivals Version 20250821 Patch Notes</h2>

<p><strong>Blade</strong></p>

<p>– Increase Lifesteal gained during Bloodline Awakening from 60% to 65%. Reduce self-healing reduction from 40% to 35%.</p>



<p><strong>Human Torch</strong></p>



<p>Johnny Storm’s heat is still on, but his flame’s been dialed back just enough for ground heroes to catch their breath!</p>



<p>– Reduce Flame Field (right-click on terrain) Damage Over Time from 25/s to 20/s.</p>



<p>– Reduce Pyro-Prison Damage Over Time from 50/s to 40/s.</p>

<p>Skate made an appearance during the Future Games Show at Gamescom, with the big announcement being a tease for a major update next week as Early Access looms.</p>



<p>The EA title, relaunching the franchise after a 15-year hiatus, has been in Closed Alpha stage for months, but with the end of the summer looming large, big news is seemingly on the horizon.</p>



<p>In a developer interview shown at Future Games Show, details were shared about development, including the in-depth parkour features, with a sign-off to keep eyes peeled for a big announcement next week.</p>



<h2 id="h-skate-poised-for-big-update-ahead-of-early-access">Skate Poised For Big Update Ahead of Early Access</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Early Access is coming. Image via EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The comments at Future Games Show align with a recent <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1957843556678136288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter) directed to Skate Insiders, informing them that maintenance will take place from today, August 20, until August 26, leaving the game inaccessible.</p>



<p>With Summer 2025 stated as the release for Early Access, and just a few weeks left until we tick into September and leave the Summer behind, next week’s big update could well be the launch into Early Access.</p>



<p>Skate will be released on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC, though it’s not clear yet whether the title will eventually make its way onto Nintendo Switch 2, nor do we know when a full launch will be.</p>



<p>Keep an eye on Skate’s social media channels for the big announcement next week, which we’ll also cover here at Insider Gaming.</p>
