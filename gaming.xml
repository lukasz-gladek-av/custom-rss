		<p>Creepy Jar has released new footage of StarRupture with ten minutes that shows off the world as well as some gameplay from the latest build. The video acts as a tour of Arcadia-7 showing off the inviting looking environment that holds lots of perils and dangers to be aware of. Players will have to get familiar with those dangers pretty quickly while base building.</p>
<p><iframe title="StarRupture: The World of Arcadia-7 Showcase" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/srtUwMGwCuE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In StarRupture, players take on the role of an exile from Earth who has been tasked with mining and expanding a base as part of their sentence. The game will be able feature co-op for up to four players, but if you want to explore this frontier alone you can. Weather cycles of the planet and regular attacks by Arcadia-7’s creatures will impede player progress, so learning the patterns and consequences of the dangers will be critical to making it through the days. If you are interested in StarRupture you will have to wait a little bit longer to get hands on with it. Creepy Jar has confirmed that StarRupture will be coming to Steam Early Access in the autumn.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/11/green-hell-review-spirits-of-amazonia/">Green Hell Review</a></h2>
<p>Creepy Jar previously released Green Hell, and in our review Steve said, <em>“Green Hell is a fantastic survival experience with an exemplary sense of place and peril. Creepy Jar have really nailed the feeling of loneliness and despair that true isolation would lead to and married this to some well balanced challenges and a refreshingly user friendly approach. The range of ways to play are really welcome and should ensure that even those players who may be turned off by the rigours of hunger and thirst mechanics can enjoy the immersive jungle experience. This may not be a welcoming jungle, but there’s plenty of fun and games to be had.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/astral-chain-director-and-nier-automata-designer-takahisa-taura-has-left-platinumgames-to-form-his-own-studio/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The exodus of PlatinumGames' hugely talented developers continues, with Astral Chain director and designer on Nier Automata, <strong>Takahisa Taura</strong>, confirming that he has also left the studio, though not to follow Hideki Kamiya to Clovers. Instead, Taura founded Eel Game Studio with a few other founding members.</p>
<p>In an interview with Famitsu (transcribed by <a href="https://x.com/genki_jpn/status/1917511865078538755?s=46">Genki</a>, spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/top-platinumgames-designer-quits-studio-starts-new-game-company/">VGC</a>), Taura confirmed his departure from Platinum and the founding of his new studio, but wouldn't say who the other founding members are. He also confirmed that despite beginning this new adventure, he'll still collaborate with Yoko Taro, Yosuke Saito, and Keiichi Okabe on an unannounced project.</p>
<p>All four were key members of Nier Automata, so this unannounced project could potentially be Nier-related, but it's still too early to tell.</p>
<p>Hideki Kamiya, former creative lead at PlatinumGames and one of the studio's founders, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-leaving/">left Platinum in 2023</a>, kicking up a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-leaving/">YouTube channel at first</a> while working to form another new studio, <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/">Clovers</a>. Which, as fans of Kamiya's work immediately recognized, was a callback to a studio Kamiya previously founded, Clover.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/hideki-kamiya-on-returning-to-his-roots-with-clovers-and-okami-2/">VGC</a> last year, Kamiya confirmed that the developers who started Clovers with him were mainly former PlatinumGames members, and that he left Platinum mostly because he was unsatisfied there.</p>
<p>"<em>If I was satisfied at Platinum, then I wouldn't have left. If there was one thing I am worried about, it's the fact I was VP and chief game designer of PlatinumGames. And so with me quitting, I worry about the people there, the staff there. Of course, if they're motivated and happy at Platinum, I believe that's the right path for them. But if there are others whose mindset aligns more with what we're building here at Clovers, we want to welcome and provide a path for them, too. I see that as a responsibility I have to those people after leaving Platinum.</em>"</p>
<p>Of course, Kamiya is speaking for himself, but his words raise questions about how things are internally at Platinum. Taura, like Kamiya, is another massive talent the studio is missing now.</p>
<p>This is not to say that PlatinumGames is without talented developers. It's just to point out that Platinum was a happy home for some of the best and most storied developers in the video game industry for years until it wasn't. It'll be interesting to see how the studio continues to evolve.</p>
<p>And regarding Taura and Eel Game Studio, hopefully it's not too long before we see what they're working on.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/koei-tecmo-financials-profits</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/koei-tecmo-profits-exceed-expectations-due-to-new-releases.1178658/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/koei-tecmo-financials-profits<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>studio Koei Tecmo has released its financial results for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and the studio has reported rising profits, largely informed by new releases.</p>

<p>Per the latest Koei Tecmo financial <a href="https://www.koeitecmo.co.jp/e/ir/docs/ir3_20250501_e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the studio's operating profit has risen by around 12% over last year, and it's also about 7% higher than the studio's forecast for the twelve-month period.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo says the increase in its profit is largely down to "our new title release", although the studio does also say that "download sales of back catalog titles have grown". Cost reductions have also contributed to increased profits, according to the report.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dynasty-warriors-origins-koei-tecmo-financials-2025.jpg?itok=JK4yqpbK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dynasty-warriors-origins-koei-tecmo-financials-2025.jpg?itok=o_tsHFIO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins&nbsp;</em>is one of Koei Tecmo's most successful new releases.</figcaption></figure><p>The releases to which Koei Tecmo is referring are likely&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dynasty-warriors-origins-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">sold a million copies in its first month</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories and the Envisioned Land</em>, which serves as the&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>franchise's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-yumia-sales-300k-fastest-selling" rel="nofollow">fastest-selling title</a>.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo hasn't revealed any information about the sales performance of&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2: Black</em>, but given that the game was released simultaneously on Game Pass, it's unlikely it's done quite as well as the two aforementioned titles. Still, if&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>can do it</a>, so can&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, I suppose.</p>

<p>In terms of future games, Koei Tecmo is currently gearing up to release a new game in the&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>series,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-and-white-guardian" rel="nofollow"><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian</em></a>, which is set to launch sometime this year, although we don't have a release date for it yet.</p>




<p>The studio is also looking ahead to the launch of&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, which is a co-development project between Team Ninja and&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta&nbsp;</em>studio PlatinumGames. That's due to arrive sometime this year as well, although again, we don't have a concrete release date.</p>

<p>You can read the highlights of Koei Tecmo's <a href="https://www.koeitecmo.co.jp/e/ir/docs/ir1_20250430_e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial report right here</a> if you want to get nerdy with the numbers. We'll bring you more on this as soon as we get it.</p>

That's not a <em>small</em> amount of content.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4485822-legofortnitestarwarsstuff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485822" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4485822-legofortnitestarwarsstuff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485822"></a><figcaption>Brick Bay is about to get a big makeover.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4485822-legofortnitestarwarsstuff.jpg"></figure><p>The main event here is definitely the Star Wars Festival in Brick Life, which will show up on Friday and stick around until June 7. There's all sorts of stuff to do, from getting a Bantha Burger at the new Durr Burger Cantina to playing space soccer and dueling with lightsabers--not to mention more chill activities like chilling with an adorable little porg.</p><p>To get started, you'll want to visit with the Apprentice Evie NPC, who will give you quests that will show you everything the festival has to offer. And even though the festival only lasts a month, it won't be static--more activities will be added as the festival goes on.</p><p>Over in Lego Fortnite Odyssey, the Star Wars island is returning for May 4th (Star Wars Day) in everyone's world, but that's not the main attraction here. Starting May 15, you'll have the chance to try out the new Rapid Survival mode, in which you compete against other players, via matchmaking, on a fresh, time-limited version of the Star Wars island. You only get four hours to do your thing, progress is dramatically accelerated, PvP is on, and if you're killed the session is over. Rapid Survival itself is also temporary--it's only sticking around until May 26.</p><p>And, of course, there's also the new First Order Lego Pass, which costs 1400 V-Bucks and is included with Fortnite Crew. The big prize here is the Captain Phasma skin, which has a standard version you can take into battle royale in addition to the Lego style. After that, there's a nice pile of new First Order-themed builds in the pass, as well as a jam track and an emote. The First Order Lego Pass is progressed by gaining XP in any Fortnite mode, and will be available until June 7.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"Effective immediately, Apple will no longer impede developers' ability to communicate with users," Gonzalez Rogers says in the ruling, "nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases." Gonzales Rogers also rebuked Apple's "willfully" choosing not to comply with the original 2021 ruling, saying "that [Apple] thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation."</p><p dir="ltr">After the ruling was released, Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1917716512347152499" rel="nofollow ">announced that Fortnite would return to the US iOS App Store</a> "next week." He also offered Apple what he referred to as a "peace proposal," saying that "if Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, [Epic will] return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic."</p><p>Apple has said it will appeal the order in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659310/apple-confirms-it-will-appeal-the-app-store-order" rel="nofollow ">statement to The Verge</a>. "We strongly disagree with the decision," the statement reads. "We will comply with the court’s order and we will appeal."</p>

		<p>Microsoft is raising prices on Xbox consoles in a number of major markets around the world, the company has confirmed.</p>
<p>In the UK the Xbox Series X will now cost £499.99, a £20 jump, and the 512GB Xbox Series S will be £299.99, a £50 jump.</p>


<p>In Europe, the Xbox Series X will now cost €599.99, a €50 jump, and the 512GB Xbox Series S will be €349.99, a €50 jump.</p>
<p>And the US is facing the steepest price increases with the Xbox Series X now $599.99, a $100 jump, and 512GB Xbox Series S now $429.99, an $80 increase. The price of headsets and certain controllers are increasing in the US and Canada.</p>
<p>In the longer term, Microsoft has announced that some first party games will launch with a $79.99 retail price this winter – so Doom: The Dark Ages is unaffected later this month, and existing releases are not changing. Xbox Game Pass subscriptions also aren’t changing price at this time.</p>

<p>In the support page announcing the changes, Microsoft says, “We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and ensuring value for Xbox players.”</p>
<p>The price hike follows Sony <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/ps5-price-increases-hit-uk-eu-aus-nz-but-at-least-the-disc-drive-is-getting-cheaper/">increasing the price of PlayStation 5 consoles in the UK, Europe, Australia and NZ</a>, and with console and game pricing very much in the focus of gamers following the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-set-for-june-5th-2025/">pricing announcements</a>. Microsoft has also just posted their quarterly financials, which showed gaming revenue increasing, while Xbox hardware sales continued to trend downwards.</p>
<p>This all comes, of course, in the shadow of Trump’s tariffs in the US. While the price increases have hit the US hardest, it could look like Microsoft is spreading the burden of those import tariffs across the globe, hoping to lessen the blow in their biggest market.</p>
<p>So, that’s nice.</p>

            <p>Demon-swarmed fantasy ARPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path Of Exile 2</a> got a patch today that should have, in theory, increased the rarity of loot dropped for players across all parts of the game. Instead, the game began deleting their <a href="https://pathofexile2.wiki.fextralife.com/Skill+Gems">Skill Gems</a> - the extremely important stones that players use to perform all manner of attacks, spells, and defensive magicks. The developers quickly shut down the servers and rolled back the game, leading to a five-hour outage and a bunch of players who are now even more annoyed than they have been in recent weeks. And trust me, that is <em>annoyed</em>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The intended changes meant to land in today's update would've turned on the loot faucet significantly. It was a response, said the developers, to player gripes about item drops feeling very stingy in certain scenarios, like when you bash your way through a unique boss fight only to watch as it drops a normal and boring item worth very little to you or anyone. The hope with this update was that such disappointment would now happen a lot less.</p>
<p>"Over the last two weeks we have done a major rework to item drops in order to try and address these issues," said developers Grinding Gear Games in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2694490/announcements/detail/521964211468763217?snr=2___">an update post</a>. "These changes significantly improve the effect that Item Rarity has on the quality of the items you receive. Overall you should see significantly better items when killing more challenging content."</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/Grinding Gear Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The changes were broad and promising. They added "drop protection" to powerful bosses so they would always drop a rare item. Some higher tier items would now drop up to five times as often. And the rarity of items found in strongboxes, magic chests, and rare chests would be "drastically increased" (although the chance of the latter two chest types spawning would be lowered). The full notes explain a lot of other increases and bumps to item rarity - so <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2694490/announcements/detail/521964211468763217?snr=2___">go look at those</a> if you're curious.</p>
<p>It all seemed like a positive change to Path Of Exile 2 players who have been grumbling about the state of the game since the divisive Dawn Of The Hunt update last month, which sowed frustration by slowing combat down and making it harder to blast away crowds of monsters. This loot offering could have been just the thing to bolster player morale. Until the update was applied, at which point all glitch-hell seems to have broken loose. </p>
<p>"Today we experienced around 5 hours of realm downtime for Path of Exile 2," said the developers in <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3775016">a post explaining what happened</a>. "After deploying [the update] we had reports of people's Skill Gems being deleted on login. We immediately shut the realm down to prevent further damage to people's skills and attempted to roll back the database."</p>
<p>That rollback procedure itself became sticky, and in the end the shutdown lasted much longer than anyone would have liked. The reason Skill Gems started going poof is basically down to a database snafu: the gems were supposed to be "marked as being unable to be changed", an adjustment that evidently went badly wrong. </p>
<p>"There are multiple ways in which this kind of problem is normally caught," said the devs, "but they all failed in this case."</p>
<p>The game is now back up and running as normal. Meanwhile, the loot-loosening patch, as it was originally intended, will be rolled out in a fixed state later today, say Grinding Gear Games, who seem pretty contrite about the whole thing. </p>
<p>"Obviously this incident is unacceptable, and we would like to apologise for all the inconvenience caused. This isn't an acceptable level of service. We will be making improvements in response to this incident and hopefully will not suffer such a long downtime again."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This means an Xbox Series X will now retail for $600 (previously $500) and that select first-party games will start going for $80 this holiday season.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not just Xbox Series X, either. The cheaper Xbox Series S 512GB system will now start at $380 (previously $300), meaning the entry price to this generation is more expensive than when it began in 2020. "We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development," the Xbox support page says revealing the price increases. "Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and ensuring value for Xbox players."</p><p dir="ltr">Below is a list of the Xbox consoles and accessories changing in price in the US.

		<p>Glum is not your usual hero – if he’s a hero at all, that is –&nbsp;but when the ruler of his realm and all the more typical strongmen and magic-wielders are ousted in a surprise coup, it’s up to Glum to save the day. The one problem is, he’s just a weedy goblin, a crude, rage-filled janitor who’s not very good at fighting and only has one magical boot to help him on his way.</p>
<p><iframe title="GLUM | Early Access Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dM2ImzavibQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In what CinderCat call a ‘First Person Booter’, kicking is your one and only offensive weapon, but even that isn’t really a weapon in the traditional sense. This magical force boot is basically only good for shoving things quite hard, so you have to use this in creative ways, pushing enemies around and using the environment to deal damage, rack up combo scores, and play around.</p>


<p>The initial inspiration for Glum came from 2006’s Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, where you could stick the boot in as part of the game’s blend of first-person action RPG combat. Kicking didn’t deal damage, but could shove enemies back, pushing them down stairs, out windows, into spike racks and more. As Glum strips away all the other attacking options, it’s that one idea that provides the lynchpin for its combat and its traversal.</p>
<p>You kick to do literally everything in Glum. If you need to open a door? You kick it (and you can charge up your kick to completely smash the door). Want to boot farmyard animals? You can do that. Need to get up to that ledge? Just jump and then wall-kick from an opposing surface to propel yourself up there. Heck, you even kick your way through dialogue in the game!</p>


<p>This all feeds into sandbox levels, the opening area of the game being a traditional-looking fantasy city, but it’s one that’s filled with cruel and unusual hazards. You can kick enemies into public toilets to have them swallowed up whole, kick them into unattended meat grinders and get a little sausage in return – this is a chicken nugget if you kick a chicken into one –&nbsp;kick them into bounce platforms to fling them across the world, into furnaces, and on and on.</p>
<p>As you progress, the magical boot gains more abilities, including the Boot-zooka, where you aim your boot and blast it from your foot to clobber someone from a distance. The Foot Fish, on the other hand, will pull enemies and objects toward you which, if you’re in motion and have good aim, gives you the chance to chain a kick together and send them off in a totally new direction.</p>
<p>It’s all about “play with your food” gameplay, as CinderCat call it, like a cat playing with a mouse before eating it. That’s pretty morbid when you think about it for too long (or when you find a deceased mouse buried behind your shoe rack a week later), but in this game it’s a kind of whimsical violence that will light up the eyes of anyone who loves shooters that reward deft movement and skill.</p>

<p>It will all build up, in this first level, to a boss fight against a combine harvester and showdown against Major A.S.S Lesley, but throughout there’s a score attack being totted up in the top corner of the screen, tracking the chaos as you progress through the game.</p>
<p>If the Major’s name didn’t give you a clue, then running through the game is a childish, puerile sense of humour. Glum is not a nice goblin, with a dedicated taunt button that doesn’t affect your score, but will let you give a one-fingered salute to anyone and anything in the game. I think it will be interesting to see how CinderCat balances that crudeness with being funny throughout, no doubt aiming to strike the kind of filthy balance that Conker’s Bad Fur Day managed 25 years ago.</p>

<p>There’s an uplifting story to the game’s development and the team in general, given the difficult times that are faced across the industry. CinderCat Games is a small indie team that was founded while a group of Masters degree students went through their final years of higher education. Having come together in 2021, they eventually managed to go full-time together after completing their degrees, got an initial batch of funding, and were able to take this First Person Booter around to publishers with a lot of positive interest. Interest that dried up in 2023, putting the project and company at risk, until they were able to pound the floor, speak to more investors and get the funding in the middle of last year to let them continue.</p>
<p>Now Glum is prepping for a kick and a jump into Steam Early Access on 22nd May, looking to build a community around the game to feed even more into the broader game design, world building and story. There’s already plans for a second map in the summer, and a third, spooky map in time for Halloween.</p>

Nor do mobile games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/04/23/the-elder-scrolls-blades-early-access-review">The Elder Scrolls Blades</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/26/fallout-shelter-review">Fallout Shelter</a>, although I’ve definitely got a soft spot for the latter game’s dark humor and infinite armies of cartoon dwellers captured in the charming Vault Boy style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No, this list is for the heavy hitters, the sprawling, prestige sandboxes that immediately come to mind when one thinks of a capital B, capital G “Bethesda Game,” though admittedly we’re starting out on a rather humble foot with…</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>9: Elder Scrolls: Arena</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The first entry in the franchise isn’t last because it’s a bad game, it’s last because nobody knew what they were doing. The Bethesda of 1994 had basically only made sports and Terminator games, and Arena was kind of a mix of both. Originally, you traveled the world competing in medieval gladiator battles, doing the odd sidequest on the side. The developers quickly realised it would be a cool idea if your fighters could walk around the cities, talk to the people who live there, and dive into incredibly difficult dungeons on their behalf.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The result is an impressive little first-person RPG that’s very much of its era, a “where-the-hell-do-I-go-em-up” in the vein of Ultima Underworld and Might and Magic. Arena has loads of arcane systems and randomized loot, meandering, maddening, sidequests, and extremely clunky movement that will make you forget everything you’ve ever learned about using a mouse. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And given how bad the combat is, the kind of stats-based melee that sees you visually landing hit after hit on rampaging skeletons only to deal no damage thanks to a dice roll, maybe it’s a good thing the developers dropped the whole “gladiator” concept for Arena. Less fortunately, they didn’t drop it fast enough to change the title, since all the marketing materials were already printed up. The best they could do was tack on a “chapter one” and make it seem like the game was part of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/26/top-10-rpg-worlds-of-all-time">larger saga about all-knowing Elder Scrolls</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Declaring your debut the start of a new franchise is a gutsy move that more often than not ends in failure, but the extremely flawed Arena was still successful enough to set Bethesda on a path that would fulfill its prediction, and boldly go beyond.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>8: Starfield</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With every new BGS game comes rumors and discourse on whether this will be the one that finally ditches their aging “Gamebryo” engine, or at least updates the notoriously inefficient cell-based framework beyond its well-known limits. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-review">Starfield did not</a>. “Creation Engine 2.0” might have a fancy new name and a pretty new animation pipeline, but at the end of the day you’re still staring at a loading screen every time you step into a store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The NASApunk sci-fi setting was a welcome departure from the low-tech locales of Tamriel and the Wasteland, even though it’s starting to wear out its welcome, but it’s ill-suited for Bethesda’s style. They’re great at creating one big connected world, full of discoveries, nooks and crannies, and intricately staged skeletons with nearby flavor notes. Instead, Starfield boasts 1,000 procedurally generated planets with what feels like a dozen different points of interest repeated between them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, we've solved more than a few dragon claw puzzles in our day, but somehow that never felt as aggravating as landing on a new planet and stumbling across another abandoned cryo lab or mine. Dear god, the mines. If you’re bored in a samey Draugr dungeon, you can just walk to something cool around the corner. But in Starfield you’re just kinda stuck dejectedly wiping out the pirates, hoofing it back to your spaceship, and blasting off with a sigh.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It might seem harsh to place Starfield so close to something as primitive as Arena, but it’s easier to forgive the shortcomings of a gallant first effort from an inexperienced team than those of a $200 million triple-A behemoth that promised the moon and failed to deliver.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>7: Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One reason the procedural generation in Starfield is such a bummer is that Bethesda has so much experience with it going way, way back. In fact, its second RPG ever is one of the most impressive feats of algorithmic open world creation that ever existed, and it came out in 1997.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The map in Skyrim translates to about <a href="https://gamerant.com/skyrim-map-size-red-dead-redemption-2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>15 square miles,</u></a> and that’s actually on the smaller side compared to games that came out in its wake. <a href="https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/220353/what-is-the-real-scale-of-the-breath-of-the-wild-map" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Breath of the Wild</u></a> and Grand Theft Auto 5’s are both <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/gta-5s-open-world-map-was-so-ahead-of-its-time-that-its-no-surprise-people-are-still-flocking-to-it-10-years-later/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>around 30 square miles</u></a>, give or take. The Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall is <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Daggerfall:Dimensions_of_the_Iliac_Bay" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>80,000 square miles</em></u><u>,</u></a> roughly the size of Great Britain. It’ll take you <a href="https://youtu.be/jYvKzoxVRd4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>69 hours</u></a> to walk across the entire thing, though it’ll go slightly quicker if you’re okay with staring at the back of this horse's head for days on end as your precious time on Earth slowly whittles away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The world is vast, sparse, and kind of ugly, but it’s definitely not empty. The <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Daggerfall:Places" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Iliac Bay area contains</u></a> nine distinct climates, 44 different political regions, and 15,000 points of interest scattered throughout. We’re talking 4,000 dungeons and 5,000 cities or towns populated with hundreds of quests and non-player-characters. Needless to say, there’s a touch of wonky proc-gen involved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what good is a huge world if it’s a slog to move around in? The dungeon-crawling combat is only slightly improved, though the debut of the series’ trademark “improve your stats as you use their skills” progression system is definitely appreciated. In Daggerfall, it’s the experience above ground that made the biggest leap in quality. You can buy houses and boats, join guilds, steal and murder to your heart's content <em>and </em>deal with the consequences. While it’s all relatively simple and extremely opaque, the opportunities for immersion within Daggerfall almost make you wish you could explore it with a friend or two. Almost.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>6: Fallout 76</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You might be confused as to why Fallout 76 is on this list at all, given that it’s more of a live service, multiplayer looter-shooter than an epic, story-driven RPG experience, and if you haven’t played it for a while that’s totally fair. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/22/fallout-76-review">The game was a straight-up disaster at launch</a>, omitting hand-crafted dialogue and non-player characters in the hopes that griefing online randos would be able to provide the flavor that makes Fallout’s wastelands so worthwhile. This was a mistake, to put it mildly, and just one of many. From aggravating loot limits and endless crafting to questionable pricing practices, Fallout 76 was a dud when it debuted in 2018, thanks in no small part to a grueling development cycle that <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-zenimax-fallout-76-crunch-development-1849033233" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>plagued the project</u></a> from the start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-76-review-2024">Things have changed, however</a>. The Wastelanders update added voiced NPCs to the experience, so many in fact that technically it has the most characters of any game in the whole series. Whether they have anything worthwhile to say is still up for debate but they’re there, along with tweaks to the loot system and overall experience that make it less of a slog and more of a passable RPG to play with friends. The game has developed a healthy following, especially in the wake of Amazon’s hit Fallout TV series, but even so, it’s hard to rank Fallout 76 very high given the existence of the superior Elder Scrolls Online, Bethesda’s long-running MMO that only failed to make the cut here because it was developed out of house by Zenimax Online Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout 76’s pivot towards live-service, revenue-generating, trend-chasing slop gave fans grave doubts about Bethesda’s stewardship of the Fallout franchise, but they didn’t exist in a vacuum. Discontent had been brewing for a long time, even as sales skyrocketed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>5: Fallout 4</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">At <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/game/226290/fallout#:~:text=Fallout%204%20%2D%2025%20million,Fallout%2076%20%2D%201.4%20million" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>25 million copies sold,</u></a> Fallout 4 is the most successful game in the series by a wide, wide margin, beyond the wildest dreams of Tim Cain and the rest of the Interplay/Black Isle crew that created the original isometric RPGs in the ’90s, though that success comes with a cost. Streamlined gameplay and welcome quality-of-life features can turn a niche cult classic into a mainstream blockbuster, but balancing that accessibility without sacrificing depth and complexity is no easy task. Fallout 4 fails in that regard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, the good: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/fallout-4-review">Fallout 4 feels great</a>. The movement and shooting feels crisp and responsive compared to its clunky predecessors, and the Commonwealth is more than a worthy environment to explore. A new system that allows you to design and build your own settlements is an impressive addition to Bethesda’s aging tech, though it’s a coin flip as to whether you’ll find it fun or a complete waste of time. The game looks and sounds spectacular, and was arguably the most polished launch product Bethesda produced since… <em>ever</em>. Some of its expansions, particularly Far Harbor, seemed to capture that old Fallout feeling, and there’s at least one all-time classic character to emerge out of the crowd of Bostonian blandness and micromanaging Minutemen in the form of android private eye Nick Valentine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The storyline, revolving around high-tech synthetic humans teleporting from a crisp and clean underground lab, is at odds with the grungy atompunk flavor of the Fallout universe, and the bizarre twist involving the identity of your character’s missing son was both blindingly obvious and incredibly dumb. The whole experience feels like a Fallout-flavored theme park ride, plopping you in power armor to face off with a deathclaw within the first hour of gameplay. From there, the game parades you through a series of shallow choices and uninteresting factions until you pick who you’re going to side with and watch the uninspired endings play out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest detriment to the game has to be the dialogue system. The first Fallout, famously, allows for all sorts of freedom in how the Vault Dweller interacts with the world around them, from monosyllabic grunts to talking the super mutant Master into unaliving himself in the final boss battle. Fallout 4, on the other hand, made the dubious decision to voice all of our protagonist’s interaction, severely limiting their options. Even worse, the four choices offered in response to any situation usually boil down to nice, rude, neutral, and “tell me more.” It’s a disappointing devolution of the RPG formula, but not entirely unsurprising given Bethesda’s first Fallout game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>4: Fallout 3</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">When Bethesda <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPt08UYmyMo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>announced</u></a> it had purchased the rights to the dormant Fallout franchise in 2004, fans went nuclear. For some, Fallout seemed like a perfect fit for the devs that wrote the book on systemic open world sandboxes, but there was a sizeable contingent of gatekeeping grognards who were a little more wary, warning that the Bethesda crew would tone done the anarchic spirit of the first two games for a more bland experience in hopes of capturing a more casual audience. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/28/fallout-3-review">The end result was a little bit of both</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The revival starts out extremely strong, with an opening sequence that begins with your character exiting the womb and then gives a quick crash course in all that life inside Vault 101 has to offer, from bullies to birthday parties. The intro also serves as a tutorial for the V.A.T.S. system, maybe Bethesda’s most brilliant addition to the franchise. The isometric, turn-based Fallout games allowed your character to target individual body parts in combat, allowing for agonizing and often hilarious precision shots. In the leap to first person, BSG compensates for their somewhat muddy controls by letting us freeze time and select precisely where we’d like our strikes to land in one of the most elegant translations of a game mechanic from 2D to 3D ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not everything in Fallout 3 is as successful as V.A.T.S., however. The Capital Wasteland is a fantastic map filled with recognizably ruined national landmarks, but it’s also stuffed with repetitive encounters in subways and sewers awash in a hideous green filter that was all the rage in the early aughts. There are meaningful choices with megaton consequences that ultimately railroad you into an utterly ludicrous ending scenario that requires you to sacrifice your life to radiation while your radiation-immune supermutant friend watches from a safe distance A conclusion that was so derided, Bethesda would eventually patch it by way of the Broken Steel DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the very best and very worst of Bethesda’s instincts laid bare, and the awkward friction integrating BGS’s environmental storytelling with Fallout’s anarchic RPG flavor makes vanilla Fallout 3 a rather unpleasant experience today. An excellent alternative is theTale of Two Wastelands mod that fuses Fallout 3 together with Obsidian Entertainment’s fan-favorite Fallout: New Vegas to create a single massive game. Or if that’s too much of a hassle, you could just wait for the all-but-confirmed remake that’s coming in the wake of Oblivion Remastered. Speaking of which…</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>3: The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This was a tough call. Many of Oblivion’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRi6GBF5zB0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>adoring fans</u></a> might find it blasphemous to be placed before Skyrim, while haters might contest that some of the Fallouts are superior. The truth, as always, is subjective, except for on ranking lists like this, which are infallible, definitive, scientifically determined and legally binding so let’s see how it stacks up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/03/25/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-pc-review">Oblivion is the foundation of modern Bethesda games</a>. Morrowind, obviously, came before, but it’s notable that Fallout, Starfield, and every Bethesda game (and Bethesda wannabe) since 2006 have used Oblivion as the template rather than its predecessor. The awkward pause and zoom in to start a conversation, the OP dominance of stealth archery, the ramping-up power fantasy designed to make a lowly prisoner feel like the most important being in all of Tamriel… It’s all here in pretty much its final form, though with lots of room for improvement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main plot sees you fending off a demonic Daedric invasion alongside a Sean Bean-voiced bastard in a cinematic saga that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/oQGEloRoWaI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>borrows bigtime vibes</u></a> from Peter Jackson’s wildly popular Lord of the Rings trilogy. But it’s the sidequests, particularly those involving the guilds, that really elevate Oblivion. They’re all really solid in Skyrim, too, but Oblivion’s individual missions have a lot more going for them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead of Skyrim’s fairly rote assassinations on behalf of the Dark Mother, your devotion to the Dark Brotherhood in Oblivion is tested by specific kill conditions that make you feel like an Argonian Agent 47. Meanwhile,  while Skyrim’s introduction to the Thieves Guild effectively amounts to getting approached by a recruiter, in Oblivion, it only exists as shadows and rumors, the only clues to their existence are scattered posters and urban legends. You have to work to seek them out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So why did we rank Oblivion below Skyrim? Maybe it’s the eye-searing ugly bloom of the XBox 360 era, or the dorky potato-faced characters stumbling through their lines. It could be the ill-conceived progression system that forces you to grind minor skills for fear of losing precious stat points when you level up, or the repetitive trudging through endless Oblivion gates. Of course, all of that can change with a remake. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review">The Oblivion Remaster</a> goes a long way towards modernizing the game, with a slick UI, gorgeous new graphics, a more forgiving level-up system, and a deeply appreciated sprint button. Gone is the blinding haze of the seventh console generation, replaced with a solid Unreal Engine sheen. Unlike a lot of remasters, Oblivion maintains its awkward charms, for better or for worse. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The enemy scaling is sadly still intact, meaning you’ll find yourself running into gangs of filthy bandits bearing glass and Daedric gear. Most of the frustrating minigames have been retained, and the combat still feels strange by modern standards. But would Oblivion really be Oblivion without the jank? Without expensive horse armor and actors flubbing their lines? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Oblivion Remaster is still the same game. It might be a little too early to tell if the remaster will be worthy of a higher spot than Skyrim, but there’s a fundamental difference between the two games that’s more than just skin deep.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>2: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">For all of its triumphs, Skyrim loses a lot of what makes the older Elder Scroll games so special. The quests are more shallow, your character build isn’t as customizable, and your choices matter even less. You can quickly become the leader of every single guild, and the biggest decision of the game is who you want to back in the Skyrim Civil War, which culminates in an epic battle of about 40 dudes clipping into each other outside of Whiterun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In exchange for the simplification, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/11/10/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-review">Skyrim received massive, undeniable improvements to the moment-to-moment gameplay</a>. You can dash across the landscape and glitch hop your way up mountains. Additions like dual wielding and weapon crafting finally make the kinetic act of combat enjoyable in itself, and the brilliant addition of shouts allows you to drop dragons out of the sky and blast guards into the horizon with a single squeeze of a shoulder button. Clearly, the game was designed with controllers in mind, as a glance at the oft-maligned default interface will tell you, but that brings with it a tactile and responsive game feel that Skyrim’s PC-first counterparts lack. Skyrim simply <em>feels</em> better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the real secret that separates Skyrim from Oblivion is its space. In past lore, Oblivion’s setting of Cyrodiil was an <a href="https://www.imperial-library.info/content/pocket-guide-empire-first-edition-cyrodiil" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>endless jungle</u></a> of East Asian and Mesoamerican-influenced aesthetics. In the game itself, it’s basically England. Green forests, grassy fields, and the odd Ayleid Ruin dot a landscape that fails to leave much of an impression compared to Skyrim’s frozen tundra. The mechanical depths of the Dwemer ruins, the hazy valleys of the Rift, and the glaciers of Winterhold, all feel like part of a cohesive whole. Skyrim’s geography becomes second nature as you climb enormous mountains and explore endless caves, all the while knowing that the warm glow of Whiterun at night is just a cozy walk away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Frankly, it’s a place you wouldn’t mind settling down and living out your days in a comfy Lakeview Manor, raising honey bees with your werewolf wife at your side. It’s no wonder so many people found themselves lost in Skyrim over the years, compelled to purchase the game over and over again with each slightly-improved release. For many, Skyrim and its suite of mods are the first thing to install on any new computer, just so you know it’s there – a true “forever game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skyrim is the game that turned the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-games-in-order">Elder Scrolls</a> from a successful but nerdy RPG franchise into a blockbuster AAA giant. It’s like comparing Dark Souls to Elden Ring. Similar to Oblivion, Dark Souls is probably the better game on paper, but in terms of impact, the refinement that led to Elden Ring and Skyrim allowed the games to simultaneously expand in scope and reach the widest audience possible. Skyrim isn’t a game you have to recommend with huge caveats to your friend who mostly plays Warzone, it sacrificed just enough of its systems to smooth out its friction points and in the process became an all-time best seller.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn’t to say that it should be ranked highly just because it made a ton of money, but rather that it made a ton of money because of how well it struck a balance between accessibility and depth, allowing players of all kinds to immerse themselves in an intricately crafted world and live out that timeless, universal fantasy of slaying dragons. But with all due respect to Skyrim’s successful efforts to make the game accessible to the mainstream, our number one spot goes to the game that achieved the exact opposite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But first...</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Honorable Mention: Fallout: New Vegas</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We couldn’t in good faith leave this list without mentioning <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/10/19/fallout-new-vegas-review">the best Fallout game ever made</a>. Even if it was developed by Obsidian, it’s built on Bethesda’s bugs-and-all engine and wouldn’t exist without the other games on this list, even though it’s better than all of them. A near-perfect marriage of old-school sensibility and BGS open-world quirkiness, you don’t want to miss this one, especially if you plan on watching season 2 of the show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which brings us to the greatest Bethesda game of all time, coming in hot from the isle of Vvardenfell, it simply must be…</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>1: The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">For a game that we’re definitively calling <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/06/17/elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind-review">the greatest Elder Scrolls game of all time</a>, it’s far from the most polished or accessible. The combat retains much of the RNG aggravation of earlier games, and The UI, cluttered with resizable windows and long lists of dialogue choices to scroll through, borders on utter madness. It’s almost impossible to believe that people once navigated this monstrosity with nothing but a giant Xbox Duke controller, but indeed they did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yet, despite the at-times overwhelming encumbrances of age and complexity, Morrowind is unparalleled when it comes to pure freedom. There are no quest markers or floating arrows on a compass to guide your way, just clues in a dense journal filled with vast amounts of text to click through with hyperlinks. Its spellmaking system, nerfed and eventually eliminated over the years, allows for utterly broken combinations that let you leap between cities and blast across the sky on Boots of Blinding Speed. Characters have seemingly endless amounts of dialogue, spewing forth on screen in massive paragraphs – though if you get tired of reading, you can always end their worthless life. <em>Always.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">No NPC is unkillable in Morrowind, not even the essential ones. In most Bethesda games, if you bludgeon a story-integral character to death with the Mace of Molag Bal, they just take a wee nap and rise again to move the story along. Morrowind instead presents you with the haunting yet somehow liberating message: “the thread of prophecy is severed… restore the weave of fate or persist in the doomed world you have created.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And what a doomed world it is. Vvardenfell is an ashen wonderland where giant insects float among towering fungi and dark elves set up shop in hollowed-out exoskeletons. It borrows more from The Dark Crystal and Dune than it does from Tolkien, a bold, experimental, and organic departure from tropes and tradition. There’s just something magical about Morrowind. Even when later games like ESO return to the region, it never quite hits the same as the original’s rough graphics and smeary textures that render the world as a trippy fusion of Cruelty Squad and Xavier: Renegade Angel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that individuality comes at a cost. For every person enamored by riding giant bugs as public transit or reading 36 volumes of a Dunmer god’s wisdom, someone else decided to play Halo 2 instead. Bethesda made a very conscious decision to make Oblivion more inviting, and its investment obviously paid off. Still, it’s hard not to ponder what could have been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reflecting on Morrowind, one can’t help but think of Baldur’s Gate 3 – a modernized, uncompromised take on the classic CRPG genre that took the video game world by storm when it was released. BG3 isn’t a retro novelty throwback, nor is it a dumbed-down trend-chasing crowd pleaser. It’s simply what fans of the first two games could have envisioned a long-delayed followup would look like, which begs the question: How would an <em>actual</em> sequel to Morrowind work? And would today’s audience accept it?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Truthfully, the top three Bethesda games are almost entirely interchangeable. You can make a solid argument for them in any order, based on your own personal preferences and, let’s face it, more than a little nostalgia. For us, Morrowind is at the top of this list because there will never, ever be another Bethesda game like it –- but as always, your own personal ranking may vary.

In a new video, Bethesda reunited the original Oblivion team to watch a documentary about the game's creation almost two decades later.</p><p>"This is going to be really f**king awkward watching this," Todd Howard says, before a clip of his younger self plays admitting he was in the chess club in school. For the most part the video is wholesome, with the long-term Bethesda employees reminiscing about a time when the company only had around 40 people on staff--it has around 450 now.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A9oMOem2t4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4A9oMOem2t4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I remember all the struggles we went through making it," one developer said of the old footage, while others on the team spoke about how ambitious the project was for its time. "I guess I didn't know it at the time, but looking back, we were doing impossible things," another developer added.</p><p>The Oblivion team also discuss how the game was something of a turning point for Bethesda. "It was the 2.0 version of the studio," one dev said. "It is the start of this group of people working together working together, making this great game."</p><p>"It was impossibly hard to do what we wanted to do," Howard adds. Oblivion went on to become a commercial and critical hit for the studio, winning numerous awards and setting the standard for fantasy RPGs for years to come. The recent surprise-release of Oblivion: Remastered has reignited that same fervor in fans, with nostalgia around the remaster running high. The remaster <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-hits-100000-concurrent-players-on-steam-just-hours-after-launch/1100-6531026/" data-ref-id="1100-6531026">hit 100,000 concurrent players</a> on Steam just hours after release, and the numbers have stayed high in the week since.</p><p>Just getting into the remaster?

"We will never see another conventional console sell 150 million units, like the PlayStation 2 did."</p><p>Hawkins went on to say the "technical prowess" of PCs, along with existing current-generation consoles and newer smartphones, might be "good enough" for people.</p><p>"Even for Sony and Microsoft it will soon make more sense to focus on their game-streaming subscription services instead of losing money on hardware manufacturing and marketing," he said. "Brands like PlayStation and Xbox can be maintained yet will also be more easily available on PCs and billions of smart devices, for a win-win among the cloud providers, game brands and players."</p><p>The original Switch has <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sold more than 150 million units</a>, and that number is going to climb higher when Nintendo releases its next earnings report this month.</p><p>As for the Switch 2, Hawkins said he expects it to clear 100 million lifetime sales, but given his earlier comments, he doesn't anticipate it reaching the heights of the original Switch.</p><p>Microsoft is working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">next-generation console</a> that could also included a handheld, while Sony is believed to be working on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-powered-by-familiar-chipmaker-report/1100-6526499/" data-ref-id="1100-6526499">PS6</a>. Release dates for both, however, remain unknown.</p><p>For its part, Microsoft is already heavily invested in game-streaming technologies, while Sony allows users to stream games as well. Microsoft has said that game-streaming is just one possible way forward; it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-stresses-that-streaming-won/1100-6479243/" data-ref-id="1100-6479243">continue to release dedicated gaming consoles, too</a>.</p><p>Hawkins left EA all the way back in 1991. Among other things, he was instrumental at EA in signing John Madden to a development deal for what would become the juggernaut Madden football series. A Madden movie is in the works, with John Mulaney set to play Hawkins. The veteran executive recently discussed the film, saying director David O. Russell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-founder-says-madden-moviemakers-had-no-interest-in-involving-him/1100-6531230/" data-ref-id="1100-6531230">declined to work with him.</a></p><p>After EA, Hawkins founded 3DO to create a new gaming console, but it never took off. </p>

        <p>Price hike means 2TB Series X now more expensive in US than PS5 Pro.</p>

            <p>
Xbox consoles will now be more expensive worldwide, including in the UK, mainland Europe and the US, Microsoft has confirmed.
</p>
<p>Here in Europe, Xbox Series X will cost £499.99 / €599.99 - an increase of £20 / $50. The 512GB Xbox Series S will meanwhile cost £299.99 / €349.99 - an increase of £50 / €50.  If you're splashing out on the 2TB Xbox Series X model, that's up £40 or €50 to £589.99 / €699.99.</p>
<p>In the US, Xbox Series X will cost $599.99, up a whopping $100. The 512GB Xbox Series S will meanwhile cost $379.99, up $80. The 2TB Xbox Series X is now $729.99, up $130, and now more expensive than Sony's $699 <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>
The prices of some upcoming Xbox games will rise to $80 (UK price TBA) at the end of this year, though existing games will not increase be impacted. Still, expect this fresh pricing to roll out in time for Call of Duty 2025 and whatever else Microsoft has out this Christmas. 
</p>
<p>"We will adjust the pricing of some of our new first-party games starting this holiday season to $79.99," a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">Microsoft Q&amp;A on the changes</a> states. "This update will apply to physical and digital versions. That said, different games and expansions will continue to be offered at a variety of price points."</p>

</figure>
<p>The cost of certain controllers - and in the US, also headsets - will see small increases, too. The cost of Xbox Game Pass is staying the same, however.
</p>
<p>In a statement to Eurogamer, a Microsoft spokesperson acknowledged the price changes were "challenging" but claimed they were a reflection of "market conditions" and rising development costs.</p>
<p>"As of 1st May, we have adjusted recommended retailer pricing for our consoles and controllers worldwide," a Microsoft spokesperson said. "We also expect to adjust the pricing of some of our new, first-party games starting this holiday season to $79.99. Those titles purchased on the Xbox store have the benefit of Xbox Play Anywhere, allowing players to buy once and play on console and PC at no additional cost. </p>
<p>"We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen, and ensuring value for Xbox players."</p>
<p>Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-hardware-revenue-continues-to-tumble-but-gaming-revenue-is-up-microsoft-reports">Microsoft reported a further fall in sales of its Xbox hardware</a> during its latest quarterly financial results, and suggested it was looking to tighten its margins there.
</p>
<p>
Still, revenue from Microsoft's gaming division continues to grow overall, thanks to money made primarily by money spent on Call of Duty, Minecraft and Game Pass subscriptions. Indeed, Microsoft said it was the top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation for the quarter.</p>
<p>The news follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-price-increased-at-major-european-retailer-prompting-fears-of-wider-rises">retail leak earlier today that revealed a €50 price hike for Xbox Series X/S in Europe</a>, and months of speculation around Microsoft quitting some smaller markets worldwide. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 now available for download introduces noticeable visual improvements at the cost of a relatively minor performance impact.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, the Enhanced Lumen mod available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/clairobscurexpedition33/mods/71?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a> is a modified engine configuration file that adds the r.Lumen.TraceMeshSDFs parameter, which helps achieve more accurate lighting and reflections calculations. Activating this parameter results in a performance loss of between 2 and 4 frames per second, but it can significantly enhance lighting in certain scenarios, as showcased in the comparison screenshots below.</p>

<p>Despite launching shortly after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">mother of all shadowdrops</a>, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 became quite successful in a few short days. Earlier this week, it was confirmed that the role-playing game developed by Sandfall Interactive has already sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-a-million-seller/">one million copies</a>, which is a fantastic result considering the game is also available on Xbox Game Pass on PC and consoles. The game's success, which is entirely deserved, as it is among one of the best role-playing games released in recent times thanks to its excellent story, cast of characters, and gameplay, also means that we will see more of its world in some form, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-chances-of-clair-obscur-expedition-33-getting-dlc-are-good-hints-lead-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested by the game's lead writer</a>.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-series-x-s-may-be-getting-a-price-increase-as-european-retailer-increased-the-price-of-both-systems-overnight.1178529/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>[<strong>Update</strong>] As suggested by the price adjustment for the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S made by French retailer Micromania earlier today, the price of both current-generation systems is increasing worldwide.</p>
<p>The steepest increase, as reported by The Game Business, will be in the United States, as the Xbox Series X price is increasing by $100 to $599 and the Xbox Series S by $80 to $429.99. Microsoft has also confirmed that the prices of controllers and headsets are increasing, and that some games will cost $79.99 starting this holiday season. A full rundown of the price increases in the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom and Australia can be found <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/xbox-raises-prices-on-consoles-games">here</a>.</p>
<p>[<strong>Original Story</strong>] The Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S may soon receive a price increase, judging from what a big European retailer did just as the new month began.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-series-s-and-x-get-overnight-price-increase-in-french-retailer-micromania.1178412/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, French retailer Micromania has increased the price of both Microsoft's current-generation systems overnight. All the SKUs available from the retailer have seen a €50 price increase, and the timing suggests that this price adjustment could have been made ahead of an official announcement coming in the next few days.</p>
<p>The current economic situation worldwide is making it difficult for console manufacturers to maintain steady prices for their systems, so seeing an official price increase for the Xbox Series X wouldn't be surprising, however unfortunate it is.<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">&nbsp;</a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last month</a>, Sony increased the price of the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand due to the challenging economic environment, high inflation, and fluctuating exchange rates.</span> The system's price has been unchanged in the United States to date.</p>
<p>If the economic situation continues to be as challenging as it is today, gaming will definitely get more and more expensive down the line. While it is not a real price increase like the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 increases, the Nintendo Switch 2's launch price, which may <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-us/">increase in the future</a>, was higher than most analysts predicted, suggesting that next-generation systems from Sony and Microsoft will likely be priced much higher than most expect, though <a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/">handheld</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-once-again-teased-by-phil-spencer/">offerings</a> could mitigate this issue.</p>

Everything here is fully playable now and will likely get performance bumps once Nintendo's next system arrives.</p></div><p id="msi-sale"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MSI Sale">MSI Desktops &amp; Components Sale</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219558"><div id="219558" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>MSI Desktops &amp; Components Sale</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Click through for the full Woot gaming sale</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">MSI’s factory-reconditioned gaming desktops are quietly one of the best parts of today's sale.

It is fast enough for quick transfers, big enough for most libraries, and cheap enough that you do not have to think too hard about it. Just know it is not built for Switch 2, in case you're planning ahead.</p></div><p id="8bitdo-xbox-edition-keyboard"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="8BitDo Xbox Edition Keyboard">8BitDo Retro 87 Mechanical Keyboard (Xbox Edition)</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219562"><div id="219562" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>8BitDo Retro 87 Mechanical Keyboard (Xbox Edition)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/8bitdo-retro-mechanical-keyboard-review">8BitDo Retro 87 Mechanical Keyboard</a> is down to $99.99 at Amazon.

            <p>
Nintendo's partnership with Lego is continuing this summer with a fresh wave of Super Mario and Animal Crossing sets, including the first appearance of some fan-favourite characters.
</p>
<p>
In Nintendo's general Super Mario range, you'll be able to add Captain Toad via a new playset featuring the intrepid explorer at his campsite. Very cute. 
</p>
<p>
The Mario Kart range, meanwhile, adds an interactive Lego Mario and Standard Kart set, as well as a set containing Wario and King Boo (thanks, <a href="https://jaysbrickblog.com/news/lego-super-mario-summer-2025-sets-include-wario-captain-toad-prince-florian-and-more/">Jay's Brick Blog</a>).
</p>
<p>
Other Mario sets include a Toad House and a Bowser's Castle playset. For those looking to splash a bit more cash, there's a 1251-piece Prince Florian and Castle Bowser set inspired by Super Mario Wonder to tempt you.

<p>
Three more Lego sets also join the Animal Crossing range, bringing a pair of houses with villagers Fuschia, Stitches and Fang, plus a further house with Goldie. 
</p>
<p>
But the star of the show here is clearly Blathers' Museum, a 543-piece set that features the building's facade, as well as a fountain and dinosaur skeleton exhibit. Oh, and Blathers himself of course, hoo.
</p>
<p>
All of the above sets are due to go on sale from 1st August, with pre-orders live shortly via Lego.com. Anything take your fancy?
</p>
<p>Further down the line, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-boy-is-the-next-nintendo-console-officially-getting-the-lego-treatment">Lego has already announced a Game Boy set due later in 2025</a>, and a full <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-announced-coming-2026">Lego Pokémon range that's coming in 2026</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
