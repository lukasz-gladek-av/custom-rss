<p>Well, except one</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Capcom doesn't seem to be in any rush to put its classic <strong>Resident Evil</strong> games on the Switch or Switch 2. And when we say 'classic', we're primarily talking about the original PS1 trilogy, maybe <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_code_veronica_x">Code: Veronica</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/resident_evil_outbreak">Outbreak</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/resident_evil_survivor">Survivor</a>, etc...</p>
<p>With that in mind, developer Unclear Games is looking to fill the gap with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/florist">The Florist</a>, a survival horror launching on the Switch 2 in 2026 alongside Steam and the PS5 (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/retro-resident-evil-fans-will-want-to-pay-attention-to-the-florist-on-ps5">Push Square</a>). Boasting fixed camera angles and a wildly unsettling atmosphere, it's a blatant callback to classic RE in all the right ways.</p>
<p>Well... except one. In the description for the game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3152440/The_Florist/">Steam</a>, it notes that you'll have access to an unlimited inventory – <em>"pick up anything and everything"</em> – and that just seems kinda wild to us. Having a limited inventory is a huge part of the identity of survival horror, and it's something that Resident Evil has carried throughout its existence (to a much lesser degree in some entries, granted).</p>
<p>We're definitely concerned about this, but we'll of course reserve full judgement for now. Otherwise, we're really enamoured with the presentation here. The bold colours represent a pretty drastic departure from what you'd expect a survival horror to look like, and we suspect at least a bit of inspiration has been taken from Konami's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill f</a>. Not a bad thing at all, in our opinion.</p>
<p>So, let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Fixed cameras to evoke tension and showcase beautiful artwork<br>
- Puzzles to test perception, deduction and creativity<br>
- Powerful and explosive weapons to defeat enemies<br>
- A world that grows and changes throughout the game<br>
- Unlimited inventory - pick up anything and everything</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, Resident Evil fans will be well catered for in 2026, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a> all launching on the Switch 2 on <strong>27th February</strong>.</p>
<p>Rumours are also gaining pace that points to a full remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_0">Resident Evil 0</a>, with a voice actor including a now-deleted entry for a lead role in 'Project Chamber' in his résumé, which is said to be the working title for the remake.</p>

              <p>I <a href="https://kotaku.com/theres-a-damned-good-reason-escape-from-duckov-has-sold-a-million-copies-in-a-week-2000638588">very heartily recommend you play extraction shooter <em>Escape from Duckov</em></a>. Do no be fooled by the silly name or cartoony presentation: this is a very in-depth game with an enormous number of mechanics to get to grips with, especially if you’re newer to the looter-shooter format. But fear not, for I have spent so very many hours making so very many mistakes that I am now expertly placed to warn you how <em>not</em> to follow in my footsteps. Here are 12 things I wish I knew before playing <em>Escape from Duckov</em>.</p> <h2>You’re going to die, a lot, and that’s OK</h2> <p>Your goal in <em>Escape from Duckov</em> is to explore an overworld populated by murderous ducks, in order to loot the equipment you need to build up your base, improve your weapons and armor, and head off ever-further in pursuit of new quests. However, on each and every trip, you’re risking absolutely everything you’re taking with you, alongside anything you pick up on your way. While many extraction shooters play out as multiplayer PvP games, where loss of progress feels far more normal, <em>Escape from Duckov </em>is a purely single-player shooter. This can make the losses almost unbearable until you develop a zen-like approach to failure. Because you <em>will&nbsp;</em>fail.</p>

 <p>Every trip is fraught, with the overworld’s population of enemies changing each time you head up there. The enormous explorable areas maintain the same layout, albeit with lockers and chests in varying places, but where certain gangs of marauding ducks hang out can change, along with the spots where you might find a few named boss types. Let your guard down and you can be easily ambushed. Venture too far with not enough first aid and you can be easily taken down. Bring the wrong ammo type for your current weapons and you can find yourself helpless. Or just completely goof up and let a hand grenade explode at your feet and you’re also done for. The point is, you’ll die.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639825" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639825"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639825">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>You’ve got one chance to get your stuff back</h2> <p>Now, you do get&nbsp;<em>one</em> chance to recover your lost items. Every death returns you to your base, your character inventory almost emptied, and your spirit dented. But fear not: everything you died with is still up there, next to the site of your death. All you need to do is head back up and grab it! Except, remember why you died? That’s likely to still be a problem. And if you die again before you pick it all up, then it’s <em>all gone forever</em>*. So you can’t just be running back up there in your duck underwear and hope you’ll be fine. You’ll always want to make sure you have back-ups of vital equipment like armor, weapons and ammo stashed in your base’s enormous warehouse.</p>

 <p>Even then, don’t get cocky. Think of this trip as a recovery only, no matter how tempted you might be to tick off another quest en route, or take an extra risk for the sake of some big loot. Mess this up and all your best equipment is gone-gone. It’s about getting in and out, ideally without ever being seen. Find your death site, move everything over as quickly as you can, and then extract at the nearest exit. Anything else is hubris, and believe me, you will need to close the game down and take a walk if you screw this up because you didn’t focus.</p>

 <h2>*OK, there’s a way to save scum</h2> <p>Yes, OK, it’s not necessarily&nbsp;<em>gone</em>-gone. There is a rather scummy way to get your stuff back if you’re willing. So long as you’re prompt (usually within one real-world hour) after you last had the equipment, you can return to the main menu, choose your save slot, and then click “Restore Backup” in the bottom right. This lets you pick from the last ten autosaves you never knew the game was making and overwrite your current position. It’s obviously cheating, and I really recommend against it: a lot of the fun of <em>Duckov</em> is facing up to those losses, and rebuilding from meager parts with a few early-stage runs to gather equipment for crafting what you’ve lost. But then again, no one else will ever know.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639845" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639845"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639845">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>You want to increase your carrying capacity ASAP</h2> <p>For a game with 48 billion-trillion pieces of loot to gather,&nbsp;<em>Duckov</em> doesn’t give you a lot of space to carry them. By default you have 22 slots in your inventory, which will very quickly be taken up by spare weapons, various types of ammo, first aid, and food and drink, and that’s before you’re vacuuming up the items in the overworld. Some loot stacks, other loot doesn’t, and juggling what you can carry is a constant concern. So the first thing you want to do is add space.</p>

 <p>The easiest way to do this is with the various bags you can find and craft. The first of these, a make-up pouch, adds a very welcome extra row of inventory slots, but you’ll almost immediately be craving more. As you explore further out, you’ll find larger bags that not only add an abundance of new slots, but also increase the total weight you can carry before you become encumbered. But bags are only the start.</p> <p>It’s always worth noticing what various bits of armor can do for you here, too. You’ll usually have to sacrifice extra protection for larger numbers of extra slots, but body armor can give you a very welcome handful of additional spaces. The game also has slightly mystical items called Totems, two of which you can wear at any time that will augment various abilities and defenses. One of these is called Sturdy, which at level 2 will boost your inventory slots by 25 percent.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639828" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639828"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639828">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>There’s a quick way to get more totems</h2> <p>Speaking of Totems, something <em>Duckov</em> absolutely does not make clear is that there’s a quick way to access more of them via some peculiar incantations in the sewers. In the top right corner of your base is a hatch that leads down to some sewers below. From here you can reach a “secret” passage to a location in the first overground area, and a boat that’ll take you to town once you can find or afford the tickets. But there’s also an odd little area with chalk circles on the floor. If you’ve played at all, you’ll notice you’re picking up an awful lot of Fading Feathers from your killed enemies, and while selling these can get you some much-needed cash, saving them up also offers this big benefit. Because down here you can “sacrifice” them, eight or 80 at a time, in exchange for random Totems.</p>

 <p>What you get is very unpredictable, but it can be game-changing. That Sturdy II I mentioned was something I got this way, and it’s made&nbsp;<em>such</em> a difference. Others will improve your health, your armor, stamina limits, perception ability (the cone of sight in which you can spot enemies), and how your guns work. It’s nightmarish picking only two to wear at a time, honestly, but the more choice the better.</p> <h2>Night is not quite as bad as the game suggests</h2> <p>If you try to leave your base anywhere close to dusk, the game will warn you that it might be a better idea to sleep the night away rather than risk the increased danger. And right at the start, that’s advice worth listening to. But it won’t stop warning you, even when you’re ready. Once you feel comfortable with some solid armor and powerful weapons, you can begin to brave the dark. The difference is robo-spiders, which come out at night and are very powerful foes. But not <em>crazy</em> tough, and if you make sure to use cover and quality ammo, you’ll mow them down quickly enough. And their robotic cores are key to unlocking a lot of the mid-game goodies.</p>

 <h2>Your doggy chum has no weight limit</h2> <p>Accompanying you on your expeditions is a little, loyal pup. He doesn’t seem to do anything at all, until you notice he’s capable of carrying stuff. As you upgrade various elements, you can increase these slots to two or three after a fair few hours, and they prove to be super useful. Firstly, anything your doggo is carrying isn’t lost when you die. Presumably he bravely scampers back to your hideout with whatever you gave him. This means he’s ideal for carrying items you must never lose, like the key pouch you can find that’ll hold all sorts of keys and paper passes whose loss would be awful. Like, the worst. Hideous. Yes, I literally just did it. I swapped out the Key Case for a super-heavy set of body armor I wanted to bring back as spare, and then everything went horrible wrong.</p> <p>However, my stupidity aside, the dog is also fantastic for its apparent infinite strength. Often, even when you’ve more inventory slots than you need, you’ll find yourself over-encumbered as higher level weapons and armor start to weigh four or five kilograms each. But hand them over to dog-chum and they’re out of your inventory, and he’s unbothered. Just remember to also take them back off him when you get back to base. I am embarrassed by how many times I’ve set off on a new trip with the poor thing already carrying a massive plastic barrel and a set of level 5 armor.</p> <h2>Storms are a real pain</h2> <p>Every few hundred hours (which translate to real-world minutes) the overworld is consumed by a peculiar purple storm. And it will kill you in&nbsp;<em>seconds</em>. For the longest time, there’s simply no way around this. You might stumble on some injections that purport to help early on, but don’t even try. You’re going to have been playing for a hefty length of time before braving storms is even worth considering, with specialist armor and equipment. In the meantime, just sleep your way past them.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639826" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639826"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639826">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Frequently check your Build station</h2> <p>Your base begins with a Build station, represented by what looks like a large blueprint on a stand, and it’s via this that you’ll learn what loot you need to build the many stations that will fill your base. But it also occasionally adds new and very useful builds without bothering to tell you. It’s worth regularly checking the board to see if something new—perhaps an ATM or even a Black Market storefront—is available to gather for and build.</p> <h2>You can’t have too much of anything</h2> <p>You will occasionally notice you have so many of one particular item that you feel convinced it makes sense to sell or dismantle them to make more space in your Warehouse. And sometimes you’ll be right, but oftentimes you’ll wish you hadn’t. Later quests can surprise you with a sudden need for both of those pointless footballs you found earlier, or you might think your Skill Enhancements no longer need the Cold Core Fragments now that you’re finding Crimson Core Fragments, but you’d be wrong. It’s always worth trying to add more space than delete stuff to create it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639827" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639827"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639827">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Here’s how to mod weapons</h2> <p>Another element the game forgets to teach you is now to mod weapons, and while if you stumble on it you’ll think it’s blatantly obvious, until you do it can be very frustrating. Adding the mods like grips, muzzles, scopes and magazines is&nbsp;<em>not</em> done when you’re crafting weapons, no matter how much it might look as though it should be. It’s done after, and it’s done just in your regular inventory. To adapt a weapon, open your inventory, left-click on the weapon, and a window will appear with all its details. There will be boxes for available mods, and you then need to drag and drop the mods from your inventory or Warehouse into these slots. That’s it. But it would have been nice if it had said so.</p> <h2>There really aren’t gamepad controls</h2> <p>It feels impossible that anyone would release a game in 2025 without gamepad controls, but that’s genuinely the case for&nbsp;<em>Duckov</em>. It’s fully mouse/keyboard, and it works splendidly that way, especially with all the shortcut keys. However, this is essentially a twin-stick shooter, and it would make so much sense to play it on your preferred controller! So far there hasn’t been any hint that adding gamepad options is a priority for the developers, and given it’s sold an extraordinary two million copies in two weeks on PC, it’s obviously not hindering anything. It does suggest console versions are a fair way off, however.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>File sizes of video games have gotten out of control in the last decade. As the industry chases higher and higher fidelity, rendering every last bead of sweat on their in-game characters, games have been ballooning in size. Just look to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em>set to release next month. The latest FP cash cow from Activision is also a file size cow, coming in at over 200GB. The fact is, if you want to be able to play more than a small handful of these games, you’re going to need a lot of storage space. Amazon happens to have the WD_Black SN850X internal gaming SSD on sale at the moment. Right now, you can save 22% on the 1TB model (bringing the price from $115 to just $90) or you can save 17% on the 2TB model (bringing the price from $190 to just $158) for a limited time. You’ll end up saving between $25 and $32.</p>
<p>If you want an even bigger buttload of storage available at your fingertips, Western Digital does make models containing 4TB and 8TB. These though are not currently on sale, with the 4TB option going for $280 and the 8TB option going for $640.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5082/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>PlayStation 5 Compatible</h2>
<p>Consoles are also struggling to keep up with the increasing files sizes of AAA titles releasing each year. Look at the launch model of the PlayStation 5. It comes with just 1TB of internal storage, though technically, much of that space is already dedicated to the system software that let’s the PS5 be a PS5. Really, you’re only working with just over 800GB of workable space to save your games to. Well, you can expand your storage by hooking up a WD_Black SSD inside your console. It’s easy to install as there are countless YouTube videos to follow along to. However, you’ll want to grab the “with heatsink” option on Amazon. This is a tiny metal casing that allows heat to dissipate across while playing games. Sony recommends using one when expanding your consoles storage.</p>



<p>Amazon also happens to have the SSDs with a heatsink available at a discount. Typically the 1TB WD_Black SN850X with a heatsink goes for $130, but right now it’s $10 off at just $120. Likewise the 2TB option is down $20 from $200 to just $180. The 4TB and 8TB options aren’t discounted either. They go for $320 and $640 respectively. You can also consider picking up a third party heatsink for less to use with the WD_Black SN850X SSDs that come without.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Blade X Zombies monthly redeem codes for October 2025 to get plenty of free cash, giving you the freedom to buy as many weapons as you desire.</p>



<p>Blade X Zombies is a popular horror-themed survival game on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-heads-please-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> that has certain similarities to popular entries to the genre, like Hunty Zombie. One of the things that makes Blade X Zombies stand out is the Japanese anime-style setting, with not just the characters and gameplay but even the map looking like it’s straight out of post-apocalyptic Japan. Like with other zombie survival games, the main objective of Blade X Zombies is to survive as long as possible. The only hitch comes in the form of hordes upon hordes of zombies out to get you, meaning that having the best weapons and items is of utmost importance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where these Blade X Zombies codes can be helpful to the players. They can be used by newer or more experienced players, offering a solid boost in terms of cash. This cash can be used in multiple ways, including purchasing new weapons and upgrading existing ones. Whether you’re playing alone or with a group of friends, using the codes is certainly recommended.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>In Ghost of Yotei, when you're not actively battling Lord Saito's forces or frolicking through the fields of Ezo, there's a pretty good chance you're climbing some sort of mountain. As with many video games, Ghost of Yotei makes use of specially marked white stones in order to help guide you on your journey, but it wasn't until I was many hours into the story that it occurred to me: I've been touching bird poop this whole time. </p><p>There is no getting around this, and no mental gymnastics you can do to pretend it's anything else. As Atsu climbs up a mountain, the white rocks eventually lead to a white smeared area at the top. Sure, at this point, perhaps you could say that is chalk or some sort of paint. However, there is <em>always</em> a bird that just so happens to fly away just as you get there. Was that bird simply hanging out and singing a tune? Perhaps, but only if it likes to multitask while delivering an absolutely gargantuan dump. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4593346-screenshot2025-10-29at10.24.38%E2%80%AFam.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593346" data-ratio="0.560625" data-width="3200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4593346-screenshot2025-10-29at10.24.38%E2%80%AFam.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593346"></a><figcaption>That's poop</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4593346-screenshot2025-10-29at10.24.38%E2%80%AFam.jpg"></figure><p>It's gross, and I'm luckily not the only person to notice this. <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/ghost-of-yotei-yellow-white-guiding-paint-bird-poo-excuse/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">George Foster</a> over at TheGamer made mention of it, and a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ghostoftsushima/comments/1nwsvwp/how_do_we_feel_about_atsu_specifically_using/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">clever Reddit user</a> even posited this is the reason why people complain about protagonist Atsu's cooking. For once, "This tastes like crap" would absolutely not be hyperbole. Let's just be thankful none of those birds have IBS, because it would both be more disgusting and impossibly difficult to figure out where to climb. </p><p>Ghost of Yotei released in early October as a PS5 exclusive.

If only we recognized the poop earlier. </p>

            <p>Reports have been swirling that The Wachowski sisters, creators of The Matrix series of films, once approached Konami to have decorated Metal Gear Solid creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> make a Matrix game.</p>
<p>The original report, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/no-one-ever-told-me-such-a-conversation-had-taken-place-kojima-wasnt-aware-of-the-wachowskis-matrix-game-offer">on Time Extension</a>, said the Wachowkis approached Konami after the release of the debut Matrix film in 1999, but were told no by an unspecified executive.</p>
<p>That, however, is news to <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1983390844037009907">Hideo Kojima, who clarified on X</a> that he had no idea such a conversation ever took place, if indeed it did. He was busy making <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-2-sons-liberty">Metal Gear Solid 2</a> at the time, he wrote, but had he known the Wachowskis wanted him to make a Matrix game, perhaps something could have been done.</p>
<p>"I was surprised to see on social media that the Wachowski sisters had 'offered me a Matrix game project!' back in 1999," Kojima wrote. "In all these 26 years, no one ever told me such a conversation had taken place."</p>

<p>There were plenty of opportunities for such a conversation to take place, it sounds like. "At the time, we were mutual fans and exchanged emails," Kojima wrote. He met the Wachowskis three separate times when they came to Japan for The Matrix promotional tour, and on one of those occasions the three of them talked for an hour. Nothing was said about a game.</p>
<p>Kojima had conversations with the film's producer, Joel Silver, too, at The Matrix premiere and party, and again, "there was no mention of an offer," Kojima wrote. Did such a desire for Kojima to make a Matrix game exist?</p>

<p>There was also the ropy but ambitious The Matrix Online, an MMO, which was terminated four years after opening, but was fascinatingly bestowed with Wachowski-sanctioned responsibility of continuing The Matrix story on, after the film's conclusion.

			<p>Hideo Kojima was as surprised as anyone learning this week that he was offered to develop a video game project based on the Matrix franchise, as no one ever told him such a conversation took place between the Wachowskis and Konami.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the legendary game designer and creator of the Metal Gear and Death Stranding series clarified<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-matrix-creators-wanted-kojima-make-a-game-on-the-ip-konami-refused/"> the statements made a few days ago by Christopher Bergstresser</a>, the Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and business Development at Konami between 1996 and 2002. </p>



<p>In his post on <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1983390844037009907">X</a>, Kojima-san confirmed that, back in 1999, he and the Wachowskis exchanged emails as mutual fans, and later met when they traveled to Japan to promote the original Matrix movie for its Japanese release. Kojima-san believes he met them three times, but the offer never came up in any of the conversations he had during these meetings.</p>



<p>"<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">At that time, I was already extremely busy with MGS2 and probably couldn’t have accepted the offer right away. But if someone had told me, maybe there could’ve been a way to make it work,</em>" Hideo Kojima concluded.</p>

<p>It is a real shame a Matrix video game project developed by Hideo Kojima never came to be, if the offer had indeed been made, as it would have been a match made in even. Although the franchise's popularity is not what it was in the early 2000s, such a game project would have incredible potential even today, as none of the games based on the franchise have captured what makes it special.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>developer Remedy Entertainment has posted its financial results for the third quarter of its 2025-26 fiscal year, and there's a pretty clear indication in the report that the studio is moving on from&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>.</p>

<p>In an official Remedy <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=34fb39e4-7860-4bea-9485-4f29745db2e6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, new interim CEO&nbsp;Markus Mäki, who stepped in to replace departing exec Tero Virtala <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-ceo-tero-virtala-steps-down" rel="nofollow">just last week</a>, says that the company has "moved development resources [from&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>]&nbsp;to [its] other in-development titles".</p>

<p>Mäki does say that Remedy intends to "respect [its] communicated roadmap" for the game, so at the very least, you can expect the promised updates on said roadmap to arrive in a timely fashion. After that, though, it seems likely Remedy is done with the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc-firebreak-remedy-q3-financials.jpg?itok=abA-jMPi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc-firebreak-remedy-q3-financials.jpg?itok=mzZnct5d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>has resulted in a pretty rotten few months for Remedy.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite this, however,&nbsp;Mäki says that Remedy has "also found positive sides" to&nbsp;the launch of&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>. He says that the studio's "first multiplayer product launch was technically successful in a cross-platform environment", and that the game's release has helped Remedy's publishing team gain experience.</p>

<p>It hasn't been a great few months for Remedy, though. The aforementioned financial report shows that revenue is down a whopping 32% on last year's Q3, although&nbsp;Mäki says that's because the studio received development fees for&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies" rel="nofollow">from publisher Annapurna</a> during this period.</p>

<p>Additionally, Remedy made an operating loss of €16.4 million this quarter, compared to a profit of €2.4 million during the same period last year. It's safe to say that&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>has rather scuppered Remedy's third quarter this year, and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-breakpoint-update" rel="nofollow">major Breakpoint update in September</a> hasn't helped much.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, development on&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes continues,&nbsp;Mäki says, and the projects are "progressing according to plan".</p>




<p>It may well be a while before we hear anything more from Remedy regarding these projects, but hopefully, we'll learn what&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes look like in the coming months. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-development-ending-amazon-layoffs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-world-development-ending-as-amazon-suffers-layoffs.1338058/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon Games has announced that development on its PvP-focused MMORPG&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>is coming to an end, and that the game's tenth season will serve as its final major update.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world?tag=updates" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>website, Amazon says that after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-launch-500k-players-queue-times" rel="nofollow">four years</a> of supporting the MMORPG, it is "no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates", hence the halt to development.</p>

<p>Despite that, however, the servers won't be going down; you'll still be able to play&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>"through 2026" at the very least, although that naturally doesn't mean the servers will continue to be available after next year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-world-development-ending-amazon-party.jpg?itok=hi3xdHbZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-world-development-ending-amazon-party.jpg?itok=WNw-Ie5G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>New World&nbsp;</em>won't be getting any more big updates.</figcaption></figure><p>In an accompanying FAQ, Amazon says that it will "provide more details on what to expect in the coming months" with regards to how long&nbsp;<em>New World</em>'s servers will remain available, and that "a minimum of six months' notice" will be provided before any big changes are made.</p>

<p>In-game currency and purchases are also remaining active, and you'll still be able to buy and play the game on each platform (although the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063730/New_World_Aeternum/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam page</a> no longer provides the option to purchase <em>New World</em>), as well as downloading it via PlayStation Plus "until further notice".</p>

<p>While development is ending, bug fixes and support will continue, and "world bosses, bonus weeks, and some seasonal events" will stay in rotation as well, although there won't be any more holiday events in&nbsp;<em>New World</em>.</p>

<p><em>New World&nbsp;</em>was released back in 2021 to a rather inauspicious beginning; it was plagued by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-is-bricking-gigabyte-rtx-30-series-gpus" rel="nofollow">technical issues</a>, farming <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-to-crack-down-on-new-world-farming-bots" rel="nofollow">bots</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-breaking-new-world-invincibility-exploit-discovered" rel="nofollow">game-breaking bugs</a> from day one, and updates intended to fix problems would often introduce entirely new ones.</p>




<p>In 2024,&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>was relaunched with a brand new title,&nbsp;<em>New World: Aeternum</em>, a relaunch that also saw the game arriving on consoles. It was also a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-review-bomb-relaunch" rel="nofollow">particularly unpopular move</a> among the game's PC player base, many of whom felt abandoned by Amazon despite their love for the original game.</p>

<p>News of the game entering maintenance mode also comes as Amazon is hit by sweeping layoffs, with thousands of employees <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/amazon-layoffs-14000-corporate-employees-citing-ai-1236563297/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">losing their jobs</a> amid a push towards AI. The gaming division has also pledged to halt a "significant amount" of its first-party AAA game development.</p>

<p>Amazon isn't exiting the gaming space entirely, though; earlier this month, it was announced that streaming service Luna would be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-luna-rework-later-this-year" rel="nofollow">getting a major overhaul</a> to refocus on party gaming, although the rebrand will still offer access to many core audience-focused titles as well.</p>

<p>For the time being, you can still check out&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/new-world-aeternum/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/new-world-aeternum/9NPZJNVGHZ3P" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and if you already own the game on PC, you can play it there as well. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

<p>Chances are, you’ve had the Advance Ticket sitting idly in your Pokémon TCG Pocket inventory for the best part of a year. The mysterious item has left everyone confused, but not anymore. </p>



<p>It’s been 12 months since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pockets-card-dex-registration-update-will-arrive-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> launched. The free-to-play card-collecting and pack-opening feast has provided daily joy, and this is thanks to numerous new card sets, features, and fun battling. Something more Unown than the Pokémon itself is the Advance Ticket—which is about to be redeemed. </p>



<h2 id="h-advance-ticket-purposes-revealed-for-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Advance Ticket Purposes Revealed For Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New focus. Image via The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>A random draw is set to take place very soon, which will see very Pokemon TCG Pocket users with an Advanced Ticket be rewarded for their patience with a set number of Hourglasses.</p>



<p>“We’ll be holding a drawing for players, so please make sure to check your Gifts in-game to see your rewards,” said the official X page.</p>



<p>The random draw will happen at 11 PM PDT on October 29, and the prizes are divided into three different potential outcomes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>1st Prize:</strong> 1,200 Pack Hourglasses for 100 lucky winners.</li>



<li><strong>2nd Prize:</strong> 120 Pack Hourglasses for 10,000 lucky winners.</li>



<li><strong>3rd Prize:</strong> 24 Pack Hourglasses for all players.</li>
</ul>



<p>Whatever the result, if you have the Advanced Ticket in your possession, you are guaranteed to get some Pack Hourglasses. Obviously, we’d all love to be the recipient of 2nd Prize, let alone 1st Prize.</p>



<p>Interestingly, according to the small print, even if you don’t have the Advance Ticket: “The 3rd prize will also be distributed to players with no advance ticket.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The Advance Ticket finally gets used! 🎫 </p><p>We'll be holding a drawing for players, so please make sure to check your Gifts in-game to see your rewards. 🎁 <a href="https://t.co/EU2oV59BQV">pic.twitter.com/EU2oV59BQV</a></p></div>— Pokémon TCG Pocket (@PokemonTCGP) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1983428587479798268?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>

                <p>Hideo Kojima has responded to reports that The Matrix’s creators, Lilly and Lana Wachowski, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-wachowskis-wanted-hideo-kojima-to-make-a-matrix-video-game-report/1100-6535757/" data-ref-id="1100-6535757">once pitched a game idea to Konami</a> while he worked there.

"In all these 26 years, no one ever told me such a conversation had taken place. At the time, we were mutual fans and exchanged emails.

"If someone had told me, maybe there could've been a way to make it work," Kojima added. In the original interview on <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/they-were-big-fans-of-kojima-the-wachowskis-once-asked-the-metal-gear-creator-to-make-a-matrix-video-game" rel="nofollow ">Time Extension</a>, Bergstresser recalled a meeting with the Wachowskis and former CEO of Konami Digital Entertainment, Kazumi Kitaue, but Kojima says he wasn't present for it, and he arrived back at Konami headquarters after the discussion had wrapped up.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-speaks-about-the-matrix/1100-2448486/">Kojima and the Wachowskis eventually met up</a> and discussed the similarities between their work, but with the entire story taking place over 25 years ago, some details might have been lost to time here.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="f77e8d5ceb611"><a title="Monster Hunter Wilds / Rise" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f77e8d5ceb611/monster-hunter-wilds-rise.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Capcom has today shared its latest <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_01.pdf">financial results</a> for Q2 of FY2025/26, and the software sales numbers have left us rubbing our eyes and pulling a double take — is that the four-year-old <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/monster_hunter_rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> putting up more new sales than <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, yes it is. As noted by our friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/monster-hunter-wilds-doing-so-badly-thats-its-been-outsold-by-mh-rise-devil-may-cry-5">Push Square</a>, there's a rather amusing wrinkle in the studio's Digital Contents Unit Sales Ranking this time around. Series newbie Monster Hunter Wilds — which shifted <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/03/monster-hunter-wilds-smashes-capcom-record-with-10-million-units-sold">10 million units</a> in its record-breaking opening weeks, let's not forget — is at the bottom of the pile with 637,000 sales in the first half of the fiscal year, while Rise is one spot above it with 643,000 sales.</p>
<p>That might not be a huge gap on paper, but it's exacerbated when we look at Q2 in isolation. Of those 637,000 sales, 477,000 came in <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/1st/explanation_2025_1st_01.pdf">Q1</a>, meaning Wilds only shifted an additional 160,000 copies in the months since. Rise, on the flip side, managed 254,000 sales in the same period — a slight decline from the 389,000 sold in Q1, but what do you expect, it's <em>four years old</em>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="4065e85c9a446"><a title="Capcom Q2 FY2025 Unit Sales" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4065e85c9a446/capcom-q2-fy2025-unit-sales.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_01.pdf">Capcom</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you can see, the two Monster Hunters sit firmly at the bottom of the pile, outsold by the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> (which put up 547,000 sales in Q2) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a>, which actually sold the most units in Q2 (643,000), despite still falling behind <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/devil_may_cry_5">Devil May Cry 5</a> on the fiscal year as a whole.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a bunch of reasons why Wilds might be falling behind Rise, despite being the <em>much</em> newer of the two — the latter's availability on more platforms and readily available bonus content, for example — but it's still kind of crazy to see how much the sales have dropped off after Capcom's stellar launch earlier this year.</p>
<p>You'll notice that a bunch of the titles in the above list will be making their way to Switch 2 before the fiscal year is up (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil VII</a> and Village will join <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Requiem</a> on the hybrid on 27th February), so it'll be interesting to see what that does to the total unit sales. Outside of that, we'll be keeping our fingers crossed for news of mainline MonHun coming our way at some point in the future.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> endgame is pretty hectic, so by the time you reach the post-game, you might be overstimulated and overlook some of the ways things have changed in your home base of Hotel Z. There’s an entirely missable epilogue of sorts for a character that even gives you a free Pokémon with ties to someone from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-best-worst-games-ranked-red-blue-scarlet-violet-1849984595"><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i></a><span>. We’ll start with a spoiler-free explanation of where to go and what to look for, then we’ll dive into the details.</span></p> <p><span>As soon as you beat the final boss, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-credits-npc-dialogue-school-kid-2000638839"><span>the credits roll</span></a><span>, and when you’re finally given back control of your character, you’ll find a Poké Ball sitting on the table in your hotel room. It’s entirely possible to miss and walk right past it because </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>doesn’t direct your attention to it, but this Poké Ball contains a Pokémon you’ve already met on your journey, and a note from an old friend. Now that you know where to go, let’s unpack this.</span></p>

  <p><span>The Poké Ball has AZ’s Lucario, which you used much earlier in the game to learn how to use Mega Evolution. But this Lucario wasn’t always AZ’s. The 3000-year-old war criminal (who has never done anything wrong in his life) was gifted this fighting/steel monster by “a certain trainer” who hoped it would be able to keep him safe in Lumiose City. If you examine Lucario’s stats, you’ll see its original trainer is listed as Korrina. If you don’t know or remember who that is, Korrina is the fighting-type gym leader in </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. She also gave the player a Lucario in those games as well. While Korrina doesn’t actually appear in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, she’s still indirectly helping the player out.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Alongside Lucario’s Poké Ball, you’ll find a letter from AZ written before his passing. In it, he reflects on his 3000 years, including when he originally received his partner Floette, the Kalos War thousands of years prior that led to the events of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, the first time he saw a Pokémon undergo Mega Evolution, and when he saw the “dark day” fall over Galar, the region in </span><i><span>Pokémon Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. This is in reference to what is colloquially known as the Darkest Day, in which a Legendary Pokémon called Eternatus caused the Pokémon of the region to undergo forced Dynamax transformations, which turn Pokémon into kaiju-like giants. The monsters nearly destroyed the region, but the entire event came to an end when the two Kings of Galar defeated Eternatus. The event was “recreated” in </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>, but AZ was alive for the original one.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>By itself, this might just seem like a bit of extra world-building, but given that we know through </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>the Teraleak</span></a><span> that the next </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game may be a historical Galar game, AZ might appear in a future game, despite his death in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. Even if we never knew anything about the leaks, this line would likely have sparked speculation that the next </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game would go back to the past like </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>. It feels like Game Freak is still solidifying what the </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> moniker means, and if it keeps bouncing around the timeline like this, maybe the subseries will just be a place for the team to experiment and fill in lore gaps without any hard rules.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-25-244hz-gaming-monitor-at-record-low-now-costs-the-same-as-a-budget-display-2000639677</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-25%E2%80%B3-244hz-gaming-monitor-at-record-low-now-costs-the-same-as-a-budget-display.1338019/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re approaching the holidays fairly fast, but the big holiday sales events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday are still a month away. Luckily, you can still find some good opportunities to save even right now. If you’re a PC gamer in the market for a new primary or secondary monitor, now’s a great time to jump on it because Amazon has the <strong>Samsung Odyssey G4 gaming monitor</strong> on sale for 29% off: It’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5081/">normally listed at $280, but the discount has it knocked down in price by $80, bringing what you have to pay down to an even $200</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5081/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This 25-inch monitor from Samsung is capable of delivering a clear depth of colors in a 1080p FHD resolution. It’s got a fast response time of just 1ms with a smooth refresh rate of 240Hz. The screen eliminates lag and will make any game that relies on fast inputs and quick reaction times a dream to play. That pogo platforming section in Hunter’s March from <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> can be significantly easier on a better monitor.</p>
<p>The monitor has NVIDIA G-SYNC which is able to keep your GPU and panel synchronized. What this does is eliminate choppiness, screen-lag, and image tears. AMD FreeSync Premium can also help to ensure better stability and a stutter-free gameplay experience.</p>
<p>With this monitor, you can connect your PC or gaming console over either of the two HDMI inputs or through the DisplayPort input. If you have multiple sources connected to your Samsung Odyssey G4 display, the monitor can auto-detect when a new source signal is plugged in or turned on, changing the input over so you don’t have to manually. Get into the action faster.</p>



<h2>Optimal Viewing</h2>
<p>This Samsung monitor is built with an ergonomic stand which can be raised and lowered to your liking. Tilt the angle of the screen toward or away from you to find the optimal viewing for how and where you are seated or standing at your desk. The screen can even be rotated to go either horizontal or vertical. This makes for a wondering secondary monitor. Keeping you main screen horizontal front and center is ideal for longer gaming sessions so you neck is always straight as your facing forward. Then you can have a second monitor positioned to the side of it vertically. This is great for Discord, Slack, or any kind of message apps so you can see more of the conversation at once.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>When it launched in 2017, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild received near-universal acclaim, including a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/the_legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild/b/switch/archive/2017/03/02/game-informer-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-switch-review.aspx">10 out of 10 from <em>Game Informer</em></a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2018/01/04/game-informers-best-of-2017-awards.aspx">Game of the Year honors</a>. Nintendo has announced a partnership with Laced Records, a gaming-focused record label, to bring the beautiful and, at times, emotional soundtrack from one of the most beloved games of the 21st century to vinyl next year. This release marks one of the first major Nintendo titles to receive an official vinyl release outside of Japan.&nbsp;</p><p>The vinyl soundtrack release is available in a double-LP set or an expanded 8-LP box set. Each version is available in standard black vinyl or a special limited-edition colored variant: The double-LP comes in blue and white, while the 8-LP box set features blue and gold splatters on white discs. The double-LP releases feature 34 select tracks, including "Overworld (Day)," "Great Fairy Fountain," and "Hyrule Castle." Meanwhile, the 8-LP releases include 130 tracks, and each disc is sequenced around a theme from Breath of the Wild, such as exploration, freeing the Divine Beasts, and discovering Shrines. All the tracks have been remastered for vinyl, aiming to provide the best translation of the work of composers Manaka Kataoka, Yasuaki Iwata, Hajime Wakai, and Soshi Abe.</p><p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild vinyl soundtrack collection arrives on June 19, 2026, with pre-orders available today. The limited-edition blue versions will be available exclusively through Laced Records, the My Nintendo Store, Nintendo New York, and Nintendo San Francisco, while the standard-edition black vinyl versions will be available at select retailers.</p><hr><p><em><span>Do you have any game soundtracks on vinyl?

			<p>The PlayStation Portal handheld system may be about to get a highly-requested feature soon, judging from a PS App leak.</p>



<p>Over on the <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/1ohdvol/streaming_owned_games_imminent/">PlayStation Portal official subreddit</a>, user GetTheWetsOn shared a screenshot captured from the PS App of the Deliver at All Costs store page, which seemingly confirms that cloud streaming of purchased digital games could be coming to the PlayStation Portal for PS Plus Premium subscribers. The user also stated that the same confirmation, which has since been removed, could be found on the Dead Space remake store page.</p>



<p>While there's no indication this new PlayStation Portal streaming option is indeed coming, its confirmation on the store pages of two different games is unlikely to be a mistake, so there's a high chance it will eventually arrive on the system. </p>



<p>Ever since the system's release and its surprising popularity, Sony has repeatedly iterated that the company is looking into <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming/">expanding the system's functionality</a>. Allowing streaming of owned digital PlayStation games without having to download them first on their home system would be the perfect way to do so.</p>



<p>The PlayStation Portal is a Remote Play focused handheld device which launched back in 2023 worldwide. While not the successor of the PlayStation Vita many have been expecting for a long time, the system does what it does exceptionally well. You can learn more about it by checking out Kai's<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/"> review.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> developers Don't Nod have revealed that they're working on a new narrative game based around a "major IP" in partnership with Netflix. The game'll be developed at Don't Nod's Montreal studio, with the chilling-based streaming service set to publish it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This deal was announced via Don't Nod's <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases/?ID=ACTUS-0-94850">latest financial results</a>, which detail how they've done in the first half of the 2025 fiscal year. CEO Oskar Guilbert characterised the first six months of this year as having seen "solid revenue growth", though the company's total operating revenue of €13.9 million was down by 5% compared to the first half of 2024. A "performance plan" they've enacted after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-is-strange-developers-dont-nod-hit-with-more-layoffs">a rough period</a> - which saw staff laid off, games put on pause, and Guilbert himself accused of "catastrophic management" by the French union STJV - is expected to start paying larger dividends soon.</p>
<p>This deal with Netflix is cited as a "key milestone" in that effort to turn things around. "The project finances the Montreal studio and aligns with the Group's strategy to secure its resources and strengthen its ability to evolve in an increasingly competitive and selective market," Don't Nod say in addition to blowing their own storytelling trumpet.</p>
<p>There's no indication of which Netflix show might be getting the game treatment, but the socials have very much begun to fill with 'Life is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stranger-things">Stranger Things</a>' jokes. Personally, I think it'll be an adaptation of Victoria Beckham's fashion documentary which also rewinds back Lost Records-style to her and David's heyday in the 90s and early 2000s. Either that or something about a serial killer. Or maybe Wednesday Addams is going to make a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1543830/The_Addams_Family_Mansion_Mayhem/">less party-centric</a> return to the gamisphere.</p>
<p>Until we find out, give <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-1-bloom-review%3EGraham's%20review">Graham's review</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-records-bloom-and-rage">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>'s first tape a re-read. It made him ask important questions:</p>
<blockquote>Is it possible that this video game of Young Adult tropes and teenage girl protagonists just isn't meant for me? I have a few rebuttals to that idea. For one, hey, this game also contains the tired 40-something version of those characters, which I obviously find deeply relatable. I was also a kid in the '90s and feel a growing nostalgia for Hey Arnold! and my Nintendo 64. I bet I'd love Yellowjackets, and I own a Rainbow Rowell novel and one day I might even read it, but really I just think that good writing can transcend demographics.</blockquote>
<p>You'll always be a young adult to me, former bossman.</p>

              <p>It’s not Black Friday yet, but Amazon has already rolled out a few serious laptop deals that shouldn’t be missed. Those looking for a powerful work or study partner should consider the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5080/">17.3-inch HP laptop (Intel Core i3, 1TB SSD, 16GB RAM) that’s now going at a 70% discount for a short time</a>.</p>
<p>It normally would run you <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5080/">around $2,200, but this deal brings the price down to just $650</a>, and that’s not the only offer here. You’re also getting an accessory bundle worth <strong>$240 thrown in for absolutely free</strong>! This laptop is also marked as an Amazon’s Choice product and has a 4.7-star rating, so grabbing it at this price feels like a steal.</p>

<h2>Bigger Screen, Better Performance</h2>
<p>The price might make it seem like a basic option, but it’s far from that. It boasts a massive 17.3-inch diagonal high-resolution display with narrow bezels. You’re getting a large screen real estate to work on, plus solid visuals that make the content pop. The keyboard is slightly elevated using a new lift-hinge design, so typing long documents won’t make your wrists hurt by the end of the day.</p>
<p>There’s an 8-core Intel i3-N305 processor to ensure fast performance, plus 16 GB DDR4 high-bandwidth RAM for smoother multitasking. Storage is taken care of by a 1TB PCIe SSD, which gives you quick boot times and fast file access, plus sufficient space to have all your important files and content in one place.</p>



<p>The battery can last up to 8 hours on a single charge, which means you can go a full day without worrying about plugging it in. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.4, plus a wide range of ports for connecting your accessories. Speaking of accessories, the free bundle gets you a design mouse, a colorful gaming keyboard, Windows 11 Pro (pre-installed), and a data cable organizer. Getting the OS pre-installed means you will have instant access to a wide range of productivity features from the get-go, plus Microsoft’s new Copilot AI assistant, which you can also launch directly using the dedicated Copilot key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>All things considered, this laptop is made for both work and everyday use. It can support your most productive days without throwing a fit, and comes with a set of useful accessories that add even more value to the deal. Grab this 70% off discount before it expires for good.</p>

              <p>Shooting high-quality video with exceptional vibrancy and just the right angles is just half the story. You need clean audio to get the message, excitement and even frustration across. Most cameras out there have built-in microphones but they are not always enough: If you want that professional audio that cuts through background chatter and reaches with exceptional clarity, it might be time <strong>for a proper wireless mic system</strong>.</p>
<p>DJI – one of our favorite go-to brands for cameras – also has a solid lineup of wireless microphones and we just spotted an option going for less. The DJI Mic Mini, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5079/">which typically retails for $119, is now going for just $74 at Amazon, after a generous 38% discount</a>. It’s the lowest price we’ve seen in the past 30 days; even Prime Day didn’t bring it this low. We recommend grabbing it sooner rather than later, as the offer might wrap up anytime now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5079/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Range With Two Noise Cancellation Modes</h2>
<p>This setup gives you two transmitters and one receiver, so it’s perfect for when you’re shooting with more than one user. Each transmitter is small, lightweight, and can be worn/clipped easily. It doesn’t feel bulky or look unpleasant on camera. Despite its tiny size, it offers a maximum transmission range of 400 meters for stronger signals both indoors and outdoors. Recording in those busy streets and jam-packed cafeterias won’t be a problem, ever again.</p>
<p>You’re also getting two noise cancellation modes; basic and strong. The basic mode is ideal for relatively quieter environments, like your home, while the strong mode is more appropriate for noisier settings. It also comes with an automatic limiting feature that reduces volume spikes and maintains a consistent tone; your audience won’t be hit with an unexpected jumpscare mid-video.</p>



<p>Battery-wise, you’re looking at up to 10 hours of operating time on both the transmitters and the receiver. This is more than enough for longer shoots, and you can even go a couple of days without plugging them in. The DJI Mic Mini also plays well with a wide range of devices. Even without the receiver, you can pair the transmittor with DJI devices like the Osmo Pocket 3 and Osmo Action 5 Pro.</p>
<p>In the box, you’ll find two transmitters, one receiver, a mobile adapter, a camera audio cable, clip magnets, windscreens, a charging dock, and a carrying pouch. Keep in mind that the offer might end soon, so it’s best to grab it fast.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-need-battlefield-6-to-play-redsec/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/do-you-need-battlefield-6-to-play-redsec-how-to-play-battlefield-redsec-battle-royale.1337986/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield REDSEC offers several new ways to play Battlefield 6. It arrived after Battlefield 6’s launch, just like Warzone did after MW 2019, and we’re here to let you know if you can play for free, and if so, how.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launched with a campaign and multiplayer. Throw in Portal, and you’ve got yourself a pretty meaty bundle. However, we always knew EA and Battlefield Studios had more ideas up their sleeves. This materialized on October 28 with the launch of Battlefield 6’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-review-br-warzone-coded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REDSEC</a>.</p>



<p>It came bundled with battle royale (no <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale-solo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solo mode</a>, though) and the hot new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gauntlet-mode-battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gauntlet</a> playlist. Let’s see if you need Battlefield 6 to play it, though. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-redsec-without-owning-battlefield-6">Can You Play REDSEC Without Owning Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty to enjoy for free. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, you can play Battlefield: REDSEC for free without needing to own a full, paid copy of Battlefield 6.</strong></p>



<p>Just like Call of Duty and Warzone, REDSEC is an independent release separate from Battlefield 6. This means you can enjoy a premium Battlefield 6 experience without needing to pay a single penny. If you want to, you can buy Battlefield 6 from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-amazon-us/">Amazon</a>!</p>



<p>All BR modes are free-to-play, as is Gauntlet Mode. We’re sure REDSEC will add new features and modes over the coming months and years as well. Has there ever been a better time to be a Battlefield fan?</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-battlefield-redsec">How To Play Battlefield REDSEC</h2>



<p><strong>To play Battlefield REDSEC, you need to go into your relevant storefront, download it, wait for it to install, and you can jump straight into EA’s free-to-play Battlefield experience.</strong></p>



<p>For an easy breakdown of what to do, check out these simple instructions:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, or Steam.</li>



<li>Search for <strong>Battlefield REDSEC</strong>.</li>



<li>Click on the game.</li>



<li>Choose to download <strong>Battlefield REDSEC</strong>.</li>



<li>Wait for the download to complete.</li>



<li>Once it’s ready, you can now boot up REDSEC and play it for free!</li>
</ol>



<p>There was speculation that REDSEC was going to be free, but only for players who already own Battlefield 6—technically making it not free. However, this is a smart decision on EA’s part and should do a lot to help both Battlefield 6 and REDSEC have a long battery life.</p>



<p>Let us know if you’ve had a chance to play REDSEC yet. Can you not get enough of Gauntlet? Or is the allure of battle royale still proving to be too much?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is walking away from making new content from its MMO, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/new-world-aeternum">New World</a>, amid huge layoffs affecting 14,000 roles at the company. Now, there is concern over the status of its The Lord of the Rings MMO.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday, October 28, Amazon confirmed cuts affecting an eye-watering 14,000 roles. It’s one of the biggest round of layoffs the tech giant has ever seen, and comes at a time when other companies in the tech sector, such as Microsoft and Meta, have made similarly huge cuts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also comes at a time when Amazon is performing well. So why are they happening? AI, basically. In <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-workforce-reduction" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a note to employees</a>, Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, said:</p><blockquote>Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well. Across our businesses, we're delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">What does this all mean for Amazon’s gaming business? According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, nothing good. There are “significant” cuts coming to Amazon’s video game operation, which will reduce development work and layoff staff mainly in its Irvine and San Diego offices.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The New World changes are a part of that, and while the game will remain online during 2026, this is basically the beginning of the end for once hugely popular MMO. Let’s remember, New World was a rare hit for Amazon in the video game space, and followed multiple flops that resulted in game and studio closures. The MMO set in an alternate 1600s America saw huge player numbers on Steam, with a whopping 913,634 peak concurrents on Valve's platform back in 2021. Player numbers have significantly declined since that peak, however.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloomberg said Amazon is cutting back especially on MMOs, but will continue to develop Amazon Games Montreal’s strategy March of Giants, its new Tomb Raider game in the works at Crystal Dynamics, and "casual and AI-focused games" for its cloud gaming service Luna. UK studio Maverick Games will continue to work on its racing game, too. Amazon Games also continues to publish externally developed games such as Lost Ark and Throne &amp; Liberty in western markets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is also working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">an in-house The Lord of the Rings MMO</a>, although we haven’t heard much about it since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-mmo-coming-from-new-world-developer-amazon-games">it was announced in 2023</a>. In August last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-games-still-seeking-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-christoph-hartmann-interview">Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann told IGN</a> the company had 10 games in development and was negotiating "a couple more." These include Tomb Raider and The Lord of the Rings MMO, as well as the new driving game from the former developers behind Forza Horizon.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Tomb Raider Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On The Lord of the Rings MMO, however, Hartmann insisted it was still early days. "We're still trying to find the hook, find that idea of what it is because we don't just want to go and do the same thing over," Hartmann said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While it's tempting sometimes with an existing IP, that's not the point of doing it. You've got to find a fresh twist, and we're still, I think, in that period where we really want to find out what could be the hook, what could be the thing which is different to all the other games out there. So it's a little bit early.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Amazon for an update on The Lord of the Rings MMO.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also plenty of questions around Tomb Raider, which has been caught up in the mire around the Embracer Group. Hartmann mostly waved off those concerns, saying that developer Crystal Dynamics is "fairly sheltered from everything going on with Embracer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"People obviously look at what the parent company is doing, but it never impacted on resources, never led to any changes on management for them, so they're fine. I mean, doing a new Tomb Raider, the bar is so high. The longer you go, the expectation goes higher, so it's a huge, huge task, but things are progressing. I mean, there's some really great ideas here," Hartmann said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Obviously, we're not going to share any with you even if we would love to, but things are going well, things are moving forward. And from what I could tell, Crystal was pretty sheltered, because also when you look before...they went through a couple of ownership changes anyway before, it's not brand new for them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-more-following-perfect-dark-cancelation">Crystal Dynamics recently laid off a number of workers following Microsoft’s cancelation of the Perfect Dark reboot</a>. At the time, the studio insisted Tomb Raider was still in development and unaffected by the decision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crystal Dynamics was originally brought in to revitalize Perfect Dark after struggles getting the project moving with former co-developer, Certain Affinity. Crystal was later acquired by the Embracer Group in 2022, at which time the studio was revealed to have 273 employees across its Austin, Bellevue, and San Mateo offices. Crystal laid off 10 people in 2023, and laid off 17 more people earlier this year. It's unclear how many remain now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth uses this tactic too, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sparks-yellow-paint-debate-once-again"><u>players sharing their thoughts on it</u></a> and leaving Hamaguchi himself surprised about the debate it stirred at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/oh-no-the-yellow-paint-debate-is-back-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-says-there-is-definitely-a-need-for-that-kind-of-thing-and-the-only-real-question-is-about-how-its-done/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesRadar+</u></a>, Hamaguchi said he understood there are some people who don't want or need the yellow paint, but insisted that it was necessary.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I get there is a debate about that, whether that fits with that world or not, whether some people want it, some people don't," Hamaguchi said. "I think as a game, there is definitely a need for that kind of thing in a lot of ways. I think obviously different developers experiment, try different things about what works best, what fits best, the right way of doing that in their game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The need to guide players around from from a gameplay perspective and show them what can be done, what they need to do, there is definitely times where that is needed," he added. "So I think obviously there is more of a debate about how it's done, what level and what works. And there'll still be people who say, 'No, that doesn't fit at all. We don't like that.' That's fine, but I think there is definitely a need there, and it's something that is definitely worth looking at."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When the yellow paint debate kicked off with Rebirth last year, some said they didn't like how in-your-face the hand-holding was not just in Final Fantasy 7 Remake, but modern video games. Others, however, pointed out that it could be helpful, and was an important accessibility feature. Developers, too, weighed in, with some highlighting how in playtests and focus groups, players sometimes struggle to work out where to go, get frustrated, and quit playing altogether. Because of this, somewhat obvious and sometimes unrealistic visual clues are needed to help point players in the right direction. And some have pointed out that video games have featured visual clues for exploration and progression for decades now.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">With discussion around the yellow paint in FF7R, who remembers the options red/green arrows plus giant pointer available in the original FF7? <a href="https://t.co/qMLnKh3rGw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/qMLnKh3rGw</a></p>— John Linneman @dark1x.bsky.social (@dark1x) <a href="https://twitter.com/dark1x/status/1756686944178676036?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Based on Hamaguchi's comments, perhaps fans can expect the yellow paint to return for Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> received both its Season One update yesterday, as well as the Redsec battle royale mode in a massive content update for the popular military FPS. Not everyone is happy though.</p>
<p>While many are having a good time with the update, others are dejected due to the influx of microtransactions, relatively colourful cosmetics, and weekly battle pass challenges that can push players towards the battle royale mode they may not be interested in. It seems like Battlefield 6, which has largely been sailing smoothly since launch, has hit turbulent weather.</p>
<p>Starting with the battle pass, you progress through it via BP points, which are earned <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oio6d7/dear_dice_if_i_wanted_to_play_a_terrible/">through the completion of weekly challenges</a> as well as XP gained through playing. These points unlock tiers of the battle pass, filled with cosmetics, boosts, and currency rewards.</p>

<p>These challenges previously could be completed in any mode for the most part, aside from a few specific challenges for certain unlockables. However these battle pass challenges can force players to jump into the battle royale. They can be rerolled, but if you reroll and land on battle royale challenges, you're stuck with them.</p>
<p>These cosmetics are <em>largely</em> thematic with the military aesthetic of Battlefield 6, such as various digital camouflages. However these have rubbed some players the wrong way, especially, those that found the authentic look of the classes at launch appealing.</p>
<p>The battle pass also isn't simply offered in a free and paid form. Players can buy separate bundles that provide different rewards. There's the Season One Starter pack, the Season One Advanced Pack, the Rogue Ops pack, and the Season One Pro Pack. Then there are the skins added to the in-game store itself, which must be bought with Battlefield coins.</p><p>It's a sharp turn away from the more pure FPS experience people have been playing in droves this month, and what seemed to tempt people to the game as they tire of the uber-capitalist trudge that Call of Duty has become.</p>

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is in the midst of its one-year anniversary celebrations, and a new set is right around the corner in Mega Rising, for which we have all the release date and start time details.</p>



<p>New sets in Pokémon TCG Pocket have been a regular occurrence since the title first released, but Mega Rising is a big moment for the title as it introduces the mechanic of Mega Evolution, adding further complexity to deck building to consider.</p>



<p>For all the release details of the Mega Rising set, check out our guide below.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-b1-mega-rising-release-date">Pokémon TCG Pocket B1 Mega Rising Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big additions. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>TCG Pocket’s B1 Mega Rising set will be released on Thursday, October 30, as confirmed by the trailer for the new set.</strong></p>



<p>The launch of the set marks the start of the second year of Pokémon TCG Pocket with the start of ‘B’ sets, though it’s not clear at this stage exactly how that will shake up the meta and what restrictions, if any, will be in place for cards.</p>



<p>There’s still time to get your hands on Pack Hourglasses ahead of the release of the set, and it’s worth taking every opportunity you can ahead of the release.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-b1-mega-rising-start-times">Pokémon TCG Pocket B1 Mega Rising Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>The B1 Mega Rising set will be available in the game from 11 PM PT on October 29, with a release on October 30 for the majority of the world.</strong></p>



<p>The table below shows the exact release time and date for major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Mega Rising Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – Oct. 29</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">1 AM – Oct. 30</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">2 AM – Oct. 30</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">6 AM – Oct. 30</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4 PM – Oct. 30</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-b1-mega-rising-confirmed-cards-list">Pokémon TCG Pocket B1 Mega Rising Confirmed Cards List</h2>



<p><strong>The Mega Rising set in Pokémon TCG Pocket</strong> <strong>is headlined by the introduction of Mega Evolutions, following the release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Mega Evolutions returning in the physical TCG.</strong></p>



<p>Ahead of release, the full set list has been <a href="https://www.serebii.net/tcgpocket/megarising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">detailed by Serebii</a>, featuring Mega Pinsir, Mega Blaziken, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Altaria amongst the cards. In total, there are 331 cards in the set—broken down into 226 normal cards and 105 Secret Rares.</p>



<p>The set will be split into three booster packs, like Genetic Apex was in the initial release of the game.</p>
