Though the RPG does a decent job of introducing things to you slowly, by the time you have a full party, you’re juggling pretty distinct characters with bespoke playstyles and trying to find some way to make them fit together. Part of the fun is experimenting with different characters, ability sets, and combos to find what works best for you, so I won’t try to influence your playstyle too much.

			<p>Now that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-to-launch-in-october-game-is-done-with-only-polishing-left/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a firm release window of October 2025</a>, new developer The Chinese Room (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-comes-fall-2024-developed-by-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> Hardsuit Labs a few years ago) has discussed the long-awaited role-playing game sequel in an exclusive interview that appeared in the <a href="https://fave.co/42tOSlw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest issue of PC Gamer magazine</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of the game's dialogues, Game Director Alex Skidmore emphasized that they will feel like a maze, partly to avoid people just heading straight toward the standard good choice options.</p>
<p><em>We ultimately want narrative exploration, so each of those dialogue trees is a kind of maze. So we didn’t want people to sort of switch off and go, ‘I’m looking for the good choice, or the Paragon choice’. Because the moment you do that, you’re always going to press top right or whatever.</em></p>
<p>Even though this new iteration of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will put players in the role of an Elder vampire called <a href="https://wccftech.com/phyres-role-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-explained-in-latest-developer-diary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phyre</a> (rather than the newly created Thinblood originally imagined by Hardsuit Labs), The Chinese Room made sure to leave plenty of room for players to interpret the character however they want. Narrative Director Ian Thomas explained:</p>
<p><em>We’re deliberately leaving space for the player. If we went, ‘Here is your character, they’re like this, they have done this, all of these things,’ actually, in a way, it’s not important that they know all that backstory – at least to start with, because we are dumping them into a new and unfamiliar situation.</em></p>
<p><em>How we show the status of the character is in other people’s reactions to that character. And so, rather than saying at the beginning, you’re a legend, we build that by people’s reactions to you. Then there’s the power level, which I think would show pretty heavily very early on. The first time you accidentally punch a guy across a room, which I think is very different from the start of Bloodlines 1.</em></p>
<p>At the start of the game, Phyre, who is waking up after a long slumber, is bound and stripped of most of their Elder powers. However, even in this state, they're still a force to be reckoned with. Lead Sound Designer Tessa Verplancke adds:</p>
<p><em>They’re much more quiet. Their foley doesn’t make as much noise because even without their powers, even when they’re nerfed, they’re way more silent than all the rest of them. You can feel how strong and powerful they are. Even if you can’t use all of their powers, when they’re climbing up things, they don’t even need to have a little exertion when they do it. So even in their movements, they’ve been made to be more powerful audibly, and you can subtly tell that nothing is really difficult for you.</em></p>
<p>We expect to learn much more about Bloodlines 2 over the next five months or so. Stay tuned for more info.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/656552/clair-obscur-expedition-33-battles<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> has flashy, thrilling battles, but the best thing about them is how you can twist the game’s many systems to your advantage. The turn-based RPG combat might feel familiar, but it offers a lot of ways to customize your approach to battles so that you can do absolutely devastating amounts of damage.</p><p>In <em>Expedition 33,</em> you play as a group of Expeditioners who aim to destroy The Paintress, a mysterious being that erases everyone of a certain age every year. In battles, you can have up to three of your party participating in a fight, and should they all die, you can call in your teammates who are in reserve to try and finish off the enemies. </p><p>To show you how deep the rabbit hole can go in customizing your team, here’s my approach to building out just one character, the fencer Maelle. Every character can equip three “Pictos,” which offer passive buffs like giving you the defense-boosting Shell status at the start of a fight. But after you win a few fights with a Pictos equipped, other characters can <em>also</em> equip the Pictos as a “Lumina” by using “Lumina Points,” which you accumulate through leveling up and by using a resource you can find in the game.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Kepler Interactive</cite></p></div><p>When you mix and match Pictos and Luminas to stack complimentary bonuses, things really get going. For my version of Maelle, I set a combination of Pictos and Luminas that could let her deal potentially enormous amounts of damage, especially if a lucky critical hit and a coin-flip 200 percent damage buff went through. But as a counterbalance to Maelle’s huge power, some of the Pictos and Luminas also increased the amount of damage she <em>received</em>, so I added defensive ones that helped her better withstand hits.</p><p>In battle, each character also has a unique mechanic that, when used properly, lets you make their attacks more effective. Maelle, for example, relies on different “stances” that you can shift into: an offensive stance that increases the damage you give but also the damage you receive, a defensive stance that reduces the damage you take, and a “virtuous” stance that does 200 percent damage but can be harder to set up.</p><p>With Maelle, you can move into the different stances based on which of your six different “skills” you use in battle — and like with Pictos and Luminas, those are also customizable and have their own traits and potential synergies. </p><p>It can be a lot to manage, and the game often helps in battles by adding a little sparkle to suggest a move for your current situation. But even within the first few hours of the game, I was able to grasp the potential of what was possible with the battle system. And with Maelle, when I nailed the combination of setting up the right stance and a lucky break from my Pictos and Luminas, I regularly could absolutely demolish my foes by dealing thousands of points of damage. (A late-game Pictos that let me exceed 9,999 points of damage in a single hit was particularly welcome.)</p><p>That’s just my approach with one character; each of the other party members has their own playstyles to experiment with and potential skills to use. Your equipped weapons are an element to consider, too. The game shines when everyone’s abilities and skills line up perfectly for a series of explosive hits, and it’s especially satisfying when things come together to melt down a tricky boss’s health bar.</p><p>I definitely didn’t use <em>Expedition 33</em>’s battle system, which makes things easy to experiment with, to its fullest. Once I found a combination of characters and skills that I liked, I rarely deviated from them. But I have lots of ideas on how to try things differently for a hard mode run — I’m sure there are a lot more ways to absolutely break the game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/review/bloodlines-2-dialogues-are-maze-like-to-avoid-people-beelining-for-the-good-choices/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Now that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-to-launch-in-october-game-is-done-with-only-polishing-left/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a firm release window of October 2025</a>, new developer The Chinese Room (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-comes-fall-2024-developed-by-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> Hardsuit Labs a few years ago) has discussed the long-awaited role-playing game sequel in an exclusive interview that appeared in the <a href="https://fave.co/42tOSlw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest issue of PC Gamer magazine</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of the game's dialogues, Game Director Alex Skidmore emphasized that they will feel like a maze, partly to avoid people just heading straight toward the standard good choice options.</p>
<p><em>We ultimately want narrative exploration, so each of those dialogue trees is a kind of maze. So we didn’t want people to sort of switch off and go, ‘I’m looking for the good choice, or the Paragon choice’. Because the moment you do that, you’re always going to press top right or whatever.</em></p>
<p>Even though this new iteration of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will put players in the role of an Elder vampire called <a href="https://wccftech.com/phyres-role-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-explained-in-latest-developer-diary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phyre</a> (rather than the newly created Thinblood originally imagined by Hardsuit Labs), The Chinese Room made sure to leave plenty of room for players to interpret the character however they want. Narrative Director Ian Thomas explained:</p>
<p><em>We’re deliberately leaving space for the player. If we went, ‘Here is your character, they’re like this, they have done this, all of these things,’ actually, in a way, it’s not important that they know all that backstory – at least to start with, because we are dumping them into a new and unfamiliar situation.</em></p>
<p><em>How we show the status of the character is in other people’s reactions to that character. And so, rather than saying at the beginning, you’re a legend, we build that by people’s reactions to you. Then there’s the power level, which I think would show pretty heavily very early on. The first time you accidentally punch a guy across a room, which I think is very different from the start of Bloodlines 1.</em></p>
<p>At the start of the game, Phyre, who is waking up after a long slumber, is bound and stripped of most of their Elder powers. However, even in this state, they're still a force to be reckoned with. Lead Sound Designer Tessa Verplancke adds:</p>
<p><em>They’re much more quiet. Their foley doesn’t make as much noise because even without their powers, even when they’re nerfed, they’re way more silent than all the rest of them. You can feel how strong and powerful they are. Even if you can’t use all of their powers, when they’re climbing up things, they don’t even need to have a little exertion when they do it. So even in their movements, they’ve been made to be more powerful audibly, and you can subtly tell that nothing is really difficult for you.</em></p>
<p>We expect to learn much more about Bloodlines 2 over the next five months or so. Stay tuned for more info.</p>

		<p>Publisher Awaken Realms has announced that Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon, the follow up to Tainted Grail: Conquest, will be getting its full 1.0 release on May 23rd. The game will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS. If you are unfamiliar with Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon, it is an open world fantasy action RPG with a branching storyline.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/utDgF27366E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon will have three regions open to exploration including the Misty Horns of the South, the sun drenched Cuanacht, and the wintry Forlorn Swords. Across these three regions there will be over 200 side quests, more than 250 individual non playable characters, over 400 weapons and shields to equip yourself with, an inventory of over 50 spells, dozens of dungeons to explore, more than 100 enemy types, and the main quest will apparently have hundreds of endings based upon your actions and decisions. Another big addition for the full release of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon will be the inclusion of a third person perspective, where before the game was going to be a solely first person perspective title.</p>
<p>Awaken Realms has also stated that applications are now open to help test the 1.0 build of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon, and if you are interested you have to fill the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZHEbudX-V0ZE50XFt7nCfT1I8mXRgni95Ny8QAZ9repB_nA/viewform">Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon 1.0 version playtest</a> form. If your application is successful you will gain access to the main release of the game, though some content will still be missing, and an exclusive Discord channel to provide feedback directly to the development team.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/02/tainted-grail-conquest-review/">Tainted Grail: Conquest Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Tainted Grail: Conquest review, Jason said, <em>“Any game so good that you can’t resist doing just one more battle in is a game well worth paying attention to, and Tainted Grail definitely manages that.”</em></p>

            <p>
There isn't a huge list of things that'll immediately sell me on your game, but there is one that'll draw me in without fail pretty much every single time: you can drive around in a kei truck. Now, admittedly, there are very few games where you can actually do this, the delightful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/promise-mascot-agency">Promise Mascot Agency</a> being the most recent one. There's the yet to be released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2961860/Honcho/">Honcho</a> from the devs behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/landlords-super">Landlord's Super</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jalopy">Jalopy</a>, you can bet your bottom dollar I'll be playing that one. And now, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/easy-delivery-co">Easy Delivery Co.</a>, a game with a kei truck that isn't exactly what it says on the tin.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In Easy Delivery Co., you are an <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a> by way of PS1 game-esque cat character, who drives around a kei truck in a snowy mountainside town delivering different things. That indie PS1 aesthetic can obviously feel a bit overdone in some cases now, but Easy Delivery Co. just looks right, a bit dreary, a bit lonely even, yet with a hint of goofiness about it. Good stuff!

<p>
The game's Steam page notes that there's "definitely no secrets", which between you and me I think might just be a lie. Apparently the soundtrack is made up of lo-fi, drum 'n' bass, and jungle tracks, a real late '90s, early 2000s arcade racer vibe it seems. Oh, and there's a four-player split-screen co-op <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing</a> mode too? Dang, this game was just made to be played on a CRT, something I'll be doing as soon as I'm able to.
</p>
<p>
According to a press release developer Sam C is inspired by games like Animal Crossing, but also <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-long-dark">The Long Dark</a>, a pairing of games I would never think to make in my life, except here I am craving just that. No release date in sight for Easy Delivery Co. bar "later this year", so in the meantime you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3293010/Easy_Delivery_Co/">wishlist it on Steam here</a>, and check out its demo too!

            <p>
I'm sure like me, some of you would really like another <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> game. A Nier 3, if you will, except I won't, because it already came out and it was called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-reincarnation">Nier Reincarnation</a>. Unfortunately it was also a free-to-play mobile game, and as most mobile games are destined for, it shut down last year rendering it completely unplayable. Nier celebrated its 15th anniversary this year, so far with no big announcements, though there is a new website that's slowly sharing bits of a special novel. And curiously enough, it appears to be teasing something Nier Reincarnation related.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewillarowe.bsky.social/post/3lnnoessmzk2k">journalist Willa Rowe</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-is-teasing-something-nier-related-again-in-a-cryptic-website-update">IGN</a>), the website is doing something a bit odd. At the end of the <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nier-anniversary/15th-novel/e58f8b/space/">most recently released chapter</a>, there's some kind of computer log, a cryptic bit of text that specifically references the official Japanese website for Nier Reincarnation. In fact the specific wording leading up to the link to said website says "recovery protocol initialised."
</p>
<p>
There's even some lore stuff teased when you right click and view page source, referencing characters called Her and Him that appeared in Reincarnation, as well as a reference to The Cage, the main setting of the game. It's all a bit odd, suitably Yoko Taro, and of course has me and everyone else hoping that this is suggesting some kind of Nier Reincarnation re-release/ port is on the way.
</p>
<p>
Here's the thing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>: I'd really like it if you did that. I didn't manage to catch up to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG's</a> main story in time, and even if I put all of the combat stuff on autopilot it's just not the same watching cutscene compilations on YouTube.
</p>
<p>
We can only assume that some kind of Nier project <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/big-cool-weirdo-yoko-taro-may-or-may-not-be-working-on-something-that-may-or-may-not-be-nier">will be coming, some time, eventually, maybe</a>, though it would be nice for an actual bit of news. Or, like, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-automata">Nier Automata</a> re-release with an equally annoying name to write as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-replicant">Nier Replicant ver. 1.22</a> blah blah blah's that adds a lore critical sword or whatever.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-start-ringing-the-new-skates-death-knell-because-ea-says-its-online-only<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
I think to properly convey my severe dislike of always online games I'd probably need more space and time than what an average RPS news article provides, but I'll try to contain myself on this one. You see, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/electronic-arts">EA's</a> just started up this new thing it calls <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-one?isLocalized=true">The Grind</a> (like what you do on a skateboard, get it?), which they describe as their "platform to talk directly to you, the community." The first volume had quite a few questions from expectant skaters about the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate">Skate</a> reboot, one of the first being whether or not it'll have an offline mode. Can you already guess from my tone so far that it won't?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Because, as EA put it, "the simple answer" is "no." They go on to explain that the "game and city are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox that is always online and always evolving. You’ll see bigger things evolve, like changes to the city over time, as well as smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities." According to EA, this isn't possible without a live connection, which I'm sure might actually have a technical justification, it just stinks a bit.
</p>
<p>
My guess is that they want to Fortnite-ify Skate so that the city can change in substantial ways, which is a cool concept! It just also means you're eventually bound to get situations like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> where the game is just unplayable (which has resulted in a lawsuit, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-2-is-getting-an-offline-mode-play-test-and-it-unsurprisingly-wont-have-all-of-its-online-features">offline modes for The Crew 2 and Motorfest</a>). Maybe EA will add in an offline mode eventually so that the game will last longer than the live service fad, but I won't put any bets on it.
</p>
<p>
In terms of other, less annoying details, EA do still plan to launch Skate into early access some time in 2025 at least. They also clarified that "there will be 'cool' things for you to earn and customize your character without having to spend real cash," if you're someone that likes your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free-to-play games</a> to be completely free. New areas won't be paywalled either, and there's no sort of pay-to-win element. Still don't like the online-only stuff, but all of that sounds good at least.

						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>No matter how it is looked at, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is one of the few video games released to date that can be described as magical. Launching at a time when the medium was about to blow up like it never managed to do before, the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda took everything its predecessor did right, and brought it up to eleven in such a way that no one who happened to get acquainted with Emperor Uriel Septim VII in the dungeons of the Imperial Prison could ever forget the journey through Cyrodiil to prevent the forces of Oblivion from ravaging Tamriel.</p>
<p>Though it is fondly remembered by all those who had the pleasure of experiencing it, the original Oblivion is not without issues. While revolutionary in many ways, some of the gameplay features felt somewhat clunky, even in 2006, and the usual smattering of Bethesda's trademark bugs negatively impacted the experience, although they ultimately contributed to the game's legendary and magical status.</p>
<p>Nineteen years later, Bethesda <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to bring back their magical role-playing game with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, and so far, the player response seems great, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-breaks-4-million-players-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four million players registered in the first four days</a>. This remaster does an excellent job updating the classic role-playing game without removing any of the features that still make it unique to this day, for better or worse, starting with the massively enhanced visuals. Taking advantage of the latest version of Unreal Engine 5, Virtuos did an incredible job making Cyrodiil look gorgeous with new character models that do a much better job higlighting the physical differences between the different races, a new lighting system powered by UE5 Lumen, new highly-detailed environmental assets, new weather effects and spell animations.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250423173956_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unsurprisingly, most new visual features and changes look incredible, but they have some downsides. For starters, as sadly expected in a game powered by Unreal Engine 5, there are performance issues on PC. The game runs pretty well in closed-off environments, but the performance leaves a lot to be desired in the open world. In two different benchmarking sessions, held in the sewers during The Path of Dawn quest to meet with the Sponsor to obtain the Mythic Dawn Commentaries 4 book, at 4K resolution, NVIDIA DLSS in Quality Mode, Frame Generation Hardware Lumen and every setting at high, the game ran at an average of 141 FPS, 24 1% low, with minimal stuttering that did not impact the experience a lot.</p>
<p>In the open world, however, things are quite different, as the game ran at an average of 107 FPS, 15 1% low with frequent stuttering. My system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) should be more than capable of handling Oblivion Remastered well, at least based on the system requirements, so it's clear that more work is needed on the optimization front. During my first playthrough of the base game's main quest, the game also crashed a few times, so the remaster suffers from some stability issues.</p>
<p>Besides the performance and stability issues, which will hopefully get addressed with post-launch updates, there's one more reason why some may not particularly like a visual overhaul of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. The original's distinct bloom-heavy looks and soft and hazy lighting, which suited the game's unique dreamlike nature, have been completely replaced with a more toned-down look and darker color grading that aligns with modern games. I didn't mind the more grounded tone of the overhauled visuals too much, but there's no denying that something has inevitably been lost in the remaster. This is ultimately a more subjective point of view, though, and it's one easily remedied on PC with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/72" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReShade presets</a> and the like.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250424170447_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The gameplay improvements featured in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered are sure to be more universally appreciated, as they increase the fun without taking away some of the game's unique quirks.</p>
<p>The improved movement and combat animations make fighting enemies more satisfying, as hits have more weight and impact than the original. Third-person camera and controls, which allow players to move the character independently from the camera's direction, have been vastly improved and are in line with Bethesda's latest RPG offering, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">Starfield</a>. This makes playing the game in third-person view more viable than ever. However, in my opinion, the first-person view is still the best way to play.</p>
<p>Another addition that massively improves the experience is the ability to sprint, which makes traversal faster and, in turn, the entire experience more enjoyable, although it comes with the side effect of making the game's map feel slightly smaller. Other welcome changes are the interface overhaul which brings the game on par with its successor, Skyrim, some new menu shortcuts assigned to a controller's dpad which make accessing fundamental menu features much smoother like inventory and map, a brand new character creator that allows players to go even crazier and create some of the most unnerving mosntrousities seen this side of Tamriel, an overhauled, and much better, leveling system, and toned down enemy scaling which makes the game slightly more approachable at all difficulty levels.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered also features audio enhancements, such as new voicework across the game added on top of the old voicework. There are additional voiced lines from renowned actors like Sean Bean and Patrick Stewart, new environmental audio effects for NPC voices and sound to make the experience more immersive, new combat sound effects, and a higher quality soundtrack, which is highly welcome, considering how good it is even at a lower quality. These improvements, much like the gameplay enhancements and the inclusion of all downloadable content released for the original, including the excellent The Shivering Isles expansion, go a long way toward making The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered the definitive edition of the game, and the best way to experience this epic quest in 2025, though some newcomers will inevitably have trouble getting into the game if all they have experienced of the series is Skyrim.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250423174756_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Even with its new coat of paint and all gameplay enhancements, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is still markedly a game from the early 2000s. Its gameplay mechanics powered by the the original game engine, the remaster still plays like it for the most part, with all its clunkiness almost intact, its smallish open world, compared to modern games, its weird NPCs, who still behave in their iconic comical way, like the iconic Highwayman taking gold from the player, only to comment how worthless it is once it is stolen back, its quirky combat system that often makes fighting enemies more frustrating than fun, and a general "randomness" to the entire experience that can feel very hard to get into, coming off from modern RPG or even just Skyrim. It's this randomness, however, that makes Oblivion such a unique game.</p>
<p>Anything can happen in Cyrondiil. A grounded quest may turn into complete mayhem as it proceeds, and NPCs and other gameplay elements may interact unexpectedly and sometimes comically, with the same unpredictability of a dream, incentivizing experimentation like in the best immersive role-playing games on the market. It is not an experience for everyone, to be sure, but once it clicks, one becomes a fan of life, making it very easy to set aside the game's undeniable shortcomings completely.</p>

<p>Though some of the changes and the performance issues will inevitably turn some players off, there's no denying that the fourth entry in the series couldn't have made its debut on modern gaming platforms better than it did with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. Updating the experience where required while keeping true to the original, Virtuos has developed an amazing remaster that does proper justice to one of the most beloved role-playing games ever released. PC players can also tweak it further to their liking thanks to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-seems-to-be-rather-well-suited-to-mods-and-one-of-them-adds-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many mods already available on Nexus</a>.</p>

The thing about computers is that they're just really annoying, actually. They're massively complicated, constantly changing machines, and despite the fact the hardware is technically better now, they can sometimes struggle to run older games because of… reasons. Those reasons often being software issues I won't even attempt to understand. So, it always brings a smile to my face when I see another game back from the dead through the efforts of GOG's preservation program, the most recent entry being the classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-japanese-games-to-play-on-pc">JRPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/breath-of-fire-iv">Breath of Fire 4</a>.

<p>
You see, Breath of Fire 4 did actually have a PC release way back in the day. It was originally released for the PS1 back in 2000, later coming to PC in 2003, though only for Japan and Europe. As mentioned, the problem with older PC games is that they don't always work on modern hardware, and ignoring that it can be tough to track down legitimate copies of certain games. With <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv">Breath of Fire 4 joining GOG's preservation program</a> however, it's now playable on Windows 10 and 11.

<p>
Outside of that, there's a few new display options like a windowed mode, V-Sync, Anti-Aliasing, and refined gamma correction for better visuals, alongside an upgrade to the audio engine. That one has brought back some previously missing environmental sounds, and you'll have a few options to tinker around with now too. Plus, it being GOG, the game is DRM-free, so if you decide to pick it up it's yours forever.
</p>
<p>
Breath of Fire 4 isn't the only game to be spruced up either, there's other classics like Ultima Underworld 1+2, Worms: Armageddon, and Tex Murphy: Under a Killing Moon. Good stuff! Looking forward to whatever the GOG preservation program brings back next.

<p>As the fourth season hasn't yet aired, it's hard to know where, exactly, in Geralt's chronology we find him, but the sword on his back suggests it's after he was gifted the blade from Zoltan, which has yet to happen on the show.</p>
<p>As the location is "filled with beehives and beekeepers", some think this could be a scene from Andrzej Sapkowski’s Tower of the Swallow, where Geralt encounters beekeepers who direct him to druids. Druid costumes spotted on set seem to strengthen the theory.</p> <div>

<p>The shots also evidence that Hemsworth stuck around to reprise The Witcher role for the final season after assuming it from Henry Cavill, who bowed out of the show at the end of season three.

<p>In related news about the game, we recently learned CD Projekt Red has recast <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s Ciri. Whilst originally it only sounded as though the character's original actor, Jo Wyatt, had been replaced in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">Witcher 4's reveal trailer</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-the-witcher-4s-ciri-has-been-recast">development studio has now confirmed it</a>, albeit without expanding on why Berkeley had been brought in to replace Wyatt.</p>
<p>Last week, CD Projekt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-beta-test-invites-a-scam-cd-projekt-warns">warned fans of a The Witcher 4 beta test "scam"</a>, saying it's "been taking the necessary steps to take this fraudulent messaging down".</p>
<p>The studio shared its warning to the Witcher community in a statement posted to social media, writing, "Recently, we've been getting reports from some community members that they've been invited to a beta test of The Witcher 4 - this is a scam!"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Earlier this month <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/nacon">Nacon</a> did something unthinkable, completely unpredictable with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>… <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/may-is-no-longer-the-month-of-spice-as-dune-awakening-catches-a-three-week-long-delay">they delayed it</a>. Alright, fine, generally the opposite is true for big games these days, but it did come down to the wire in the greater scheme of things as it was due out this coming May 20th. Now the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> is slated to be released on June 10th (or June 5th for those with early access), just three weeks extra. That "meh" news did come with some "oh that's cool" news though, as a large-scale beta was promised. Now, following a snazzy new story trailer, a date for said beta has been set!
</p>

<p>
According to said trailer, the beta is taking place this coming May 9th to 12th, with a press release claiming it'll be the biggest one yet. That doesn't mean you're guaranteed access though, you'll have to request to take part on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">game's Steam page</a>. Alternatively on May 10th a livestream is being held which will be giving out tens of thousands of beta keys, so your chances generally sound pretty good. Said livestream will be <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/funcom/schedule?segmentID=49b3762a-2470-485a-9a21-ce7ad63209c0">held on Nacon's Twitch channel</a>.

<p>
The beta sounds like it'll be a pretty beefy one too, the press release notes that it'll include the first 20 hours of the game and "most of Act 1 of the story." Unlike previous betas, there won't be an NDA this time, so you'll be free to post about getting eaten by a sandworm or whatever to your heart's content.
</p>
<p>
That new story trailer also very much seems to be setting up a chosen one-esque storyline which isn't anything new to the MMO genre, though I do think it's a bit tired by now. Ah well, I'm sure a bit of spice will set things right.

The French RPG is clearly inspired by the Japanese greats like <em>Final Fantasy </em>and <em>Persona</em>, but its <em>Paper Mario</em>-style timing elements and wealth of original mechanics keep its grind engaging and decidedly modern. My time with the game hasn’t been without frustrations, but I’m writing these impressions wishing I could be playing the game instead.

            <p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty</a> fan had a run-in with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) after trying to get a "replica explosive device" Monkey Bomb onto a plane in the US earlier this year.</p>
<p>The figurine - styled on the in-game version which is used to distract enemies - was showcased online after the organisation shared a number of its more memorable contraband seizes on social media.</p>

<p>"Our officers at Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) had a 'What the frag?!?' moment when they discovered this replica explosive device in a passenger's checked bag," the TSA quipped in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1202998258156542">Facebook post</a>, sharing an image that appears to show a phone holder and charger (thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-fan-runs-into-tsa-by-trying-to-take-monkey-bomb-on-plane-3185682/">Dexerto</a>).</p>
<p>"This monkey may rack up points in a game, but in real life, leave the gear for your loadout screen, not your baggage. Replica weapons and explosives, no matter how cool or collectible, aren't allowed in either carry-on or checked baggage."</p>
<p>The post racked up thousands of responses, with many taking umbrage with the organisation's decision to seize it.</p>
<p>"So basically, you took a child's toy. If it's not real, did you only take it to post on Facebook?" asked one.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Activision confirmed it was amending crossplay functionality in Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Season 3 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-will-allow-players-to-turn-off-crossplay-in-an-effort-to-limit-cheating">to allow players to restrict matchmaking to consoles only</a>. Effectively, this means console players can turn off crossplay with PC players across all the game's major multiplayer modes in an effort to limit cheating.</p>
<p>While removing crossplay was already available in the game's ranked modes, the new options will extend this to all multiplayer modes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With </span></span><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/split-fiction/"><span><span><span><span>a 91 on Metacritic</span></span></span></span></a><span><span> and </span></span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hazelightgames.bsky.social/post/3lkbeztsqbs2b"><span><span><span><span>two million copies sold within the first week</span></span></span></span></a><span><span> of its release, it's about as big a success as the studio could ask for.&nbsp; Yesterday, however, Variety reported the game is on its way to an even bigger audience, as it's in the works to become a feature film.</span></span></p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fcwngWPXQtg" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p><span><span>Jon M. Chu, best known for his recent work on the film adaptation of <em>Wicked</em>, would direct the movie. While Chu has never adapted a video game before, he has built his career transferring stories from other media onto the big screen, including books, cartoons, and recently, Broadway musicals. At the very least, he's been successful in directing at least one movie starring two women with magical abilities, so one can see the logic in bringing the assignment to him.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The project will also star Sydney Sweeney (</span></span><span><span>Euphoria, White Lotus, Madame Web</span></span><span><span>), though it's yet to be decided which of the leads, Mio or Zoe, she will play. Sweeney is also set to executive produce the film. Oddly, this is the second piece of Sweeney-related game adaptation news we got this week, since </span></span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/report/2025/04/21/sydney-sweeney-to-produce-michael-bay-directed-outrun-movie"><span><span><span><span>she'll also be producing a Michael Bay-directed adaptation of Outrun, a Sega racing series</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Story Kitchen is set to produce the film and bring the project to movie studios, as none have picked it up yet. The production company happens to have tons of other game adaptations in the works as well, including films based on Just Cause, Ruiner, Shinobi, and a live-action Tomb Raider series.</span></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-until-dawn-movies-greatest-weakness-is-straying-so-far-away-from-the-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>This article contains spoilers for the </strong></em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-movie-review-david-f-sandberg"><u><em><strong>Until Dawn</strong></em></u></a><em><strong> movie.</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been racking my brain over the conundrum that is adapting Until Dawn. Supermassive Games' deconstruction of horror cinema through choice-based butterfly effect mechanics is essentially a 10-hour playable movie—a damn fine one written by indie horror staples Larry Fessenden and Graham Reznick—so a film adaptation couldn't just be the same thing. But a film that isn’t indebted to the game and its "choose your own adventure" method doesn't feel appropriate either. Sony's desire to release an Until Dawn adaptation seemed misguided upon announcement, and after viewing the film, it's still a headscratcher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's because David F. Sandberg's Until Dawn movie betrays the core hook of Supermassive's Until Dawn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Writers Gary Dauberman and Blair Butler chose to adapt Until Dawn as its title reads. In this case, "Until Dawn" translates into a time-loop-like horror scenario where five young adults find themselves hunted by various baddies, and they only escape if they can survive … until dawn. Should anyone die, they'll wake once a gigantic hourglass fixed to an ominous, skull-adorned mount drops its last grain of sand. Die enough times, and you become a wendigo lost to Dr. Alan J. Hill's delirious experiment. The core impetus of a missing sibling is still there—Ella Rubin's protagonist, Clover, is hunting for her missing sister—but otherwise, you're not on Blackwood Mountain aka Mount Washington (er…yet), and certainly not similarly punished for choices that alter narrative paths.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's… not Until Dawn. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Until Dawn Gallery</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Death Shouldn't Be An Afterthought</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In the game, death matters. It matters so much, in fact, that killing a single character sends ripple effects felt throughout the remaining storylines. There's no regeneration or second chances. Like, famously. That's the point of Until Dawn. The stakes are so astronomically high, the slightest nervous twitch of your controller during a "stay still" Quicktime event could doom multiple characters. Dauberman and Butler fail to translate the nerve-wracking experience of playing Until Dawn, landing on quite the opposite concept.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If anything, Until Dawn is a beginner's attempt at Cabin in the Woods. Glore Valley is drenched by a thunderstorm, except for a perfect circle of sunshine over the welcome center location, like some all-powerful horror movie god is controlling the rain—once again resembling Cabin in the Woods in terms of the “influencing environment” effect. The all-seeing overlord (Dr. Hill), the meta nature of characters joking about horror movie rules, and the different creatures unleashed each rewind? Despite countless plot configurations, the game's powerful storytelling is far superior to this random assortment of scary scenes tied to an hourglass clock. The game pulls players deeper into a web of intrigue, where the movie's Mad Libs nature drags viewers through a jumbled rotation of clowns-and-kooks randomness.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Points are awarded for at least using wendigos. In the game, Fessenden's "Stranger" character reveals that a 1952 mining cave-in led to cannibalism, and said cannibals turned into wendigos that now haunt Blackwood. Here, Clover and her friends start turning into wendigos due to Dr. Hill's experiments on Glore Valley from his sanatorium hideout (resembling his dingy in-game office). It's not a one-for-one translation, nor does it need to be, but the wendigos are overshadowed by a slasher villain vaguely costumed after Josh's psycho getup. There are also witches, porcelain doll-looking masks, creepypasta demons, and water that makes your entire body explode Scanners-style if you drink it. It's a hodgepodge of dangers that have nothing to do with Fessenden and Reznick's straightforward creature-centric game, outside of a few Easter eggs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The most obvious connection is Peter Stormare as Dr. Hill, Josh Washington’s (Rami Malek) hallucinated psychiatrist who runs players through rigorous psychological tests that influence future in-game details. However, even Dr. Hill features stark differences in the film vs. the original game. In the movie, he's seen as a gas station attendant, but it's not long before he's outed as former game character Dr. Hill—who's in control of experiments on Glore Valley. It’s here where we have the only direct reference to the game’s most well-known character, Josh Washington. After Clover discovers Hill’s “office,” we see her patient profile alongside Josh’s.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's some exposition about Hill's experiments as we watch prisoners cannibalize bodies and then turn into wendigos to highlight that connection to the game, but the reveal is followed by Clover defeating Dr. Hill pretty easily. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Except she doesn’t. Probably. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the film ends, we return to the dirty sanitarium office where Dr. Hill explodes after ingesting some 'splodey water, and on surveillance monitors, we see Blackwood's lodge. We then hear Dr. Hill speak, suggesting he was Clover's hallucination, much like Josh's in the game. But, that's right before the credits because I guess Sandberg's movie is an offshoot prequel that, for some reason, has nothing to do with the actual events of the Until Dawn game? If there is a sequel, presumably it'll be about Josh's case of vengeance paid unto the Blackwood group except based on the film's rules … somehow.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Cheap Easter Eggs Aren't Enough</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's just all so generic. Turning Dr. Hill into the baddie removes intrigue and becomes a cheap cop-out, torn from the game but improperly refitted. Then the stinger of Blackwood hits, which again is confusing <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/3865395/practical-effects-easter-eggs-deleted-scenes-more-with-until-dawn-director-david-sandberg-maxime-alexandre-interview/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>because in interviews</u></a>, Sandberg insists his film takes place after the game's timeline—but Blackwood's reveal suggests it's not a sequel, but a prequel. Inconsequentiality plagues Sandberg's film in a way that makes you wonder why it's even tied to Until Dawn (*cough* intellectual property reasons *cough*), which only causes Blackwood's tease to be even more spoonfed and underwhelming. For so long, Until Dawn (the movie) bears no resemblance to Until Dawn (the game)—why pivot back toward the game at the last minute?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Until Dawn: Movie Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason is simple: to appease us fans. There are choice moments that attempt to help us relive the game, but they're crammed in like afterthoughts. Ji-young Yoo's spiritualist character Megan has everyone hold hands in silence, mimicking the game's quiet "hold your breath" Quicktime events. There's a shot bathed in red lighting where a wendigo is right by a frightened Clover, and that's a direct reference to the "Don't Move" instructions. But the game's cinematic nature doesn't yield many other level-based opportunities to recreate, nor does the film try. The adaptation’s biggest issue is it never fully comprehends how best to honor Supermassive's inspiration while telling a fresh horror tale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What else might you recognize? The wendigo audio files are plucked from the game, reusing the same noises. There's also Abe's first death of being chopped in half, which could be respect paid to Josh's fake death in the game, or maybe that's just a lucky coincidence. Are the werewolf sketches in the witch's cabin a possible reference to The Quarry? Is the radio in the basement the same radio in the game where characters find out they must survive until dawn? Chances are yes, but these Easter eggs feel forced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Look, I'm all for a "spiritual successor." But to do so, there has to be some resemblance to the thing you are named after. While I don't think Until Dawn is a terrible movie, it's a bad Until Dawn movie. It's a far cry from the urgency and invasive dread that Supermassive so easily conjures, speaking to what makes the playable horror movie such a blast to complete (over and over). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As is, the Until Dawn movie doesn't make much sense in context. The events of Glore Valley are a grab bag of ideas from other horror movies that would be nothing but a clip show without Dr. Hill's inclusion. But even with Stormare's reprised role, it's only Until Dawn at face value, nothing deeper. I get the interpretation of the gang's choices forcing them to keep restarting, but it's still too far off-base to consider this adaptation anything more than unfaithful. In the end, Until Dawn is a missed opportunity to bring Supermassive's smash-hit game to life.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

This week, overall, is a great week for Chaos (check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-world-eaters-gorestorm-slaughterpack-review-gory-goodness" rel="nofollow">our review of the other new Chaos Battleforce, the Gorestorm Slaughterpack</a>), so follow along as we hold our noses and get into the funk with the Poxwrought Vector Battleforce box, up for preorder now!</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector Battleforce Contents:</h2>

<p>The Poxwrought Vector&nbsp;contains the following miniatures:</p>

<ul><li>1x Lord of Poxes</li>
	<li>1x&nbsp;Foetid Bloat-drone</li>
	<li>1x Myphitic Blight-hauler</li>
	<li>1x&nbsp;Plagueburst Crawler</li>
	<li>5x Blightlord Terminators</li>
	<li>7x&nbsp;Plague Marines</li>
</ul><h3>Reappearing Ability: Nurgle's Gift [Aura]</h3>

<p>Many of the units in this box come with the Nurgle's Gift [Aura] special ability, so I think it's worth explaining that here before we dive into individual unit profiles! With a contagion range emanating out from each unit unit (range grows in the first three rounds), and while an enemy unit is within that range, that unit is Afflicted with one of three abilities you choose at the Declare Battle Formations step:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Overall:&nbsp;</strong>Each enemy unit that is Afflicted has 1 toughness subtracted.</li>
	<li><b>Option 1 - Skullsquirm Blight:&nbsp;</b>Each time a model in this (afflicted) unit makes an attack, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.</li>
	<li><strong>Option 2 - Rattlejoint Ague:&nbsp;</strong>Worsen the Save characteristic of models in this unit by 1.</li>
	<li><strong>Option 3 - Scabrous Soulrot:&nbsp;</strong>Worsen the Move, Leadership, and Objective Control characteristics of models in this unit by 1 (this rule can only worsen a model's OC characteristic to a minimum of 1).</li>
</ul><p>Now that we understand how Nurgle's Gift works, let's dive into the individual units!</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector&nbsp;- NEW UNIT:&nbsp;<b>Lord of Poxes</b></h2>

It is!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Lord of Poxes Stats: </b>Move: 5” / Toughness: 6 / Save: 3+ (4+ invuln.) / Wounds: 5 / Leadership: 6+ / OC: 1</p>

<p><b>Lord of Poxes Ranged Weapons:&nbsp;</b></p>

<ul><li><b>Plasma Pistol (standard):&nbsp;</b>Range: 12" / Attacks: 1 / BS: 2+ / Strength: 7 / AP: -2 / Damage: 1</li>
	<li><strong>Plasma Pistol (supercharged) (pistol/hazardous):&nbsp;</strong>Range: 12" / Attacks: 1 / BS: 2+ / Strength: 8 / AP: -3 / Damage: 2</li>
</ul><p><b>Lord of Poxes Melee Weapons:&nbsp;</b></p>

<ul><li><b>Great plague blade (devastating wounds, lethal hits): </b>Attacks: 6 / WS: 2+ / Strength: 8 / AP: -2 / Damage: 2</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<h3><b>Lord of Poxes Key Abilities At A Glance:</b></h3>

<ul><li><strong>Nurgle's Gift:&nbsp;</strong>(see above)</li>
	<li><strong>Gift of Poxes:&nbsp;</strong>Add 3" to the range of this model's Contagion Range.</li>
	<li><strong>Shroud of Disease:&nbsp;</strong>While this model is leading a unit, that unit cannot be targeted by ranged attacks unless the attacking model is within 18".</li>
</ul><h3>Play Tips For Running The Lord of Poxes:</h3>

<p>This unit can lead as an attachment to a unit of Plague Marines, and that's the best way to get him in there. Though not incredible on his own, by attaching him you're shielding your Marines from long-range weaponry with his Shroud of Disease ability. And extending out the Contagion Range turns an ordinary unit of Plague Marines into a walking, festering cloud of de-buffs.</p>

</ul><p><b>Plague Marines Melee Weapon Options:</b></p>

<ul><li><b>Plague Knives (standard), Bubotic Weapons, Heavy Plague Weapon, Power Fist</b></li>
</ul></blockquote>

<h3>Plague Marines Key Abilities At A Glance:</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Nurgle's Gift (Aura):</strong> See Above</li>
	<li><strong>Infused with the Blessings of Nurgle:</strong>&nbsp;In your Shooting phase, each time this unit is selected to shoot, after this unit has shot, select one enemy unit hit by one or more of those attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that enemy unit is Afflicted (<em>see Nurgle's Gift</em>&nbsp;<em>above for more info on Afflicted)</em></li>
	<li><strong>Icon of Despair (Aura):&nbsp;</strong>This Wargear Ability states that when an enemy unit is within 6" of the bearer, worsen the Leadership characteristic of models in that unit by 1.</li>
</ul><h3>Play Tips For Running Plague Marines:</h3>

<p>When paired with the Lord of Poxes, these Plague Marines should really be run as a tough, shoot-y unit that's out there sitting on an objective and spraying around the Afflicted condition on enemies that try to get close-in.</p>

<h3>Blightlord Terminators Key Abilities At A Glance:</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Nurgle's Gift (Aura):</strong> See Above</li>
	<li><strong>Blistering Fusillade:</strong>&nbsp;If this unit has a Starting Strength of 5 or more, or if a Character is leading this unit, then each time a model in this unit makes a ranged attack that targets an Afflicted unit, improve the Strength and Armor Penetration characteristics of that attack by 1.</li>
</ul><h3>Play Tips For Running Blightlord Terminators:</h3>

<p>There's nothing quite like slowly stomping toward your opponents (or unloading from a transport vehicle!) with a unit of Terminators, hunkering down with your 2+ save, and blasting them to bits. Add in the benefit you get from targeting Afflicted units, and it's about to get stanky in here!</p>

<p>There's a nice mobility here you don't find in on-foot units from this slow-as-sludge army, but unless you're expecting a lot of tanks in the meta you're up against, this might spend most of its time lobbing missiles and bile from a distance, hoping to score a few odd hits.</p>

<p>This is one of those units where the flavor of the weaponry at hand really shines through&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;helps guide you toward a play style. You want to send out shock-waves of spores into the thick of battle, so position your Plagueburst Crawler in just the right spot, launch that 48" ranged Mortar at your enemies, and laugh in that hacking cough way you do as the spores rain down destruction.</p>

<p>How you want to build this unit is up to you, as I think there's an argument to be made either to have two auto-hitting plaguespitters equipped, or the 10 (!!) hits on the Fleshmower. Either way, this unit is meant to get into the action, belt out wounds, and next turn fall back thanks to its Hovering Death ability.</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector Battleforce - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Now&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;is what a Battleforce should look like, in my opinion. With six different types of units included, this vehicle-heavy box set is a really fun way to get a new army onto the tabletop in a way that feels very different from other boxes. I think, generally speaking, the design of the Death Guard is some of the best in Warhammer 40K, and this box shows how that Nurgle rot manifests across so many different types of units.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656284/bionic-bay-review-ps5-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Wandering through <em>Bionic Bay</em>’s dark alien world is unsettling and awe-inspiring. There are massive structures with no clear purpose and autonomous factories filled with whirring saw blades and devastating lasers. It’s grim and unforgiving, with little light and harsh shadows that give everything a sinister tone. But then you step on a bomb and your character bounces off of walls like a pinball, and you realize it’s a game of contrasts.</p><p><em>Bionic Bay</em> is a curious blend of two very different genres. On the one hand, it’s an atmospheric side-scrolling adventure in the mold of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12050342/inside-review-xbox-one-steam"><em>Inside</em></a> and <em>Limbo</em>, filled with disturbingly stunning environments to explore. At the same time, it’s a hard-as-nails platformer like <em>Super Meat Boy</em>, with elaborate physics that will have you dying repeatedly while trying to find the best route through deadly obstacles. Somehow, the disparate vibes come together surprisingly well.</p><p>What first drew me to <em>Bionic Bay</em> was that dark world. It’s mysterious to the point that I still don’t actually know what it is you’re doing or why. But that mystery is a large part of the appeal. As you make your way through its levels, you’re subject to some incredible and intimidating environments, and it’s largely up to you to figure out what story the world is trying to tell. There are fiery factories, green areas where organic life merges with technology and architecture in disturbing ways, and dank sewers lit up by dripping bioluminescent goo. All of these spaces make you feel minuscule in comparison. It’s the kind of game where almost every moment makes for a great screenshot.</p><p>In order to see it all, though, you have to deal with a very tough game. While there is some relatively simple platforming at first, you’re soon presented with seemingly insurmountable tasks, like a series of spinning saw blades that require exacting jumps to get through. But it’s not as precise as it may seem. One of the more unique elements of <em>Bionic Bay</em> is its physics; the little guy you control is very sturdy and can survive being bounced around, so you can sometimes flop your way through trickier areas.</p><p><em>Bionic Bay</em> is also something of a puzzle game. You have access to multiple powers, like the ability to swap places with an inanimate object or slow down time (though you can only actively be using one). Combine these tools with the floppy physics and there are a lot of creative ways to get through the game.</p><p>Key to this is that <em>Bionic Bay</em> encourages experimentation. You will die a lot, but because the game has such a forgiving checkpoint system, there’s rarely much punishment for failure. Being able to quickly retry a jump keeps the game from being too frustrating while also making it easier to find a route that actually works. And if you have a wild idea about, say, riding on the back of a rocket to avoid killer laser beams, there’s no harm in trying.</p><p>The game isn’t easy. I’ve found myself stuck on a few occasions. And while I wish the game focused a little more on exploration, the weird and unforgiving world is also what helped me persevere through the trickier challenges. I just had to see what was next.</p><p>If you’re a fan of sci-fi works like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/19/15663380/blame-netflix-anime-tsutomu-nihei"><em>Blame!</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24086957/dune-part-two-movie-review"><em>Dune</em></a>, with their impressive sense of scale, <em>Bionic Bay</em> offers something very similar. You just have to work hard to see it all.</p><p><sub>Bionic Bay <em>is out now on the PS5 and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
