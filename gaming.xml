<p>Following the immense success of the live-action Fallout television series, thanks to Amazon Prime, it was only a matter of time before the series’ second season started attracting more high-profile names. Of course, season one ended on a cliffhanger, so we’re all beyond excited to dive in for more, and now we have a tidbit of information to run with. According to a recent report, Macaulay Culkin joins the cast of Fallout season two, apparently playing a ‘crazy genius-type’ character. I’m a little curious about the role, and something in me thinks his part involves the Enclave.</p>



<p>In the original report published by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/macaulay-culkin-cast-fallout-season-2-1236170530/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Macaulay Culkin’s role in the television series based on the long-popular role-playing game franchise remains relatively new. The only information we have about his performance is that he’s a crazy genius of some sort.</p>



<p>That said, Culkin joins a large and growing roster of exceptional stars, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ella Purnell</li>



<li>Walton Goggins</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-plays-knight-titus-in-the-fallout-tv-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aaron Moten</a></li>



<li>Kyle MacLachlan</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-is-xelia-mendes-jones-in-fallout-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xelia Mendes-Jones</a></li>
</ul>







<p>Following the overwhelming reception to the first season, which debuted as one of Prime Video’s Top 3 most-watched series and received 16 Emmy nominations, a second season was almost immediately greenlit for production. While it’s still a ways off, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallouts-second-season-starts-filming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filming begins shortly</a>.</p>

<p>On the topic of Fallout, did you hear we’ll soon be able to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-ghoul-character-meta-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play as a Ghoul in Fallout 76</a>? I’ll definitely roll a new character for the chance!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/empire-of-the-ants-single-player-campaign-review.1030488/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/empire-of-the-ants-single-player-campaign-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">This is not the anthill to die on.</h2></div><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It may be nice to look at, but Empire of the Ants’s single-player campaign is outright terrible and dull. It’s around 12 hours worth of missions that pivot between being pointlessly easy – due to a passive enemy AI that doesn’t even know how to use powers to buff its troops, which is crucial to success – to obnoxiously difficult on a dime, and it doesn’t let you save mid-mission. Most infuriatingly, there’s one where nine waves of enemies spawn and attack from all directions, and you instantly fail if you lose control of a single one of the seven nests you have to defend – so many that it’s impossible to upgrade them all with effective defenses. That last wave is a doozy, too, which meant I had to replay it from the start multiple times just to overcome the final challenging moments where they come in large enough numbers to be a threat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mixed in with those combat missions are absurdly tedious ones where you only control your single ant as you hunt for tiny bugs – which are usually very effectively camouflaged thanks to the realistic art style – spread across a big map. You’re guided only by a non-directional proximity sensor, so you have to run in circles to triangulate each bug. There are also “stealth” missions that don’t actually care if you’re detected as you scan enemy legions (dying has basically no consequences either), and these similarly amount to running around a map looking for things. Sometimes you’re told to catch butterflies or fireflies that fly away when you get close – the only way I found to do it was to wait for them to repeat their scripted movement pattern and land right in front of me, and that is exactly as much fun as it sounds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering you can climb any object and walk on the ceiling, it’s surprising that only a couple of the missions make any use of this ability at all, and those that do are mostly the boring, non-combat variety. (There was only one mission where my units fought upside-down, which was very funny because the corpses of dead ants rained down.) Similarly, the only thing Empire of the Ants does with its impressive sense of scale is give you a few objects – like a glass bottle or a toy giraffe – to run around, picking up little glowy things as you explore them. I’ll grant you that this does remind me of how I’ve seen real ants figure out if an object is something they want to eat, but I don’t think ants are doing this for fun, and I am not having much fun doing it either. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I don’t think ants are doing this for fun, and I am not having much fun doing it either.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You aren’t forced to do all of these missions to complete the campaign – you select missions by speaking to quest-giving ants in a sequence of hub areas that serve as a sort of menu – but I don’t recommend any of them, or the campaign in general. The nicest thing I can say about it is that it’s not all that buggy (other than… you know).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other thing you do in these hubs is talk to ants. I haven’t read the books Empire of the Ants is based on, but if the Wikipedia synopsis is anything to go by this game’s story isn’t even close to following them because there are no human characters or secret ant weapons to make it remotely interesting. I’m going to assume that its numerous conversations about how your nest is threatened by termites and other visually identical ant species or floods don’t do the novels justice. Even the ant civil war that breaks out is over almost as abruptly as it begins, ensuring there’s no substance there either.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">While Empire of the Ants’s nearly photo-realistic world looks incredible at first glance, its boring and annoying real-time strategy campaign is the ant-ithesis of that. Combat missions are mostly trivially easy because the AI doesn’t seem to understand crucial mechanics, and those that aren’t are obnoxious because you can’t save mid-mission to replay the tough parts without trudging through the easy setup; Meanwhile, all of the non-combat missions are tedious searches for needles in haystacks and the story fails to make ant politics intriguing. It’s easily the worst single-player campaign I’ve played in years.</p></div></div><div><div data-cy="review-content"><p>awful</p><p>Pretty to look at but painfully dull and frustrating to play, Empire of the Ants's single-player campaign has none of the depth of the multiplayer and packages bad AI with boring missions and a meandering story.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to Nvidia, only 6% of its subscribers go over 100-hours. Subscribers will also have the option to carry over 15 hours unused streaming time every month. But if players exceed 100-hours in any given month, they will have the option of buying 15-hour blocks of playtime.</p><p>Nvidia explained that the new 100-hour cap was put in place in order to avoid increasing the membership prices for "the foreseeable future." The company is also offering a temporary 25% discount on Ultimate and Performance day passes through November 22. Those day passes can be upgraded to monthly or six-month recurring memberships that can also lock in a year without the 100-hour restriction.</p>

            <p>
Nvidia has announced its GeForce Now cloud gaming service will soon introduce a playtime cap of 100 hours a month for paying Performance (previously Priority) and Ultimate subscribers, although additional hours can be purchased for a fee.
</p>
<p>
Nividia shared the news <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/1glr3yc/gfn_thursday_updates_november_7_2024/">on Reddit</a>, saying the limit would help it "continue providing exceptional quality and speed - as well as shorter queue times". It also insisted the switch from an unlimited allowance would "comfortably accommodate 94 percent of members".
</p>
<p>
Paying subscribers wanting to use GeForce Now for more than the allotted 100 hours per month - equating to approximately three hours per day - will now need to pay extra, with 15 additional hours costing $2.99 USD for Performance members and $5.99 for anyone subscribed to its Ultimate tier. Up to 15 unused hours will automatically roll over into the next month.

<p>
Nvidia's new restrictions come into affect at the start of 2025, but all existing subscribers - as well as anyone signing up before 31st December this year - will continue to get unlimited playtime until January 2026. The company also notes anyone currently subscribed to GeForce Now's Founders tier will retain their unlimited playtime hours for life, provided there's no lapse in their membership. Changing to an Ultimate subscription, however, will immediately apply the new terms, imposing the 100-hour monthly play limit from January 2026.
</p><p>
In addition to its playtime limitations, Nvidia has announced a number of new GeForce Now benefits. Subscribers to the newly renamed Performance tier will soon be able to stream in 1440p instead of the previous 1080p, and ultrawide resolutions will also be supported. Furthermore, all Performance and Ultimate subscribers will be able to save their in-game graphics settings across streaming sessions.

Specifically, when he first started talking to Capcom years ago, his sights weren't actually set on Devil May Cry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He began by sharing some quick thoughts on each of the three Dino Crisis games, praising the first two while conceding that the third "lost that magic" as it headed off Earth. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Why am I telling you this?" he continued. "Because when I first went to Capcom in 2017, my mission was clear: I wanted to bring Dino Crisis back. But in an awesome twist of fate, they sold me Devil May Cry instead! I didn’t think DMC would even be on the table."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">1.

"Like it’s cool Devil May Cry fans can eat but god damn.

There are a few reasons not to hold your breath, though: for one, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-doesnt-leave-room-for-a-dino-crisis-reboot-creator-shinki-mikami-says">Mikami said earlier this year</a> that the popularity of Monster Hunter doesn't leave a lot of room for another Dino Crisis entry. Plus, Capcom recently tried its hand at another dinosaur-focused game, Exoprimal, a multiplayer title that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-a-dino-crisis-for-capcom-as-it-abandons-new-exoprimal-content-just-a-year-after-launch">stopped adding new content just a year after its launch</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/29/dino-1724928513393.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Devil May Cry's Adi Shankar originally approached Capcom with the mission of bringing back Dino Crisis.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, hope for a revival in anime form isn't completely extinct just yet — even if it's a little thin.

<p>The series' writer and executive producer is slated to be Daniel Casey, who until now was best known as the primary screenwriter on <em>F9: The Fast Saga</em>, one of the late sequels in the Fast and the Furious franchise. He was also part of a team of writers behind the relatively little-known 2018 science fiction film <em>Kin</em>.</p>
<p>Karim Zreik will also produce, and his background is a little more encouraging; his main claim to fame is in the short-lived Marvel Television unit, which produced relatively well-received series like <em>Daredevil</em> and <em>Jessica Jones</em> for Netflix before Disney+ launched with its Marvel Cinematic Universe shows.</p>
<p>Another listed producer is Ari Arad, who has some background in video game adaptations, including the <em>Borderlands</em> and <em>Uncharted</em> movies, as well as the much-maligned live-action adaptation of <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>.</p>
<p>So yeah, it's a bit of a mixed bag here. No plot details have been released, but it seems likely that the show will tell a new story rather than focus on the saga of Commander Shepherd from the games, since the games were all about the player inhabiting that character with their own choices. That's only a guess, though.</p>
<p>Amazon is currently riding high after the smash success of another video game TV series, <em>Fallout</em>, which impressed both longtime and new fans when it debuted to critical acclaim and record viewing numbers earlier this year.</p>

        <p>But it now has an early access release date.</p>

            <p>
InZoi, the upcoming Sims-like from developer Krafton, is absolutely <em>gorgeous</em> - to the point a lot of life sim fans are very excited indeed. So the good news is it now has a release date; the bad news is it's been delayed into next year to give it a "stronger foundation".
</p>
<p>
InZoi, which promises a "complete community simulation" where "every character [acts] on their free will", was initially announced last year, when it was expected to launch for PC sometime in "Q4" this year. Now, however, Krafton has revised that release, confirming Inzoi will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">launching into Steam early access</a> on 28th March next year.
</p>
<p>
In a message announcing the news, InZoi director Hyungjun "Kjun" Kim explained the decision to delay the game had been made after reviewing feedback and "analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests". He added the revised release will give the studio time to "improve areas that need attention" and "create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation".

<p>
"It is said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings," Kim continued. "The extra love and care that is required to properly nurture a child is how I see our journey with inZoi — a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth. This change in our release date represents our dedication to giving inZoi a stronger foundation, so we can embark on this journey together in the best way possible."
</p><p>
Players did, of course, get a bit of a look at InZoi back in August, when Krafton briefly released its impressively flexible character creator on Steam. During its five days of availability, the demo saw a peak of over 18K players, one of them being Eurogamer's own Jessica Orr, who shared a little of her character creating adventures right here.
</p>
<p>
"Visually, [the demo is] stunning," she <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-old-brands-revitalised-ageing-classics-and-cursed-character-creators">wrote</a>. "It's a little unbelievable how good it looks, actually, even on lower graphical settings. The customisation goes deep too. It's got all the usual bells and whistles, and even a few chimes to boot, as we're treated to entire categories for things like fake nails... Personality customisation doesn't go as deep, from what I can tell in the demo, but it's nice to see inclusive gender and sexuality options there already."
</p>
<p>
InZoi is just one of several Sims-like that have surfaced in recent years. Paradox Interactive's Life by You has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sims-like-rival-life-by-you-has-been-cancelled-after-indefinite-delay">now been cancelled</a>, but that still leaves the highly anticipated Paralives, also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-sims-like-paralives-gets-seven-minute-gameplay-video-hitting-early-access-next-year">scheduled to launch into early access sometime next year</a>, and if you fancy something a little more lo-fi, you can also play the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1651490/Tiny_Life/">adorably retro - but still surprisingly robust - Tiny Life</a> on Steam.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/07/weve-unboxed-a-ps5-pro-and-theres-also-a-cat/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> is here, aiming to usher in a new era of higher resolutions, higher frame rates, and more ray-tracing… but we’ve only taken delivery of our review unit today, so the first step is obviously to do an unboxing.</p>
<p>Also, my cat decided he wanted to be involved for a moment.</p>
<p><iframe title="Our PS5 Pro has been de-boxed" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z4ns9g2d9jY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>First impressions are naturally quite important, and the PS5 Pro is a solid iteration of the PS5’s design. It keeps the same inverted ice cream sandwich look, and which was iterated upon for the PS5 Slim by splitting the cover panels in half. The PS5 Pro now segments those panels even further with some gills, hiding some more air vents for the fan to suck in air from the surroundings.</p>
<p>What’s most impressive, though, is that the PS5 Pro promises a big jump up in graphical performance, but does so while actually being significantly smaller than the original PS5. It’s roughly the same height, but the core of the machine is skinnier (accepting that there’s no disc drive attached by default), and it’s not as deep, either. The original PS5 now feels implausibly big once you pull it out of your gaming set up.</p>

<p>One bizarre design choice is that the PS5 Pro&nbsp;<em>still wobbles!&nbsp;</em>Included in the box are two attachable feet to slot into the gilled section, providing two contact points to anything you set the console on, but there’s only one other contact point on the case. It’s certainly far better than the original PS5’s strange mounting disc, which made moving it for any reason a perilous chore (and also let the console wobble very easily), but you still have a tripod and pushing on a corner will wobble it. I believe this should be improved with the disc drive adding a flattened bulge to the bottom, but it’s no less barmy.</p>
<p>Outside of that, I’ve quickly run through the console’s set up process – using a network data transfer to copy users across, and with plans to swap an NVMe across to shift the bulk of my game data (which was unavailable within the data transfer utility).</p>
<p>Stay tuned for a smorgasbord of comparisons over the coming days, as I plan to look at and compare the various game performance modes across the variety of PlayStation Studios and third party games. We won’t be able to hit all of the 55 launch games, but you can expect several round ups of different categories as I work toward a console review.</p>
<p>I’ll also try and gauge what my cat thinks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-overwatch-2-ranks-how-to-hit-top-500/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Like all other competitive games, Overwatch 2 has a popular ranked mode that gamers can play and climb up the skill ladder. With multiple different ranks to hit, getting to the top is no easy feat. Here is a list of all the Overwatch 2 ranks and how you can hit them.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-overwatch-2-ranks">All Overwatch 2 Ranks</h2>



<p>Below is a list of all the ranks in Overwatch 2:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze </strong>(V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Master</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Grandmaster</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Champion</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Top 500</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The game follows a pretty standard ranking system, featuring five levels in almost all of them, with five being where you start and one being the final level before ranking up. The game uses Matchmaking Rating (MMR), which many other games use too to calculate ranks. </p>



<p>However, the final rank, Top 500, is quite impressive to hit. Not many games have a final rank that specifies what number you are in the world in the game. This gives players a global leaderboard to strive to get their name on, making the game just that much more competitive.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up-in-overwatch-2-guide-to-top-500">How to Rank Up in Overwatch 2 | Guide to Top 500</h2>



<p>To rank up in Overwatch 2 you simply must play ranked matches. As you progress through the game’s ranked system, you will find games tend to get much more difficult, as ranked uses skill-based matchmaking when putting you in matches.</p>



<p>Getting your name on the Top 500 list is not something that can just be done overnight. Many competitive Overwatch players spend countless hours grinding ranked and never even hit the Top 500.</p>



<p>Still, by winning matches, players can move up in the ranks. </p>



<p>When you first start playing ranked mode in Overwatch 2, the game will have you unranked for a series of games before calculating what badge you should receive. </p>



<p>While your first rank will not be Grandmaster or Champion, some players may start at as high as Gold.</p>

<p>Excited for Black Friday this year? Every year, loads of deals are released for both Pokémon cards and Pokémon games. So, what deals do Pokémon fans have to look forward to this year?</p>



<p>Here are the best 2024 Black Friday deals for Pokémon fans.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-pokemon-game-black-friday-deals">Best Pokémon Game Black Friday Deals</h2>



<p>As of now, there have been no revealed Black Friday deals for Pokémon video games. However, games such as Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl, Arceus and others could easily be getting a deal this year.</p>



<h4 id="h-where-to-find-pokemon-game-black-friday-deals"><strong>Where to Find Pokémon Game Black Friday Deals:</strong></h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Walmart</strong></li>



<li><strong>Target</strong></li>



<li><strong>Best Buy</strong></li>



<li><strong>Amazon</strong></li>



<li><strong>Nintendo eShop</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>We will keep you updated as more information is released over the next few weeks.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-pokemon-card-black-friday-deals">Best Pokémon Card Black Friday Deals</h2>



<p>Not worried about the games, but instead want to grab some Pokémon cards on Black Friday? Luckily, we already know of a few special deals for this year’s popular shopping holiday, many of which are available now.</p>



<h4 id="h-all-pokemon-card-black-friday-deals">All Pokémon Card Black Friday Deals:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Stellar Crown Booster Box</strong> ($104.95 at Walmart)</li>



<li><strong>Trick or Trade BOOster Bundle</strong> ($12.97 at Walmart)</li>



<li><strong>Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</strong> ($33.75 at Walmart)</li>



<li><strong>Battle Academy&nbsp;</strong>($10.99 at Miniature Market)</li>
</ul>



<p>While the deals listed above are the only current deals ahead of Black Friday, Pokémon fans should expect more to be announced just ahead of the day. In fact, we will probably see a few deals drop on Black Friday and Black Friday only.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-to-shop-for-pokemon-cards-black-friday">Where to Shop for Pokémon Cards Black Friday?</h2>



<p>Like the Pokémon games, the cards also have a set of stores that players should head to if they want Black Friday deals. Pokémon cards are a hot commodity, though, so expect any deals to go extremely fast.</p>



<h4 id="h-stores-with-black-friday-deals-on-pokemon-cards">Stores with Black Friday Deals on Pokémon Cards:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Target</strong></li>



<li><strong>Walmart</strong></li>



<li><strong>Best Buy</strong></li>



<li><strong>Miniature Market</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>While the stores listed above are massive chains, you might have a local card shop in your area doing deals on Pokémon cards. It is always best to check those out and support local businesses.</p>



<p>Will you be buying anything Pokémon-related this Black Friday?</p>

        <p>The series' first time on Steam</p>

            <p>I first played Taiko no Tatsujin in an arcade (in Japan, because I am very cool), where it's controlled by hitting a recreation of an actual taiko drum. It was fun enough that I wish there was a taiko drum peripheral available for PC now the series is on our platform. 
</p>
<p>Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival is out now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2288630/Taiko_no_Tatsujin_Rhythm_Festival/">via Steam</a>, where it offers over 70 songs to drum through, and a subscription service through which to unlock over 700 more. Maybe I should try to get my Donkey Konga drums working on PC, but I'll probably settle for playing it with a gamepad. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you're unfamiliar, Taiko no Tatsujin games are rhythm games about hitting a drum (on the top or on the side) in time to a beat, as colour-coded notes flow onto the screen from right to left. They're also terrifically bright and silly, your efforts cheered on by a drum mascot called Don Chan. Their songlists skew extremely Japanese, too, featuring a mixture of J-pop, vocaloid music, and anime soundtracks.
</p>
<p>The previous game in the series, Taiko no Tatsujin: The Drum Master, came to PC but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/taiko-no-tatsujin-the-drum-master-is-out-on-pc-with-studio-ghibli-dlc">only via Game Pass and the Windows store for some reason</a>. Rhythm Festival is the first to arrive on Steam.
</p>
<p>It features the usual mixture of modes, practice sessions, online multiplayer, and several difficulty levels. If you're hungry for more than the songs included in the base game, you can expand your selection with the Taiko Music Pass for a monthly fee, or buy tracks via DLC packs. You can get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=UFFa0QoHWvE&amp;ab_channel=Seatbelts-Topic">Tank! from Cowboy Bebop</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2885010/Taiko_no_Tatsujin_Rhythm_Festival__Anime_Pack_Vol_2/">Anime Pack Vol. 2</a>, for example. Everyone listen to Tank! now.
</p>
<p>If you're tempted, it's worth giving <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2288630/Taiko_no_Tatsujin_Rhythm_Festival/">the demo a whirl on Steam</a> first to see whether the difficulty, setlist, and somewhat grindy structure appeal to you.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>MultiVersus is making major changes to how players can unlock fighters in the game. </p>



<p>Developer Player First Games <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-fighter-road" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has announced</a> the new “Fighter Road”. Starting November 12, this is the new way for players to unlock fighters in a more straightforward way than in the past.</p>



<p>“At its core,&nbsp;Fighter Road&nbsp;is a streamlined way to earn characters through an easy-to-follow progression track that players can tackle at their own pace,” the studio said. “This is a great way for&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>&nbsp;players to get their hands on the game’s robust and diverse cast of characters.”</p>



<h6 id="h-related-warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward/">Warner Bros. Games Focusing on Batman, Mortal Kombat, And Hogwarts Legacy Moving Forward</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-how-multiversus-fighter-road-works">How MultiVersus Fighter Road Works</h2>



<p>Fighter road has players earning progress towards unlocking one new fighter at a time. The progress is earned through Fighter Road XP that gets awarded via matches, events, and the battle pass. </p>



<p>Of course, if you don’t want to work to unlock a specific fighter in MultiVersus, you can always just buy them outright with Fighter currency or Gleamium. However, Fighter currency will no longer be available starting with Season 4 on November 12, so what you spend comes from what you’ve earned to that point.</p>



<p>As far as tracking the progress towards fighter unlocks, Player First Games says that characters will be broken down into tiers based on “a number of factors”.</p>



<p>“The first tier, for example, consists of Shaggy, Banana Guard, Wonder Woman, and Batman,” the said. “While characters are unlocked in a specific order in Fighter Road, some tiers allow for players to choose which character they want to work toward unlocking next. </p>



<p>“Characters that are already owned by the player, will be omitted from the Road and, if the player wants to unlock any characters within a tier using their existing character tokens, they can still do so. As players progress on the Fighter Road, their progress will be displayed on a post-match screen that highlights their progress on the reward track.”</p>



<p>Should you complete the Fighter Road and unlock all of the fighters, any additional earned Fighter Road XP will be converted to Battle Pass XP at a 40% rate.</p>



<p>What do you think of the new way to unlock fighters in MultiVersus? Let us know in the comments, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-will-feature-marcus-and-doms-original-voice-actors<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gears of War voice acting veterans John DiMaggio and Carlos Ferro will officially reprise their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago for Gears of War: E-Day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer The Coalition announced the news on Thursday, which also happens to be the 18th anniversary of the launch of the original Gears of War. It’s big news for longtime fans of the series, who will remember that DiMaggio and Ferro played the two leads in the franchise’s first three games. An <a href="https://x.com/GearsofWar/status/1854584608223813638" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>image of the two stars standing together</u></a> was shared to studio’s official X/Twitter account.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We are so back. 🤜🤛 </p><p>On today's 18th anniversary of Gears of War, we're proud to share that John DiMaggio and <a href="https://twitter.com/RealCarlosFerro?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@RealCarlosFerro</a> are reprising their roles as the iconic voices of Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago in Gears of War: E-Day. <a href="https://t.co/x9uaH9R0sR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/x9uaH9R0sR</a></p></div>— Gears of War (@GearsofWar) <a href="https://twitter.com/GearsofWar/status/1854584608223813638?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Gears of War: E-Day is a prequel that takes place awhile before the mainline Gears story got its start. Specifically, it’s set around Emergence Day, which is known as the day the Locust horde made its way to the surface of Sera to launch its attack on humanity. That means that we definitely won’t be seeing protagonists like JD Fenix and Kait Diaz from future Gears games, and more importantly, it means that Marcus and Dom get one more game to see how exactly their bond was strengthened.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not much of a surprise to hear that DiMaggio and Ferro will re-team for E-Day – fans had guessed that the longtime Marcus Fenix voice actor would at least return following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-gears-of-war-game-officially-revealed-at-xbox-showcase-2024"><u>the reveal of an emotional announcement trailer</u></a> earlier this year – but it’s still nice to hear that Dom’s voice will be returning as well. While Marcus lived on to fight in Gears 4 and 5, his partner’s journey ended with a heroic sacrifice in Gears of War 3. Many believe the duo’s relationship and the performances behind them are what helped propel the Gears of War series to success, and now, E-Day is attempting to recapture that gritty, gory magic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Coalition told us earlier this year that Gears of War: E-Day gives the team to return to the series’ roots in more ways than one. One element set to return in the prequel is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-e-day-devs-promise-return-to-horror-from-the-original-games"><u>the horror that the original trilogy is known for</u></a>. Brand Director Nicole Fawcette and Creative Director Matt Searcy spoke to us about their goals in an interview that took place shortly after the game’s reveal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For us, it’s like a what-if story,” Searcy said. “What if the ground opened up and monsters came out?

Based on the livestream event created by Anjali Bhimani, the setting will bring players into a world full of furry friends and adventures. In fact, it is available at no additional cost.</p>

<h2>The Puppy Roll D&amp;D 5e Setting Release</h2>

<p>According to the Hitpoint Press <a href="https://hitpointpress.com/products/the-puppy-roll-pdf">store page</a>, <em>The Puppy Roll</em> setting book brings players into the magical land of Doggo. It is a land full of, you guessed it, doggos. Doggos with dreams. With ambitions. With a drive to live their best lives.</p>

It is based off on the livestream actual play event, also called <em>The Puppy Roll</em>, that Bhimani ran to benefit the non-profit charity organization Petco Love.</p>

<p>Bhimani is a prolific voice actress whose voice credits include <em>Starfield</em>, <em>Overwatch 2</em>, the <em>Ms. Marvel</em> TV series, and the upcoming Blizzard game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/sunderfolk-gm-anjali-bhimani-explains-how-she-voices-multiple-characters" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Sunderfolk</em></a>.</p>

<p>In addition, Bhimani has been active in the actual play community. She DM'd <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/lego-ideas-dungeons-dragons-set-fabricates-fun" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Red Dragon's Tale</em></a> <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> one-shot, has been a player in Dimension 20 <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/matthew-mercer-leads-dimension-20-ravening-war-prequel-to-crown-of-candy" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Ravening War</em></a> and Critical Role's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-announces-horror-series-candela-obscura-first-to-use-illuminated-worlds" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Candela Obscura</em></a>.</p>

<p>As for the content in The Puppy Roll, it is a doggo-themed take on the rules of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.<em> Haste</em> is called <em>Zoomies</em>, <em>Witch Bolt</em> is now <em>Scritch Bolt</em>. Sending Stones are now Sending Bones. The book also contains unique locations and NPCs such as Rosso's Bakery and the The Bark &amp; Bone tavern.</p>

This is bad because without that bone, dogs are vanishing through portals, losing their memory of both who they are and their owners' identities. It is up to the good boys of Doggo to retrieve the golden bone, save the lost puppers, and find the one responsible.</p>

<p><em>The Puppy Roll</em> is available right now on Hitpoint Press for free.</p>

          <p>Sega has put dozens of its Master System, Genesis, Saturn, and other console titles onto modern game stores over the years. But, like that Dreamcast controller stashed in your childhood garage, they're about to disappear—and getting them back will cost you a nostalgia tax.</p>
<p>Those who have purchased any of <a href="https://support.sega.com/hc/en-gb/articles/29776767664145-SEGA-Classics-FAQ#h_01JBWBDWT9PXWHVDPMSZB9EB90">the more than 60 games listed by Sega</a> from Steam, Xbox, Nintendo's Switch store, and the PlayStation store will still have them after 11:59 pm Pacific time on Dec. 26. But after that, for reasons that Sega does not make explicit, they will be "delisted and unavailable." Titles <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sega-genesis-nintendo-switch-online-switch/">specific to the Nintendo Switch Online "Expansion Pack" subscription</a> will remain.</p>
<p>As PC Gamer has suggested, and which makes the most sense, this looks like Sega is getting ready to offer up new "classics" collections on these storefronts. Sega previously rearranged its store shelves to pull Sonic games from online stores and then offer up <em>Sonic Origins. </em>The title&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/06/review-sega-we-need-to-talk-about-how-you-messed-up-sonic-origins/">underwhelmed Ars at the time</a> and managed to pack in some DLC pitches.</p>
<p>Sega already offers a few bundles and collections in Steam, like the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/10143/SEGA_Mega_Drive_and_Genesis_Classics/">Mega Drive and Genesis Classics</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/14082/Dreamcast_Collection/">Dreamcast Collection</a>. As with individual titles, buyers will retain access to them, even after Sega comes back around with new bundles.</p>

<p>So if you've felt like you wanted to reclaim some Sega moments now, piecemeal, while you still can, the Ars writers can suggest a few places to look. These are links to the Steam store, and are mostly Windows-only, though they can often work through Proton on Linux or Steam Deck, and some work with older mac OS versions. Xbox has a smaller list, while PlayStation and Nintendo offer only the Mega Drive Classics at the moment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/kotaku-layoffs-go-media<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>G/O Media, a network that owns websites but also knows nothing about running websites, has made further cuts at the already-beleaguered Kotaku, with a number of writers announcing today that they had been laid off.</p><p>Willa Rowe and Moises Taveras, two writers who only joined the site earlier this year, were abruptly laid off by management this afternoon. Also announcing their departure from Kotaku today, albeit on their own terms, was Senior Editor Alyssa Mercante,<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alyssamerc.bsky.social/post/3laevatgogi2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> who posted</a> that after two years at the site she was moving on.</p><p>The layoffs and the departure of Mercante leave Kotaku with just six full-time staff, including an Editor-in-Chief who only joined a few months ago<a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> after his predecessor resigned in protest over G/O Media's management of the site</a>. They follow several rounds of layoffs to have already taken place in 2024, affecting both editorial staff and writers.</p><p>"G/O Media’s management is once again punishing workers for its own bad decisions", Managing Editor Carolyn Petit<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/carolynmichelle.bsky.social/post/3laexmv7nl62g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> wrote</a> on Bluesky. "Management mandated that some writers stick to ‘service’ posts, and now that the numbers aren’t panning out (surprise, surprise!), two of those writers have been laid off. Cruel and misguided."</p><p>Kotaku is one of the last remaining websites in G/O Media's portfolio, following the recent sale of everything from <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/the-onion-sold-global-tetrahedron-1235982383/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Onion</a> to <a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/media-deals/2024/10/21/jalopnik-cars-acquisition-static" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jalopnik</a> to<a href="https://deadspin.com/the-adults-in-the-room-1837487584/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> whatever was left of Deadspin</a>. Its masthead is now down to just a handful of writers and editors, with much of the site's service work now being handed off to freelancers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
