            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-its-employees-back-into-the-office-remote-hiring-to-be-sunset/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA is pushing its developers back into the office and phasing out its remote work policies, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring">IGN</a> reports.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts chief executive officer Andrew Wilson told employees in an email that hybrid work will now mean at least three days in the office, and that the company would not be hiring for any more locally remote roles.</p>
<p>In a separate email, EA Entertainment president Laura Miele clarified that these changes will not take effect immediately and that employees currently working remotely who are being asked back into the office will have a minimum of 12 weeks' notice to make the transition.</p>
<p>EA is also introducing a new 30-mile/48km radius around its offices, which will set the ground rules for what work model employees will fall under. If you live within that radius and currently work remotely, you'll transition to the newly defined hybrid model of three days a week in the office.</p>
<p>If you live outside of that radius, you'll continue to work as you are until EA designates that you have to transition either to a hybrid or an on-site model, the latter meaning you'd have to be in the office five days a week.</p>
<p>A final key change with this push back to in office work is that all future remote work hires and any exemptions to the hybrid or on-site models as they are now defined will have to go through the approval of EA's top executives, which means it'll be up to EA Entertainment president Laura Miele or Andrew Wilson to approve an employee's remote work request.</p>
<p>In Wilson's email, IGN reports he said that working in an office allows for "<em>a kinetic energy that fuels creativity, innovation, and connection, often resulting in unexpected breakthroughs that lead to incredible experiences for our players</em>."</p>
<p>That all sounds wonderful, but game studios proved, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, that remote work models can be successful for teams. The pandemic proved even further that the video game industry's biggest studios could be successful with remote work models. It's not like anything Wilson describes is exclusive to working in an office.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, EA employees are not all too happy with the push, and some who anonymously spoke to IGN expressed concerns around whether they'd be able to move closer to the office in the transition period, and how needing to return to the office, even just three days a week, means a complete uprooting of their lives.</p>
<p>These new changes will undoubtedly cause talented developers who, for their own valid reasons, can't make it into an EA office three times a week to leave the company. It's a way of making cuts that doesn't have to involve EA saying they are laying people off, and without having to pay severance to those who are forced to leave due to these changes. EA's balance sheet might be better off in the eyes of Wilson and the company's bean counters, but that gain does not offset the loss of key talent.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">EA laid off 300-400 developers,</a> 100 of them from Respawn, and canceled another project it was incubating, which was reportedly an extraction shooter set in the world of Titanfall.</p>

Many are the minigames that threaten to be more entertaining than the games that host them, stealing the player’s attention away like those flatworms that absorb snails from the inside. Tetra Master. Gwent. Fishing in any number of RPGs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSSGZ9O8RX4">The flushable sinks in Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a>. Or how about Space Harrier, which has only ever existed as an arcade cabinet offering inside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-0">Yakuza 0</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, these minigames escape the host's body and become a standalone release. It’s not <em>entirely</em> true to say this of Dicealot, which is based on Farkle, a dice game you<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-how-to-play-dice"> may have played</a> inside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>.</p> <!--more-->
<p>For Farkle is actually a real medieval dice game that dates back to the 12th century, in which you roll six dice and score by achieving certain combinations. Dicealot takes a few liberties with the premise: it introduces a frame narrative in which Queen Gwynevere is trying to save a bewitched <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-arthur">King Arthur</a>, together with additional power and quest dice, acquired from mission to mission, that modify the basic rules. It’s a roguelite, in other words. I know, we haven’t played a lot of those lately. Here’s a trailer.

<p>
There’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035330/Dicealot/">a demo on Steam</a> if you’d like to give it a whirl. I am keen on the presentation: it’s like an illuminated parchment and a cathode-ray TV had a baby, and the baby grew up and dabbled in art deco. 
</p>
<p>
The developers are two-person outfit Goodviewgames, who are based in based in Leeds and Bordeaux. I was born in Leeds and still have family in Yorkshire. I assure you that I discovered this after viewing and enjoying the trailer. Let it be known, developers and publishers, that you will not automatically earn my interest if you happen to be based in Leeds. Though if you do want to relocate there and host some studio visits, it’d mean I could see my dad more often. Ball's in your court.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hunger-is-a-multiplayer-first-person-rpg-that-uses-an-extraction-loop-but-isnt-defined-by-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Extraction shooters are, at this point, a dime a dozen. And for my money, you’ve got to really do something different to stand out in that increasingly crowded genre. That’s why I was eager to meet up with a couple of developers from the team at Good Fun Corporation so they could show me Hunger, their upcoming zombie-tastic Unreal Engine 5-powered first-person action-RPG that utilizes an extraction loop. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, the developers specifically phrased it that way, as they seemingly aren’t looking to be thought of as just another extraction shooter. And in fairness to them, based on what I saw of an impressive early build (the team’s Early Access launch is still far enough away that they weren’t comfortable giving me an on-the-record release window quite yet), Hunger is going to be anything but another generic extraction shooter in the Steam pile.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hunger - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Two things about Hunger piqued my interest immediately: its visual aesthetic and its actual visuals. Starting with the former, game director Maximilian Rea described Hunger’s look as “Renaissance gothic,” which seems like a fair way to sum it up. As you can see in the videos and screenshots in this article, Hunger mixes first-gen firearms with brutal melee weapons inside of filthy lived-in towns and glorious castles. And then, in terms of raw graphics, the foliage, lighting, and texture detail are all absolutely stunning. This is easily one of the best uses of Unreal Engine 5 I’ve seen so far.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is easily one of the best uses of Unreal Engine 5 I’ve seen so far.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But, you might ask, how does it actually <em>play</em>? Sadly I can’t answer that quite yet, as my demo was just a hands-off first look, but it does seem built to last. In short, the team tells me, they’re aiming for the simplicity of ARC Raiders with the complexity of Escape From Tarkov. You begin in the Outer Ramparts, a social, violence-free hub within the Chateau where other players and NPCs alike roam. Like Destiny, you can switch to third-person perspective here if you like (though in proper combat, you’ll always be in first-person). Here you can shop with Piro, a quirky shopkeeper who wears a weird metal mask and offers items up for sale on a tray that’s worn around his neck as if he’s some cigarette girl from the 1920’s. Or you can add or remove items from your stash by checking in with Louis, the Stashmaster who also doles out the occasional quest. Reynauld, meanwhile, is the Expedition Master. He's missing parts of a couple fingers, indicating that he’s tussled with the zombies at least once, and talking to him queues you into an expedition (i.e. a raid).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The initial Early Access release will have three maps: Jacques Bridge, Sombre Forest, and Sarlat Farm. Each is one square kilometer, and each one has a big dungeon beneath it as well. Expect six weather varieties per map, including noon (clear), noon (fog), sunset, and sunrise. More dynamic stuff will be added post-release. Rea explained that they’re aiming for 50-60 hours of content here, and then you unlock the Cauldron, a new area of the Chateau. You will learn your profession there. There are six professions: three gathering (like Scavenging, which means you’re a purveyor of metals and materials; a Conservator who finds mechanisms and trinkets to make tools or guns; and the Naturalist, who gathers herbs and spices to make food, drinks, and medicine) and three crafting (examples here include Metallurgy, Gunsmithing, and Cooking). You can have two professions at a time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story of this map is that there was civil conflict when The End  – the bacteria that led to the Hunger – began. As you play, there's lore to find and extract with. Missives and Maps, as examples of this, are Common, Rare, or Legendary. And if you extract with a Missive you can read it back in the Chateau and get a quest's worth of XP, and once you’ve found everything you can read the whole story of the game. The developers also plan to tell the story through NPC dialogue. "We try to infuse every aspect of the game with story," Rea told me.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Hunger all have different qualities and aspects, which means that going melee-only has the advantage of letting you be silent. Shooting, on the other hand, makes noise and invites more Hunger. The Bloater, as an example of one such Hunger, is a blob-like thing that explodes into a cloud of poisonous gas. Shambler hits, meanwhile, cause bleed damage.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Going melee-only has the advantage of letting you be silent. Shooting, on the other hand, makes noise and invites more Hunger.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a whopping 33 weapons between melee and ranged, from daggers, pistols, and rifles to maces and primitive machine guns. You can find exotic ammo for the guns that add additional damage effects to the bullets. And yes, there will be dedicated PvP experiences if you need to scratch that itch. Furthermore, there's a Mastery Tree, and as you level up from 10-100 you get a mastery point. This includes four trees: Physiology, Survival, Martial, and Cunning, and the developers hope this ensures there are multiple ways to progress through the game besides PvP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, you can play solo or in duos if you want as well. "Being a solo or duo player isn't a death sentence,” Rea said. “In fact it's one of the quickest ways to progress in the game." You'll also unlock progression cosmetics as well when you level up, kill bosses, etc. And yes, there are cosmetics for every weapon and bag.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hunger won’t be free-to-play, which hopefully helps ensure its design principles won’t be compromised by pay-to-win nonsense, and there definitely won’t be any battle passes. They did mention a “Support the Developers” edition that would include extra cosmetics for whatever it ends up priced at above the $30 the team is aiming for on the standard edition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As to how long a session might last, Rea suggested that the low end of an expedition might be 30-35 minutes, hopefully ensuring that Hunger is an easy game to jump in for a little while with at night with friends, and then go to bed feeling accomplished and not feeling guilty for having hopped off of some live-service hamster wheel. If and when you die, everything you do contributes to XP gains, so the goal is for you to never have a pointless session. "If they've played for an hour, we want them to feel like they've meaningfully moved the ball forward for their character," Rea said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hunger might still be a ways away, but from what I’ve already seen, it looks like the team – who also made Hell Let Loose – is cooking up something unique and worth keeping an eye on. We’ll have more on Hunger on IGN as development progresses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

Journey on an emotional rollercoaster that pulls at the heartstrings and reminds you how it feels to be left behind.</p><p>We follow the tale of Dawn, a skeptical shelter cat who would much rather be in the wild than be readopted again. Dawn actually believes she is a wild cat. And plans on escaping as soon as she gets the chance.</p><p>Dawn has second thoughts when she meets new owner Olive, a lonely older Aussie mourning the disappearance of her beloved furry companion. Together Dawn and Olive develop an intimate friendship, as two broken hearts mend one another and learn to beat as one.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Everything changes when Olive falls ill, and a stray copycat steals Dawn’s place in the home—forcing Dawn onto the streets.</p><p>Wander alleyways, fences and rooftops as you learn about the true meaning of home. The reflective pacing of the game allows you the opportunity to indulge in the emotions of love, loneliness and letting go as you progress throughout the story.</p><p><em>Copycat</em> is fully voice acted, featuring hours of dialogue and a talented voice cast.

                <p dir="ltr">Publisher Playsaurus has announced that Cookie Clicker will release on consoles May 22--exactly a week from today. One of the first major idle games, Cookie Clicker originally released on the web in 2013 before hitting Steam in 2021. The title, developed by DashNet, is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a> (though of course at a later date).</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/cookie-clicker-switch/">Nintendo's listing</a> for Cookie Clicker notes that the game will cost $5. This is in line with the Steam edition of the idle game. Playsaurus is promising more than 600 upgrades in Cookie Clicker, as well as the ability to "pet your dragon."

The game sees a feline pawing a taskbar as a player clicks their mouse or types, and then you can earn hats for your digital kitty.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, last year saw <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-420000-people-were-clicking-a-banana-today/1100-6524275/">everyone clicking a Banana</a>. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-massive-and-inexplicably-popular-banana-game-adds-new-skins/1100-6524446/">super popular game even got new skins</a> and saw almost 1 million concurrent players on Steam at one point, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2923300/charts/#max" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Keep in mind that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Switch 2 launches on June 5</a>, so it's not quite known whether Cookie Clicker will arrive on that date for the upcoming system or later on.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-the-phantom-x">Persona 5: The Phantom X</a>, the spin-off mobile and PC game, now has a global release date.</p>

<p>Persona 5: The Phantom X is the next game in the Persona series, which has now collectively sold 22m copies. It's been co-developed by Chinese studio Perfect World, Atlus and Sega.</p>
<p>The spin-off was first revealed back in 2023 and has already had an open beta in China. It was unclear, until this week, whether a global release was on the cards. It's now received various improvements "to meet the needs of RPG fans in Japan, turning it into a game with a lot of polish to it", as stated during the livestream.</p>
<p>The team also wanted to ensure it met western standards before announcing a release. As it was first developed in Chinese, it needed to be localised into Japanese before moving to the English language version. And as the game is a live-service, it will require simultaneous updates across the globe.</p>
<p>Indeed, the livestream began with a typically stylish anime sequence, as has become standard for the series.</p>
<p>The release date was then revealed in a new trailer, combining cinematics with gameplay. You can expect the usual mix of social interactions, city and dungeon exploration, and turn-based combat, to give an authentic Persona experience.</p>
<p>Typically Persona games take place over a school year, but with this live-service version players will experience the world in real time. It features a new protagonist (codenamed Wonder) and his owl companion who becomes a Phantom Thief by night as he's plagued by mysterious visions from the Metaverse and must restore the stolen desires of the population.</p>
<p>The livestream also introduced other characters: popular fellow student Motoha Arai, awkward student Shun Kano, and the intellectual student Riko Tanemura.</p>
<p>The game will include Phantom Idols who act like Confidants alongside the protagonist in the Metaverse and are created in the Velvet Room. The stream showed a handful of these Idols, who were all new characters from P5X and each have their own backstory.</p>
<p>It follows two previous spin-off games from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a>: hack and slash sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-strikers">Persona 5 Strikers</a> and strategy game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-tactica">Persona 5 Tactica</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tribe-nine-shutdown</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/free-to-play-action-rpg-tribe-nine-announces-shutdown-three-months-after-launch.1190175/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tribe-nine-shutdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Akatsuki Games has announced that its free-to-play "brutal action RPG"&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>will be ending service, and the announcement comes just a few months after the game's initial release.</p>

<p>Following in the footsteps of other Japanese mobile-focused games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy Brave Exvius</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-reincarnation-shutting-down" rel="nofollow"><em>Nier Reincarnation</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>will be shutting down in November, according to a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2376580/view/500572747038983820" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official Steam page.</p>

<p>In the post, Akatsuki Games says that the decision to shut down&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>was taken after "careful consideration". The studio doesn't provide any more specific reason for the game's closure, but it does say that its development team worked hard to "provide excellent service and improve player experience".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tribe-nine-shutdown-announcement-combat.jpg?itok=bXDb1nxp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tribe-nine-shutdown-announcement-combat.jpg?itok=pCndJ3lj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>is shutting down less than a year after its launch.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't a gentle closure, either; in addition to the game's shutdown, Akatsuki says it won't be updating&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>with its planned fourth chapter, apologizing for the "sudden nature" of the announcement.</p>

<p>Not only that, but all "new features, adjustments, and known-issue fixes previously announced" won't be implemented, so&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>will remain in its current state until November.</p>

<p>Additionally, new characters Ichinosuke Akiba and Saizo Akiba, who were both due to debut as part of&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine</em>'s roadmap, will be canned, and any Paid Enigma Entities you've used in the game will be fully refunded. Naturally, in-game shop items won't be available to buy for real money either.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>is, it's the flagship video game of an intended multimedia franchise masterminded by Akatsuki Games and Kazutaka Kodaka's Too Kyo Games, which is also responsible for&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tribe-nine-shutdown-announcement-warning.jpg?itok=-g4cl_Fm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tribe-nine-shutdown-announcement-warning.jpg?itok=hwcJmLqa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>will remain in its current state until shutdown in November.</figcaption></figure><p>Too Kyo Games is currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-ps5-xbox-unlikely" rel="nofollow">struggling with its financial situation</a> following the release of&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line</em>, and while that's not given as a reason for&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine</em>'s shutdown, it probably won't help matters either.</p>

<p>In any case, you can still play&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2376580/TRIBE_NINE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and mobile devices for the time being. The game will shut down on November 27th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/analyst-estimates-grand-theft-auto-vi-being-delayed-means-playstation-and-xbox-will-sell-700000-less-consoles-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We know that <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-skipping-pc-lose-40-sales/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> will have a massive impact on the video game industry when it launches, so it's no surprise that its delay into next year is also having a huge impact on the industry in 2025.</p>
<p>Analytics firm Ampere Analysis has lowered its revenue and sales forecast for the video game console market, specifically for PlayStation and Xbox, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/i/163618942/gta-delay-could-mean-fewer-xbox-and-playstation-console-sales-this-year-ampere-analysis">The Game Business</a> reports. Ampere's Piers Harding-Rolls expects PlayStation and Xbox to sell <strong>700,000</strong> fewer consoles than they would have if GTA VI were still being released this year.</p>
<p>Harding-Rolls and Ampere also estimate that 21 million fewer game sales will be made, and that between hardware and software revenue, the console market is missing out on approximately <strong>$2.7 billion&nbsp;</strong>in revenue.</p>
<p>Of course, the knock-on effect of all this is that expectations for 2026 are that much higher, but we're not yet halfway through 2025, and the year already looks drastically different from the one the video game industry thought it would have in January 2025.</p>
<p>Without GTA VI in the holiday lineup, the one platform that will benefit, Harding-Rolls suggests, will be Nintendo. Harding-Rolls and Ampere Analysis also aren't alone in this suggestion, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/">DFC Intelligence reports</a> that in its estimates, it sees Nintendo benefiting from Grand Theft Auto VI's delay, while PlayStation and Xbox have a much more muted year.</p>
<p>Overall, Ampere now estimates that the industry will only grow by 0.9%, with a bigger 2.2% jump coming in 2026.</p>
<p>Shortly after the news of Grand Theft Auto VI being delayed was announced, it was reported that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-reportedly-had-no-chance-of-releasing-in-2025-for-months-due-in-part-to-a-real-desire-to-avoid-crunch/">game had no chance of actually releasing in 2025</a>. Unfortunate as that might be for fans hoping to play it this year, the delay doesn't seem to have really <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/">impacted excitement</a>, as eager fans continue to <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-early-comparison-massive-jump/">salivate</a> over the small bits of the game we have seen.</p>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s not the next mainline entry in the series, but Atlus did announced a new <em>Persona</em> game today. It’s called <em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>, and it’s a spinoff that’s launching on both mobile and PC on June 26th.</p><p>As the name implies, <em>The Phantom X</em> is set in the same universe as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15098458/persona-5-review-ps4-ps3">2017’s <em>Persona 5</em></a>, and will feature a new main character leading a new band of Phantom Thieves. This story takes place in “a mysterious Tokyo where desires have been lost.” The structure of <em>The Phantom X</em> sounds a lot like traditional <em>Persona</em>, as players will experience normal high school life during the day, before heading off to explore dungeons at night. There’s also turn-based combat and a “synergy system” where players can form close ties with NPCs in the game.</p><p>There are also multiplayer elements, including guilds which allow “players to interact with one another in-game.” From the sounds of it, <em>The Phantom X</em> is an attempt to blend the single-player RPGs the franchise is known for with live-service mobile games designed to keep players coming back. It’s hard to say right now how well those two sides will gel together; it’s also not clear at the moment if the game will be free-to-play. Hopefully it still has curry.</p><p>Given it’s been nearly a decade since <em>Persona 5</em> launched, Atlus releasing another spinoff will likely be a disappointment to some fans expecting any sign of life from <em>Persona 6</em> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona">at least <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> turned out well</a>). Then again, <em>The Phantom X</em> at least looks the part, and might be a good way to fill in the time before the next major release.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Joining the word 'bum' in my demo preview was some thoughts on how the concept initially reminded me of the first iteration of tabletop dungeon crawler Warhammer Quest, which used a randomised tile deck to keep you guessing about the layout of your subterranean environs. Things work a little differently here: you'll be trying to reach a goal by constructing your dungeon from a deck you can add more cards to after each run. The runs involve autobattling, although you can finesse it somewhat with positioning.</p>
<p>I actually think the automatic combat is the sensible choice here, though, because you haven't got a map, and it keeps your brainspace free for navigation. As your layout gets more complex, you end up memorising routes and building in such a way as to allow you to scoop up more rewards. Maybe create a little enclave of healing rooms so you can batter enemies for longer? Maybe something more devious. Don't tell me. That'll ruin your chittering schemes, ratman. I wasn't actually sure if I'd missed the map, initially, so I mentioned it the article, and designer Tony Gowland replied. Who's quoting who now, Ant Workshop!</p>
<p>"There’s no map while you’re adventuring," wrote Tony. "This was deliberate so that keeping your dungeon memorable as you build it is another thing players have to factor in. It’s by far the most controversial design element and we’re really happy it landed for you".</p>
<p>It most definitely did. Into the Restless Ruins is currently £12/€13/$13 on Steam. Bum bum, bum bum. Bum, bum. Bum.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead, it follows a different group of Phantom Thieves led by a high school student code-named Wonder. The team attends a different high school and is accompanied by a different mascot character, the tonfa-wielding owl named Lufel. The other major difference between <em>The Phantom X </em>and most <em>Persona </em>games is that it has microtransactions and gacha mechanics. Yes, to take part in the game’s social sim and dungeon crawling, you’ll have to either wait for a set amount of time to pass or use currency to replenish your energy. Otherwise, the game is free-to-play. Check out the announcement trailer below:</p><p><em>Persona 5: The Phantom X </em>will launch on PC and mobile devices on June 26. When Atlus first teased the announcement, some people thought it was referencing <em>Persona 6</em>. However, the RPGs typically shed their previous color scheme and aesthetics with each mainline entry, so most fans knew the black-and-red graphic indicated that whatever this game was, it was still part of the <em>Persona 5 </em>subseries. This, coupled with the owl emoji used on the social posts, clearly hinted at a <em>Phantom X</em> announcement, but the game<em> </em>has been sequestered in China for so long that some fans aren’t even aware of it. <em>The Phantom X </em>was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-5-new-announced-phantom-of-night-p5-p5x-mobile-1850235928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-new-announced-phantom-of-night-p5-p5x-mobile-1850235928">originally announced in 2023</a></span> and has been in an open beta phase in the territory since last year.</p><p>With <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-6-logo-green-leak-midori-atlus-sega-1851499836&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-6-logo-green-leak-midori-atlus-sega-1851499836"><em>Persona 6 </em>rumors floating around</a></span>, it’s entirely possible that <em>The Phantom X </em>could be the final game in the <em>Persona 5 </em>subseries.

It’s a highly unusual headscratcher that has some third-party publishers flummoxed. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,195410,196143" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“The games press will not be receiving Nintendo Switch 2 consoles until just before it comes out,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-media-outlets-will-not-have&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-media-outlets-will-not-have" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes <em> The Game Business</em>’ Chris Dring</a></span> (it’s a great newsletter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamebusiness.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you should subscribe to</a></span>). He reports that some in the media won’t get their review units until launch day on June 5, with Nintendo blaming the delay on the need for a major day-one patch. The Switch 2 launches right before Summer Game Fest, a busy period for big game announcements and new trailers that could delay in-depth coverage of the new console even further. </p><p>It’s a major departure from how Nintendo handled the rollout of the original Switch back in 2017, when the company was still licking its wounds from the disastrous Wii U console generation. With the long-awaited <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-zelda-botw-anniversary-1851767489&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-zelda-botw-anniversary-1851767489">being available at launch</a></span>, the <em>Mario </em>maker made sure outlets had access to the Switch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-the-kotaku-review-1792776350&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-the-kotaku-review-1792776350">more than a week in advance</a></span> in order to both test the new hardware and complete the sprawling open-world RPG. </p><p>Delaying hands-on access to the Switch 2 until the same time as the general public suggests the hardware is either coming in hot—a possibility bolstered by the apparent urgency of a day-one software patch—or Nintendo simply doesn’t care about building pre-release hype with early Switch 2 reviews and all of the hands-on videos and social media buzz that flows from them. </p><p>The console is already expected to sell over 15 million units in its first year, with shortages seemingly likely at launch and into the summer. Everyone knows what the Switch can do, and for the most part the Switch 2 is just a bigger, better version of that existing product. Most fans have probably already made up their minds one way or the other. </p><p>Delaying Switch 2 reviews seems of a piece with Nintendo’s evolving direct-to-consumer approach, beginning years ago with Nintendo Directs and culminating recently in a dedicated standalone news app for the new hardware. Though it also seems of a piece with a lot of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-botw-switch-2-price-dlc-expansion-pass-cyberpunk-1851775786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-botw-switch-2-price-dlc-expansion-pass-cyberpunk-1851775786">ambient weirdness around the release of the Switch 2</a></span> that’s detracted from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-previews-mouse-mario-kart-1851774555&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-previews-mouse-mario-kart-1851774555">otherwise positive assessments</a></span> of the hardware at preview events. </p><p>But that doesn’t mean the review delays are good for everyone else. Insight into any major shortcomings or bugs that need to be ironed out ahead of launch could be the difference between someone paying hundreds of dollars over the $450 price tag to a scalper on eBay, or just waiting until more inventory is available closer to the 2025 holiday season. </p><p>One PR rep at a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-upgrade-pack-hogwarts-legacy-civ-7-1851780505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-upgrade-pack-hogwarts-legacy-civ-7-1851780505">third-party developer with a launch game</a></span> for the Switch 2 told <em>The Game Business </em>that the “lack of independent critical validation” now makes them wonder if they should have waited to release their game until a few weeks after the dust had settled around the new hardware. We’ll know how it all shakes out in just a few weeks when Nintendo’s next console generation kicks off in June. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>After launching in South Korea, China, and Taiwan back in April 2024, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/persona-5-the-phantom-x/" data-ref-id="5000-584986">Persona 5: The Phantom X</a> finally has a worldwide release date. The Persona 5 spin-off hits PC and mobile devices on June 26, 2025, and brings with it even more of the series' stylish turn-based combat and an entirely new cast of Phantom Thieves.</p><p>Developed as a collaboration between Atlus' P-Studio and Chinese developer Black Wing Games, Persona 5: The Phantom X is a mobile-focused title that sends players back to the world of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/persona-5/" data-ref-id="5000-115534">Persona 5</a>, albeit as a new character and under slightly different circumstances. In it, players control Wonder, a second-year high school student at Kokatsu Academy whose worldview is shifted upon meeting a mysterious owl-like creature named Lufel. After some good old-fashioned exposition, the duo eventually set off on quest to recruit a new cast of Phantom Thieves, their ultimate goal being to restore the concept of desire back to humanity and put a stop to the mysterious force hellbent on taking it away.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5btk2fzbRjQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5btk2fzbRjQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>What ensues is a continuously-expanding, live-service adventure filled with much of the same turn-based combat, social simulation, and time management elements found in mainline Persona titles. Players will get the chance to explore new dungeons and areas of Mementos, take on part-time jobs and join after-school clubs, strengthen their Personas, raise Wonder's social stats, and form relationships all while experiencing an original story. Players can also expect fan-favorite Persona characters--like Joker, Ann, Ryuji, and the rest of the original Phantom Thieves--to make appearances in the game via special contracts. Lastly, the Phantom X also introduces new elements to the series, including the PvE-focused Velvet Trials, mini-games, and the ability to create and join Guilds.</p><p>Since its release in select regions last year, the title has earned a lot of praise for its story and new cast of characters, with players stating that both are shockingly on par with those found in the Persona 5. This could certainly have something to do with Persona veterans--like series producer Kazuhisa Wada, composer Ryota Kozuka, and artist Shigenori Soejima--being involved in the game's development.</p><p>However, it's important to note that the upcoming title has gacha elements, similar to games like Genshin Impact or Wuthering Waves. Though you don't <em>have </em>to spend money in order to play through The Phantom X, players are often encouraged to, which can definitely be a barrier when it comes to fully enjoying the game.</p><p>Persona 5: The Phantom X will launch on mobile and PC worldwide on June 26. For a closer look at the upcoming title, we've included screenshots and a few pieces of the game's key art below.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494724-gallery6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494725-about_img3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494726-%EA%B3%B5%EB%9E%B5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494727-persona-5-the-phantom-x-screenshot-type4-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494728-about_img2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494729-gallery1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494730-gallery2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494731-gallery3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494732-gallery4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494733-gallery5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4494724,1300-4494725,1300-4494726,1300-4494727,1300-4494728,1300-4494729,1300-4494730,1300-4494731,1300-4494732,1300-4494733" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494724-gallery6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494725-about_img3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494726-%EA%B3%B5%EB%9E%B5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494727-persona-5-the-phantom-x-screenshot-type4-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494728-about_img2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494729-gallery1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494730-gallery2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494731-gallery3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494732-gallery4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494733-gallery5.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494724-gallery6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494725-about_img3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494726-%EA%B3%B5%EB%9E%B5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494727-persona-5-the-phantom-x-screenshot-type4-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494728-about_img2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494729-gallery1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494730-gallery2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494731-gallery3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494732-gallery4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494733-gallery5.jpg"></figure>

The journey began six days ago, in Boston, and is currently in Augusta, Maine, venturing toward Stephen King country on what appears to be a collective desire to reach Canada. Directions are chosen by votes that take place every few seconds—whichever available direction receives the majority of the votes, that’s the way the Street View moves, made all the more adorable by the inclusion of a steering wheel at the bottom of the screen.</p><p>Since I’ve been watching/voting for a couple of hours (since my chum Paul tipped me off to the game—thanks Paul!), a whopping five miles of progress has been made. This is partly because the entire endeavor is inherently slow, but also because of awful people (tee hee) who keep voting to take completely pointless detours. Should enough malevolent people (snicker) vote to take a right down some dirt track that loops back onto the main road, that’s what’ll happen, to the dismay of all the sensible people in the site’s chat.</p><figure id="" data-id="880cca8e56a1f3943bbf1ed003a72238" data-recommend-id="image://880cca8e56a1f3943bbf1ed003a72238" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Google Street View image of a car driving through Augusta, Maine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Google Street View image of a car driving through Augusta, Maine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Neal Agarwal / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="880cca8e56a1f3943bbf1ed003a72238" data-recommend-id="image://880cca8e56a1f3943bbf1ed003a72238" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Google Street View image of a car driving through Augusta, Maine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The chat is a more recent addition, and according to leading expert Paul, it’s made the whole thing a lot less soothing. It has, however, allowed for those who maliciously choose silly directions (giggle) to see the enraged reactions of the folk actually trying to get somewhere. Of course, given that it’s made up of contributions from 1,100 strangers via Discord, be warned there’s also a lot of garbage in there. (It is apparently <em>hilarious</em> to respond “gay” when anyone encourages voters to pick “straight” on.)</p><p>Consensus appears to be a desire to reach Canada, with the more confident denizens of the chat window already debating whether to head to Montreal specifically. By my estimation that dream is weeks away, if not longer given how many nefarious types seem to vote for loop-de-loop routes (guffaw). Much better to just focus on Bangor for now. Oh, and if you can rally enough people, you can vote to change the radio station, the “DJ” of which I’m pretty sure has been voiced by creator Neal Agarwal himself. Or you can even vote to honk the horn (something that won favor when the Street View had the car in the wrong lane of traffic, with cars coming straight toward us).</p><figure id="" data-id="6f3e5f261d015dcdaa335c9cc22fc021" data-recommend-id="image://6f3e5f261d015dcdaa335c9cc22fc021" data-format="jpg" data-width="1520" data-height="855" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Google Street View image of a car driving toward a spooky house in Augusta, Maine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Google Street View image of a car driving toward a spooky house in Augusta, Maine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Neal Agarwal / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6f3e5f261d015dcdaa335c9cc22fc021" data-recommend-id="image://6f3e5f261d015dcdaa335c9cc22fc021" data-format="jpg" data-width="1520" data-height="855" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Google Street View image of a car driving toward a spooky house in Augusta, Maine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Agarwal has an extraordinary gift for data manipulation.

                <p>Back in September, Ubisoft announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">its commitment to fixing the gameplay issues</a> that plagued <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review-missing-the-mark/1900-6418273/" data-ref-id="1900-6418273">Star Wars Outlaws</a> since its launch. Today, the game's second DLC story, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-big-star-wars-outlaws-surprise-has-been-spoiled-by-a-leak/1100-6530948/" data-ref-id="1100-6530948">A Pirates Fortune</a>, is launching alongside a new Star Wars Outlaws patch that's adding a few more improvements.</p><p>Ubisoft shared the details about the new patch <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/6xjEjWMQplZquUcRmLrKco/swo-patch-update-16" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Star Wars Outlaws' official site</a>. Some of the most notable changes involve Kay's newfound ability to smoothly switch from her blaster to two-handed weapons. Kay has also gained the ability to free-fire while riding her speeder. New space contracts have also been added for all players that feature multiple challenge types for additional rewards.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Urp3XfddqZs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Urp3XfddqZs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Some of the latest changes are essentially cleaning up problems, like audio lines playing out of order or certain props disappearing or floating in the air during cutscenes. A handful of other fixes were introduced to keep players from being unable to complete intel quests and to prevent Kay from getting trapped in a room on Toshara while respawning.</p><p>Today's patch also features new cosmetic items based on the Star Wars: Skeleton Crew TV series, including an outfit for Nix. Those items are available to all players and can be found on the Trailblazer in Kay's delivery crate.</p><p>The full patch notes are below.

Fans have fallen in love with Esquie, one of your companions in the game, and a lovable oaf. Soon, you might be able to bring Esquie into your home as Sandfall has revealed it is looking into creating official plushies of the character, as first reported by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/05/expedition-33-dev-to-turn-the-games-best-character-into-a-plushie"><em>Push Square</em></a>.</p><p>News of a potential Esquie plushie comes at the end of a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1922603248415908078">post on X</a> by the team warning fans that Esquie plushies do not currently exist and anyone advertising them is likely using AI to create mockups. The team urges fans not to purchase any kind of Expedition 33 plush from these sellers as “they could be scams” while waiting for something official.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWUO8e_jtiY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWUO8e_jtiY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“We’ve noticed a number of suspicious websites popping up, claiming to sell Esquie plushies. This makes us whooo,” the post on X reads. “To be clear: any third-party websites selling Esquie plushies are NOT officially licensed. Many of them are using AI-generated artwork to advertise, and we strongly recommend against purchasing from these sources. They could be scams.”</p><p>The post then reveals some “wheee to balance out the whooo.”</p><p>“We are looking into making official Esquie plushies and want to bring them to you as soon as we can. In the meantime, please be patient—and don’t get scammed!”</p><p>While waiting for an official Esquie plush, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33/melancholy-rpg-eminence"><em>Game Informer’s</em> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a>, and then check out our feature on <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/14/if-you-liked-clair-obscur-expedition-33-play-these-games-next">other games to play if you liked Expedition 33</a>.
