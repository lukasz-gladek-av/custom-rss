		<p>Amazon have announced that Season 2 of Fallout will drop an episode a week, rather than all at once, which is how Season One arrived. The second season, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/20/fallout-season-2-confirmed-sony-paramount/">which was commissioned just a week after the first </a>had aired, finds Lucy (Ella Purnell), Ghoul (Walton Goggins), and Maximus (Aaron Moten) as they travel to New Vegas in an attempt to catch up with Lucy’s father, Hank (Kyle MacLachlan).</p>
<p>Moisés Arias returns as Lucy’s brother Norm and it will be interesting to see where his story goes, as at the end of Season 1, he discovered the real purpose of the Vaults.&nbsp; Barb, the Ghouls wife from his previous life, will also join the cast, and most excitingly, according to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32158505/?ref_=tt_eps_nx">IMDB, Dogmeat</a> will be in the show.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout – Season Two Teaser Trailer | Prime Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7TsP09cZA7o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer reveals that fan favourite Mr. House will join the show, played by Justin Theroux, and he has a connection to Ghoul, or more specifically, Cooper Howard, the pre-war era actor who eventually became Ghoul. There is also a tease of a Deathclaw right at the end and lots of head popping gory action, just like the first series.</p>
<p>If you missed the first series, then we highly recommend it. You<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/11/fallout-season-1/">&nbsp;can check out my review here.</a> Season 3 has already been commissioned, so the story will continue.</p>

<p>The Fallout television series is canon within the franchise so Fallout 5, whenever that gets round to being made, may incorporate characters and locations from the show.</p>
<p>“Fallout is one of the greatest game series of all time,” said&nbsp; Jonathon Nolan during <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/02/fallout-tv-series-teased-by-amazon-studios-and-kilter-films/">the show’s 2020 announcement</a>. “Each chapter of this insanely imaginative story has cost us countless hours we could have spent with family and friends. So we’re incredibly excited to partner with Todd Howard and the rest of the brilliant lunatics at Bethesda to bring this massive, subversive, and darkly funny universe to life with Amazon Studios.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-launch-scheduled-for-exactly-one-year-after-pc-ps5/">Black Myth: Wukong</a> developer Game Science has announced Black Myth: Zhong Kui, the next game in its Black Myth series, coming to PC and "<em>mainstream console platforms"</em> sometime in the future, as a specific release date was not announced.</p>



<p>On the game's <a href="https://gamesci.cn/zhongkui">official website</a>, Game Science makes a few things clear to Black Myth: Wukong fans who potentially have a flurry of questions in their minds about Zhong Kui.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Black Myth: Zhong Kui World Premiere Trailer | gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zwYZ7xC2v80?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Firstly, Zhong Kui is the next game in Game Science's Black Myth series, but it is not a sequel to Black Myth: Wukong. As to why Game Science isn't just rushing to show off Black Myth: Wukong 2, in an FAQ for Zhong Kui, it wrote, "<em>Upon completing the journey with the Destined One, we now aspire to take a tentative first step - to build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features, and to bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Zhong Kui came as a natural choice born of that aspiration and other contributing factors. We are confident that, in this new project, we can make refreshing changes, create new things, while taking a hard look at our past flaws and regrets.</em>"</p>



<p>The studio does also confirm that the choice to reveal Zhong Kui first doesn't mean it's the end for Wukong, as it closes by saying, "<em>And to all friends who love Black Myth: Wukong, the westward journey won't end here</em>."</p>



<p>But even though Game Science is debuting Zhong Kui before it shows off Wukong 2, it is also very clear in communicating that this game is very, very early in development. Regarding Zhong Kui's story, Game Science admits that it's "<em>not even done with the outline yet</em>," and also calls the project "<em>little more than an empty folder at this stage</em>." Which it explains is also why the debut trailer isn't gameplay, but instead just a CG short "<em>to let everyone know that a new project has kicked off</em>."</p>



<p>Even though by the sounds of that, we'll be waiting a long time to see any actual gameplay of Black Myth: Zhong Kui, it's exciting to get a look at what the studio is working on, and to know that there's more to come regarding Black Myth: Wukong. Hopefully, we'll have more concrete information soon on when Game Science is ready to release its next project.</p>

            <p>Fire up the geiger counter, the second series of Amazon's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout TV series</a> just showed off a trailer during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>. It premieres on 17th December.</p>
<p>If it wasn't clear already, this chain of episodes is set to take us to NEW VEGAS. I said NEW VEGAS. That's NEW VEGAS, the setting of obscure 2010 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: NEW VEGAS</a>. Understand? I don't think you do, so let's all look over here while I point to this sign. It says Lucky 38, which is a casino in NEW VEGAS.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, I doth protest this much because I'm a NEW VEGAS fan who's looking forward to taking in this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-tv-creators-saved-iconic-elements-for-season-2-so-it-doesnt-feel-like-they-just-skimmed-wikipedia">second series of Fallout</a> when it premieres in December. Ahead of that, this outing of it showed us The Ghoul and Lucy heading to New Vegas in pursuit of a certain someone (I won't say who, to avoid series one spoilers). Between the trailer and little chat actors Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten and the showrunners had with the Geoffman, we look to be getting a lot more of that Purnell/Goggins duo rubbing off on each other in series two, which sounds great to me.</p><p>They'll have to do a lot to pry my attention away from everyone's favourite preservation tube-dwelling Fallout billionaire, though. After popping in briefly in series one, NEW VEGAS' own Robert Edwin House looks to be playing a big role in series two. He and Walton Goggins' Cooper Howard are having plenty of pre-war chats, which see the suave, moustachioed House stare deeply into the Goggler's eyes while talking down to him just like he does to a certain videogame mailperson. Phwoar, Bob Residence. If you weren't a shrivelled prune by the time my character reached you, they'd have stabbed you through some bedsheets after a round or two, rather than that Benny.</p>
<p>Despite all the NEW VEGAS, I'm keen to see whether, with all of of its major characters all now set up and past the early stages of a playthrough when you're still convinced you're not gonna resort to speccing into speech, the series does anything major to take Fallout places it's not been. The likes of new factions or visits to locations the games haven't touched, just to spice up the big screening of things we know and love. Though, I'm aware that's something that I may well be in the minority on, given the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-fallout-tv-show-gave-the-fallout-games-a-huge-player-bump-as-everyone-remembers-they-like-fallout">massive popularity</a> of the first series.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Either way, odds are Ella Purnell, Walton Goggins, and co will once again be the faces of a good post-apocalyptic adventure, and one that looks like it's leaning heavily into pre-war flashbacks of NEW VEGAS in all its glory.</p>
<p>That's NEW VEGAS, lest you forget amid your Silver Rush to get on Tops of all the other Gamescom Opening Night live news.</p>

<p>Game Science has dropped a tease at an expansion to the story of Black Myth: Wukong, confirming the Journey to the West is not over.</p>



<p>The title, which was released last year and is finally joining Xbox on August 20, was a breakout success for the studio, with many expecting DLC would be announced at Gamescom.</p>



<p>Instead, the finale of Gamescom Opening Night Live was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-zhongkui-revealed-at-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer for Black Myth: Zhong Kui</a>, a brand-new title from Game Science that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-black-myth-zhong-kui-a-sequel-to-black-myth-wukong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t a sequel to Black Myth: Wukong</a>—but more could be on the horizon.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-myth-wukong-journey-will-continue">Black Myth: Wukong Journey Will Continue</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to wait. Image via Game Science</figcaption></figure>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a> for Black Myth: Zhong Kui, a series of questions and answers were shared about the development of the new title, with one stand-out entry concerning the decision to develop a brand-new game and not create a sequel for Black Myth: Wukong.</p>



<p>Explaining the decision, Game Science stated the aspiration to “take a tentative first step” to “build more game experiences,” “challenge ourselves with bolder features,” and “bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design.”</p>



<p>The key detail concerning Wukong, however, came right at the end with a message that said: “And to all friends who love Black Myth: Wukong, the westward journey won’t end here.”</p>



<p>It’s not clear whether the story from Wukong will continue in a new title as a direct sequel, or whether DLC is planned for the original title.</p>



<p>If the plan is for a direct sequel, that would likely come after the release of Black Myth: Zhong Kui, which itself is a long way off, considering development is in very early stages and “even Yocar himself has absolutely no idea” when a release will be.</p>



<p>Do you want to see DLC released for Black Myth: Wukong, or are you happy to wait for a direct sequel? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3347/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

		<p>Survival horror fans have been treated to a new look at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> during <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/gamescom">Gamescom</a> 2025. The survival horror sequel, which made its debut during E3 earlier this year, will take fans of the franchise back to Raccoon City with a new lead protagonist at the helm.</p>
<p>A release for the upcoming title has been confirmed for February 27th, 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Check out Capcom’s latest gameplay video.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - Gamescom Gameplay Trailer | gamescom 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/19LGIQNmN4M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The ninth mainline Resident Evil game casts players as Grace Ashcroft who – as RE law dictates – finds herself embroiled in an apocalyptic scenario that has players running a gauntlet of jump scares as they peel back layers of a grander conspiracy.</p>
<p>Much like Resident Evil 7, and Village, Requiem will feature first person gameplay and visuals powered by Capcom’s silky smooth RE Engine. Instead of being chased by the shambling undead, the Gamescom footage shows Grace and her mother escape the clutches of someone who appears to be a deranged serial killer. It’s definitely a change of direction for Resi though one that will no doubt loop back to the familiar tropes this series is known for, with fan favourite characters likely to make an appearance at some point.</p>

<p>While it hasn’t been confirmed, we’re also likely to see a demo. Both RE7 and Village gave fans a tantalising slither of gameplay to keep them sated, so let’s hope Requiem follows this trend.</p>

<p>During Gamescom's Opening Night Live showcase, it's been confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> now has a free demo available for users on all relevant platforms, including the Switch 2.</p>
<p>It should be available for download by the time you're reading this, but if not, then just keep an eye out over the coming hours for an update to the Switch 2 eShop; it'll be there before you know it.</p>
<p>As for what you can expect, the demo will include the first nine chapters of the story, and will also allow you to freely explore the open world. Online co-op is also supported for up to three players via cross-play, and all save data can be transferred to the full game when it launches on <strong>5th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Titanic Evolution</strong> - <strong><em>Daemon X Machina</em></strong>’s high-octane armored action debuts on a new generation of platforms, bringing with it an epic sci-fi adventure, gameplay that’s accessible to newcomers, and an expanded scope sure to satisfy returning fans.</p>
<p><strong>Build a Better You</strong> - Now a nimble suit of armor, each Arsenal can be fully customized both in design and in loadout, with the ability to craft or salvage new elements.</p>
<p><strong>Together You Can Make a Difference</strong> - Cooperative and asynchronous multiplayer means players never truly fight alone. Team up with friends online to tackle the epic story and battles together.</p>
<p><strong>Beautiful and Deadly</strong> - Explore an alien planet in an Arsenal as players battle against mechanical and organic enemies. Trek through the vast open world on foot, fly through the skies, or when all else fails, gallop on horseback across plains, swamps, mountains, and more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We recently went hands-on with Titanic Scion and came away feeling pretty optimistic about the whole thing. Needless to say, while we'll reserve our full judgement until the game launches, we reckon you should keep an eye on this one.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-legends-2026-release-gamescom-onl-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-yotei-legends-co-op-multiplayer-confirmed-for-2026-new-gameplay-showcased-at-gamescom-onl-2025.1274946/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ghost of Yotei is arriving on PS5 and PS5 Pro later this year on <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/">October 2, 2025</a>, and ahead of that launch at Gamescom ONL 2025, developer Sucker Punch Productions confirmed that the popular multiplayer Legends mode introduced in Ghost of Tsushima is also making its way over to Ghost of Yotei, with Ghost of Yotei Legends confirmed with a 2026 release window.</p>



<p>Just how Legends was free for Ghost of Tsushima players, it will also be free DLC for all owners of Ghost of Yotei when it eventually launches sometime next year.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - &quot;Song of Vengeance&quot; Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FM08YoziYJs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Ghost of Yōtei Legends will offer two-player story missions and four-player survival matches. This time around, you’ll play as one of four character classes and try to defeat demonic, giant versions of members of the Yōtei Six, plus a variety of new enemies that fight alongside them,"</em> writes Andrew Goldfarb, senior communications manager at Sucker Punch in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/ghost-of-yotei-legends-dlc-is-coming-in-2026/">PlayStation Blog post.</a></p>



<p>The blog post also featured concept art of the enemies you'll face, which you can see here.</p>

				    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
			    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>It's exciting to know that we'll be able to dig back into Legends following the main release for Yotei, which is coming in October. It's unfortunate that we have to wait until 2026 to check it out, and that even those in attendance at Gamescom ONL 2025 and the rest of the convention won't get a chance to play it this week.</p>



<p>Still, Legends was a surprise mode that fans of Ghost of Tsushima loved, and knowing that it'll be coming to Yotei further solidifies the next entry in Sucker Punch's 'Ghost' series as a true successor to Ghost of Tsushima.</p>

<p>The Keighleybot intrduced Zero Parades trailer as a "first look" at a spy RPG ZA/UM have been working on. Oh, you mean the spy game they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despite-it-all-disco-elysiums-original-studio-have-revealed-espionage-filled-new-game-c4">revealed earlier this year</a>, Project C4, I mouthed at the screen. Geoff didn't answer, or even mention the name Project C4. So, unless this is an example of spyish doubling up to confuse a foe, I assume the two must be one in the same.</p><p>Anyway, in Zero Parades, the name for which comes with a host of optional taglines including "Zero Parades for fake radicals", which given all that's happened with folks seen as radical ideasmiths leaving ZA/UM in the Disco aftermath feels maybe a bit cheeky. Anyway, in this game you play as an operant Hershel Wilk, alias CASCADE, who's described as being "brilliant, burnt-out, possibly cursed", as well as "an Anti-Icon". Hershel's also a woman, so modify the mental image of Harry Du Bois that description's inevitably given you a little bit. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863680/ZERO_PARADES/">Steam page</a> continues as follows:</p>
<blockquote>Five years ago you led your team into the abyss and have been haunted by your failures ever since. Now you've been recalled for a mysterious assignment that may give you a chance to prove yourself again. Find yourself thrown into a three-way struggle for cultural and ideological power, played out across an unforgettable new city. In Zero Parades, the world itself is a character with its own secrets, traumas, and miracles for you to discover.</blockquote>
<p>Much like in Project C4's reveal, a big thing's made of the fact you'll be failing a lot, and tha your failure will take you places via improvisation. Places that might not be as ideal, but that be how the dice are sometimes.</p>
<p>Zero Parades, or the artist that looks to be formerly known as Project C4, is currently without a release date. You can wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863680/ZERO_PARADES/">here</a>, if you're so inclined.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-protagonist-atsu-wolf-ps5-1851657667"><em>Ghost of Yōtei Legends</em></a> will bring multiplayer to Sony’s fall blockbuster, though not until next year. The cooperative online mode will arrive as free DLC sometime in 2026.</p> <p>For anyone unfamiliar with the mode from the original game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/im-going-to-play-the-shit-out-of-ghost-of-tsushima-s-ne-1845397850"><em>Legends</em> was a multiplayer spin-off for <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a> that had players team up online to take down mythical challenges in a new series of story missions, fight off waves of enemies in a horde-like survival mode, or compete with other players to see who could rack up the highest score. There were character classes, difficulty ranks, and unlockable cosmetics. It was one of those multiplayer add-ons to a single-player adventure that was way better than it had any right to be.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ghost of Yōtei - &quot;Song of Vengeance&quot; Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FM08YoziYJs?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/ghost-of-yotei-legends-dlc-is-coming-in-2026/">PlayStation Blog post</a> suggests things will work pretty much the same in <em>Ghost of Yotei Legends, </em>though this time the story missions will revolve around teaming up to take down members of the Yōtei Six, the main antagonists of the single-player campaign. They’ll be accompanied by new enemies, however, and presumably have other, more challenging tricks up their sleeves. The return of the survival mode is also confirmed, though it’s currently unclear if that will include the 2v2 contest option as well. It sounds like Sucker Punch will reveal more details once <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is out on October 2.</p> <p>The original <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> multiplayer mode was one of Sony’s more successful first-party forays into live-service content. Its popularity among fans made it seem like a slam dunk impressive enough to justify a full-blown standalone spin-off game. But despite the literal billions Sony has poured into trying to get a fleet of live-service games off the ground,<em> Legends</em> hasn’t been among the projects released or canceled, at least that we know of. If anything, the success of <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review-in-progress-difficulty-1851782700"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a> proves there’s definitely players out there who want innovative co-op riffs on traditional single-player games. We’ll see if<em> Ghost of Yotei Legends</em> can satisfy some of that pent-up demand when it arrives next year.</p>

<p>This year’s Gamescom has officially kicked off. That means that today, we were treated to a trailer-laden showcase known as Opening Night Live, straight from Cologne, Germany and featuring none other than Geoff Keighley.</p> <p>ONL was pretty packed this year, with some solid trailers and reveals of many awesome-looking games. As always, we’ve rounded up everything that caught our eye. It was a dense show, so read on!</p> <hr> <h2><span id="hollow-knight-silksong"></span><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em><span></span></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Host Geoff Keighley Kicks Off gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/94P9Upb_qjQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>While we didn’t get a firm release <em>date</em> of the ever-elusive sequel to <em>Hollow</em> <em>Knight</em>, Geoff Keighley took to the Gamescom stage to officially declare that the game is coming out <em>this year </em>and to show off some new gameplay. A more in-depth presentation from developer Team Cherry <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-gamescom-stream-2000618437">is coming on Thursday</a>.</p> <p><strong><em>Hollow Knight Silksong </em>launches in 2025.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><span id="call-of-duty-black-ops-7"></span><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em><span></span></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 World Premiere Trailer | gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/egA6Pj485eA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The world is in a bad place in 2035 according to <em>Black Ops 7</em>, so it’s a good thing you’ve got a gun and a willingness to shoot people. I mean, that’s the premise for all these kindsa things, but at least the level design looks surprisingly batty! I’ll take it. I will <em>not</em> take this version of Metallica’s “Master of Puppets,” though.</p>

              <p>Today, at the very end of Gamescom Opening Night Live, Geoff had one more secret to reveal: The developers behind the <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-review-soulslike-pc-ps5-1851629456">super-popular action RPG <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></a> are working on a new game, <em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui,</em> starring a new mythical hero.</p> <p>Here’s the very short teaser for<em> Zhong Kui</em>, which doesn’t have a release date yet:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Game Science's New Title | Black Myth: Zhong Kui - Teaser Trailer (Chinese Dub)" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sqe3j4Qch1Y?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui</em> isn’t a direct sequel to <em>Wukong</em>. <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui">On the new game’s official website, the devs explained</a> that they wanted to “build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features” and work on “fresh ideas.” However, they did tease an actual sequel or DLC to <em>Wukong</em>, saying: “And to all friends who love <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, the westward journey won’t end here.”</p>

 <p>It should also be noted that, despite a slick-looking CG trailer showing off the new mythical hero and setting, Game Science admits it doesn’t have much to show because the game is still very early in development, saying that <em>Zhong Kui</em> is “little more than an empty folder at this stage.” However, the devs said they love announcing new things and updating fans on August 20, so they created a CG short to “let everyone know that a new project has kicked off.” But yeah, don’t expect to be playing this game anytime soon.</p> <p>According to Game Science,<em> Black Myth: Zhong Kui</em>, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-souls-like-looks-cool-even-if-it-might-never-come-o-1844786724"><em>Wukong</em></a>, is a single-player action RPG that will follow “the same business model as before.” That seems to imply that this sequel won’t be free-to-play when it eventually launches.</p> <p>“However, you won’t be playing a monkey role this time,” explained the studio. “That said, we’re still exploring and experimenting with the concrete differences between <em>Wukong</em> and <em>Zhong Kui.</em> So take it easy—let us impress ourselves first before we serve it to you.”</p> <p>On August 20, 2024, <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> launched on PlayStation 5 and PC and quickly became a massive hit. The game saw over 2.4 million concurrent players on Steam alone, beating out popular games like <em>Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, Elden Ring, Cyberpunk,</em> and many more. It still, to this day, <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-steam-game-pass-cyberpunk-elden-ring-1851626674">holds the record for second-highest number of players all online at the same time on Steam</a>, only beaten by <em>PUBG’s</em> massive 3.2 concurrent players record. Needless to say, a lot of people are excited for more<em> Black Myth</em>, and I expect that when <em>Zhong Kui</em> eventually arrives on PC and consoles, it will be as big if not bigger.</p>

<p>Game Science dropped a huge surprise during Gamescom Opening Night Live with the reveal of Black Myth: Zhong Kui, and the title immediately raises questions on whether it is a direct sequel to Black Myth: Wukong.</p>



<p>The finale of Gamescom Opening Night Live was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-zhongkui-revealed-at-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal of Black Myth: Zhong Kui</a>, with the footage showing the character from Chinese mythology riding on the back of a giant tiger, earning awe from the audience.</p>



<p>As both titles share the Black Myth name, some confusion around Zhong Kui’s sequel status has emerged, but we’ve got all the answers you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-black-myth-zhong-kui-a-black-myth-wukong-sequel">Is Black Myth: Zhong Kui a Black Myth: Wukong Sequel?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Menacing. Image via Game Science</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Black Myth: Zhong Kui is not a sequel to Black Myth: Wukong, Game Science has confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a>, several questions on the development of Black Myth: Zhong Kui were answered, including why a decision was made to release a new title and not provide a sequel to Black Myth: Wukong first.</p>



<p>The question itself makes it clear that Zhong Kui is not a sequel to Wukong, instead telling a story elsewhere within Chinese mythology, though there could be references and Easter Eggs connecting the game to Wukong.</p>



<p>There are many similarities between the games, however, with Black Myth: Zhong Kui sharing “the same foundation of ancient Chinese myth and folklore,” while the game will remain a standard single-player ARPG, “following the same business model as before.”</p>



<p>Given the very early stage in development, however, full details on Black Myth: Zhong Kui are not yet known, and it could be a while before more concrete reveals are shared.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-black-myth-wukong-receive-a-sequel">Will Black Myth: Wukong Receive a Sequel?</h2>



<p><strong>Game Science has not confirmed whether Black Myth: Wukong will receive a sequel or additional DLC, though it appears the door is open.</strong></p>



<p>At the end of the question on the website concerning why Black Myth: Zhong Kui was chosen for development, players were assured that “the westward journey won’t end here.”</p>



<p>No further details have been provided, however, but stay tuned for more news from Game Science in the future, particularly given the long-awaited Xbox release.</p>

<p>Returning from Ghost of Tsushima, the free co-op Legends mode will launch in 2026 for Ghost of Yotei. </p>



<p>The original Ghost of Tsushima added Legends, which brought fans to an otherworldly battleground. You and four resurrected warriors would take on the demonic forces to survive. While not included in the base game at launch, Legends was a huge success and brought many back to the game. Now, Ghost of Yotei plans to bring it back in 2026.</p>



<p><strong>This story is breaking news, so updates, including more information, will be done after publication.</strong></p>

<p>While we don’t see any gameplay of it, the stinger at the end of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM08YoziYJs">latest Ghost of Yotei trailer</a> revealed that Legends is returning. It will bring back the four-player co-op experience from Ghost of Tsushima, now for new audiences. As mentioned by Geoff Keighley at Gamescom Opening Night Live, the experience will be free, so all can play it. It is currently set to launch sometime in 2026, but it’s likely we’ll hear more closer to Ghost of Yotei’s October 3rd launch.</p>

                <p>Blizzard revealed the opening cinematic for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> next expansion, Midnight, as part of Gamescom Opening Night Live, setting the stakes for the second chapter in the game's multi-expansion Worldsoul Saga and proving it ain't easy being a Blood Elf.</p><p dir="ltr">The cinematic depicts Xal'atath, the current big bad of the Warcraft universe, commencing a full-scale invasion of the Blood Elf homeland Quel'Thalas. Blood Elf leaders Lor'themar and Liadrin face off against Xal'atath and her shadowy Void beasts, but it soon becomes apparent that they can do little to stop this threat.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiIjThwKLaE" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SiIjThwKLaE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Xal'atath's objective seems to be the Sunwell, a potent font of magic power that has been the target of hostile forces multiple times in Warcraft history. First, Arthas and his Scourge army corrupted the Sunwell to create the lich Kel'thuzad back in 2002's </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos/" data-ref-id="5000-2650">Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos</a><span>, an event that led to the former High Elves changing their name to Blood Elves to begin with.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Fast forward a few years and disgraced Blood Elf prince Kael'thas Sunstrider would attempt to restore the Sunwell to its former glory…albeit with the goal of using it to open a portal for a Burning Legion invasion. Players put a stop to that back in 2008 as part of WoW's The Burning Crusade expansion, but with some help from the Draenei, the Sunwell would ultimately be restored as a font of both arcane and holy power.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550292-wowmidnightcinematiclor%27themar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550292" data-ratio="0.56239015817223" data-width="2845" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550292-wowmidnightcinematiclor%27themar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550292"></a><figcaption>Lor'themar and the Blood Elves face off against the Void in World of Warcraft: Midnight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550292-wowmidnightcinematiclor%27themar.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">What Xal'atath wants with the Sunwell isn't exactly clear, but it certainly can't be good. Thankfully, the Light seems keen on stopping her and her Void army, and Liadrin and Alliance forces, seemingly empowered by the Light, push back the encroaching foes.</p><p dir="ltr">Maria Hamilton, associate design director on WoW, told GameSpot in an interview that while it's true players have seen the invasion of Quel'Thalas and the Sunwell before, the nature of this fight is quite different. The Light isn't taking a backseat this time around, and the heroes of Azeroth will have to contend with some never-before-seen Void creatures.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Light is quite actively involved in this fight," Hamilton said. "This is a fight between Light and Void and the Light is there, it is visible and present."</p><p dir="ltr">Xal'atath has become a fan-favorite villain in the WoW community, and this cinematic is the first time players have gotten to truly see just how powerful she is. The cinematic shows she's capable of inflicting mental anguish with just a blink of the eye, though Lor'themar is eventually able to overcome the psychic attack.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550294-wowmidnightcinematicxal%27atath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550294" data-ratio="0.56258790436006" data-width="2844" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550294-wowmidnightcinematicxal%27atath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550294"></a><figcaption>Xal'atath is scarier than ever in WoW: Midnight's reveal cinematic.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550294-wowmidnightcinematicxal%27atath.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cinematic director Ben Dai told GameSpot the cinematics team wanted to leave room for imagination when it came to Xal'atath's true power, choosing to hold back on showing her at her full potential. The less she does, the more powerful she feels, Dai said.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's just the tip of the iceberg of what she can do," Dai said. "We want to leave everything else to the game to let the player explore."</p><p dir="ltr">It's after that initial battle depicted in the cinematic that players will begin the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-world-of-warcraft-midnight-whats-old-is-new-again/1100-6534043/" data-ref-id="1100-6534043">Midnight expansion</a>, which will revamp the Blood Elf lands of Quel'Thalas first introduced in 2007 to be more in line with the modern version of the game. The expansion will also introduce <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-launch-with-patch-11-2-7-but-not-in-full/1100-6534018/" data-ref-id="1100-6534018">player housing in full</a>, add a new Allied Race in the form of the Haranir, make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-midnight-is-finally-making-transmog-much-cheaper-and-more-convenient/1100-6534017/" data-ref-id="1100-6534017">major changes to transmog</a>, and bring a third, Void-powered specialization for Demon Hunters. WoW's Midnight expansion does not have an exact release date just yet but is slated to arrive in early 2026.</p>

Suddenly, the lights of the entire hotel go out, and things spiral from there.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh7TVa8yUf8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yh7TVa8yUf8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Eventually, the two women find the hotel manager, who begins to apologize for the power outage and says he'll fix it immediately. Suddenly, the man is attacked by a hooded figure--who also happens to have pale white skin resembling the undead or the zealots of Resident Evil 4--with a plastic bag, sending the Ashfords running for their lives. Grace walks ahead of her mother, and when she turns to say something, she screams ... and the trailer ends.</p><p>The trailer provided a little more information about Grace, who was the playable character in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview/1100-6532336/" data-ref-id="1100-6532336">hands-on preview</a> Capcom showed off when it announced Resident Evil Requiem in June.

In a new trailer shown during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 today, we get to see a little bit of Grace's backstory and history with her mom, Resident Evil Outbreak's Alyssa Ashcroft.</p><p>Alyssa is a field reporter and playable character from the Outbreak series, now playing a major role in Resident Evil Requiem. She's the mother of Requiem's lead, Grace Ashcroft, and looks to be on the run from some dangerous foes. After a mysterious phone call and a power outage, we get a brief look at a playable section where the player, as Grace, follows Alyssa through the darkened and foreboding hotel hallways.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yh7TVa8yUf8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yh7TVa8yUf8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Spare a thought for the world's most doomed hotel manager, as a terrible fate befalls him, and the pair escape. Seeing the dynamics between mother and daughter here seems to emphasize this as a thematic thread for the main game, but we'll have to wait and see for more.</p><p>The wait's not that long, though, as Capcom confirmed <a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/06/resident-evil-requiem-is-arriving-february-2026">Resident Evil Requiem's release date during this year's Summer Game Fest</a> back in June.

It’s clear the studio isn’t resting on its laurels, as the final game shown at this year’s Opening Night Live show aims to continue the story. Black Myth: Zhong Kui is the new entry in the burgeoning franchise.</p><p>The debut trailer certainly doesn’t reveal much. We see two down-on-their-luck men who appear to be on the run, but they quiet down as they realize someone is outside who may be chasing them down. The visuals pan over to a figure riding a massive tiger, revealed to be Zhong Kui.</p><p>In following up on the trailer, Opening Night Live host Geoff Keighley offered up that the game follows the “ghost-catching god who wanders between hell and earth.” The game appears to be early in development (not unexpected given that the last installment only released a year ago), but the game will be a single-player action/RPG rooted in Chinese mythology.</p><p>Check out the full trailer below.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZ7VLcO06Ak"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZ7VLcO06Ak" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/black-myth-zhong-kui-announced]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> is almost upon us, and ahead of its 2nd October arrival, developer Insomniac has confirmed its highly anticipated sequel is getting its own co-op-focused Legends mode as free post-launch DLC next year.
</p>
<p>
There's not much to report in the way of specifics just yet - the news was only very briefly shared <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-and-blog">during Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> - but host <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> teased Ghost of Yōtei's take on Legends mode would include a "fantastical supernatural story and survival missions".
</p>
<p>
It seems reasonable to assume, then, that Ghost of Yōtei's Legends mode will be similar to that of its predecessor, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. Tsushima's Legends mode <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-is-getting-online-co-op-multiplayer">arrived several months after launch,</a> introducing a combat-focused co-op spin on the solo experience that saw 2-4 players - as one of four available classes - completing missions inspired by Japanese folk tales and mythology. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima-legends">Ghost of Tsushima: Legends</a> later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushimas-multiplayer-legends-mode-getting-standalone-launch">released as a standalone game</a>.
</p>
<p>
It might be a little while before we get some solid details about Ghost of Yōtei's Legends mode, but you can see the tiniest glimpse of its action in the new trailer below.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> studio Game Science has revealed it's working on the next game in the series.
</p>
<p>
Black Myth: Zhong Kui will be an all-new follow-up, focused on the titular ghost-catching god who wanders between hell and earth. Like Wukong, it will be another single-player action-RPG rooted in Chinese folklore.
</p>
<p>
A brief teaser trailer was shown at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> Opening Night Live, showing a couple of men hiding from a parade of mythical characters, including Zhong Kui himself riding a giant tiger.

<p>
So why not release a Wukong sequel? Game Science explained over on the <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui">new game's website</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Upon completing the journey with the Destined One, we now aspire to take a tentative first step - to build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features, and to bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design," reads a Q&amp;A. 
</p><p>
"Zhong Kui came as a natural choice born of that aspiration and other contributing factors. We are confident that, in this new project, we can make refreshing changes, create new things, while taking a hard look at our past flaws and regrets. And to all friends who love Black Myth: Wukong: the westward journey won't end here."
</p>
<p>
There's no release date yet, but it's planned for PC and "mainstream console platforms".
</p>
<p>
Wukong was a huge success for Game Science, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-continues-its-dominance-with-new-milestone">selling 10m copies in just three days</a> after its release last year. It's considered China's first AAA release and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">paved the way for a whole string of Chinese-made action-RPGs on the way</a>.
