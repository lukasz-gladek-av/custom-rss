            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> open beta is over at the time of this writing, ending just hours prior to this post, and as far as we know right now, we won't get another chance to play it until it launches this coming October 10, 2025. But if you can't wait that long and want more Battlefield right now, EA has released a new update for Battlefield 2042 to help tide you over until October.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-9-2-0">Update 9.2</a> for Battlefield 2042 adds a new fan-favorite map to the 2021 release, Iwo Jima, a map that is new to the last major release in the Battlefield series, but veterans of the shooter will recognize from multiple entries, including Battlefield V, Battlefield 1942, and Battlefield 1943. You'll enter the fight from the sea with boat landings, and jump into close-quarters fighting in the bunkers and trenches with an active volcano in the background to complete the grandeur of Iwo Jima.</p>



<p>The update also includes two new weapons and vehicles for players to check out: the KFS2000 assault rifle and the Lynx sniper rifle. The two new vehicles are two new fighter jets, the A10 Warthog and the SU-25TM Frogfoot.</p>

<p>Along with the new map, weapons, and vehicles, EA is also adding a free battle pass that runs right up to Battlefield 6's release, titled the Road to Battlefield Battle Pass, which includes 60 tiers of cosmetics for players to earn, celebrating previous Battlefield titles stretching all the way back to Battlefield Bad Company 2.</p>



<p>There's also a bevy of bug fixes and balance changes included in the update, and though EA doesn't specify what the rewards will be, the company does say that players who dig into the new content added in this update will "<em>unlock exclusive Battlefield 6 rewards</em>."</p>



<p>We've still got a while to wait for Battlefield 6's launch, but if you're really craving a bit of what we saw these last two weekends, then this new update, along with the rest of the content already available in Battlefield 2042, will help you get your fix until October 10.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>An August Nintendo Direct is indeed happening, though maybe not the one fans were expecting. The company announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-nintendo-direct-mario-donkey-kong-1851774194">a deep-dive into <em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> is coming on August 19, the same day that Gamescom kicks off in Germany. We basically know nothing about the upcoming racer except that Kirby creator and Smash Bros. director Masahiro Sakurai is in charge, and it’s scheduled to arrive before the end of 2025.</p> <p>“Tune in on Tuesday, August 19, for a livestreamed <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> Direct featuring about 45 minutes of information about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game,” Nintendo posted in its Switch 2 news app today. Nearly an hour about <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>? In this economy?</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Kirby Air Riders – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oJVsNMp_nAU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The game was originally revealed during the Switch 2’s April Nintendo Direct, but only with a cinematic teaser and Sakurai’s name flashing across the screen. It’s a sequel to the 2003 GameCube fan-favorite, which included, among other things, the novel mechanic of players not needing to hold a button to accelerate. But it was also largely overshadowed on a console that already had <em>F-Zero GX</em> and <em>Mario Kart: Double Dash</em>.</p>

 <p>The new <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> falls into a similar position with the Switch 2, coming so soon after <em>Mario Kart World</em>, <em>F-Zero</em> via the Switch Online retro library, and the great indie launch racer<em> Fast Fusion</em>. Expectations are also markedly higher for exclusives featuring first-party characters in the Switch 2 era, though <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is a joint venture between Sakurai’s studio and Bandai Namco.</p> <p>The upcoming game is supposed to round out Nintendo’s holiday release lineup, though we’re still waiting on <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>‘s release date, a game that was originally teased back during the first years of the Switch 1’s life cycle. A <em>Kirby</em> Direct probably wasn’t on most fans’ bingo cards for August, but hopefully, a big Nintendo Direct that helps define the longer-term roadmap for the Switch 2 will still be coming soon.</p>

<p>Kirby Air Riders is taking center stage at the latest Nintendo Direct showcase, announced for tomorrow.</p>



<p>Due for release on Nintendo Switch 2 later this year, Kirby Air Riders is the first new game in the franchise since 2022’s Kirby and the Forgotten Land and is one of the big remaining Switch 2 launches this year.</p>



<p>The latest Nintendo Direct continues the approach of focusing on a single game rather than several titles, an approach already seen this year with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-revealed-during-mario-kart-world-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-announced-by-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and plenty of details are set to be revealed.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-direct-announced-for-august-19">Nintendo Direct Announced For August 19</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More details coming. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a social media <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1957427985625088145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Nintendo announced the Kirby Air Raiders Direct would take place on August 19 at 6am PT/8am CT/9am ET/2pm BST/11pm AEST.</p>



<p>The announcement stated the livestream presentation will “last 45 minutes” and provides an “in-depth look” at the title, releasing exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>A social media <a href="https://x.com/KirbyAirRiders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">account</a> for Kirby Air Riders then went live, which will share the “latest announcements and updates” for the title, which will likely be extremely active following the Nintendo Direct showcase.</p>



<p>Details on exactly what will be shown are unknown, though it’s highly likely that a release date will be provided given we’re approaching the latter end of 2025 and details so far have not been shared.</p>



<p>Further reveals from Nintendo for Switch 2 could be on the cards this week at Gamescom, where the company’s attendance is confirmed.</p>

And while Patch 1.5 does address many of these issues, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-performance-patch-makes-drastic-changes-to-enemies-and-story-and-players-arent-happy"><u>it also made sweeping, and unexpected, changes to many of the game's enemies, dialogue, and story</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we explained at the time, prior to the patch, you were able to target and kill certain human NPCs you encountered throughout the game. These characters were passive and didn't attack you, but murdering them affected your character's "madness" mechanic. That's no longer the case, however — the NPCs are untargetable and unkillable, effectively removing the ability to choose to interact with the madness mechanic in that specific way, and you cannot kill boss enemies any longer, but only "exhaust" them into surrendering. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you might expect, the changes have not been well received, and many players have taken to Steam's discussion forums and user review section to share their disappointment. And within days of 1.5's release, a modder has already created a mod that rolls back the changes wholesale, be they for the better or worse, to version 1.4.1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Wuchang 1.5 massively downgrades the game experience - Most late game bosses, NPCs and enemies now get exhausted instead of dying and give you meaningless banter instead of story-advancing dialog from the original game," the modder <a href="https://v/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a>. "Basically, patch 1.5 has ruined the game's story and immersion."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mod creator themselves admitted it's a "fairly complex mod that modifies game files," and as it also undoes some of the QoL improvements introduced in Patch 1.5, they point some players who want to rollback the story changes but keep QoL changes to additional mods like <a href="https://https//www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/136" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fast Vertical Traversal</u></a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/146" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Improved Recovery</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/124" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fast Item Pick Up</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is a Soulslike action-RPG set in the land of Shu during the dark and tumultuous late Ming Dynasty. You play as a mysterious warrior afflicted by a horrific feather disease, who uncovers hidden secrets and battles supernatural enemies in an ancient empire teetering on the edge of collapse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: "Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is yet another great soulslike to add to the ever-increasing pile, featuring excellent combat, wonderful level design, an incredible skill tree, and fearsome bosses. Just watch out for some steep difficulty dips and spikes, and a reliance on cheap-feeling 'gotcha!' ambushes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

<section><p>Thunder Lotus' game about end-of-life care showed me that it's never too early to try to understand someone better.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><em>Spiritfarer is celebrating its 5-year anniversary today, August 18, 2025. Below, we reflect on how the game's compassion and empathy can help influence our own lives.</em></p><p dir="ltr">When it was first introduced, Developer Thunder Lotus billed Spiritfarer as "a cozy management sim about dying," which immediately intrigued me. What's so cozy about dying, and what difference does the team see between a game about dying and a game about death? The wording seemed unmistakably intentional. Many games are, to some degree, about death--and specifically, avoiding it. But Spiritfarer not only makes dying unavoidable; <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-little-death-positivity-in-video-games-can-be-go/1100-6471051/">it makes dying the whole point</a>. As Stella, players ferry over a dozen characters through a purgatorial plane, waving them goodbye as they cross the Everdoor into a permanent afterlife. But it's her thoughtfulness and understanding of each passenger, regardless of the life they lived, that I find so inspiring. Stella's hospice care approach works great on the precipice of the afterlife. But we don't need to wait until it's nearly too late to express such a devotion to forgiveness.</p><p dir="ltr">It's Stella's job to manage the many personalities that find their way aboard her boat, helping each passenger with their unfinished business before sending their souls floating away into the warm glow of the Everdoor. Though this sounds like the setup for something so saccharine it may induce nausea, in reality, Spiritfarer doesn't shy from the much gloomier and less picturesque aspects of life. And yet, despite its flawed, hurting, sometimes even hurtful characters, it never wavers in its expressions of love and understanding, and it's that difference that helped me learn something about my own life.</p><p dir="ltr">Each character that comes into Stella's (after)life does so in a new physical form, like an animal, a tree, or a mushroom, but keeps intact their name and personality from their time on Earth. There's Gwen, a surrogate big sister of Stella's, who took up smoking as a way to protest her overbearing father. The smoking eventually killed Gwen, as she succumbed to lung cancer in her 40s, bringing her to Stella's spacetime-defying boat in the shape of a deer.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4550291-ss_a751970e68bc928538fbc4f52d6090c6ff1d8974.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550291" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4550291-ss_a751970e68bc928538fbc4f52d6090c6ff1d8974.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550291"></a><figcaption>Atul presents himself as an outgoing fellow eager to help, but beneath that layer, he's more complicated.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4550291-ss_a751970e68bc928538fbc4f52d6090c6ff1d8974.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Atul, presented as a large, jovial frog on the ferry, was, in life, a builder and a union leader. In the game, Atul is always enthused to help Stella improve her boat, but as you get to know him, you realize he has a sadness about him that he keeps from the world. On Earth, Stella knew Atul as her uncle, who disappeared back home while she was traveling abroad in her 20s. Some interpret Atul's story to end in suicide, and when he similarly disappears from the boat one day, not allowing Stella to ferry him to the Everdoor herself, this tragic, abrupt ending is reflected in purgatory.</p><p dir="ltr">One of my favorites of all passengers is Giovanni, a complicated, self-obsessed man (made into a lion on the boat) who fought in World War II during his time on Earth. In life, Giovanni loved Astrid, a woman who also appears as a lion during the game, but it's said that the two had a tumultuous relationship, partly due to Giovanni cheating on Astrid during their time together following the war.</p><p dir="ltr">Every character in the game's long line of passengers is written this way; they made mistakes, they acted out of feelings like spite or impulse. Sometimes they did bad things for regrettable reasons. Some of them inflicted pain not just on themselves but on others, like Bruce and Mickey, brothers who were injured when Mickey was drunk-driving--an event that long preceded their reunion on the ferry. Stella becomes a mediator between the two, helping Bruce forgive his brother so he can find peace. Others seem tragically innocent, like Stanley, a boy who died of a terminal illness at a very young age, or Alice, an elderly woman expressing on the ferry the same dementia she suffered in life. In these instances, Stella's task becomes less about forgiving them for their mistakes or helping them forgive themselves, and more about comforting them in their final moments.</p><p dir="ltr">But the universal truth of all the passengers is their need for love and understanding, which Stella never withholds from them. The last thing virtually all of them experience before swimming into the warm light of the Everdoor is an affectionate hug from Stella, a mechanic that actually has a dedicated button in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Expressions of love can take different forms. For some, it's a hug when you're feeling blue or scared. For others, it's taking the right tact when a loved one's lucidity is slipping. For Stella's passenger, Buck, love looks like buying into his fantasy role-playing obsession, yes-anding his live-action role-playing like a method actor. Bedside manner is something Stella had to learn in her life as a hospice nurse, and this quality makes her a wonderful candidate for the game's titular role, too. She cares for everyone on the ferry, meeting each of them where they are; their flaws don't scare her away, and their wrongdoings don't cause her to shun or judge them. She understands she is there to bring them kindness through closure, and she is past the point of judging people for their mistakes or hardships. It's something I'm striving to achieve in my own life.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1845715894" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

content!</p></div><p dir="ltr">When I moved 3,000 miles away from my parents and siblings to start my own family, it was very hard at first, then I sort of got used to it. Days come and go, and life has a way of getting in the way of letting you slow down to take inventory of what you should maybe be doing with your time. But now, with my third kid on the way and the health of a loved one deteriorating, I find myself stuck on the feelings that Spiritfarer so often grapples with. When we're staring down the inevitable loss of someone we love, it's easier to crystallize what it is we wish we had been saying for years before. Suddenly, the words can be found, after years of biting our tongues, failing to make amends. If you've not lived far away from your family before, you may not know the unique sadness you feel when you notice your parents have visibly aged between FaceTime calls with their grandkids, or when it seems like they're noticing the same about you or your kids.</p><p dir="ltr">In Spiritfarer, we see this occur a lot; characters like Giovanni, Astrid, Summer, Gwen, and Stella's sister, Lily, all get their time alone with Stella, to say what they need to say, either to Stella specifically or just to say it out loud, knowing Stella is there to listen with love and understanding. For them, it's now or never. The Everdoor awaits, and what they need to say will be said. I think what Spiritfarer taught me is that, however helpful it may be to find that closure at the very end of a life, it's going to be even more comforting and meaningful if you can find it sooner. I don't want to wait until I or my loved ones are on the ferry.</p><p dir="ltr">I felt close to a certain loved one for most of my life, but for many reasons--geographical, political, personal, and surely others I'm not exactly cognizant of--it feels like we've drifted apart in recent years. They don't have a terminal illness, but their life has been a series of hardships, and it's taking its toll on them physically and mentally. I think I'll lose them soon. They wear a sadness about them, a gloom that intensified when their mother died half a decade ago and has exacerbated personal issues they've had their entire life. Seeing how their mother's death affected them has further led me to wonder what I can do better about my relationship with them while they're still here.</p><p dir="ltr">I don't believe in an afterlife, and I don't believe in souls. To me, these remaining years are all I'll get with them. There is no purgatorial safe space for us to hash it out later. There's only here and now, so I have only now to forgive them and make our time together more meaningful. To the extent I've found any value in religious writings, I point to Thich Nhất Hạnh. The late Zen Buddhist monk is someone I read and re-read often. I wouldn't be surprised if the philosopher also inspired someone at Thunder Lotus when the team was designing their unique take on Greek myth and Charon's role in ferrying souls down the River Styx. Nhất Hạnh practiced a radical kind of forgiveness, believing that when "someone makes you suffer, it is because he suffers deeply within himself, and his suffering is spilling over. He does not need punishment; he needs help. That's the message he is sending." Though I don't know if the game's writers would endorse that view, I see a lot of his teachings inside Spiritfarer.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4550296-ss_3ea9b42a39a6a5652b6df197ada7ac0a03f47661.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550296" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4550296-ss_3ea9b42a39a6a5652b6df197ada7ac0a03f47661.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550296"></a><figcaption>Stella, along with her cat Daffodil, is willing to help whomever comes aboard her boat.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4550296-ss_3ea9b42a39a6a5652b6df197ada7ac0a03f47661.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When Giovanni was self-absorbed, or Bruce and Mickey were straight-up jerks, or Alice was frustratingly slow to speak or make sense, Stella didn't take offense. She didn't overreact. She saw that their lives to that point made them that way, and it didn't make sense to hold it against them. Instead, she accepted them, cared for them, and helped them pass on. Even now, as I try to repair my once-close relationship with this person in my life, I'll tell you that they are incredibly frustrating at times, but lately I find myself feeling like Stella more and more, and I think it's only a healthy thing for me. I don't want things to feel strained, or forced, or awkward. I don't want to hold this person's past wrongs against them if I can instead find a way to forgive them. I don't want to be angry about their flaws if I can instead understand that they need help, and maybe one form of help is an almost radical forgiveness. I can look inside their heart and see goodness, and when that goodness is veiled by their personal demons, I don't let it change who they are to me.</p><p dir="ltr">Stella was well-practiced at being there for people who needed her due to her years working in a hospice. But we don't have to wait until someone is receiving end-of-life care to let our guard down. Eulogies often exaggerate the good parts of a person and overlook the bad parts, memorializing by way of sugarcoating. I think what I find so refreshing and important about Spiritfarer is that it doesn't do this. It shows you flawed people and tells you they deserve love all the same. Whatever someone has gone through, and however those experiences have shaped them, the best thing we can do is be there for them.</p>

            <p>Developer Herobeat has announced its next game, Rewilders: The Lost Spring, which has been inspired by the works of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli films.</p>
<p>The developer is known for its debut game Endling - Extinction is Forever, which was released back in 2022 and went on to score itself not only a BAFTA win, but a nomination at the Game Awards as well. Rewilders: The Lost Spring is a follow up to Endling - Extinction is Forever, though not a sequel. That said, the developer has promised "echoes" of its predecessor's storytelling, as well as its aesthetics and score.</p>

		<p>Herobeat, the studio behind Endling: Extinction is Forever, has revealed its brand new game with the title of it being Rewilders: The Lost Spring. Rewilders: The Lost Spring is an open world roguelike that also incorporates creature collection, and it is set in a time where the world’s surface is too poisonous for people to live on. Players take on the role of Abi who descends to the world to find her family, and restore the world to a more healthy state.</p>

<p>The gameplay of Rewilders: The Lost Spring will see Abi split her time between her airship above the clouds, and the poisoned surface below. The airship acts as a laboratory where Abi can unlock new abilities and upgrades to help in fights and traverse the world. The upgrades include access gliders and grappling hooks. As Abi makes progress she can rewild the world and restore the different biomes that make up the world.</p>
<p>The creature collection part of Rewilders: The Lost Spring refers to Abi finding the native creatures known as Hantu, each of which has its own abilities. Together with Abi they can restore the world and face off against the dangers that have made the poisonous world home. As you restore the world, you will have a choice to make on whether you restore the world to its former glory or choose to let it continue down a darker path.</p>

<p>Rewilders: The Lost Spring does not yet have a release date but is available to wishlist on Steam.</p>

			<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet developer Racoon Logic Studios has just released a new update and a new demo for its sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/journey-to-the-savage-planet/">2020's Journey to the Savage Planet</a>. The demo is only available on PC, but the update is on all platforms, adding a new photo mode, new habitat customization features, and on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, a new Performance graphics mode that gets the framerate up to 60 FPS.</p>



<p>The news also came with a new trailer, showcasing the features of its fairly extensive photo mode, which lets you make several edits and changes, even add in some of the creatures you'll study and capture over the course of the game's campaign.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regarding the demo, it'll showcase Revenge of the Savage Planet in two parts. The first, which is available now, is just the first hour of the game, giving you a chance to get acquainted with the game's setting and tone in those opening moments.</p>



<p>The second, which will be made available at a later date, is a custom abilities mode, which will let you experience how the game feels when your character is upgraded and kitted out with more gear and tools. It'll also be playable in co-op, which can be a key element to having as much fun as possible in Revenge of the Savage Planet.</p>



<p>For the new habitat features, 40 new objects have been added to the game for players to customize their homes with.</p>

<p>"<em>We know that money is tight. We feel you. So if you’re not 100% certain you’ll enjoy our game, here’s a free demo</em>," said Racoon Logic Studios creative director, Alex Hutchinson, in a press release.</p>



<p>"<em>Try it. We think you’ll like it. We worked on it for 4 years and now it’s the price of two expensive coffees. You’ll play the tutorial and then maybe fool around with a bunch of late game abilities. Give it a shot. Please?</em>"</p>



<p>If you enjoyed the first game, and have yet to check out Revenge of the Savage Planet, it's worth giving the demo a chance. When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">I reviewed it for Wccftech earlier this year, I wrote</a>, "<em>Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with a layer of environmental systems that do work well together, once you have the upgrades to manipulate and use them all. It thrives mostly due to the charm, care, and whimsy pumped into its design and nearly every aspect, but it lacks any narrative chops to push it further.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has released a new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042&nbsp;</em>update in preparation for the release of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>later this year, and it's packed with stuff, including a new map, new weapons, and more.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1957412193198100646" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media post</a>, this latest&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042&nbsp;</em>update is intended to be one of the first steps on "the road to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>", which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe" rel="nofollow">due to launch in October</a>&nbsp;(and which, mercifully enough, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-no-80-pricing" rel="nofollow">won't cost you $80</a>).</p>

<p>The first big thing you're getting in this update is a new map in the form of Iwo Jima, which was, as EA says, "a fan favorite previously seen in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 1942</em>,&nbsp;<em>1943</em>, and&nbsp;<em>V</em>".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-2042-update-iwo-jima.jpg?itok=9n-zLMWZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-2042-update-iwo-jima.jpg?itok=hU59xsQr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Battlefield 2042</em>'s latest update is bringing a brand new map, plus more.</figcaption></figure><p>The new version of the map is a "reimagined" space that EA says will "give you plenty of options to flex your tactical muscles", and it comes complete with an "active volcano" that you'll have to watch out for as well.</p>

<p>As well as Iwo Jima, you can also look forward to two new weapons in the form of the KFS2000 assault rifle and the Lynx sniper rifle.</p>

<p>The former is a "highly accurate" rifle that's also easy to control, and the latter is a "vicious semi-automatic anti-material rifle" that will be given to players who joined&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s open beta. If you didn't, however, you'll still get a chance to get this weapon "later down the line".</p>

<p>Two new vehicles are also being added: the A10 Warthog and the SU-25TM Frogfoot, both of which are attack jets that will be available in All-Out Warfare. They'll join a free battle pass that comes complete with 60 tiers of cosmetics to earn.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-2042-update-a10-warthog.jpg?itok=0DNJpXCB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-2042-update-a10-warthog.jpg?itok=QxiMk7zV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Battlefield 2042</em>'s Warthog is very different to&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>'s.</figcaption></figure><p>Completing some of the new battle pass' tiers will also grant you access to exclusive&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>rewards, so if you're intending to play the new game, it's worth dipping back into&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>&nbsp;to bolster your cosmetic haul.</p>

<p><em>Battlefield 2042&nbsp;</em>is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1517290/Battlefield_2042/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/battlefield-2042/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/battlefield-2042-xbox-series-xs/9p0t51bddwvt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>, meanwhile, is due for launch across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807960/Battlefield_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/battlefield-6/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/battlefield-6-standard-edition/9pjxv87jtsvq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 10th, and you can read our Erren's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/battlefield-6-multiplayer-preview-good-company" rel="nofollow">preview of it here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Battlefield 6 Open Beta has ended. For two weekends, hundreds of thousands of players went to war with each other. Now that the dust and rubble have settled, it’s time to see what the community has judged to be the best Battlefield 6 map—and worst.</p>



<p>Battlefield has had its fair share of classic maps over the years. Everyone always wants to see a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-battlefield-games-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ranking of the best Battlefield games</a>, but we recently went one better. We broke down our favorite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/9-best-battlefield-maps-of-all-time-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield maps</a>, giving high praise to Wake Island and Caspian Border. It’s time to see which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-the-battlefield-6-beta-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 beta</a> maps stood out.</p>



<h2 id="h-siege-of-cairo-leads-the-way-in-battlefield-6">Siege of Cairo Leads The Way in Battlefield 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A clear winner. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Yes, I’ll cut straight to the chase, Siege of Cairo has comfortably been voted as the favorite Battlefield 6 map.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Bulletin</a>, a poll was launched to find out the answer. It states that only roughly 10,000 votes were cast. Given that the Open Beta recorded well over 500,000 players, we get it’s a tiny percentage of the crowd. Still, it’s fun to analyze this portion of the data.</p>



<p>Out of Siege of Cairo, Liberation Peak, Empire State, and Iberian Offensive, Siege of Cairo came out on top with 47% of the vote. Liberation Peak was a distant second with 27%, Empire State recorded 16%, and Iberian Offensive only managed 11%.</p>



<p>These polls are always subjective, though. Personally, I loved Iberian Offensive. I wouldn’t have had it last (maybe Liberation Peak). </p>



<div><article><p><span>According to a community’s poll with over 10,000 votes via </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Battlefield</a><span>, Siege of Cairo is the most favourite map from </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Battlefield6</a><span>‘s Open Beta whereas Iberian Offensive is the less, favourite map.</span></p></article></div>



<p>But this is the time to tell us what you think. Do you agree with Siege of Cairo being number one? Or is it ranked too highly? Head to the comments to let us know. Plus, go to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> to talk all things Battlefield 6.</p>

<figure><a title="Drag x Drive" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/28109af8836b2/drag-x-drive.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Nintendo first-party releases keep coming, and the first of two for August has wheeled onto the Switch 2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> has been out for a few days now, and it has proven to be a divisive one.</p>
<p>Pairing up wheelchair basketball with the Joy-Con 2's Mouse Mode, we actually had a fairly good time with Drag x Drive, with the wonderful PJ <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">scoring the game a 7/10</a>. The core gameplay? Good, and surprisingly deep. But outside of online matches and a few minigames... there's not much in the package. But it's on the cheaper side, at least.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186124 @ 1755521429 -->
<p>At the time of writing, the game is currently on a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/drag-x-drive/">62 Metascore, which is "Mixed or Average"</a>. So it seems like this one might have missed the basket for many.</p>
<p>We know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree's Switch 2 Edition</a> are still relatively fresh, and we still have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>'s big Switch 2 upgrade to come, but we imagine some of you have been shooting hoops with friends. So we want to know what you think of the game.</p>
<p>You can score Drag x Drive between 1-10 here or on the game page whenever you fancy; if you've spent lots of time with it at the weekend, you're probably ready, but need more time on the court? That's okay too, come back later.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Marvelous has announced that&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>has reached a major sales milestone across all platforms worldwide.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000002093.000016719.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> (which is in Japanese, so we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>sales have managed to hit 500,000 around the world. As a reminder, the game was released on June 5th, having been delayed slightly from its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date" rel="nofollow">originally-intended May 30th date</a>.</p>

<p><em>Guardians of Azuma</em>'s sales numbers aren't too shabby when considering that the game, which belongs to a reasonably niche genre in the first place, is only available on PC and Nintendo's Switch family of consoles; at time of writing, there's no PS5 or Xbox Series X|S version of the farming RPG.</p>

<p>While the game is the latest&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>title, it's technically a spinoff, with&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory 6&nbsp;</em>still yet to be officially announced. For now, though, this is all the&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>you're getting.</p>

<p>The game revolves around one of two protagonists, Kaguya and Subaru, between whom you can choose at the outset of your playthrough. They must restore balance to the titular land of Azuma by befriending its spirits and uncovering the mysteries of the Celestial Collapse.</p>

<p>This being a farming sim-RPG hybrid, you can expect all the usual activities in your journey; growing crops, befriending NPCs, and crafting, as well as battling monsters and exploring the world around you.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokemon TCG Pocket Mega Evolution Confirmed for Fall]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-evolution-fall</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-evolution-confirmed-for-fall.1272552/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is getting Mega Evolutions this fall, and there are some pretty powerful mechanics attached to them as well.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/mega-evolved-pokemon-arrive-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-this-fall" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>website, Mega-Evolved Pokemon will be arriving later this year, although we don't have a more specific release date. Presumably, we'll be seeing them in the game somewhere between September and December.</p>

<p>As well as new Pokemon cards, you can also expect new "Mega Evolution ex rules" to make their way into the digital card game, and you'll need to be careful with the way you use your Mega-Evolved Pokemon, because a slip-up could easily cost you a game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-evolution-fall-blaziken.jpg?itok=ADCmP6WI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-evolution-fall-blaziken.jpg?itok=JCgaErsD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Mega Evolution is coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>this year.</figcaption></figure><p>A quick look at some of the Mega Evolution cards announced thus far reveals that if a Mega-Evolved Pokemon is knocked out, the opposing player earns themselves three points.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the first player to reach three points wins the match, so that means that knocking out an opponent's Mega Evolution ex card is essentially a guaranteed victory.</p>

<p>To compensate for that kind of power, though, the Mega-Evolved Pokemon in question will have higher HP totals than your average 'mon, and they'll have access to some pretty powerful attacks as well. It's very much a high-risk, high-reward strategy.</p>

<p>It's not clear yet whether Mega Evolution will arrive alongside a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow">major expansion</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove" rel="nofollow">smaller booster set</a>, or just as its own update, but given that it's bringing specific new cards with it, I think the first option in that list is a safe bet.</p>




<p>News of Mega Evolution in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>comes just a few weeks after accusations of plagiarism saw in-game art of Gen 2 legendaries Ho-Oh and Lugia <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-production-issue-plagiarism" rel="nofollow">removed from the game</a>, with placeholder art being added while permanent replacements were sought.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>. Mega Evolution arrives this fall.</p>

            <p>Cult hit Euro Truck Simulator 2 is seemingly coming to PS5 and Xbox consoles. The news comes via PSN and Xbox store listings for the game, which is yet to be officially announced for the two consoles.</p>

SCS SOFTWARE had a big hit with Euro Truck Simulator 2 on PC, which as of 2024 had sold<a href="https://www.scssoft.com/press/"> in excess of 15 million copies</a>.</p>
