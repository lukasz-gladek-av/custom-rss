Joined by an AI companion and his dim-witted robot assistant Ody-6, Alex sets off on a journey where every fight is a desperate battle against the unknown—and doom itself. The ship is a war zone. You may be outnumbered, but you are not outmatched.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Moros Protocol</em> is a relentless, fast-paced shooter where survival means adapting – or being consumed. To thrive against the monstrous hordes, players will need to dynamically adapt their loadout and strategy with each run.</p><p>Looking for a frantic, high-mobility approach to your enemies? Fill up your loadout with SMGs or pistols, augmented for speed and increased damage while moving—perfect for laying down a barrage of bullets on the go. Or for a slower, more methodical approach, put together a sniping build that focuses on powerful, precise shots that can take down enemies in a single hit.</p><p>Whichever you choose, your skills will grow during each run through thanks to <em>Moros Protocol</em>’s evolving combat system. Throughout your run you will find augments tailored to improve your skills in a specific playstyle. Find an augment that boosts your run and gun capabilities? Change up your loadout for a shotgun and let it rip!</p><p>Plot your own route through each run, with every branching path offering different risks. Do you want to play it safe, or face greater danger in pursuit of even greater rewards? Are you looking for a guaranteed new weapon, or a vendor to upgrade your skills? Choose wisely as you make your way towards your goal.</p><p>Beware, as death is around every corner in <em>Moros Protocol</em>—but death is not the end!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Although Ubisoft has yet to formally confirm a new Ghost Recon game is on the way, in a recent shareholder Q&amp;A, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot and CFO Frederick Duguet talked openly about the upcoming sequel.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisofts-ceo-has-let-slip-that-a-new-ghost-recon-is-coming/">VGC</a>, Dugent revealed that the recent investment from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/charlie-guillemot-follows-father-as-co-ceo-of-ubisofts-new-tencent-funded-subsidiary-nepotism-claims-addressed">subsidiary for which will be lead by Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot as co-CEOs</a> - will be used to develop "other major brand names", with Ghost Recon being "just one example for our first-person-shooter-type games".</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the meeting, CEO Guillemot said: "In addition to the [Rainbow Six] game that I just mentioned, our objective is to also make strong progress in the growing market, generally speaking, by continuing to enhance our current experiences that we offer – and capitalising on upcoming launches, such as The Division and Ghost Recon."</p>
<p>Given we haven't had a Ghost Recon game since 2019 (I had a bad time with the last one, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-breakpoint-review-a-limp-and-lifeless-spin-on-the-ubisoft-formula">slapping it with Avoid</a>, calling it "a limp and lifeless spin on the Ubisoft formula"), for Guillemot to use the words "current experiences" and "upcoming launches" in relation to a franchise that hasn't seen a new game for six years suggests a new Ghost Recon installment is on the way.</p>
<p>Yesterday we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-own-shareholders-demand-response-to-the-stop-killing-games-consumer-movement">Ubisoft's own shareholders directly challenged the publisher</a> to respond to the huge swell of support behind Stop Killing Games – a consumer movement generated by Ubisoft's decision to take <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">The Crew offline last year</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suggests-to-shareholders-a-new-ghost-recon-game-is-on-the-way-even-though-theres-been-no-public-announcement-yet]]></content:encoded>

<p>In our part of the world it’s summertime and the Switchin' is easy. Most of us at NL (and I imagine many of you) are sitting back with Mr. D Kong this weekend, enjoying his first 3D platformer since the 64-bit days, possibly while supping a delicious summer beverage from a coconut. Smashing.</p>
<p>And if not? Well, perhaps perusing our monthly letters page will take your mind off <em>not</em> playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">DKB</a>. Got something you want to get off your chest? We're ready and waiting to read about your game-related ponderings.</p>
<p>Each month we’ll highlight a Star Letter, the writer of which will receive a month’s subscription to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/site-news-love-what-we-do-become-a-nintendo-life-supporter">our ad-free Supporter scheme</a>. Check out the submission guidelines at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>So, grab your drinks with jaunty cocktail umbrellas and let's have a rummage...</p>
<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox - July 2025</h2>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 eShop" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8b91790df63bd/switch-2-eshop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h3>"somewhat sour taste" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In the first place I would like to thank you for being my main source of Nintendo news for over a decade now. I continue to enjoy visiting your website daily and the wholesome community you have built.</p>
<p>What makes me less happy, to my surprise, is the way the online discourse surrounding the Switch 2 can get to me. I try to tell myself to ignore it and just enjoy whatever Nintendo is cooking. But despite my efforts, I'm still left with a somewhat sour taste in my mouth. Normally, I'm a glass half full kind of guy (I loved Pokemon Scarlet despite its flaws) and trolls, attention seekers and mis/disinformation doesn't really faze me, but now, with the launch of a new system from my favorite publisher, I can't help but feel less enthusiastic and even kind of worried about the Switch 2's future.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>I can't help but wonder if these feelings are grounded in reality or fed by online "haters". Take Mario Kart World for example, while I have had a great time so far (managed to get 3 stars on every Grand Prix and Knockout Tour), I also feel kind of underwhelmed with it all; free roam in particular has left me hoping it had more, especially with an €80 price tag. Still, would I have felt the same way if the general online opinion (within my bubble) was overwhelmingly positive?</p>
<p>So my question to you guys is: In what way has the negativity surrounding Switch 2's launch, pricing, Game Key Cards, screen, battery life, etc. affected your enjoyment of the new system and its games? How do you seperate your personal experiences from those of others and not let it get tainted? Are you in any way worried about its future?</p>
<p>PS: I was incredibly relieved with the quality of the Donkey Kong Bananza Direct and the positive reception thereof. I desperately needed some uplifting energy.<br>
<strong>Jolteon23</strong></p>

<p>Ah, the 'discourse'. It's definitely tough when you're in the weeds, reading all the feeds to get a temperature check, looking for nuance but getting only gurning YouTuber thumbnails proclaiming that [insert popular game] is a crime against humanity, [insert new console] is a scam, [insert anything you quite enjoy] is total trash, and so on.</p>
<p>Jokes and depression at the state of bad-take culture aside, there are absolutely valid criticisms to be made of Switch 2, and outlets (and individuals) with remits to focus on very specific areas — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/one-of-the-slowest-modern-lcds-ive-ever-seen-digital-foundrys-john-linneman-on-switch-2s-display">tech analysis</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/ifixit-performs-a-full-teardown-of-nintendos-ps-poor-pro-controller">repairability</a>, for instance — should <em>not</em> be lumped in with vocal grifters stirring up controversy and weaponising followers because outrage is their business model. Refuse to engage with that rubbish and you'll feel better about, well, everything!</p>
<p>As for the future, as ever, it's all about the games. How to innovate with an extremely familiar hardware platform is Nintendo's main challenge this gen. The system is solid but it's lacking in novelty, so the software needs to pick up that slack. And from that perspective, Nintendo's future is looking very bright; this firm has been pumping out genre-definers for nearly half a century, with a batting average so far beyond the competition it's mind-boggling. Squeezing new ideas from old tech is a Nintendo speciality. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"Orbulon's Oinker"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>While I like the variety of characters in Mario Kart World, I wish Nintendo included some characters from the Wario games. Characters like Ashley, Captain Syrup, Penny, or Mona would add more female variety. Dribble drives a taxi on a regular basis. He would be perfect for Mario Kart. Orbulon's Oinker would be a cool idea for a kart. I'm hoping that some Wario Land or WarioWare characters might appear as DLC. They need more recognition.<br>
<strong><em>SadGarlic Pizza</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. I agree. No notes. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"sassy sauce machine"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>So the Switch 2 is finally here, performing for you — at faster speeds than most expected, too. It’s a slick, safe, interactive upgrade, whose main surprises were the mouse controls and the remarkably beefy specs. (4K, 120fps and HDR are words I never associated with The House of Mario.)</p>
<p>My question is: when are Ninty gonna get their freak on? And don’t you tell me they ain’t got no more freak left to give. You know Nintendo ALWAYS got freak in the closet.</p>
<p>True, we no longer have the Everybody Votes Channel or Mooverse (that was a typo but I shall leave unchanged in the hope that Nintendo reads this and decides that if Cow can be a core character in Mario Kart then an entire social media service based around bodacious bovines is exactly what would ‘surprise and delight’ the world right now) but that didn’t stop Nintendo last gen.</p>
<p>We all thought they’d dialled down their freak with Switch 1 because it wasn’t built directly into the system, but then they dropped LABO and instead it turns out you build the system into _it_. The console is just one constituent of a cardboard whole.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>So what’s it gonna be this time? How is Nintendo going to take the Switch 2 from being a safe, predictable upgrade and turn it into a sassy sauce machine with some completely whacko, off-the-wall idea?</p>
<p>My not so outlandish prediction would be some of fitness product that combines ‘Joy-Con as pedometers’ with a phone app that can track where you are, resulting in a something that’s a little bit Strava, a little bit Street Pass, and a little bit Pokemon Go.</p>
<p>My more outlandish prediction would be a successor to Wii Music in which various instruments are cobbled together from common household items + a Joy Con: sounds are produced by HD Rumble 2, but amplified and augmented by the objects themselves (for example, imagine sticking a bunch of discarded loo roll tubes together to great a weird Joy-Con powered oboe or didgeridoo). You could write music in-game using a Mario Paint style interface then have your instruments perform it as you conducted (with a Joy-Con, naturally) like Link in the Wind Waker. There would be built-in lessons teaching you about composition, music theory and music history, much like how Art Atelier taught you painting and Game Maker Garage taught you programming.</p>
<p>Anyway, those are my ideas. What are your wild fantasies for Nintendo’s upcoming freaky project this gen?<br>
<strong><em>Maxz</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm assuming everyone here tried reading Maxz's second line DK Rap-style...and then went, <em>'Hang on, "the remarkably beefy specs" doesn't scan at all, let alone rhyme with "upgrade"!'</em></p>
<p>The return of Channels, huh? I could get into it. A successor to Wii Music?... Hmm, maybe I've still got time to pivot and work on my gurning thumbnail face.</p>
<p>Personally, I'd keep my eye on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/miyamoto-shares-why-doll-company-exec-was-chosen-for-outside-director">newly-appointed outside director Kazuhiko Hachiya</a> if you're into "unconventional" Nintendo stuff. They haven't brought him into the fold for nothing. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"area code"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Nintendolife Team,</p>
<p>I am hoping you can investigate something in relation to the Switch 2 GameChat functionality that is affecting every Switch 2 owner here in the Isle of Man.</p>
<p>Having purchased a Nintendo Switch 2 and began setting it up. I have started the set up for GameChat.<br>
When it brings me to the Phone Number Verification Required screen.<br>
I use the QR code and where I am asked to enter my phone number.</p>
<p>I live in the Isle of Man, part of the United Kingdom. Our mobile phone numbers all start +44 (0) 7624<br>
I entered my phone number. I selected United Kingdom (as there is no Isle of Man in the selection dropdown). This gave the correct area code of +44. I then entered my mobile phone number which starts 07624.<br>
I pressed Submit and immediately got an error message stating “The phone number you entered cannot be registered”</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>A few friends also living in the Isle of Man have also tried to set up GameChat on their Switch 2 consoles and they get the same response.</p>
<p>Please do not tell us that as we live in the Isle of Man that we cannot use GameChat on our new Switch 2. Especially as this is a key function.</p>
<p>I truly hope this is just an oversight for all the Nintendo Switch 2 owners in the Isle of Man</p>
<p>Any help you can give us Isle of Man Switch 2 owners in helping us get an answer would be very much appreciated.</p>
<p>Enough of my waffling, thank you.<br>
<strong><em>Andrew Reed (aka Laxeybobby)</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I reached out to Nintendo UK and they're investigating - I'll let you know as and when I hear back.</p>
<p><em>Note. I've been in touch with Andrew, who managed to find a workaround using a family member's UK mainland number to verify GameChat before removing that number from the account. Not something you should have to do, but apparently that works.</em></p>
<p>If anyone from the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands has run into this problem, let us know in the comments. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"recent deductions"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>With all the recent deductions about game key cards and digital games, I am increasingly feeling there should be a different definition between gamer and game collector like they are 2 different hobbies. There are so many comments saying 'if it's not physical I won't buy it' to me these aren't gamers who want to play and enjoy a game but are only interested in collecting, value and ownership of games. I love gaming and have done so for over 40 years, but I love it for the playing and enjoying of the games in the moment not owning something to put on a shelf and pretend I'm into conservation.<strong><br>
Dgb</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Each to their own. I understand the attraction of building a collection and I still buy physical media, but I don't have the room to store it these days, and I went all-digital on Switch.</p>
<p>If someone enjoys the process of building a library, cataloguing their collection, and just <em>having</em> the stuff more than using it...hey, as long as they're happy and not getting ALL CAPS in my DMs, crack on. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"one person"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, so I might seem a little crazy, but I can't help but notice ever since the Switch 2 launched, reviews have gone from saying something like "We thought that..." as "I thought that..." and so on. Is this intentional, referring to something the entire site would look at as something just that one person would feel? Or has the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 forced everyone to split up to cover more ground, and that's why? I'm not trying to criticize anyone for making this change, it honestly makes a lot of sense. I'm just curious.<strong><br>

<p>I enjoy the idea that we <em>all</em>, every one of us on staff, have the infinite time and funds to play <em>every</em> video game we cover before (presumably) channelling our thoughts through the hive mind into a single, collective piece of text. Unfortunately, Jean-Luc and his Enterprise cronies destroyed our sexy, slimy queen and individuality has spread like a virus through the team...</p>
<p>Yes, you may have noticed that we've retired the 'we' in our reviews! Hopefully, it feels a bit more personable, less Borg-y, and reminds people that they're written by actual, real-life human units. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<p>Not as much as we would like to, mainly due to different time zones and family stuff, which makes scheduling a real 'mare. We recently created a GameChat Slack channel, though, so we're hoping to make it a regular thing. <em>- Ed.</em><em><br></em></p>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above).

<figure><a title="WaterField Designs Magnetic Case - front" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/375be35f2437d/waterfield-designs-magnetic-case-front.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sasha Stowe</em></figcaption></figure><blockquote>
<p><em>"It’s what Indiana Jones would carry his Switch 2 around in."</em> - <strong>Jim Norman, 2025</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He’s not wrong, though. The Magnetic Case for the Switch 2 from WaterField Designs looks like something straight out of <strong>Raider of the Lost Ark</strong>. It’s a simple, but effortlessly timeless-looking design, and should anyone see you out and about with it, we doubt they’d ever assume you were going to be spending your lunch hour shooting chromed-up Cyberpsychos on the streets of Night City.</p>
<p>This case is about as basic as it gets in many ways, not least of which is the mechanism that allows you to crack open the sweet, creamy yolk (read: Nintendo Switch 2 console) within.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, there are no zips, no clasps, nothing here. To open it, you simply pull it apart with some force. Not <em>loads</em>, but also not so little that it’s going to be spilling your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_white">albumen</a> (read: Joy-Con 2 controller) onto the pavement of Piccadilly Square.</p>
<p>And once you do pull it apart, you’ll be met with a whole lot of nothing, if I’m honest. Just an opening for a pouch that holds the console in place, and two soft pads that help cushion the console and provide an extra bit of support. Those pads are not just pads though, they’re also small pockets that you can slip whatever you want into, although we would recommend you only store slim, non-bulky items to prevent putting undue pressure points on your console.</p>

<p>That is all this case has to offer, but frankly, for me, that’s all it needs. It’s a gorgeous, all-leather sleeper case that betrays nothing of what’s inside, and the magnetic sealing mechanism is <em>just</em> perfectly balanced to keep things secure, but easy to access.</p>
<p>I’m not one for packing masses and masses if I can avoid it, and this case does everything I need it to. I’m using every feature that it offers, and I don’t need anything more. If you wanted more, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mini-review-waterfield-designs-cityslicker-for-switch-2-a-classic-design-lives-on">WaterField also do the CitySlicker for the Switch 2 as well</a>, which could be more what you’re after.</p>
<p>If leather’s not your bag (ha) for whatever reason, you can also get this case in waxed canvas and ballistic nylon. Not as pretty or hardwearing in my eyes, but it’s always great to see animal product-free options available. You’ll even save a few quid, too ($89 compared to $119 for the leather ones).</p>



<p><em>Waterfield's Magnetic Case for Switch 2 is priced at $119 and produced in batches that <a href="https://www.sfbags.com/products/magnetic-case-for-nintendo-switch">you can pre-order from their website</a>. The sample used in this review was provided by the manufacturer.</em></p>

<p>Last week, we looked at Disney's Magical Quest 3 Starring Mickey and Donald on the GBA, and it was a surprisingly close battle. In the end, Japan won with 42% of the vote. Europe came in second place with 30%, and North America bagged 27%.</p>
<p>This time, we're going back to the SNES to check out a rather deep cut: <strong>Weaponlord</strong>. Developed by Visual Concepts and published by Namco in 1995, it was a fighting game that received fairly mixed reception. It never received a sequel, though many believe that its mechanics would go on to inform the <strong>Soul Blade / SoulCalibur</strong> franchises.</p><div><figure data-videoid="23DYpTkUosk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f63esqxjvn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23DYpTkUosk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It's another duel this week as North America and Europe go head-to-head. So let's get to it.</p>
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Weaponlord - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b5f4ce8901e49/weaponlord-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6056-weaponlord">Namco / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>With a large, imposing logo taking centre stage and an even larger and imposing character in the background (with a second kinda covered up by the logo), the North American design is pretty badass, indeed. We love the art style too – very '90s. In fact, we're kinda puzzled as to why it didn't sell so well with such a cool cover.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Weaponlord - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/66d18d6371458/weaponlord-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6056-weaponlord">Namco / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is uhhh... different? Really nice use of colour on this one, actually. It stands out a lot. Though the decision to not feature any characters is admittedly a bit of an odd one. When it comes to movies and games, faces sell. There are no faces here. Unless you count the scary skull in the middle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In their <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2jOPqNEzotGX0odqDUt5jr/57f0ba952c3be14b38ba97a02b17c119/Ent_AGM_2025.07.10_URD_GB_Interactif_def.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual financial report</a>, Ubisoft made a statement that no doubt already has many gamers riled up. On page 10, while discussing the Group's Business Model and Strategy, they go out on a limb to say that microtransactions make premium games more fun.</p>



<p><em>The adoption of monetization and engagement policies that respect the player experience and are sustainable in the long term. At Ubisoft, the golden rule when developing premium games is to allow players to enjoy the game in full without having to spend more. Our monetization offer within premium games makes the player experience more fun by allowing them to personalize their avatars or progress more quickly, however this is always optional.</em></p>



<p>Most hardcore gamers are, however, fiercely opposed to this monetization practice. While microtransactions are understandable to an extent in the context of a free-to-play game that has to generate some revenue to keep the game running, the same cannot be said of a premium game, which by definition already has an intrinsic access cost for the consumer.</p>



<p>This is not at all a newly implemented practice by Ubisoft. The publisher first introduced microtransactions in their premium games with 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins. As they say in the quote above, they're entirely optional purchases that offer mostly cosmetics, like unique-looking mounts, armor, and weapons, as well as some powerful weapons with strong stats (but others just as powerful can be acquired simply by playing the games). They've been in practically every Ubisoft premium game released ever since, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin's Creed: Shadows</a>. Still, this statement, although clearly aimed at investors, will do nothing to improve the publisher's reputation among hardcore gamers. </p>



<p>In other Ubisoft news, we just <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-name-yves-guillemot-son-christophe-derennes-co-ceos-tencent-subsidiary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the recently established subsidiary (partially funded by Tencent) would be co-led by Yves Guillemot's son, Charlie Guillemot, and Christophe Derennes, the former head of the publisher's North American studios.</p>

</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Oblivion Remastered" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e357206c5fb75/oblivion-remastered.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bethesda, Virtuos</em></figcaption></figure><p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-port-specialist-believes-switch-2-can-surpass-its-predecessors-success">Switch port specialist Virtuos</a> – known within the Nintendo space for its work on games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/outer_worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> – has officially laid off 270 employees across its studios worldwide.</p>
<p>This is "approximately 7%" of the company's "global workforce", with 200 roles in Asia and 70 roles in Europe axed, "primarily in teams facing lower occupancy and slower demand due to structural shifts" in the game industry.</p>
<p>The latest update follows the surprise release of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/elder_scrolls_iv_oblivion_remastered">Oblivion Remastered</a> (<a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/05/xbox-tops-the-list-in-new-best-selling-games-roundup-for-the-us">which seemingly got off to a great start</a>) on other platforms earlier this year, and the company specifically notes how these layoffs include "fewer than 10 in France", where this core team is located.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/news/adapting-for-the-future-of-game-development/">blog on the Virtuos website</a> titled "Adapting For The Future Of Game Development", the company went into detail about how it intends to evolve and realign its structure to strengthen its "high-value co-development":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Virtuos is evolving to meet the changing needs of our partners and the industry. As game development grows increasingly complex, we are realigning our global footprint and capabilities to strengthen our offering in high-value co-development, ranging from full game engineering to advanced art, including creative content production and live services."</p>
<p>"...Over the past 12 months, Virtuos has deepened its commitment to premium co-development through key acquisitions of Beyond-FX, Pipeworks, and Umanaïa in North America, as well as Third Kind Games and Abstraction in Europe. These studios enhance our strengths in VFX, design, Unreal Engine programming, and creative development. This ongoing investment reflects our intent to grow in areas where our expertise and scale create lasting value, while selectively exiting service segments where demand is weakening. We need to better match the locations of our teams with those of our clients to support the increasingly iterative nature of creative co-development. This alignment is why the current reorganization has a greater impact on our teams in Asia."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Virtuos says it's "grateful for the contributions of those impacted" and will be providing separation packages along with career transition assistance, and opportunities for "redeployment" within its global network where possible.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's promised it remains "fully committed" to its partnerships, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/12/more-cyberpunk-2077-updates-could-be-coming-as-cdpr-enlists-outside-help-for-patch-2-2">including its "ongoing work"</a> on titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. This news follows Microsoft laying off over 9,000 employees earlier this month, including staff under the Xbox division.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/video-switch-2-vs-steam-deck-system-face-off-digital-foundry-investigates</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Digital Foundry has returned with a new "system face-off" video – this time putting Nintendo's hybrid hardware, the Switch 2, up against Valve's PC handheld, the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>In the video above, you can see how the Switch 2 holds up against the Steam Deck OLED model across various "head-to-head" match-ups, including battery life, form factor, controller design, as well as OS and software availability.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry's Oliver Mackenzie acknowledges how there are some obvious similarities, but also notes how these are two very different systems at the end of the day. Here are his closing thoughts, if you don't get the chance to watch the full video:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I think the Switch 2 is better as a console-like device than the Steam Deck is. It offers a streamlined, stress-free experience for playing controller-oriented games, the OS is rock solid, it docks perfectly, and it has great exclusive games - it's a more enjoyable, delightful machine to use moment to moment, if you want a slick gaming experience, it's hard to go wrong here, but it doesn't have the flexibility of a PC handheld, it can't access thousands upon thousands of PC games, you can't add special launch parameters, change up settings, swap refresh rates, or check out performance overlays, and you don't have the control options to make cursor oriented software work on the go. So, each machine has its strengths.</p>
<p>"The Switch 2 is a great machine to enjoy a game like Cyberpunk 2077 or exclusives like Mario Kart World or Fast Fusion, but a game like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy 14 benefits enormously from having trackpad input, and the deck can play a larger vaiety of software, including older games that will probably never get a Switch 2 release. It's kind of an intractable battle, a fight between a console and essentially a PC in a console suit. Personal preferences and priorities are going to dictate this one, but I think most gamers will find a lot to like in both devices."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/warframe-old-peace-world-war-one-interview-tennocon</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warframe-still-a-space-ninja-game-technically-is-now-drawing-inspiration-from-world-war-i.1248144/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Wait, so what kind of game is <em>Warframe</em>, exactly?” is a common refrain among people who don’t play <em>Warframe</em>, upon hearing someone try to explain <em>Warframe</em>. So here, let me help: The sci-fi space ninja shooter’s previous expansion took players to the year 1999, where – by <a href="https://aftermath.site/warframe-1999-romance-dating-tennocon-soulframe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dating a bunch of hot people</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtF6jiLxc88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">listening to boy band music</a> – they uncovered key revelations about the nature of the universe. How do you follow that? Easy: World War I-inspired anime fights.</p><p>This only makes slightly more sense in context than out of it, but the beauty of <em>Warframe </em>is that it is constantly, sometimes to its own detriment, trying shit. The end result is a broad emotional palette, a decade-running narrative that can detour into tongue-in-cheek ‘90s-stalgia before pivoting back into a tale of war, woe, and what happens when one group attempts to subjugate all others. The game’s next narrative quest expansion, <a href="https://www.warframe.com/news/tennocon-2025-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Old Peace</em></a> launches later this year and takes place during the war between the Orokin, the ancient civilization that set the game’s whole story into motion, and the Sentients, Orokin creations that ultimately turned on their masters after being thrust into the dangerous Tau system. The Tenno, Orokin child soldiers forced to psychically pilot flesh mechs (and <em>Warframe</em>’s player faction), end up stuck in the middle.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="TennoCon 2025 | The Old Peace | Official Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bfoypaVNGuU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Ultimately, <em>Warframe </em>will head to an entire new solar system – the aforementioned, long-whispered-about Tau – in 2026, but this quest sets the stage by letting players venture into Tau’s past.&nbsp;</p><p>“We're really going to lean into themes of true war, and that's the state you left this moon and Tau in,” creative director Rebb Ford told Aftermath. “That way, when you go back there, you'll recognize everything in the same way a battle of old would be recognized."&nbsp;</p><p>True to <em>Warframe</em>’s name, other narrative quests have already depicted the conflict that took place during that era; this one explores a brief, brittle period of peace. A demo, which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSqwET8-P-Q&amp;t=21575s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debuted today at TennoCon</a> in London, Ontario, shows one of the game’s lithe not-quite-cyborg ninjas sliding and soaring through trenches straight out of World War I as fire rains down. This turns out to be a training exercise between a Tenno and their Sentient schoolmate Adis, but the choice of imagery is no coincidence. World War I influences, creative director Rebb Ford told Aftermath, are more than skin deep.</p><p>“I’ve been kind of addicted to reading World War I novels,” she said. “[We’re going to explore] the idea that war happens so quickly when people make a decision that impacts the peace and armistice.”</p><p>As far as players understood previously, the Orokin and Sentinels fought bitterly, the Tennos turned the tide, and that was that. The idea that the two sides buried the hatchet, even briefly, is new to this expansion.</p><p>"I liken it to the moment in World War I where you have soldiers playing football on Christmas day across the trenches,” lead writer Adrian Bott told Aftermath. “That all-too-brief moment of commonality between enemies and recognizing something in one another – the idea of playing in this environment of trenches and devastation."</p><p>Of course, <em>The Old Peace</em> is not a 1:1 World War I story (space ninjas tend to get in the way of that), but the developers at Digital Extremes want players to recognize that every war past and present is a tragedy – specifically, a human one.</p><p>"I learned to be a storyteller through tourism and teaching history, and in that sense, when you forget to tell the human story inside history and abstract it to just names and dates, that's where teaching history in schools goes wrong,” principal writer Kat Kingsley told Aftermath. “When you just say 'Then this number of people died, and it happened on this day,' it just goes in one ear and out the other. One thing I think <em>Warframe </em>does really well is, it takes these epic sci-fi fantasy stories and tells them from a human aspect. It connects them to human emotions, even if they involve the wildest science fiction characters. I think with this update, we're telling a war story from a [place] of human emotion."</p><figure><blockquote><p>That all-too-brief moment of commonality between enemies and recognizing something in one another – the idea of playing in this environment of trenches and devastation.</p></blockquote></figure><p>As a result, the developers focused more on studying individuals’ battlefield horror stories, rather than the history books.&nbsp;</p><p>"I've not delved into things like historical records, the kind of thing that could distance you,” said Bott. “I've really tried much more to refresh my familiarity with [war poets], the men who were on the ground describing things. I think the idea of war poetry in itself might seem ironic, but it's not rendering something brutal whimsical in the slightest. It was finding a way to communicate what Wilfred Owen calls 'the pity of war distilled.' ... Drawing attention to it and saying 'This is the reality of what we suffer. This is what war is. This is what we went through.'"</p><p><em>Warframe </em>also boasts a long history of using music to bolster its space opera – up to and including full-band songs with lyrics and lore, so many of which now exist that this year’s TennoCon featured <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKai40IaURo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a nearly-stadium-sized concert</a> with multiple vocalists and a pyrotechnics show (Ford played bass in the band). <em>The Old Peace</em> leans into this particular penchant, albeit in a more somber way than <em>1999</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"The song sung by the Sentients to one another as they crossed the deep gulf of space [to Tau], it's got that kind of pioneering vibe to it, but it's also got a fatalistic vibe,” said Bott. “There's a direct inspirational link between 'There is some corner of foreign field that is forever England' and 'Who but we shall distant die on that far shore forlorn.' It's that same sense of 'We know that we are fated to eventually perish on some literally alien landscape,' but that is our nature, that is our destiny.'”</p><p>"'We've been made to die,'" added Kingsley.</p><p>It’s a stark tonal shift away from <em>Warframe</em>’s previous expansion, but the developers at Digital Extremes are confident in their ability to navigate it.</p><p>"<em>Warframe</em> tries to never repeat itself beat for beat, and because <em>1999 </em>was more tongue-in-cheek and was goofier and more humorous, this is more of a return to form," said Kingsley.</p><p>"I think [giving people something like <em>1999</em>] would have been an easy thing to do, but that's why we didn't do it,” said Bott. “The intent is to deliver something that is, palette wise, completely different than what we just did, and that is something we have done again and again.”</p><figure><figcaption>Digital Extremes</figcaption></figure><p>If nothing else, it’s relevant subject matter, considering the ever-worsening state of the world. But as far as Ford is concerned, that’s always been the case.</p><p>"My mom is a very eccentric woman, and she sent me a text about two months ago. She was born in the 50s, and she said 'Ever since I've been born until the day I die, the world has been at war,’” Ford said. “She's only known war her whole life despite living in the most peaceful times, and there's never been more peace. But you can't really say that with the world we have where everything is so accessible, especially stories of what's going on with conflict and war."</p><p>"The inspiration for taking a slice of time where a treaty should have happened and what's going on, it of course is coming from anything the globe can put in front of us.” she added. “We can look at it and we can say, 'How can we make this human story about space kids that control robots be rooted in the truth of all war?'"</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-valnet-off-the-grid-gunzilla-rip-this-sucks"><h3>🙃 [Update: 🤔]</h3></a><p>Cool, cool, cool</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse"><h3>‘Friendslop’ Isn’t Real, But People Love Posting About It Anyway</h3></a><p>But people are still intent on dunking on the idea of someone saying "friendslop" and meaning it.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/warframe-old-peace-world-war-one-interview-tennocon]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During TennoCon 2025 (the tenth edition of the community event), Digital Extremes announced what's coming next to Warframe, its popular free-to-play third-person online action game.</p>



<p>Later this year, Warframe will be updated with a new Narrative Chapter titled 'The Old Peace'. It will usher players into the past, where they will relive the long-forgotten tale of Tau and his childhood friend, Adis, and the war between the Orokin and their creations, the Dax Anarch Warriors (a new enemy faction), on the Perita moon. This quest will be operator-focused, in case you were wondering. The Old Peace continues Warframe's current “Void War” story arc and sets the stage for the monumental Tau Narrative Chapter, coming at some point in 2026.</p>



<p>Alongside The Old Peace, the developers will also add a new side story titled 'The Devil's Triad'. In this narrative, players will welcome a new trio of characters: Father Lyon Allard (Protoframe of Harrow), Marie Leroux (Protoframe of Wisp), and Uriel (the new devil-themed Warframe).</p>



<p>Digital Extremes also unveiled the Operator's graphically remastered character models and cosmetic assets to improve visual fidelity, including new facial animations, and align with Warframe’s latest assets. Last but not least, a new Ultimate ability will be introduced for the Operator. More details about this will be revealed later.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The developers then moved on to the untitled Fall update that will debut in a few months. This patch will continue improving the new player experience in Warframe, with a new Mod tutorial Quest, The Teacher, developed in collaboration with Sumo Digital. The 62nd Warframe, a long-awaited Oberon rework, a fresh Lavos deluxe skin, among other quality-of-life improvements, are scheduled to be released with this update, too. More details will be provided in the September live stream.</p>



<p>The Android closed beta for Warframe will also arrive this Fall. Sign-ups for the closed beta playtest <a href="http://warframe.com/android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are available now</a>. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a> scares me a bit. Ok, it scares me a lot. Here's this big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free-to-play</a> MMO that's been growing for over a decade, adding layers upon layers of complex sci-fi lore and context to its imposing metal form.</p>
<p>I couldn't tell you before googling it why one of my fellow article writers had declared in the chat for a recent press preview that Excalibur Prime users won't be spared when the revolution comes. I can tell you that its end of year 2025 update is called The Old Peace, and looks like it'll be a hoot.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Old Peace, which developers Digital Extremes have just shown off a demo of at this year's edition of annual Warframe get-together TennCon, is all about "the war-scarring conflict between the Orokin, their creations, and a coalition of Dax Anarch Warriors" upon the Perita moon". The demo of it kicked off with the player fighting a huge robo-lad that turned out to be manned by a small robo-lady, who then accompanies you through events you're hallucinating via a Matrix-esque tech bath with <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Lotus">The Lotus</a>, the mysterious figure who talks you through missions from the start of the game.</p>
<p>"You had the new war, you know about the old war," Warframe creative director Rebecca Ford said of the update, "but now it's time to learn about the old peace, where, as with all wars, there was a moment in time when there was an effort for peace, a treaty. There was a time on Tau when things could have been different."</p>

<p>The Old Peace, which'll expand Warframe's focus skill tree and add in a new baddie faction, is bringing with it a standalone side story called The Devil's Triad that looks like it'll see you take on three scary bosses to earn a new warframe and a couple of new protoframes. The frame's dubbed Uriel, it's devil themed, and it's also the last warframe that the game's former art director Michael 'Mynki' Brennan worked on prior to his death from cancer in <a href="https://www.vg247.com/remembering-michael-mynki-brennans-warframe">October last year</a>.</p>
<p>Before all of that, the game'll also be getting an autumn update featuring a Lavos Deluxe cosmetic, a rework of the Oberon frame, and a quest called The Teacher. The latter's designed to teach you all about modding in Warframe, which sadly is of the adding stuff to gear in a game variety, rather than the downloading a thing that turns NPCs into Shrek variety.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>The Devil's Triad look delightfully devilish, Seymour. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Digital Extremes</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Digital Extremes also announced that a standalone Warframe TTRPG module, made in collaboration with sci-fi dice game Starfinder devs Paizo and dubbed Warframe x Starfinder: Operation Orias, is launching in October this year.</p>
<p>Going back to The Old Peace, the very end of its TennoCon showing teases Warframe's future, with an update dubbed Tau coming in 2026 set to continue the game's current "Void War" story arc. "We have a very ambitious next couple of years [planned], to get the roots of Warframe and everything we're gonna need [in place] to continue this crazy journey," Ford said.</p>
<p>So, no slowing down in sight for the massive MMO's continued metamorphosis, even as Digital Extremes' other project, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soulframe">Soulframe</a>, inches closer to full release.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warframes-2025-end-of-year-update-is-all-about-the-old-peace-as-hallucinated-via-communal-matrix-bath]]></content:encoded>

The protoframes you'll be meeting are Harrow and Wisp, a sign that new protoframes will still be coming even as the game leaves <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-motorbiking-pal-romancing-boyband-battling-1999-expansion-finally-has-a-release-date">the Warframe 1999 setting</a>.
</p>
<p>Uriel, the devil-themed warframe coming alongside The Devil's Triade, was confirmed by Soulframe's creative director Geoff Crookes in a pre-Tennocon Q&amp;A as the last design by Michael “Mynki” James Brennan, who passed away last year.

<p>In that same pre-Tennocon Q&amp;A, Warframe community manager Megan Everett confirmed that those who choose to romance these new Protoframes as part of The Devil's Triade side story will not have to worry about pre-existing relationships in the Warframe 1999 setting. The reason being that Warframe 1999 is The Drifter's story, whereas this upcoming update focuses on The Operator.</p>
<p>There's been a lot of reveals of Tennocon this year. Earlier today, Soulframe got a new trailer and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-alpha-prelude-access-2025-delay-2026">opened the floodgates for anyone who signs up</a>. </p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> fans won't need to be reminded it's a big weekend for developer Digital Extremes and its long-running sci-fi shooter. Thanks to this year's TennoCon live event, which is traditionally the time for the studio to dazzle its community with all sorts of things to come, we've now got a pretty good idea of what Warframe's next twelve months look like.
</p>
<p>
Top of the list for this year's big updates is The Old Peace, Warframe's next major quest and narrative chapter. It's basically the prelude to next year's big Tau update (which we'll get to in a bit) and comes packaged with a new side story called The Devil's Triad.
</p>
<p>
Focusing on The Old Peace's quest bit first, it whisks players back to the Tau of the past, where - to paraphrase the official description - they'll ecnounter a childhood Sentient friend named Adis, and experience the conflict between the Orokin, their creations, and a coalition of Dax Anarch Warriors upon the Perita moon. And as for that Devil's Triad side story, it'll serve as the introduction to three new characters: Father Lyon Allard (the Protoframe of Harrow), Marie Leroux (the Protoframe of Wisp), and new devil-themed Warframe Uriel.

<p>
Alongside all <em>that</em>, you've got a new enemy faction, a Focus expansion introducing a new Operator ability, and - on that subject - a full graphical remaster for Warframe's Operators, which includes new character models and cosmetic assets, new facial animations, and more.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date for The Old Peace yet besides its vague "2025" window, but you can at least keep your Tenno spirits up in the immediate terms with the tuneful Lullaby of the Manifold, which is leaping out of Digital Extremes' Old Peace reveal trailer and onto "most" major music streaming platforms on 21st July. Valkyrie gets some new premium in-game cosmetic options when her Heirloom Collection arrives on the same day, and - as summer departs in its annual seasonal strop - there's still more to come. 
</p>
<p>
In October, Digital Extremes is teaming up with tabletop RPG creator Paizo to bring Warframe to tabletops in both physical and digital forms, while other autumnal treats include the launch of Warframe's closed beta on Android (you can <a href="http://warframe.com/android">sign up for that here</a>), and another big update currently known only as "untitled". It might not have a name yet, but it'll still be one to watch, and it's introducing a very much-requested - and much-needed - tutorial quest teaching players how to use Warframe's complicated upgrade system, Mods. Digital Extremes has sought outside help for this one, and the resulting quest, appropriately known as The Teacher, has been developed in collaboration with Sumo Digital.

<p>
On top of all that, "untitled" brings an  Oberon rework, a new Lavos deluxe skin, plus various quality-of-life improvements, which you can learn more about in a livestream this September. And one more thing to add under 'relatively imminent': Caliban Prime Access arrives "soon".
</p>
<p>
And finally for your Warframe calendars, should that be a thing you own, there's the aforementioned Tau. It's described as a "monumental" new narrative chapter that follows on from the events of this year's The Old Peace, and it's launching in 2026. And if Digital Extremes' wish comes true, Warframe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-studio-would-love-to-do-a-proper-switch-2-version-but-its-still-waiting-on-a-dev-kit-so-if-you-know-anyone">might even be available on Switch 2</a> by then.

            <p>EA is planning a three-day event that will finally include the reveal of the next Battlefield game. Rumour has it, it's called - yup, you've guessed it - Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>According to Battlefield content creator Rivalxfactor, via a combination of informants and a <a href="https://i.ibb.co/mVCZqL74/battlefield-6.jpg">now-deleted tweet</a> from a content creator who received a "massive" Battlefield 6 case in the mail, they believe a reveal is imminent, with Rivalxfactor stating they have it confirmed that "there is indeed a three-day EA event starting on 29th July".</p>

<p>"This is where Battlefield 6 will be revealed, devs will be interviewed in a somewhat fixed format, and the game will be featured with content creators," Rivalxfactor <a href="https://x.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1946401115240644819">wrote</a>. "The open beta will launch shortly after.</p>
<p>"It will be much like the BF1 event with players getting a live round in after the devs speak and video is showcased," they <a href="https://x.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1946400245388038395">added</a> on a different tweet.</p>
<p>As for the picture of the promotional case that's seemingly gone out to content creators? We can't presume it's real, of course - so take it all with the requisite dollop of salt - but the image shows a case with 'Battlefield 6' emblazoned across the front, its straps seemingly branded with different Battlefield modes, including Conquest, Breakthrough, PTFO, and Rush.</p> <div>

<p>Pretty much all we officially know about the next Battlefield so far is that it's set in the modern day, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">bring back traditional classes and more focused maps</a> after the unpopular changes made in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>. Beyond that, it's all speculation - although one sleuth scoured the new game's concept art and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-sleuth-seemingly-identifies-location-teased-in-next-games-first-bit-of-concept-art">identified landmarks suggesting it could be set in Gibraltar</a>. EA confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">expects the series' latest instalment to arrive before April next year</a>.</p>
<p>Although the closed Battlefield playtest is described as the "most ambitious community testing program in franchise history" and requires participants to sign an NDA, plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefields-invite-only-playtest-has-just-begun-and-gameplay-is-already-leaking-online">gameplay footage has popped up in various corners of the internet</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reminds-battlefield-players-things-taking-place-in-labs-may-or-may-not-make-their-way-to-the-final-game">EA was not happy</a>, eventually hitting back at a grumpy Reddit thread about an unsupported claim about skill-based matchmaking, but stuff continues to leak, including clips of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhifj5/bf6_campaign/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">gameplay</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhnpdm/all_of_the_bf_labs_subfactions/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">factions</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhny43/gear_customization_heading_in_the_right_direction/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">gear customisation options</a>, its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lh7bzp/how_do_you_feel_about_battle_royale/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">battle royale</a> mode, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online">its single-player campaign</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-leak-confirms-return-of-fan-favourite-mode">18 minutes of Rush mode</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-image-suggests-the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-called-battlefield-6-and-the-reveal-event-is-coming-very-soon]]></content:encoded>

<p>You can also expect a new trial - Kill the Politician - and the complementary MK Challenge, which sees you guarding them "door to door". There's also Sentence The Prosecuted in which you'll have to decipher the charges, pin them to the defendant, and "make sure that it sticks". Which probably means exactly what it says on the tin.</p>
<p>As for the Rebirth rework?</p>
<p>"After careful consideration, Easterman is reopening the Rebirth to all reagents who deserve it," Red Barrels writes. "Rebirth now offers two options: The original Rebirth for solo players. The new Rebirth, called Communal Rebirth, which is designed for teams."</p>
<p>Communal Rebirth drops the players in a random Trial with 3 unique variators - Mirror, Rebirth, and Classified. Rebirth now requires each member of a group to have 100 Rebirth Tokens. It is now possible to stack up to 1000 Rebirth Tokens, which is just as well, because Rebirth Token rewards for completing Trials have also been revisited, and you'll now get 5 Rebirth Tokens per Trial, and 3 Rebirth Tokens per MK-Challenge.</p>
<p>The original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outlast">Outlast</a> launched back in 2013, casting players as journalist Miles Upshur as he investigated the notorious Mount Massive Asylum. Its terrifying (and often quite grim) blend of first-person night-vision exploration and frantic chase thrills quickly attracted fans, leading to a story expansion the following year and a full-blown sequel in 2017.</p>
<p>This second outing - which saw players investigating a murder in the Arizona desert - ramped up the violence and strenuous pursuit sequences to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outlast-2-review">slightly less positive reception</a>, but it still did well enough that Red Barrels was able to launch a third game, co-operative multplayer survival horror <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outlast-trials">The Outlast Trials</a>, into early access in 2023.</p>
<p>"The Outlast Trials is excessive and frantically enjoyable - but can occasionally tip over into frustration more than fear," I wrote when I reviewed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-review-a-unique-obscene-spin-on-the-horror-staple">The Outlast Trials</a> back when it was released in early access, awarding it three out of five stars.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outlast-horror-series-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation">Lionsgate recently announced it's working on a film version of developer Red Barrels' survival horror series, Outlast</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-season-4-is-here-heres-whats-new]]></content:encoded>
