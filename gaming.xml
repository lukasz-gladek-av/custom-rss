            <p>Shortly after you finish celebrating the arrival of next year, a plague will rock up. Well, the full version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-3">Pathologic 3</a>, a game in which you play a doctor tasked with saving a town from a mysterious contagion will rock up. I'm sure that if you turn off all of the lights and pay someone to sit in the next room coughing every two minutes, the difference'll be negligible.</p>

<p>This full release has taken a tiny bit longer than developers Ice-Pick Lodge <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-announced-with-time-travel-mechanic-due-for-release-in-2025">initially planned</a>, but it's just barely slipped out of 2025, with January 9th, 2026, being the freshly revealed release date. "That date is nailed down, screwed in, wrapped in commitments, and it isn’t moving," the studio wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3199650/view/542244996316660185?l=english">Steam post</a>.</p>
<p>Alongside this announcement, they've released the first in a series of trailers, because apparently Pathologic 3's far too "hard to explain with keywords" for a single video to do it justice. Multiple trailers apparently aren't enough to accomplish that task either, as the studio have opted to release a second demo - following Pathologic 3: Quarantine's arrival this March - as part of the latest Steam Next Fest.</p><p>"This demo is a slice from the beginning of the upcoming game," Ice-Pick Lodge explained. "Daniil Dankovsky, the Bachelor, arrives in the City-on-Gorkhon. He wants to meet an immortal man. And then everything goes sideways." Sounds like the average trip into town.</p>
<p>As Brendan discussed when he delved into the plague doc sim's Quarantine demo, Pathologic 3 treads a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-devs-keen-to-avoid-premature-promises-about-bringing-back-the-changeling-in-pathologic-4">more detective-coded plague-doctoring path than its scrappier predecessor</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-2">Pathologic 2</a>. Here's an extract from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-quarantine-drops-the-hunger-meters-so-you-can-play-doctor">his impressions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>For all its stitched-togetherness, the Quarantine demo remains good at building atmosphere. As a taster menu for the unreliable narrator story that is planned for the full game, it is flavourful and stacked with familiar names and faces for long-suffering fans. As a showcase for what the player will be doing it's also something of a disjointed mess. I'm writing out many of its features in simple terms, but the demo itself doesn't always deliver them that way, with minimal tutorials and a UI that mostly lets you figure things out yourself.</blockquote>
<p>Pathologic 3's also the first entry in the series the studio'll be releasing after the departure of founder and long-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic">Pathologic</a> director Nikolay Dybowski, who <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ice-pick-lodge-founder-nikolay-dybowski-departs-pathologic-dev">left amid allegations of kidnapping and abuse</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>The game's Next Fest demo can be found on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/">Steam page</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-wind-waves-everything-we-know-about-gen-10-leaks.1324135/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A huge dataleak has struck the world of Pokémon, revealing huge details about upcoming titles and the long-awaited arrival of Gen 10, said to be titled Wind &amp; Waves.</p>



<p>A series of leaks have dropped <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">details about Gen 10</a>, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-games-and-dlc-roadmap-allegedly-revealed-in-new-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap for future titles and DLC</a>, and teases the introduction of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-leak-reveals-boss-fight-and-mmo-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MMO mechanics in the next era</a> of the franchise.</p>



<p>Keeping on top of all the leaks is practically impossible, but we’ve made it easier for you to track everything revealed about Pokémon Gen 10, Wind &amp; Waves, in this guide.</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-we-know-about-pokemon-wind-amp-waves">Everything We Know About Pokémon Wind &amp; Waves</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big additions. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-game-location">Game Location</h3>



<p>Pokémon’s tenth generation will return to the Asian continent, having ventured to Europe and Hawaii in recent years, with the islands of Indonesia and Southeast Asia serving as the location.</p>



<p>The island locations will certainly be reminiscent of Sun &amp; Moon, based on Hawaii, and these rumours have been circulating for some time, though it was previously indicated that it would be based on the Greek islands. That appears not to be the case, however, with Indonesia and surrounding nations set to star.</p>



<h3 id="h-seed-pokemon">Seed Pokémon</h3>



<p>Seed <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> will reportedly be introduced in Pokémon Gen 10, with a particularly unique mechanic. According to datamines, the evolution of the Seed Pokémon will be based on the unique island you discover (more on that later), meaning your evolved form will feature unique patterns and colors.</p>



<p>There has been some confusion, however, as the Japanese use of ‘Seed’ for Pokémon description is also used in the TCG to describe ‘Basic’ Pokémon, so it may be that this Pokémon is ‘Basic’ and not ‘Seed’. However, the evolution mechanics seem to stand.</p>



<h3 id="h-underwater-exploration">Underwater Exploration</h3>



<p>Underwater exploration, not seen since the Hoenn games, is returning for Gen 10 and is said to be a huge feature, with datamined images showing a player riding on the back of Lumineon. Footage leaked from the graphics engine suggests it will have free exploration, not just available on designated routes.</p>



<h3 id="h-riding-amp-petting-mechanics">Riding &amp; Petting Mechanics</h3>



<p>Pokémon games have had riding mechanics in the past, notably with Pokémon Legends: Arceus having various mounts with different uses, but Gen 10 is seemingly set to take that to the next level with mechanics that make every Pokémon rideable, or pettable—likely depending on their size.</p>



<p>It’s noted that these details were in the planning document from 2020, so the feature may have been adjusted or removed entirely during development.</p>



<h3 id="h-model-redesigns">Model Redesigns</h3>



<p>It’s not surprising to see Pokémon getting model redesigns in new eras of the franchise, and it seems it’s happening once again for Gen 10 as images showing several images comparing Pokémon to their new forms and older models have been shared.</p>



<p>Pikachu, Charizard, Lumineon, and Machamp are all explicity stated as receiving new models for Gen 10, though it’s likely all Pokémon will be adjusted to fit the new era.</p>



<h3 id="h-mmo-features">MMO Features</h3>



<p>MMO features are set to be introduced in Gen 10, the leaks state, with a mix of open-world and MMO elements. Though not confirmed, this sounds like exploration areas will be limited to parties and groups, while main areas, acting as hubs, will have players across the world joined together.</p>



<p>The features are seemingly going to serve as a soft-launch ahead of being expanded in the Pokémon Seed project, a game that joins several regions together including Hoenn and Sinnoh. A similar approach has been seen in the past, with large open-world areas introduced in Legends: Arceus, which occurred before the huge open-world map seen in Scarlet &amp; Violet.</p>

<h3 id="h-release-window">Release Window</h3>



<p>As expected, Pokémon Wind &amp; Waves, the tenth generation, will launch in 2026, coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the franchise. This would come four years after the release of Scarlet &amp; Violet, slightly longer than the standard three-year gap we’ve seen in the past.</p>



<p>These plans have seemingly been updated; however, as documents initially stated Gen 10 was planned to release in 2025, likely as a big lure alongside the Switch 2 launch, with Legends: Z-A launching in 2024. That is not the case, however, as we know.</p>



<h3 id="h-procedural-generation">Procedural Generation</h3>



<p>Procedural generation is reportedly going to be a huge feature in Gen 10, with islands generated randomly for you to explore. If you like what you find, you’ll be able to share an island with your friends.</p>



<p>It’s not known whether you can save islands permanently and have them serve as a ‘base,’ or if they’ll merely be for exploration and catching new Pokémon. </p>



<h3 id="h-switch-2-exclusive">Switch 2 Exclusive</h3>



<p>Unsurprisingly, it has been confirmed that Gen 10 of Pokémon, Wind &amp; Waves, will be exclusive to Switch 2 and won’t be available on the original console, unlike Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p>



<p>Legends: Z-A is likely to be the final Pokémon title released onto the original Switch console, with Pokopia arriving next year and confirmed to be a Switch 2 exclusive. </p>



<h3 id="h-sustainable-development-goals">Sustainable Development Goals</h3>



<p>Similar to Scarlet &amp; Violet, there will be a group of objectives rather than just the standard gym badges, with the theme said to be inspired by the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>



<p>In total, there are 18 challenges, one for each type, and completing them all allows you to challenge the champion. However, if you want to, you can skip this whole stage entirely and head straight to the final boss as soon as open-water exploration in the game is unlocked.</p>



<h3 id="h-characters">Characters</h3>



<p>Descriptions for several characters have been unearthed, including the protagonist, a child whose mother wins a lottery and a vacation to the region. A sibling is also mentioned, with their development playing a key part in the story, and there’s the customary friend/rival to challenge you along the way.</p>



<p>The antagonist is said to be the chairman of a group of hotels, who initially planned to build resorts where humans and Pokémon could co-exist. However, an accident led to the loss of a child, changing his views. There’s also a younger sibling to that child who survived and is described as “naive” about the world.</p>



<p>The role of the evil team is taken by a Land Development Team, who destroy nature to expand land for profit, likely working for the hotel chairman. Finally, the professor is younger than we usually see in the franchise, age 21, and is known as the “Survival Professor,” with survival skills being a core strength.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> is clearly off to the races if its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-having-a-massive-debut-on-steam/1100-6535370/">domination of the Steam charts</a> are any indication. Over the course of its launch weekend, EA's latest and greatest multiplayer shooter put up remarkable numbers, cresting over 740,000 concurrent players regularly. And while the game is still pretty fresh, it has impressively retained a great deal of players at all times, rarely dropping below about 200,000 active players at any given point.</p><p dir="ltr">On Steam at least, Battlefield 6 boasts the most concurrent players of any entry in the franchise, and it has ranked among Steam's most played games the entirety of the weekend. It is also the #1 top seller on Steam, which is especially prominent given the fact that the base game is going for a whopping $70. I think it's safe to say that all that momentum Battlefield 6 has been enjoying has turned it into the series' first bonafide hit in a long while.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1977395959446286661" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I think this Sunday will be good in terms of how many of you all are playing BF6! New record? I hope so!</p>  — David Sirland (@tiggr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1977395959446286661?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Despite the momentum that Battlefield 6 had going into the weekend after its launch--a holiday weekend, no less--it wasn't able to beat out its peak of 747,000+ players, which it achieved right at release on October 10. Still, Battlefield 6's early Steam numbers are good enough to beat out Call of Duty's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/" rel="nofollow ">all-time high</a> on the platform, which is currently sitting at about 492,000, as well as other major shooters on the market like Apex Legends and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6's outstanding start isn't without precedent. A slew of leaks from the Battlefield Labs program, which invited select players to test the game out early and provide meaningful feedback, detailed many features that built up anticipation. Anticipation which eventually exploded around the game's full reveal earlier this summer, where the developers at Battlefield Studios teased inspiration from Battlefield's 3 and 4 (the darlings of the franchise) as well as a back-to-basics approach after Battlefield 2042's tumultuous launch.</p><p dir="ltr">An open beta in August seemed to crystallize the fervor around Battlefield 6, drawing in more than 500,000 players on Steam alone and proving to many that the franchise was in rare form after a series of misses. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review-good-company/1900-6418420/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">review-in-progress</a> confirms as much, calling it "a return to form for the long-running series, delivering chaotic, large-scale multiplayer that's as familiar as it is uproariously fun."</p><p dir="ltr">I guess all that remains to be seen now is whether Battlefield 6 can maintain this good buzz and momentum moving forward, especially as competitors like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">Black Ops 7</a> inch closer to release.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, Xbox underwent a massive internal shift resulting in a number of projects <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/#1">getting canceled</a>, a great deal of employees <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/">being laid off</a>, and at least <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/">one studio closure</a>. Among the damage done was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/">cancelation of Everwild</a>, a third-person fantasy game that underwent a turbulent development cycle before having the plug pulled on it.</p><p dir="ltr">At the time of its cancelation, we'd only ever seen two trailers of the game. Details of the project outside of these atmospheric teasers were scarce and it seemed like we would hear very little after its untimely demise. Now though, it appears that screenshots of some early builds have leaked, at last giving players some idea of the game they'll never get to play.</p><p dir="ltr">First reported by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/screenshots-rares-everwild-featuring-ui-gameplay-details" rel="nofollow ">MP1st</a>, the screenshots come by way of an artist that once worked on the title at Rare, and reportedly resemble a version of the game close to its cancelation. In these screenshots, you can make out the game's cel-shaded art style, as well as some elements of its menu and UI, which detail some kind of farming/survival mechanics.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PastorXbox/status/1977745836097315011" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Vazou?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Vazou</a> Capturas de Tela do Cancelado Everwild da Rare 📸<br> As imagens mostravam (provavelmente) uma versão relativamente recente, de um pouco antes do jogo ser cancelado pela Microsoft<br>A interface nos lembra um pouco dos jogos da franquia Zelda modernos , embora tenhamos sido… <a href="https://t.co/7lMlrAUvXw" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/7lMlrAUvXw</a></p>  — Pastor Xbox (@PastorXbox) <a href="https://twitter.com/PastorXbox/status/1977745836097315011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">In a seemingly early build of Everwild, we get our first glimpse at a menu that is divided into tools, seeds, and figments. The latter two appear to be consumables of some sorts, with Figments specifically looking like deployable critters of some sort that come in various types, while the toolbar suggests items that the player might use more regularly, especially if Everwild was to support some sort of farming element. Reportedly, the game was being developed as a third-person title with God game and survival mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">Another screenshot shows a more developed and artistically rendered version of the same menu, though this time it also features tabs hinting at other items the player could use such as mosaics and plants alongside tools, figments, and seeds. One even shows a bit of flavor text for an item called a shrub seed which pokes fun at the player's intelligence.</p><p dir="ltr">Among the leaked images is one showing off a number of Everwild's settings. Interestingly, MP1st notes that according to the website where the images were found, Rare was going to use player data from Sea of Thieves, its ongoing pirate live-service game, to inform its settings for Everwild, though specific examples of this philosophy aren't mentioned.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the remaining screenshots show off some glimpses at the game's environment, though they also give away painfully little. In one image, the player seems to stand before a structure in a sea of fog while another provides a blurry glimpse at a forested area. Even if the images are of an early build, Everwild sure was nailing the naturalistic ambience of its cinematics.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, I expect these screenshots will be all we get out of Everwild for a long time. Still, I'm glad we got to see it at all, and now many can finally imagine a more concrete version of this regrettably axed title.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>ZeniMax Online has released the Battle for the Writhing Wall event for The Elder Scrolls Online on all platforms, a novelty in itself given that updates usually launch on PC and Mac before consoles. The Battle for the Writhing Wall is a key component of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/eso-seasons-of-the-worm-cult-developer-qa-theres-tons-of-exciting-stuff-we-havent-talked-about-thats-coming-to-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seasons of the Worm Cult</a> because so far, players have been limited to exploring Western Solstice due to this magical barrier (made of souls) erected by the dreadful cult of necromancers. Now, though, the whole community of the MMORPG will participate in an assault on the barrier that will develop over three stages.  </p>



<p>The first phase is one of supply and defense where players must help the Stirk Fellowship (a partnership between the three Alliances and the Fighters and Mages guilds) gather resources for the upcoming battle. Both sides engage in skirmishes over siege camps, and planar incursions will affect locations across all of Tamriel. All The Elder Scrolls Online players can contribute to progressing this phase, but only those who have purchased the 2025 Content Pass can accept quests in Solstice. During this initial stage, you can expect the Worm Cult to take over various delves and public dungeons throughout Tamriel, using them as invasion sites and marking them on the map. These areas have additional monsters that are more difficult to defeat than usual and are the focus of the daily quests offered by the NPC Orinde Glenuvon.</p>



<p>In Phase 2, players must strengthen the war effort and maintain siege camp defense while the proper assault on the Writhing Wall begins. Expect vicious counterattacks as the Fellowship prepares its decisive strike against the wall. As before, all players may contribute, but only 2025 Content Pass owners can accept quests in Solstice. Siege Camp incursions will occur more frequently and be more difficult to complete. Additionally, the Daedra Ghishzor, a powerful Maldrith, will appear as a world boss on Solstice.</p>



<p>Finally, the last phase will start with the Writhing Wall exposed. At that point, it will be time to break through and clear the Writhing Fortress public instance. Unlike the other phases, which vary in length depending on player successes and mobilization, the third phase lasts one week from when the Writhing Fortress is first completed on a given server; the event ends after that period. Only players with the 2025 Content Pass can attempt and complete this phase.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Similar to the vanilla World of Warcraft event of the opening of Ahn'Qiraj, each server will progress separately depending on its players' contributions. The Xbox Europe and PlayStation Europe servers are currently slightly ahead of the others. The progress of each server can be followed <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-gb/writhingwall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via this official The Elder Scrolls Online website page</a>.</p>



<p>We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-qa-zos-leadership-change-game-alive-30-years-unfortunate-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed the ZeniMax Online leadership</a> to discuss the studio's changes (the layoffs, the cancellation of Project Blackbird, and the new Game Director, Nick Giacomini) and their goal to keep Elder Scrolls Online alive for 30 years.</p>

Naturally, you’d think it’ll take a lot of work to get to that stage, and you’re half right. But there are a few tips and tricks we’ve picked up along the way to help you make the sparkly garden of your dreams.</p><p>Grow A Garden is one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roblox-games/2900-6830/">best Roblox games</a> available to play on the platform, and one of the reasons why is that you can spend a few minutes tending to your plot before leaving it to do its own thing. However, unless someone is willing to donate to you one of their most expensive plants, getting started will take some grit. Here are some tips for the early game, things to focus on once you’ve made a bit of money, and all the more obscure mechanics that help you in the long run.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Best_Plants_to_buy_in_the_early_stages">Best Plants to buy in the early stages</a></li><li><a href="#Don___t_forget_about_the_guide_achievements">Don’t forget about the guide achievements</a></li><li><a href="#Mid_late_game_tips_for_making_money">Mid-late game tips for making money</a></li><li><a href="#Mutate_your_rarest_pets">Mutate your rarest pets</a></li><li><a href="#Buy_tools_and_get_crafting">Buy tools and get crafting</a></li><li><a href="#Participate_in_Admin_Abuse_events">Participate in Admin Abuse events</a></li><li><a href="#Cook_plants_in_the_cooking_kit">Cook plants in the cooking kit</a></li><li><a href="#Look_out_for_merchants">Look out for merchants</a><ul><li><a href="#Gnome_Merchant">Gnome Merchant</a></li><li><a href="#Honey_Merchant">Honey Merchant</a></li><li><a href="#Sky_Merchant">Sky Merchant</a></li><li><a href="#Sprinker_Shop">Sprinker Shop</a></li><li><a href="#Summer_Seed_Merchant">Summer Seed Merchant</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Invest_in_expanding_your_garden_size">Invest in expanding your garden size</a></li><li><a href="#Spend_a_fortune_to_Ascend_and_gain_Garden_Coins">Spend a fortune to Ascend and gain Garden Coins</a><ul><li><a href="#Ascension_merchant_inventory">Ascension merchant inventory</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575723-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-seeds.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575723" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575723-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-seeds.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575723"></a><figcaption>Sam owns the Seed Shop, which regularly restocks valuable seeds you can plant to earn money.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575723-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-seeds.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Best_Plants_to_buy_in_the_early_stages">Best Plants to buy in the early stages</h2><p>When you’re just starting your garden, growing and selling carrots is a good way to make a bit of pocket change, as they grow very quickly. However, you’ll want to prioritize any plant that doesn’t disappear upon harvesting it before too long. Generally, they’re more cost-effective, meaning that you’ll recoup your money and won’t need to buy and plant replacement seeds.</p><p>While single-harvest plants don’t normally give a good return upon sale, there are a couple of exceptions. Bamboo is the most plentiful plant with the best resale value. Buy as many seeds as you can afford in the shop whenever they replenish, then plant them in the corner of your garden and leave them there. Expose them to as many weather effects as you can so that they can get as many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-grow-a-garden-mutations/1100-6534388/" data-ref-id="1100-6534388">Grow A Garden mutations</a> as possible, then sell them for a fortune. Mushrooms are also a valuable candidate for single-harvest plants that are potentially worth a ton.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575736-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-achievements.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575736" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575736-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-achievements.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575736"></a><figcaption>The Guide button on the left was added fairly recently, but it's a handy way to check the achievements to get more stuff.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575736-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-achievements.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Don___t_forget_about_the_guide_achievements">Don’t forget about the guide achievements</h2><p>The Guide Book has plenty of things you can do to gain a bunch of experience. While the rewards for reaching higher levels aren’t all that exciting, completing each page of the Guide Book’s achievement sections gives you helpful items to boost your garden, such as seed packets, pet shards, and many more.</p><p>To give you an idea of the work needed to complete the Common Achievements page, you only need to shovel 100 plants, harvest 200 carrots, sell 500 strawberries, and gift a carrot and 5 strawberries. Completing this set of quests will reward you with a cooking kit and 5 silver common seed packs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575747-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-mid-game.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575747" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575747-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-mid-game.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575747"></a><figcaption>Occasionally, you'll get a plant that has a whole bunch of different mutations, each one buffing how much it's worth when sold.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575747-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-mid-game.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Mid_late_game_tips_for_making_money">Mid-late game tips for making money</h2><p>Once you’ve made your first million Sheckles, it’s time to use tools such as the shovel to dig up plants that are no longer needed. Any common, uncommon, and rare plants are taking precious space that you can better use for when you find or buy higher rarity plants. If you’re unsure what the rarity of your plant is, hover your cursor or face the direction of the crop and look at the color of its name. If it’s grey, green, or blue, then you can probably dig it up.</p><p>Bulky single-harvest plants, such as watermelons, or replenishable ones like apples that don’t give a lot of profit, should be sold as soon as possible. Instead, you should grow high-yield trees such as coconuts, mangoes, dragon fruit, and romanesco. Bamboo is still a good investment at the mid-game, because they grow quickly and are worth a fair bit when affected by many mutations. Eventually, you’ll be able to afford the most expensive plants and dedicate all your garden space to growing them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575751-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-pet-mutations.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575751" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575751-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-pet-mutations.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575751"></a><figcaption>Some mutations, such as Inverted, give an additional boost to pet XP, while others allow pets to give bonus mutations.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575751-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-pet-mutations.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Mutate_your_rarest_pets">Mutate your rarest pets</h2><p>This is also the time when you should be investing in Grow A Garden pets. Focus initially on trying to get any event-exclusive pets that grant mutations that will disappear once a new update appears. They’re not worth much now, but hatching as many of them as you can gives you potential trades in the future. Don’t bother with any common or uncommon eggs from the shop. There are very few that are worth the hassle of hatching, while rare and higher rarity eggs can be game-changing.</p><p>As for mutations, a pet can only have one at a time, so choose carefully which one you want. To mutate them, feed them to level 50 and deposit them for 500,000,000 sheckles at the facility next to the pet shop. You can also give them a Golden Acorn from level 40 to give them a random mutation from one of the following options.</p><ul><li><strong>Shiny</strong> - provides an additional 15% boost to the pet’s XP per second.</li><li><strong>Inverted</strong> - provides an additional 30% boost to the pet’s XP per second.</li><li><strong>Windy</strong> - every 4 minutes and 47 seconds, there’s a 20.12% chance a nearby fruit gets the Windstruck mutation.</li><li><strong>Frozen</strong> - every 4 minutes and 47 seconds, there’s a 30% chance a nearby fruit gets the Frozen mutation.</li><li><strong>Golden</strong> - gives a big increase to the pet’s passive.</li><li><strong>Mega</strong> - pet is gigantic and has a 20% faster hunger rate. Gains an additional 10-40 XP per second.</li><li><strong>Tiny</strong> - pet is tiny and has a 20% slower hunger rate. Gains an additional 5-30 XP per second</li><li><strong>IronSkin</strong> - gives around a 35% to 45% chance to recover any stolen fruit.</li><li><strong>Rainbow</strong> - provides a bigger increase to the pet’s passive.</li><li><strong>Shocked</strong> - during a thunderstorm, every 45-60 seconds, it has between a 25% and 30% chance to attract lightning strikes to give nearby fruits the Shocked mutation.</li><li><strong>Radiant</strong> - every 20 to 30 minutes, it emits sunshine at a random nearby plant to advance its growth by 24 hours.</li><li><strong>Ascended</strong> - every 5 to 6 hours, there is around a 75% chance that this pet will give the Dawnbound mutation to a random fruit.</li></ul><p>There are also a handful of events in the past and present that give out Pet Shards, which you can use to apply the following mutations:</p><ul><li><strong>Aromatic </strong>- every 24 minutes and 42 seconds, a nearby fruit has a chance to get the Aromatic mutation. (Cooking event only)</li><li><strong>Fried </strong>- every 20 minutes, a nearby fruit has a chance to get the Fried mutation (Cooking event only)</li><li><strong>Tranquil</strong> - every 25 minutes, a nearby fruit has a chance to get the Tranquil mutation (Zen event only)</li><li><strong>Corrupted</strong> - every 25 minutes, a nearby fruit has a chance to get the Corrupted mutation (Zen event only)</li><li><strong>GiantBean</strong> - pet has a 15% faster hunger rate and gains an additional 0.12 XP per second for each Beanstalk planted in your garden. (Beanstalk event only)</li><li><strong>Glimmering</strong> - every 24 minutes and 45 seconds, a nearby fruit has a 20.14% chance of getting the Glimmering mutation (Fairies event only)</li><li><strong>Luminous</strong> - every 34 minutes and 15 seconds, a nearby fruit has a 20.04% chance to get the Luminous mutation (Fairies event only)</li><li><strong>Nutty</strong> - every 19 minutes and 40 seconds, the pet's main ability has a 20% chance to activate twice. If this fails, your pet loses a level. (Chubby Chipmunk event only)</li></ul><p>You can also get Pet Shards by participating in events or completing achievements. These are single-use items that permanently swap your pet’s mutation, and they include pet mutations otherwise not available elsewhere. Here are the ones currently available:</p><ul><li><strong>Silver</strong> - obtain by completing Pet Achievements</li><li><strong>Gold</strong> - obtain by completing Pet Achievements</li><li><strong>Rainbow</strong> - obtain by completing Pet Achievements</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575755-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-tools.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575755" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575755-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-tools.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575755"></a><figcaption>The Gear Shop and crafting benches provide players with access to some invaluable tools and gear to help their gardens grow.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575755-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-tools.jpg"></figure><p>Another top tip is to grab some additional tools from the gear shop or craft them at the bench. These can help you improve your pet’s abilities, water your plants more efficiently, and even change cleansing sprays into ones that give plants mutations instead. We highly recommend you save a Basic, Advanced, and Godly sprinkler to craft either a Lightning Rod or Tanning Mirror for 500,000 Sheckles. When you deploy them, they give nearby plants a higher chance to be affected by the Shocked or Sundried mutations during thunderstorms and heatwaves, respectively.</p><p>You can also craft unusual plants by combining seeds and plants like some kind of Frankenstein’s courgette. It’s frankly absurd as a concept, but if you want access to Lingonberries, Mandrakes, and all the other craftable plants, then you’ll need to invest some time, money, and resources into getting them for your garden.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575780-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-admin-abuse.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575780" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575780-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-admin-abuse.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575780"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575780-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-admin-abuse.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Participate_in_Admin_Abuse_events">Participate in Admin Abuse events</h2><p>Before loading up Grow A Garden from the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/126884695634066/Grow-a-Garden" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Roblox main page</a>, you’ll want to pay attention to the section below that tells you when the next event will begin. This is because, in addition to briefly describing what the event entails, it also states that an “Admin Abuse” will occur starting an hour before the update is released.</p><p>Yes, the name is rather unfortunate, but what typically happens during an Admin Abuse is that one of the main creators of the game will appear via big messages on the game screen, similar to the ones that tell you when the shop restocks. They will announce things such as when rare items are being added to the relevant shops, and warn players about certain Admin-only Grow A Garden weather events.</p><p>Having lots of plants with a high resale value in your garden before the Admin Abuse begins is key to making millions of Sheckles per plant. Fill your garden with plants like Bamboo or regrowable plants such as romanesco at least a couple of hours before the new event switchover time to guarantee that you have plenty of valuable crops to sell once the update is complete.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575778-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-cooking.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575778" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575778-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-cooking.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575778"></a><figcaption>Picking up a Cooking Kit will allow you to make food, which is needed for complex crafting recipes and increasing your friendship levels.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575778-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-cooking.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Cook_plants_in_the_cooking_kit">Cook plants in the cooking kit</h2><p>To get a cooking kit, you need to either complete the Common, Rare, or Mythical tier achievements or buy one in the cosmetic shop for 1,000,000 Sheckles. Place it in your garden and have a plant in your hand to then put it into the pot for cooking. You can only put in five plants to make food, so make sure they’re high-value or ones with mutations to increase the chances of getting a food with those same bonuses. The mutation gauge on the cooking kit will increase the more fruits with these multipliers are used in the recipe.</p><p>The advantage of this is that they are worth more friendship points when you feed them to shop owners. Regular food is worth 2 points, while mutated food is worth a lot more for every mutation. Given that there is a 24-hour cooldown before you can feed a shopkeeper again, having many mutations on one plant is vital for ensuring your friendship level increases with as few plants as possible.</p><p>Crafting specific Grow A Garden recipes, such as Corndogs, is simplified because only the type of plant is taken into account when cooking. For example, the corndog requires one plant to act as the stick, one as the meat, and one as the batter. You can use many plants as the stick part, but only a handful are acceptable meats. The batter, in this case, has to be either violet corn or corn.</p><p>You should also have a few cakes on hand, just in case there’s an NPC birthday, as giving them a slice will hand you one of the rarer items from their shop for free. Here are all the NPC birthdays:</p><ul><li><strong>Eloise (Gear shop</strong>) - March 4</li><li><strong>Sam (Seed shop)</strong> - July 2</li><li><strong>Isaac (Cosmetic shop)</strong> - December 1</li><li><strong>Raphael (Egg shop)</strong> - October 30</li><li><strong>Orson (Ascension shop)</strong> - Unknown</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575770-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-merchant.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575770" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575770-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-merchant.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575770"></a><figcaption>Some merchants will only appear once every half an hour next to the Seed Shop.

            <p>Digital Extremes has announced that its upcoming action MMORPG Soulframe will be receiving a founders pack that eager fans can purchase for exclusive items, gear, and a way to make a "permanent mark" on the game.</p>
<p>Announced during the recent Soulframe Devstream 11, the team dove into the latest updates for the nature-themed fantasy game in detail for its keen audience. What these rewards are remains largely a mystery, though we know they'll be themed around the first Envoys (names for play characters): Galene, Pothia, and Josalfar. More information is set to come in the future, but for now the price point and what these items will look like remain a mystery. Though, <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en/founders">the illustration on the Soulframe website could be a pretty good clue</a>.</p>
<p>Digital Extremes also announced that Founders Pack owners would be able to invite a number of their friends to Soulframe: Preludes (Digital Extreme's version of an early beta version of the game). Earlier this year, the company opened the floodgates to any pending or new applications to join these preludes as part of its annual event: Tennocon.</p>

<p>Let's break down the Founders pack. So the "permanent mark" is the initial eyebrow raiser, and could be a callback to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> Founders pack and a particularly cool perk it had. Warframe, Digital Extreme's first MMO, had Founders in-game names attached to specific missions, so players could hover over and see a list of Founders when they were looking around the star map (A sort of mission select). These days, the Founders names are found across the various Relays (player hubs), but nonetheless it's a permanent mark that went down well.</p><p>However, with that Warframe Founders pack came with Excalibur prime, Skana Prime, and Lato Prime. These are suped-up versions of pre-existing frames (playable characters) and weapons, and remain extremely cool pieces of gear that will likely never return to the game, especially given they mark a player who helped Digital Extremes out at their lowest point. However, these items also contribute to your account's mastery rank, a measure of player prestige, which has left some feeling a little sour over the years.</p>
<p>It's as such very unlikely that these Soulframe Founders items will contribute to your Soulframe account's Master level, given this continuous frustration from a portion of the fans. However, this hasn't been stated outright as of writing. An account's Master level in Soulframe provides Virtue points, which can basically be used to increase your ability damage, range, and duration. Though, it's worth noting some weapons scale with Master rank.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Digital Extremes to ask whether these Founders items will contribute to a Soulframe account's Master Rank, and received the following response courtesy of PR: "We’ll have more info to share on Soulframe Founders in the coming weeks".</p>
<p>Also announced in the Soulframe devstream was a small narrative addition to the Waste Bear Fable, a main quest of sorts currently playable in Soulframe: Preludes. In addition, a new interaction with the Witch Vermina will explore the colours of the world, unlocking the dye system for gear customisation.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[King of Meat Review]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/king-of-meat-review.1324108/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>King of Meat is a strange name for a game, to state the obvious, and yet it totally fits the daft modern cartoon vibe that it’s going for, with bizarro riffs on quirky jokes running throughout. Set in Loregok, a techno-medieval world that’s gone absolutely ga-ga for the titular game show, your path to stardom is to dive into the dungeons, overcome platforming challenges, battle past skeleton minions, and make it through to the end. And you can become a star dungeon designer as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="King of Meat: Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/stZ0Vvfvd6s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That’s right, this is dungeon crawling by way of the dearly departed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/littlebigplanet">LittleBigPlanet</a> – and this makes complete sense given Glowmade’s background. Where LIttleBigPlanet pioneered accessible User Generated Content (UGC), this has exploded in importance over the last few years with the likes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/roblox">Roblox</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> becoming home to entire universes of created game experiences. King of Meat is much closer to a LittleBigPlanet or a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/05/05/review-modnation-racers/">ModNation Racers</a> in scope, sticking to its particular genre and trying to nail the fundamentals.</p>



<p>With that in mind, the third-person platforming and dungeoneering is eminently accessible. You’ve got a jump and a Yoshi-like flutter jump that is basically all you need to get around the world, and then there’s a variety of weapons for when enemies spawn and rush towards you. You start off with sword and shield and a crossbow for a bit of range, but can swap those out for a hammer, grenade launcher, knuckle dusters and more that you unlock as you progress. The melee weapons all have particular styles, basic and charged attacks, and attack combos that you can quickly learn.</p>

<p>Alongside these core weapons are a gradually growing range of magical abilities, first with a bellowing belch that will repel all before you, or a simple healing flask that can come in handy for tougher levels, and beyond to giant horse hooves stamping down from above.</p>
<p>You’ll apply all of this to levels that blend together platforming, combat and puzzling. Glowmade has stuffed the game with around 100 levels – created, in-game, by Komstructor – and they run the gamut of ideas, being sorted into three buckets of difficulty and labelled with generalised tags for what to expect from them.</p>
<p>It’s nice and easy-going on the whole. Combat does lack a bit of oomph to it, and it can often feel like you’re not really doing much to the hordes you’re battling – possibly because, for the tougher enemies, you really aren’t. When there’s four of you, you can always pick up buddies that have been downed, or they can give up and respawn from the gloop cans at the next checkpoint, but if all of you are downed, it’s game over. I really enjoyed some of the examples of puzzling that I saw, though, leveraging the basics of switch pulling, button shooting, and bringing power cells to key locations alongside game logic to provide some light brain teasers. One example had you pulling switches in order, Simon Says style, while another had multiple switch combos opening different doors. A bit trickier to manage when playing without voice communication, mind you.</p>

<p>And, of course, a lot of that will sound instantly familiar to anyone who explored the creation tools of LBP or Dreams. There’s a straightforward logic engine running in the background that can be twisted and bent to create all manner of things, from simply spawning in enemies as you and your team enter a room, to setting spike and flame traps to run on timers, program platforms to move around the world as you need, and much, much more complicated tasks.</p>
<p>The creation tools try to make all of that as manageable as possible, and I think Glowmade has done a fantastic job of organising those tools and providing the views you need. It starts with a blueprint phase where you place and connect rooms and hallways together, matching up their doors together, and it’s here that you’ll really realise that this dungeon builder works entirely on a single plane, albeit with doors on two levels and the ability to raise and lower the scenery within these spaces. That does put some shackles on what you could create, but that’s not really a bad thing.</p>
<p>From there you can switch to a 3D view and manipulate the scenery, put in place those traps, enemies and spawners, and then delve into the nitty-gritty of hooking up and configuring the logic behind it all.</p>

<p>Again, there’s huge amounts of potential and possibilities here –&nbsp;a user level I saw shrouded the whole level in darkness, with braziers flaring only as you reached certain points, forcing you to fight enemies mostly in the dark –&nbsp;and that can be hugely rewarding if you have the time and the desire to really embrace this. It can also be a bit daunting and overwhelming to try and come up with a concept and then actually make it. It’s really down to the player themselves what they want to get out of this, but I’ve come to be more of a consumer of UGC games than a creator.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of joy to simply consuming King of Meat, though. This is a fun setting, with the shared space lobby area having you run back and forth between different vendors, who always have quirky things to chat to you about. Then there’s the interstitial cartoons, which are all fantastic and lean right in on modern cartoon styles with an excellently pitched sense of humour. It’s absolutely geared towards younger gamers, but adults will get a wry smile out of it too. Oh, and I’ve got to mention the announcer who introduces each level and booms over your achievements like it’s a cross between Wipeout and Robot Wars.</p>

			<p>Square Enix Game Director Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGVWVq8cJPI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was at last week's Brasil Game Show 2025</a> to discuss Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 and the trilogy as a whole. Speaking about the decision to split the original game into three parts, he explained:</p>



<p><em>Final Fantasy VII is a game with a truly huge fanbase. We could have cut some parts and turned it into one game, but the fans of the original would never have forgiven us. If we want to tell this story using new technology, it's not possible to do so in a single title. That's why we made the difficult decision to split it into three parts.</em></p>



<p>Later in the interview on stage, Hamaguchi expressed confidence that the ending of the final chapter of the trilogy would satisfy both new and old fans:</p>



<p><em>Of course, I already have a clear idea of ​​the ending for Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3. I think this conclusion will appeal to both those who loved the original and those who became fans of FF7 thanks to the Remake series. I'm confident this new game will be loved by everyone.</em></p>



<p>Nearly a year ago, Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-director-wants-to-add-a-different-twist-for-a-new-and-exciting-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 would need some twist to make it a unique and exciting experience compared to the previous two. We still don't know what that will be, but we recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-tetsuya-nomura/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did get confirmation from Tetsuya Nomura</a> (another director on the series) that the game (and Kingdom Hearts IV, too) is on schedule.</p>



<p>Looking at the four-year timespan between Final Fantasy VII Remake and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, we might have to wait another two to three years before the conclusion to the remake trilogy is out. Meanwhile, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous games are launching on Xbox Series S|X and Nintendo Switch 2</a>, starting with the first chapter.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Creator Doubles Down on Who Dropped The First Nuke]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-creator-double-down-first-nuke-drop/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-creator-doubles-down-on-who-dropped-the-first-nuke.1324096/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In 2023, Fallout’s creator, Tim Cain, uploaded a video explaining <strong>which country </strong>dropped the first nukes in the Fallout universe. It was revealed that it was <strong>China </strong>that fired first, which put to rest the assumptions made by many over the game’s twenty-plus-year history.</p>



<p>Now, in an all-new video, Tim Cain has doubled down on his confirmation, explaining in more depth <strong>why </strong>China fired first. It’s lore that is mostly understood by die-hard fans, but it’s always nice to get a little more of a backstory for a universe so expansive and densely populated as Fallout’s.</p>



<h2 id="h-china-fired-first">China Fired First</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-first-nukes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Two years ago</a>, Tim Cain confirmed that China dropped the first nuke in Fallout, kicking off the Great War and bringing about the destruction of the entire planet:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The reason we got nuked is: bio-weapons were illegal and somehow China found out we were doing FEV. And they were like, ‘You have to stop it.’ And we went, ‘Okay’. But all we did is move it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a new video, Cain once again touched on the topic and went into more depth about why China dropped the first wave of nukes on the United States:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>China nuked first.</p>



<p>It’s pretty obvious from the game. This isn’t canon, but let me explain what I mean and why we thought that. </p>



<p>In the original game we had established that the US was doing bio-weapons research. We weren’t supposed to, we had signed a UN treaty saying we wouldn’t do that, and I think you can find that out in the game. China discovered that we were doing it, but how did they discover that? </p>



<p>Espionage. </p>



<p>We went, ‘Oops our bad we’ll stop doing it. But we just kept on doing it, we just moved the research to another base. It’s the hidden base where you discover ZAX the supercomputer.</p>



<p>They just nuked us. We nuked back, other countries nuked, because all anyone saw was missiles flying. China technically started it by firing the first nuke, but you could argue that technically the US started it by doing illegal bio-weapons research then lying about it multiple times.</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>It’s an expansion on what we already knew, but Fallout fans <strong>love </strong>this kind of lore, so they’ll eat it up (myself included).</p>



<p>In the video, Tim Cain goes on to talk about Fallout-themed tidbits, such as why Vault Suits look the way they do, and how some brands wound up being implemented in the universe. It’s a treasure trove for the game’s biggest fans, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>If you’re planning on booting up Battlefield 6 with a Cronus Zen attached, there’s bad news waiting for you. In a series of posts on social media, it has been revealed that users are receiving account suspensions from Electronic Arts when trying to play Battlefield 6 using a Cronus Zen, an infamous piece of technology mostly used by malicious operators in games.</p>



<p>An image uploaded to social media showed that<strong> </strong>Electronic Arts is <strong>permanently blocking access </strong>to Battlefield 6 for those found to be using a Cronus Zen in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-won-t-prosper">You Won’t Prosper</h2>



<p>The Cronus Zen input device has long been the face of controversy in the gaming world, simply because it offers malicious advantages to those using it. It can massively reduce recoil, aid with accuracy, and introduce macros that users can lean on to gain an upper hand over their opponents, and it works on both PC and console platforms.</p>



<p>In a string of posts on social media, users started sharing images of bans after trying to boot Battlefield 6 with a Cronus Zen engaged:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The discourse has proven that both console and PC platforms are being impacted by these punitive actions, which have been met with jubilation from fans worldwide. In one post, a user wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Cronus</strong> Zen community is losing their minds and getting banned on <strong>Battlefield</strong> 6 lmao. How about play the game how it was intended to be played and have fun?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was stated that the ‘lead programmer’ for the Cronus lineup has mentioned how the device is ‘cooked’ for Battlefield 6, and that the team has advised users <span><strong>not to</strong></span><strong> </strong>use their Cronus Zen when playing the all-new FPS title.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a huge win for Electronic Arts? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re thinking.</p>

<p>Before we get to this, it appears there's apparently one more update in the form of a live stream. This Japanese broadcast will take place next week on 21st October 2025 and will share the "latest updates" about the title's story mode, chronicle mode and versus mode.

<p>Fingers crossed this is just an update about the game's content, and Level-5 can reconfirm this latest entry really will be arriving next month on Nintendo platforms. The previous delay in July 2025 was apparently tied to recordings, localisation and "other related processes". More recently, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/new-inazuma-eleven-victory-road-trailer-dives-into-level-5s-repeatedly-delayed-baller">we also got a new trailer for the title</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 7 Beta Matches Were ‘Nearly 99%’ Cheater-Free]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-matches-beta-cheaters-free/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-beta-matches-were-%E2%80%98nearly-99-%E2%80%99-cheater-free.1324084/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a post on social media, Activision’s Team RICOCHET has highlighted that ‘nearly 99%’ of matches in the Black Ops 7 beta were free of cheaters. This statistic has already been met with criticism, with many users claiming that they had cheaters or other malicious operators in their matches during the open beta.</p>



<p>Team RICOCHET has remained positive, emphasizing continuous improvements, and the median time to identify cheaters has been reduced to ‘under three matches’. What’s not clear is how many matches that 1% represents. Is it 1000 matches, or 100,000 matches?</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-still-won-t-be-free-of-cheaters">Black Ops 7 Still Won’t Be Free of Cheaters</h2>



<p>It’s impossible to rid Black Ops 7 of cheaters entirely, as with each new improvement made by Team RICOCHET, the world’s cheat manufacturers respond with their own evolutions. It’s a never-ending battle that can only <span><strong>improve&nbsp;</strong>and will never be entirely resolved</span>.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1977766811916746869" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent post</a> on social media, Team RICOCHET stressed those improvements:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve crunched the numbers for Black Ops 7 Beta, and RICOCHET Anti-Cheat achieved the strongest Beta results in Call of Duty history. </p>



<p>Each&nbsp;day, our cheat detections got faster and your matches got cleaner. </p>



<p>By the end:</p>



<ul>
<li>Nearly 99% of matches were cheater-free</li>



<li>The median detection time for cheaters was three matches.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>Clips still surfaced online of cheaters ruining the fun for legitimate players worldwide, but Activision was quick to stamp these out and point out that the wrongdoers had been forcefully removed from the Call of Duty platform.</p>



<p>In recent years, Call of Duty has suffered immeasurably under the weight of cheaters, especially in modes like the game’s ranked play platforms. It’s a gruelling place to try and enjoy yourself, and it always seems like it ebbs and flows quite dramatically.</p>



<p>This year, the hope for Call of Duty players is that Team RICOCHET is in the best place possible and that foul cheaters worldwide have their attentions fixed elsewhere, such as on the recent release of Battlefield or the upcoming 1.0 launch of Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>I’m not wishing ill will on those games, but the diversification might help spread the cheaters across a wider base rather than having them all focus on one game.</p>



<p>Will it be enough to propel Black Ops 7 into a better space when it’s released next month? Let me know what you think on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-jurassic-world-evolution-3-have-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-jurassic-world-evolution-3-have-early-access.1324075/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Jurassic World Evolution 3 is right around the corner, but is there early access so you can play even sooner than that normal release date?</p>



<p>Looking at the calendar will fill sandbox fans with joy that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date is nearly here</a>, but sometimes, the super fans will do all they can to get their hands on a game as soon as possible.</p>



<p>Here is the answer to whether or not Jurassic World Evolution 3 has early access.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-jurassic-world-evolution-3-in-early-access">Can You Play Jurassic World Evolution 3 in Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Can you guys see any early access up there? Image via Frontier</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is no early access available for Jurassic World Evolution 3. Everyone will have access to the game on October 21 at 10 AM ET.</strong></p>



<p>Life may find a way, but early access did not find a way to follow <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a> to release. The sandbox and park simulation game will have you building up your own Jurassic World amusement park, which has always gone well for people in the movies, right? Whether that is on PC, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X, you will have to wait until the 21st to get your dino fix in.</p>



<p>Sometimes, a video game release will work in a three-day early access release for players who purchase a deluxe edition, but that is not included this time around. Instead, all you get for the extra $15 spent on the deluxe is four additional family units and some bonus skins and scenery. Whether or not that is worth it is completely up to your tastes.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-jurassic-world-evolution-3-have-a-playable-demo">Does Jurassic World Evolution 3 Have a Playable Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, no, there is not a playable demo available for Jurassic World Evolution 3 either. Your only chance to play the game is to buy it outright.</strong></p>



<p>With this being the third game, you could maybe find the previous two games for cheap to see if you like it before spending the full price tag on <a href="https://www.jurassicworldevolution.com/en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a>. That, or if you are an Xbox Game Pass subscriber, you can play the second game with your subscription.</p>



<p>When it comes to demos, many games these days avoid offering them to players. The thinking for that is, while it could be exciting for some players to give the game a try and fall in love with it, others may be turned off, and then the developer and publisher wouldn’t get any money out of the deal. It sucks, but that is where we are in gaming.</p>

<p>With this in mind, Time Magazine's website has featured the Switch 2 on its "best inventions" list of 2025. This list features 300 of the "best inventions making the world better, smarter, and more fun", and includes categories like robotics, accessibility, apps and software, and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 is listed under the 'Entertainment &amp; Gaming' category, which is all about revolutionising how "we play, create, and consume content". One other notable device featured on this list is the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/tags/rog-xbox-ally">ROG Xbox Ally X</a>. Here's the attached description for the Switch 2, along with a list of the other inventions featured in this category:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The original Nintendo Switch rewrote the rules for portable gaming. Its 2025 sequel increases the power without sacrificing portability. A sampling of its impressive stats: An Nvidia Tegra T239 chip, alongside dedicated ray-tracing and Deep Learning Super-Sampling (DLSS) cores, lets the new model run at 4K on TVs, while the on-device 7.9-inch HDR display runs handheld titles at 1080p and 120Hz, meaning there’s no flicker during gameplay. Its 12 GB of LPDDR5X memory also helps keep sprawling open worlds stutter-free. Launched in June, the console sold 3.5 million units in its first week—making it Nintendo’s fastest-selling hardware ever."</p>

<p>The Switch 2 was also recently shortlisted for a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/mario-kart-world-and-donkey-kong-bananza-shortlisted-for-console-game-of-the-year">'best gaming hardware' award</a> alongside the system's Pro Controller.

<p>Say hello to 'Nintendo Fukuoka'</p>

<p>Further details are scarce at the moment, but Nintendo says the store will be located in JR Hakata City (Amu Plaza), a large shopping mall consisting of clothing stores, furnishing retailers, restaurants, and more.</p>
<p>Fukuoka is the sixth-largest city in Japan and the capital of the Fukuoka prefecture. It's located within the Kyushu island of Japan, meaning it's significantly separate from the main industry island of Honshu, home to Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Nagoya, and Hiroshima.</p>

<p>The upcoming Nintendo Fukuoka store will join existing branches in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto, the latter of which opened in October 2023. Meanwhile, joining Nintendo New York in America is the new San Francisco branch, which recently opened on 15th May 2025.</p>
<p>Nintendo of America President and COO Doug Bowser led the ribbon-cutting ceremony, and the store offers customers the opportunity to customise their Switch Joy-Con colours. Miniature replicas of the store's character statues are also available.</p>

<p>Including achievements and a new name...</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Argonaut Games has announced its Croc remaster is getting a major update. It's officially titled <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/croc_legend_of_the_gobbos">Croc Legend of the Gobbos: Platinum Edition</a></strong>.</p>
<p>This free update will be applied to the console versions of the game (including Switch) on <strong>16th October 2025</strong> and promises to deliver the "best possible Croc gaming experience".</p>
<p>The 'Platinum Edition' of the game will include a new Time Attack mode, 25+ additions to the Crocipedia, the ability to swap between Croc Main Theme mixes in the main menu, bug fixes, and a bunch of quality-of-life features and improvements.</p>
<p>The team also explains how the name change is tied to PlayStation's Trophies system. This same update adds a new trophy set and will also bring these same achievements to the Switch (including its own "in-game Achievement tracking screen").</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"So why the new name? Great question! When we initially launched the <em>Croc Legend of the Gobbos</em> remaster<em>,</em> we didn’t include enough trophies to qualify for the Platinum trophy on PlayStation. And it’s not permitted to simply fix this with a patch. So we had to come up with a smarter solution: release a new version of the game with a comprehensive trophy set, including 16 new Trophies and the highly coveted Platinum Trophy."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, this update is out later this week for the Switch. You can learn more about this title in our Nintendo Life review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Croc: Legend of the Gobbos wasn’t exactly a revolutionary entry in the 3D platforming genre even back when it released, and though it still doesn’t necessarily ‘wow’ us today, it certainly is an entertaining and worthwhile adventure. Things like the new controls, enhanced presentation, and extensive museum content are satisfying additions, and the core adventure itself is still good retro 3D platforming fun, warts and all."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 review embargo date is quickly approaching, giving everyone a first glimpse at what you can expect from the upcoming game from your favorite critic or content creator.</p>



<p>This sequel is easily <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-the-outer-worlds-2-pre-order-bonuses-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the more anticipated games of 2025</a>, with many RPG fans ready to jump back into this galactic universe full of flawed people and chaos.</p>



<p>Here is when you can expect The Outer Worlds 2 review embargo to lift.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-review-embargo-date-explained">The Outer Worlds 2 Review Embargo Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No need to rush, the reviews are coming soon. Image by Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Outer Worlds 2 review embargo is set for October 23 at 9 AM ET.</strong></p>



<p>When the clock strikes 9 in the morning along the East Coast, you can expect plenty of sites and YouTube channels to start dropping their reviews for the game. If you are curious if one of your favorite critics or content creators is covering the game, you should consider checking their social media accounts. Many have already posted that they are playing the game early and will be working on a review when the time comes.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-review-scores-prediction">The Outer Worlds 2 Review Scores Prediction</h2>



<p><strong>Given that the game is a direct sequel and will do many of the same things that the original did, but expanded, you can probably expect The Outer Worlds 2 to have a similar review score to the first game. Somewhere between 83-87 makes sense for this kind of game.</strong></p>



<p>The first Outer Worlds game sits at 85 on MetaCritic, with the remastered Spacer’s Choice at 72 because of performance issues and not really bettering the experience in any way. Unless the sequel is absolutely mired in bugs and glitches, it shouldn’t fare too poorly with critics.</p>



<p>To some who are thinking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-the-outer-worlds-2-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a> might be their most anticipated game of 2025, an 85 might seem low. Of course, we haven’t played the game yet to know for sure, but that is actually a very good score for any game release, let alone an RPG. That being said, if you are expecting the game to contend with other top games this year that reach well into the 90s, you might come away disappointed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Obsidian Entertainment</a> is a brilliant development studio with tons of talent and a great back catalog of games, they’ve never been one to have a game score 90 on MetaCritic outside of Pentiment, which was a shock to just about everyone. We’re willing to be surprised, but don’t expect it.</p>



<hr>



<p>What are your guesses for The Outer Worlds 2 review scores? Do you think it can contend for the best Obsidian games ever? Or will it be more in line with the original game? Let us know in the comments or on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

                <p>In June, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fbc-firebreak-review-controlled-chaos/1900-6418376/">FBC: Firebreak</a> became Remedy's first self-published game as the company attempted to expand its shared universe that includes Control and Alan Wake. Remedy has previously disclosed that Firebreak's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-is-unsatisfied-with-fbc-firebreak-sales-but-it-still-plans-to-turn-things-around/1100-6533852/" data-ref-id="1100-6533852">sales came in below expectations</a>, but the latest report indicates that the game will cost the company a very significant write down.</p><p>Ahead of Remedy's quarterly financial report on October 29, the company <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=b4d23a32-03e7-49e5-bbc3-93ec062699a5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared an update</a> that it is on the hook for a €14.9 million loss or approximately $17,234,085. Remedy notes that this amounts to "a majority of the game’s capitalized development costs," before adding that the company's cash position hasn't been changed by this setback.</p><p>Firebreak ran into trouble out of the gate with 1,992 players on launch day, which turned out to be its peak. Those numbers <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/#max" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">have since drastically fallen</a> to less than 100 concurrent players per day. Remedy subsequently acknowledged that players were particularly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-fbc-firebreak-update-will-address-the-game-frustrating-opening-hour/1100-6533265/" data-ref-id="1100-6533265">unhappy with the first hour of the game</a> and promised to rectify its shortcomings with a future update.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFx8yMOC67w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rFx8yMOC67w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Remedy rolled out the Breakpoint update at the end of September, which included a playable tutorial for new players that walks them through the basics, while adding context for the game's world, including The Oldest House from Control. The update also made significant changes to how players pick their missions. However, Remedy noted in its report that the update has not met its' "internal targets" despite earning "improved player and sales metrics."</p><p>The company is currently working <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-alan-wake-2-every-game-remedy-is-working-on-right-now/1100-6514998/" data-ref-id="1100-6514998">on Control 2</a>, in addition to the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake project alongside Rockstar Games. Remedy's October 29 report may include more details about those games.</p>

<p>Get ready, trainers</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>The end of this month officially marks the first anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> on mobile devices.</p>
<p>This title has been regularly updated with new expansions and features like trading, and soon it will receive even more "new and updated" features in the form of three major updates "coming soon".</p>
<p>There's the new share feature, the tradable cards list is being expanded, and there'll be improvements to the wonder pick feature. Here's some PR about each feature, and you can see it all in action in the trailer above.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implementation of the new share feature</strong>
<ul>
<li>A feature that lets you give ♢–♢♢♢♢ rarity cards to friends.</li>
<li>You can send one card to each of your friends each day.</li>
<li>Once friends send you cards through the share feature, you can select and receive one card each day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Range of tradable cards expanded</strong>
<ul>
<li>You will be able to trade cards from even the most recent booster packs.</li>
<li>In addition to cards of ♢–♢♢♢♢ rarity and ⭐︎1 rarities, ⭐︎2 and Shiny 1–Shiny 2 rarity cards will also be eligible for trading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Improvements to the wonder pick feature</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cards from the latest expansion that you have not obtained will appear more often.</li>
<li>The number of cards you currently own will be displayed on each card in wonder pick.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The team says it's working hard to bring these updates to players "in the best possible way" and continues to listen to player feedback while developing and maintaining the title. The Mega Evolution expansion will also kick off at the end of October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is having another one of its "<a href="https://zdcs.link/9gjONe?object_uuid=74b18853-6a80-450b-b150-73f3aece1d26&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Buy 2 Get 1 50% Off</strong></a>" sales and it is absolutely filled to the brim with puzzles this time around. There are hundreds of options included in this sale from some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">best puzzle brands</a> out there. If you're on the hunt for your next puzzle, or are just looking to grab a nice gift for the puzzler in your life, this promotion makes it a great time to save some money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To take advantage of the promotion, you'll just need to add two eligible jigsaw puzzles to your Amazon cart and the 50% discount will be applied to whichever one is the least expensive. And since it isn't just puzzles included (there are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-buy-1-get-1-half-off-board-game-sale-october-2025">board games as well</a>), you can also mix and match with other items to still get that discount. I've gathered some of my top picks from this sale below, but there's a ton of other options available if you want to browse the sale yourself.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Jigsaw Puzzle Sale on Amazon Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like I mentioned above, there are a <em>ton</em> of puzzles included in this sale. I couldn't possibly include them all, so I've only highlighted a few top picks that I think best represent what is included here. There's a fairly wide variety of piece counts, from 300 to 3000, but I mostly stuck to 1000-piece puzzles here as they are the most popular whenever I've covered a puzzle sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are looking for some suggestions for what to buy, the Spider-Verse puzzle from Buffalo games has been on our list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzles-for-adults">best puzzles for adults</a> for over a year now. It's got a ton of different Spideys and is consistently one of the most popular marvel puzzles out there. There's also the Disney &amp; Pixar Shop puzzle from Ravensburger that offers something similar for fans of Disney instead of Marvel. There's a bunch of characters and easter eggs hidden in each one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'd also recommend checking out The Drippy Trip puzzle. It's the latest puzzle made by The Magic Puzzle Company and actually <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-series-five-magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzle-features-art-from-an-adventure-time-designer">features a few fun secrets</a> from the popular cartoon Adventure Time. If you aren't familiar with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzles">Magic Puzzle Company Puzzles</a>, they are a mix between jigsaw puzzle and magic kit and are generally very popular with families. There have been five different series of these types of puzzles and Amazon has a bunch of them featured in this sale right now.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Board Games Are Also Included</h3><div catalogid="c50f91cc-9caf-48e8-84b9-2ba2d04822db" id="229501"><div id="229501" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buy 1 Get 1 50% Off Board Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon's buy 1, get 1 50% off sale also extends to board games.

From our in-house, best-in-class photogrammetry to full-body mo-cap and even our bespoke enemy AI systems, every single bit of Unleash the Avatar has been lovingly hand-crafted.”</p><p>Mayya added, “Every wishlist counts because not only does it build our confidence that we’re making something you care about, but it signals to the world that Indian games have an audience. So if the trailer resonates with you and if you believe in a bold spin on the Soulslike genre from a scrappy team, please hit that wishlist button now.”</p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><div><p><strong>■ Latest Informaton</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Independent game developer Aeos Games revealed a substantial amount of gameplay for its upcoming Indian Epics-inspired Soulslike, <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>. The events of the game are set in an alternate version of India where the player is up against the wayward forces of Naraka (hell) who manage to unseal the barrier between realms. Along with challenging enemy encounters and memorable boss fights, players will also uncover the events that led to hell on earth and fight back the darkness for good.</p><p>The trailer shows off the haunting vistas of Vishwapur. This once pristine coastal locale is now overrun by Nisthari Rakshas. Players are tasked with defeating them with an assortment of combat options at their disposal ranging from genre staples like dodge, parry, and stagger attacks along with some new innovations like a ranged chakra and a flashy feather prism form.</p><p><strong>■ FAQ</strong></p><p>First up, we’d like to thank each and every one of you for your support for <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>. It’s heartening to see so many people care. Our team is heads down and working to get the game out so that we can live up to your expectations.</p><p>Now, before we start getting into how exactly <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is built in terms of tech, art, world, and story, here’s all the basic information about the game in one place. This should clear doubts you have about <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> and what to expect.</p><p><strong>Who is Aeos Games?</strong></p><p>Aeos Games is the game development studio behind <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> and is a part of the Aeos group of companies. Founders are brothers Varun and Rohan Mayya. The core development team is a mix of newcomers and industry veterans that have worked on games such as <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>; and movies like <em>Shazam</em>&nbsp;and <em>Flash</em>.</p><p><strong>What is Unleash the Avatar?</strong></p><p><em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is an Indian Epic Soulslike set in an alternate timeline featuring flashy, intense combat against legendary foes.</p><p><strong>What’s <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>‘s story about? What’s my character called?</strong></p><p>While it’s a little too early for us to reveal all of <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>‘s story, what we can say is, the game takes place in an age where the barrier between Naraka (Hell) and Earth has eroded and both Asuras and Rakshasas—have found their way to Earth. Imbued with a sliver of Lord Vishnu’s power, it is up to you to restore balance to the universe by putting an end to the demons’ sinister plans.</p><p><strong>Why is there an alternate India setting in this trailer that’s more inline with high fantasy instead of the relatively modern setting of the first trailer?</strong></p><p>The first trailer was meant to be a test of our photogrammetry systems and a public showing of our intent to work on a title from India.</p><p>Following feedback from our fans we felt the alternate high fantasy, Indian Epics-inspired setting you see now is more in line with the story we want to tell—and what our fans want to see—from a game like ours.</p><p><strong>What can I play <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> on? Can I wishlist it now?</strong></p><p>For now, <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is slated for <a title="Platforms > PC [24,525 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via Steam. We’re currently evaluating other platforms as well and will announce them en route to launch.

No battle passes. No loot boxes. No daily grind. No dark patterns.</p><p><strong>When will I be able to play <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>?</strong></p><p>Remember that this is our first production title so we may not be super accurate with our launch dates as it is hard to tell right now. Internally however, we’re on course for a 2026 launch window. We’re currently in the production phase so we do have playtests every now and then. If you would like to be a part of these, keep an eye on our socials for playtest announcement dates.</p><p><strong>Can I make videos on <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>? Will you copyright strike my channel? Is there an <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> creators program?</strong></p><p>Yes you can make videos on <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> and no we won’t copyright strike your channel. There are exceptions to this such as using <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> art, screenshots, videos, and gameplay to misrepresent the game or being in violation of our content creator guidelines. And yes, there is an <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> creators program. Stay tuned to our socials to know more.</p><p><strong>Is <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2?</strong></p><p>For now, <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> is slated for PC via Steam. We’re currently evaluating other platforms as well and will announce them en route to launch.</p><p><strong>Can I play <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> on the Steam Deck / ROG Ally / Xbox ROG Ally X / Lenovo Legion Go 2?</strong></p><p>We’re big fans of handheld PCs and we’d love to bring <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> to Steam Deck and other devices as well. Right now though, our focus is solely on desktops and laptop-grade computers.</p><p><strong>Is AI used in making <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>?</strong></p><p>If you’re referring to enemy AI systems that are a cornerstone of every soulslike, yes those exist. If you’re asking if we’re using generative AI tools to make Unleash the Avatar, the answer is no. The game is handcrafted with love by fans of the genre, using gen AI would be a disservice to soulslikes and their fans.</p><p><strong>Is there anything new that we get to see in <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> that isn’t in other games?</strong></p><p>Built from first principles, <em>Unleash the Avatar</em> runs on several custom systems: a fragmented-chakra engine with its own physics, enemy AI that knows when to reset posture, when to press, and how hard to push (tuned centrally), and a rigorously engineered parry model. Add generous chances to aura farm, and you get a soulslike that feels familiar, yet unmistakably new. We’ve also manually scanned countless photogrammetry assets from old towns in India specifically for <em>Unleash the Avatar</em>, so enjoy an authentic reconstruction of India in a video game!</p></div><p>Watch the trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/indian-epics-inspired-soulslike-action-rpg-unleash-the-avatar-early-alpha-gameplay-trailer]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">In April, the PEGI ratings website <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reportedly-been-rated-for-the-switch-2/1100-6531001/">listed Switch 2 as a platform for Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. On top of that, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot teased that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-exec-teases-new-versions-amid-switch-2-rumors/1100-6533378/">the game would get "new versions</a> that will come to other machines" in July. Assassin's Creed Shadows launched in March on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-announces-vantage-studios-a-creative-house-focused-on-three-major-franchises/1100-6535136/">Ubisoft revealed Vantage Studios</a>, which will oversee development on the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises. There also recently was a report that Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-canceled-civil-war-based-assassins-creed-over-controversy-concerns-report/1100-6535320/">canned an American Civil War-based Assassin's Creed game</a> because of concerns it would be too controversial.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/">Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>. The game is set in feudal Japan, following the shinobi Naoe and samurai Yasuke.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="25b964ba-1595-45a4-84b1-e7d705f5dc6c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/astrobotanica" rel="nofollow"><em>Astrobotanica</em></a>&nbsp;is an indie survival title being developed by&nbsp;Space Goblin Studio. Funded through a Kickstarter campaign, the title offers a relaxing survival experience during the prehistoric era of Earth. Playing as an alien named Xel, you have the technology to scan plants, animals, and cavemen, create various tonics that can cure illnesses, decrease air needs, and more. I've been interested in the game since I first heard about the Kickstarter campaign and jumped at the chance to dive into the demo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bulk of the demo consists of scanning different plants to learn what they do, interacting with one caveman named Ube, and solving puzzles. It gives a relatively well-rounded feel of what&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;offers to the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="taxonomy_term" data-entity-uuid="a90d9136-1388-4f79-8f46-10943fc6369d" href="https://techraptor.net/genre/survival" rel="nofollow">survival genre</a> mechanics wise. You scan plants and animals to see what they are. Scanning Neanderthals allows you to see what their current health status is. Interacting with them gives you to the chance to heal them and learn their language. Plants have different properties raw and when made into a tonic, with tonic making being a frequent action for surviving.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xel-scanning-ube-caveman-astrobotanica.jpg?itok=l_z1185A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xel-scanning-ube-caveman-astrobotanica.jpg?itok=v6sH8amU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are plenty of puzzles to solve. From collecting trophies to put in specific places, using plant juices, or pushing orbs found in ruins to their correct position, the puzzles stand out as one of the interesting parts of the game. Not only were there multiple things to solve, all of the puzzles were different. If this variety is kept up in the complete version it will give&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;the ability to stand out amongst competitors that have 2-3 puzzle layouts that repeat with various difficulty through those titles.</p>

<h2>Lacking a Hook</h2>

<p>While most of the game mechanics are well explained, there is zero story tying game aspects together. Why are you on this planet? Why do you want to heal Neanderthals? What is your name? The only way you find out what you're called or your appearance is from the P.R.I.M.A.L. tab. Besides that, there's little else to really give you a reason to do, well, anything. If you don't watch any trailers, read the in-depth Steam page description, or skim through news about&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>, you have no idea what the game is about. What is the over-arcing goal that you're meant to work towards?</p>

<p>Hopefully the lack of narrative is due to the demo being a small sample of the early access version.&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;is supposed to be rich with lore, and hints of that are present. You can find different idols and stone tablets while exploring the demo area. However, what they represent or say, and even where they are stored in your inventory, are mysteries.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/juice-puzzle-astrobotanica.jpg?itok=jNAgGHYc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/juice-puzzle-astrobotanica.jpg?itok=-9Pc0FlH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Regardless of missing narrative, there is a quest tracker that updates as you complete various tasks. These include scanning a plant, making a tonic, and healing Ube. There's no real draw to it, though. No fanfare is made when an objective is complete. It's not the biggest issue, but being reminded that a task changed and you're focusing on something else certainly helps streamline the quest cycle.</p>

<p>Other missing items include map markers on the map or being able to put a marker on the map. Even when you buy the P.R.I.M.A.L. HUD upgrade, the map remains unchanged and pretty much useless since you'll be using the HUD compass for all your navigation needs. Since you only have access to the first level of upgrades, map markers could be listed later on.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astrobotanica-primal-tab.jpg?itok=l_MNnIvf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astrobotanica-primal-tab.jpg?itok=iRIL09a3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>One other massive aspect of&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;that was missing in the demo was building. Many open-world survival games have building as one of the big draws to playing. You can design your own camp, create an epic castle, grow massive gardens, etc. The same can be said for this game based on the Kickstarter information. When it comes to the demo, you can't do any building aside from placing garden plots in the demo. You can see some structures you'll be able to construct in the future, but can't actually place them in the world, even if you do unlock the plan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game struggled as I continued to play. By the time I wrapped up my three hour session, it was consistently lagging, sluggish to load areas as I moved around, and put excess strain on my PC. This is a concern for players on older computers and those that like long gaming sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;may have a unique premise and story that is ready to set it apart from the competition, but with no narrative present in the demo and lacking many staple mechanics of the survival genre, it's hard to see it. Open world survival crafting games are extremely popular, with titles like&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="72a14f4d-4d77-4ace-a3aa-09008b8c98bf" href="https://techraptor.net/games/palworld" rel="nofollow">Palworld</a>,</em>&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="294eedd9-16ba-4c31-9a65-967aeca4d3fc" href="https://techraptor.net/games/enshrouded" rel="nofollow"><em>Enshrouded</em></a>, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5840301c-ab91-4d31-a561-7a7d64d82464" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/dune-awakening-interview-art-directors-gavin-whelan-and-david-levy" rel="nofollow"><em>Dune: Awakening</em></a>, and <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fbd23abe-125c-4cba-8afc-994aaf0735ef" href="https://techraptor.net/games/rust" rel="nofollow">Rust</a>.</em>&nbsp;It's a competitive niche to launch a game in.</p>

<p>Many of these smaller issues could be in development and were simply unready for the demo. Nonetheless, playing the demo didn't hook me. There was no story to grab my attention, and the mechanics present weren't unique enough to keep me wanting more.</p>

                <p>The details surrounding the first pack of paid DLC for Borderlands 4 have been revealed. Dropping November 20th, this narrative-based content--called Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day--will feature all new missions, enemies and legendary gear. </p><p>Developer Gearbox Software shared these details on October 11 during a panel at PAX Australia. Apparently, Mercenary Day (think Christmas) is being threatened by the Timekeeper’s Minister of Culture. It’s up to Rush and the vault hunters to show them the error of their ways using an assortment of guns, grenades, and all manner of skill-based attacks. </p>

<p>Aside from the loot gained from completing missions and extra collectibles (like a new Drone Skin or Vault Hunter Style), players will also gain access to a Vault Card with unlockable rewards. There will be 24 cosmetic items to collect and 4 pieces of rerollable gear that can be earned multiple times, giving players a chance to roll each weapon with the “right” stats.</p><h3>The Bounty Pack 1 Vault Card loot:</h3><ul><li>4 rerollable weapons</li><li>4 Vault Hunter Heads usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe</li><li>4 Vault Hunter Skins usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe</li><li>5 Weapon Skins</li><li>5 Vehicle Skins</li><li>4 ECHO-4 Drone Skins</li><li>2 ECHO-4 Attachments</li></ul><p>Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day will be available for players who purchased either of the Borderlands 4 Deluxe editions. The bounty pack can also be purchased via a bundle (which includes all 4 packs) or as a single piece of DLC.</p><p>Gearbox also mentioned Borderlands 4's free seasonal content, including a new mini-event: Horrors of Kairos. From October 23 to November 6, players will be able to face tough world bosses in areas affected by blood rain. Each one will have a chance to drop new legendary loot. If that wasn’t enough, Gearbox is also planning to release new seasonal cosmetics through the use of SHiFT codes.</p><p>Then there’s the new endgame content coming in Q4, an early highlight being a tough boss called Bloomreaper the Invincible. Confronting this boss will be akin to starting a raid-like experience--players will have to adjust their builds in order to deal with Bloomreaper’s giant health pool and powerful attacks. Basically, Borderlands fans have a lot to look forward to.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The system specifications of the PlayStation 6 and next-generation Xbox have allegedly been finalized, and the next console by Microsoft is expected to consistently deliver better performance than Sony's system, according to a known leaker.</p>



<p>The rumors originate from the NeoGAF forums, where KeplerL2, a known AMD leaker with a solid track record, has commented on the recently<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/"> leaked specifications of the PS6</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">the so-called Xbox Magnus</a>, saying that <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/page-6#post-270890566">they have been finalized</a>, corroborating the information shared by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a>. </p>



<p>With these leaked specs in mind, the insider doesn't see <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270891283">how the PlayStation 6 can match the Xbox Magnus</a>, as it has fewer CPU cores, lower CPU frequency, fewer CUs (Compute Units), fewer ROPs (Render Output Units), lower GPU frequency, less cache, and memory bandwidth. The difference is not huge, but it is big enough that the next-gen Microsoft system is expected to deliver better performance in 100% of games, unlike this generation. Sony's system, however, should still have plenty of AI horsepower, as it should be capable of <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270893113">~1200 TOPs</a> (Trillion Operations Per Second), a huge jump from the PS5 Pro 300 TOPs.</p>



<p>The insider also commented on the RAM the PlayStation 6, the PlayStation handheld, and Xbox Magnus will likely have - <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270890829">30, 24, and 36GB, respectively.</a> For the two home systems, this would be a considerable jump over the 16GB of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, which was expected, considering that ray-tracing support and AI-powered features are likely to become more important than in the current generation.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, it seems like Sony will be the only company to have two systems with different specs for the next generation. According to KeplerL2, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-amd-magnus-apu-full-leak-rdna-5-zen-6-110-tops-npu-xbox-next-gen-console.1688936/post-270892965">a lower-end Xbox Magnus model is possible</a>, but nothing in the documentation they have seen suggests that this is going to happen.</p>



<p>While KeplerL2 has proven to be one of the more reliable sources for early hardware information in recent years,, we have to take what they have revealed with a massive grain of salt. With both the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/">PlayStation 6</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">Xbox Magnus reportedly targeting 2027</a>, however, it will likely not take much longer to learn more about Sony's and Microsoft's next-generation systems.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Variety is the spice of life, and this is incredibly relevant when playing TTRPG like Pathfinder. No one wants to battle the same sets of goblins and highway bandits over and over again. To add a bit of variety to our games, we took a look at the Bog Dwellers, Cave Lurkers, and Forest Stalkers.</p>

<p>These packs of painted minis are intended to add a bit of variety and flair to battles, matched to the region that you'd likely encounter them in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before even getting to what's in any of these packs I'm a fan of them being corralled by the region where you'd likely run into them. When there are just so many monsters in the Pathfinder Bestiary, it can be difficult when trying to build an encounter from scratch to know what is available to you.</p>

<p>These collections, even as a list of names online, allows players searching for a new foe to throw into a Forest or Swamp encounter a few interesting alternatives because again… Variety is the spice of life.</p>



<p>Inside the Pathfinder Battles Bog Dwellers pack you'll find miniatures for the following creatures:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Grimstalker</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Mudwretch</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Castoroides</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Bog Mummy</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Boggard Scout</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Shimmernewt</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-02.jpg?itok=GXtaisgD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-02.jpg?itok=F6X1XK5x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This group can be split pretty evenly between the cuties and the creepies. The cuties are made up of the Castoroides, the large beaver-like creature, the Boggard Scout, ready to pounce or attack with it's conch morning star, and the Shimmernewt, who really isn't doing anything… Ironically the Shimmernewt is the deadliest of these creatures at CR 6.</p>

<p>These characters stand out with bright colors or recognizable features. The Castoroides and Boggard both do a good job of directing you towards their features, informing you about their abilities. Whether it be the Castoroised claws and tail, or the weapon the Boggard is wielding and it's dexterity. While the Shimmernewt is just standing their it's bright color immediately draws your eye.</p>

<p>On the creepier side the Grimstalker and Bog Mummy both fall into a very similar looking "Swamp Zombie" category. While accurate to the look the meshing of the dark greens and brown does give these minis a bit of a legibility issue when across the table from you.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-06.jpg?itok=Oy1Ctn74 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-06.jpg?itok=29m_T2q- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Ironically, the Mudwretch, who is a humanoid pile of mud, is predominantly brown but the bulkier features like his large fingers and drooping face are actually easier to see at a distance.</p>

<h2>Pathfinder Battles Cave Lurkers</h2>

<p>Inside the Pathfinder Battles Cave Lurkers pack you'll find miniatures for the following creatures:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Xulgath Skirmisher</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Xulgath Stoneliege</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Orc Warchief</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Myceloid</li>

Of the humanoid creatures – Xulgath Skirmisher, Xulgath Stoneliege, and the Orc Warchief – each has been modeled with great motion or intention. Whether it's a hunched sneer or standing square on shouting each of these characters gives a sense of personality.</p>

<p>The Orc Warchief is a perfect example of what I like seeing from packs like these. They might not all be fodder enemies, but when you want one mini to really stand out from the rest in the pack you want it to be eyecatching. Putting a variety of Orc's on a battle map I want no one at my table to question that the one with the battle flags brandishing the giant mace is going to be the one that gives the most trouble.</p>

<p>Minis where everyone is the same are great to fill a battlefield, but when there is uniqueness it allows a level of immersion in the gameplay that lets the characters, through their player's eyes, infer more about the battlefield.</p>

Instead of dull colors and realism it's fluorescent green with a hot pink mushroom cap. It's screaming "Danger" in nature.</p>

<p>For the little creepy crawlies, the Hunting Spider and Cave Scorpion, the Cave Scorpion is very plain looking, but the Hunting Spider does a lot to stick out compared to other spider miniatures I've seen. Normally going for a a texture and color of the black hairs on a spider the purple gives off a sense of poison and a hard carapace for defense.</p>

<h2>Pathfinder Battles Forest Stalkers</h2>

<p>Inside the Pathfinder Battles Forest Stalkers pack you'll find miniatures for the following creatures:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Elf Hunter</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Werewolf</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Buso</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Wereboar</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Werebat</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Catfolk Bandit</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-04.jpg?itok=bmJyCCFp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-04.jpg?itok=muDFkJSt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This group of Forest Stalkers is an interesting mix of one standard creature, the Elf Hunter, one wood zombie, the Buso, and a mix of animal-human hybrids.</p>

<p>The Buso is by far the most terrifying thing in this collection as everything about it just seems a bit off. A slender body, but a pale grey, one eye on it's face and a head of hair that belongs in a 6th century monastery, and a curved machete in it's hand ready to swing.</p>

<p>For each of the humanoid hybrids, I'm a big fan of the varying levels of humanity. The Wereboar and Catfolk Bandit dressed as if they were in a town of their peers or heading out on adventures of their own, the Werebat seems to be in a state of transformation shredding a human form for it's present one, and the werewolf has embraced it's change wielding tools and… that's about it.</p>

<p>Immediately, things like these can inform a player of the scenario that they're in and they've been very deliberately picked.</p>

<p>While each of these miniatures are a fantastic representation of the stat block in Pathfinder that they represent as any player will know even at early levels you'll want to be challenging your party with groups of more than one creature.</p>

<p>The different were-creatures can join together to form a group, as can the two Xulgath's, but for many of the other creatures here it can be hard to put just one down at the table.</p>

<p>A mix of creatures is a great way to get hero or boss style creatures, like the Orc Warchief, but something like a Hunter Spider or Buggard Scout might fare better in a Spider or Buggard themed collection.</p>

<h2>Bog Dwellers, Cave Lurkers, and Forest Stalkers Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The Bog Dwellers, Cave Lurkers, and Forest Stalkers of this Wizkids Pathfinder Battles collection is filled with creatures worth of standing as direct foes to your characters, as well as some casual fodder for them to encounter in a random battle along the way.</p>

<p>The strengths in this set are that each mini can help to prompt a GM to get their mind racing about unique encounters related to the location of the bundle. You're headed into a bog or swamp? Well do you want the party to encounter swamp zombies, local fauna, or a brightly lit lizard?</p>

<p>The downside of these collections is that while you'll get a good representation for one or two of a similarly grouped enemy, you won't have enough to run an encounter without having to say "imagine all of them look like this guy" while gesturing to the Shimmernewt.</p>
