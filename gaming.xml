            <p>After a few set photo leaks earlier in the month, we now have an official first look at Liam Hemsworth as Geralt of Rivia in season four of Netflix's The Witcher series.</p>
<p>A new image along with a short piece of footage shows the former Hunger Games actor with Geralt's white locks and a suitably moody stare.</p>
<p>First up, that footage, which you can see below. The Netflix team has gone for the 'strong but silent' vibe with this clip, showing Hemsworth making his way through the misty landscape with Geralt's horse Roach, before he turns to look towards the camera.</p>

<p>"His look has been in development for over a year, so it's thrilling to finally share an official sneak peek of Liam Hemsworth as Geralt of Rivia," The Witcher showrunner Lauren S. Hissrich told <a href="https://ew.com/the-witcher-liam-hemsworth-first-look-official-season-4-exclusive-8651511">EW</a>.</p>
<p>"Cast and crew alike have been struck by the passion, energy, and embodiment Liam has brought to the character from day one -- scruffy beard, iconic scar, and all! We're having so much fun filming season four and are excited to welcome fans along on this journey with us."</p>
<p>Just for good measure, here is the new still from The Witcher's fourth season:</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Hemsworth was first announced to be joining the cast for the fourth season of The Witcher in 2022, when former Geralt actor Henry Cavill announced he was "laying down [his] medallion and [his] swords".</p>
<p>"As with the greatest of literary characters, I pass the torch with reverence for the time spent embodying Geralt and enthusiasm to see Liam's take on this most fascinating and nuanced of men," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-4-henry-cavill-replaced-as-geralt">Cavill wrote at the time</a>.</p>
<p>Hemsworth will portray the series' monster hunter for the show's fourth and presumably <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-5-will-be-its-last">fifth and final season</a>. And, he won't be the only new face on set when the next season airs. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-casts-laurence-fishburne-for-fourth-season-of-netflix-show">Matrix star Laurence Fishburne is also joining the cast</a> as Regis. Danny Woodburn, meanwhile, has been announced as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-the-witcher-series-adds-seinfeld-conan-star">Geralt's dwarf friend Zoltan Chivay</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24162520/the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth-first-look</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-witcher-season-4-teaser-proves-that-liam-hemsworth-sure-looks-like-geralt.878442/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24162520/the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth-first-look<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="B0SFn8">The biggest question hanging over the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23809084/witcher-season-4-release-date-cast-news-liam-hemsworth">upcoming fourth season</a> of Netflix’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/the-witcher"><em>The Witcher</em></a> has, for better or for worse, been about casting. Liam Hemsworth has replaced <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23428458/henry-cavill-superman-man-of-steel">former Superman</a> Henry Cavill as the monster hunter Geralt of Rivia for the show’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24134071/witcher-season-4-netflix-season-5-final">final two seasons</a>, and naturally people want to know how well he slides into that snug leather armor. Netflix’s first season 4 tease is geared towards answering that question, and nothing more. </p>
<p id="D1F8pB">The one-minute clip slowly approaches nu-Geralt from behind in a foggy wood, closing in as Hemsworth looks over his shoulder to reveal that hey, he looks like Geralt! This is not that shocking, I suppose, as the people making this show have eyes and probably do want some kind of visual continuity here. Of course, in this very controlled and narrow glimpse, none of his co-stars or familiar haunts are present to register any dissonance, so seeing him — and more importantly, <em>hearing </em>him — in actual action is where the challenge lies. </p>
<p id="GpAWDV">As for when we’ll see any more, that remains to be seen. There’s still no official premiere date for season 4, but considering how the series left Geralt <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23809906/the-witcher-season-3-part-2-review">in a pretty pickle last season</a>, it’s hard to object to <em>The Witcher</em>’s creative team taking its time to get our favorite mutated monster slayer’s re-introduction right. </p>

<p id="35LpwG">Among the new cards coming in <em>MH3</em> is another addition to a small cycle of elder giant titans from the plane of Theros. Today Polygon can officially introduce Phlage, Titan of Fire’s Fury, a new take on a classic burn spell. It’s a card that could potentially be the crucial upgrade needed to revive one of the Modern format’s oldest strategies — especially with the help of the two other cards revealed in the story below!</p>
<p id="SEUTYv">That’s right: Burn decks could be coming back into fashion, after years on the sidelines of competitive and semi-competitive play.</p>

<p id="fNKPmS">When it first enters the battlefield, it immediately deals three damage to another creature or player, and gains its controller three life — an effect that already exists on a popular card called Lightning Helix, which for years existed as a cornerstone in Modern’s red/white burn deck. But like its Titan predecessors, Phlage then sacrifices itself and heads to the graveyard until its additional escape cost is paid. </p>

<p id="38md01">In order to move Phlage from the graveyard back to the battlefield, its controller must pay an additional four mana and exile five other cards from the graveyard – only then does it stay on the battlefield, triggering its Lightning Helix effect again upon entry, and repeatedly after that whenever it attacks.</p>
<h2 id="YvMgEG"><strong>The legacy and decline of Modern burn decks</strong></h2>
<p id="WV8QPe">Historically, red/white burn decks have been a mainstay in Modern, known for their efficiency, speed, and ability to run over opponents with a mix of aggressive creatures and cheap “burn” spells that perform direct damage to a player’s life total. Thanks to a critical mass of Lightning Bolts and similar spells, burn was considered one of Modern’s fastest-winning decks due to its realistic ability of ending a game on turn three.</p>

<p id="OaukYr">However, since the release of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22537203/magic-the-gathering-modern-horizons-2-best-cards-asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar"><em>Modern Horizons 2</em></a> in 2021, traditional burn decks failed to remain competitive while other Modern decks received substantial upgrades and powerful new strategies emerged. Though many burn players continued to register their decks in tournaments, the strategy itself remained stagnant, struggling to keep up as the Modern format’s power level gradually evolved and pushed the deck out of winners’ circles. </p>
<h2 id="cwtugh"><strong>Synergies and metagame impact</strong></h2>
<p id="ZXR4lN">Not only does Phlage reapply the Lightning Helix effect on a new card type, it also fits well with burn’s current play patterns. Burn decks rely heavily on one-and-done instants and sorceries, which quickly fill the graveyard while executing on burn’s primary strategy, in turn making the titan’s escape cost a realistic endgame after the burn player exhausts their other resources. </p>
<p id="b3zfNB">Since casting and escaping Phlage presents six damage on its own, it’s easy to imagine the remaining 14 damage needed to kill an opponent might have been done already with the cards used to escape it from the graveyard. If casting the card twice isn’t enough to win the game by itself, each additional attack presents nine more damage, a formidable threat against even the players who managed to somehow gain life back after getting burned.</p>
<h2 id="xPCcDY"><strong>New outlets for energy tokens</strong></h2>
<p id="JBSlBI">Another exciting reveal from <em>MH3 </em>is the return of energy tokens, a mechanic first introduced in 2016’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/15/12935316/magic-the-gathering-kaladesh-exclusive-mtg-vehicle-preview-cards-set-spoiler"><em>Kaladesh</em></a>, but which hadn’t been used again until earlier this year in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24139124/mtg-fallout-best-selling-commander-set-ever">Universes Beyond<em> Fallout Commander</em> decks</a>.</p>
<p id="0TzFKC">Unlike most other counters in <em>Magic</em>, which are placed on creatures or permanents, energy counters are given to a player directly, often as an added perk of a card’s effect. Once a certain number of energy counters are collected, they can be used as an additional resource to enhance cards that care about energy payoffs. </p>

<p id="KAxS3Z">The long-term playability of energy cards in <em>MH3 </em>remains to be seen, however, since they’ve essentially been nonexistent in competitive metagames in the years since they were first introduced. Although a powerful energy-based deck used to exist when <em>Kaladesh</em> was legal in <em>Magic</em>’s standard format, they never made the leap to more powerful environments such as Modern or Pioneer.</p>
<p id="czjEvl">Although Voltstorm Angel is likely designed for games of <em>MH3</em> draft, Amped Raptor might be worth keeping an eye on if a red energy deck exists. </p>
<p id="TDiYn6">The raptor’s effect when it enters the battlefield allows the player to cast additional cards for free, off the top of the library, by spending energy counters in place of mana. Pairing it with deck manipulation effects that can put specific cards on top of the library, along with other spells that provide enough counters to cast anything that’s revealed off the raptor’s initial trigger, could let you “cheat” powerful and expensive cards into play before you have enough lands to cast it with traditional mana. </p>

<p>TikTok is a touchy subject – and it has been so for at least the last four years. It started as a platform that hosted videos of teenagers dancing while miming songs but quickly became a melting pot of content creation, bizarre videos, pranks, gaming content, and everything in between. Today, it’s the biggest short-form video-sharing platform in the world, but it’s still a bit of a controversial application that angers the disapproving masses.</p>



<p>However, one category that excelled on TikTok was gaming. For the last three or four years, the application’s stranglehold on the gaming industry has gotten tighter, with creators leaning on the application to share short- and long-form videos, gain followers, and even live stream their gameplay.</p>



<p>Recently, data was revealed showcasing the top 500 games on the app. I’m willing to bet you’ll never guess the most popular game on TikTok.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-battle-royale-is-boss">Battle Royale is Boss</h2>



<p>In a data pull, a platform called mindGAME revealed the top 500 games on TikTok by total views and video counts. </p>



<p>At the top of the table sat Garena Free Fire, a mobile-based battle royale game that has never really excelled above the likes of PUBG, Fortnite, or Warzone in the general popularity stakes. It’s dramatically successful in some regions – such as Southeast Asia – and as an esports-focused game, it once held the record for the most concurrent viewers for an esports tournament <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mindgame-data_free-data-as-part-of-the-composite-mindshare-activity-7197053706310197248-yLVx?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In the data</a>, it was revealed that <strong>in total </strong>on TikTok, Garena Free Fire has amassed a count of 888 <strong>billion </strong>views spread across 87.3 million videos. In second place sits Roblox with 595 billion views on 66 million videos. Fortnite has wound up in third place with 591 million views on 60 million videos.</p>



<p>By comparison, Call of Duty Warzone doesn’t even make it into the top ten – neither does Grand Theft Auto 5. The likes of Counter-Strike and Rainbow Six Siege were edged out by Among Us and Genshin Impact, and single-player epics like Red Dead Redemption 2, Elden Ring, and The Last of Us are sitting somewhere in the 30 – 40 range. </p>



<p>Some fast risers have entered the list in recent weeks. For instance, Manor Lords has hit 28 million views across 1,700 videos, and Arena Breakout: Infinite has secured 14.9 million views also with around 1,700 videos.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of gaming real estate to be secured on TikTok, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>Moments ago, a new website surfaced that’s reportedly the first teaser content for Black Ops 6 – if that’s indeed what the next Call of Duty game will be called. It’s called <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘thetruthlies.com’</a>, and it’s a relatively confusing little thing. On the site, there’s a retro television – like a CCTV monitor of sorts – that showcases a ‘found footage’ style video. </p>



<p>In this video, we see unidentified operatives traversing a federal location through the night – which is later revealed to be Mount Rushmore. They deface the monument silently in the blackness of night, before filming from a distance as their work is uncovered. They’ve hung banners stating ‘the truth lies’ over the faces of Mount Rushmore, while a fourth banner shows the wolf symbol that was revealed recently to announce the upcoming Call of Duty showcase.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cryptic-teaser">Cryptic Teaser</h2>



<p>There are a few things you can do and learn from The Truth Lies:</p>











<p>If you turn off the TV using the power button, you hear a foreboding, pulsing soundtrack in the background – which doesn’t tell you much. </p>



<p>If you flick through the channels, you’ll see that there are six. That could be a nod to ‘Black Ops’, or it could mean that five further teasers are set to be revealed. </p>



<p>Hitting ‘REC’ allows you to download the video that’s currently playing, which is a nice feature that’s guaranteed to get shares on social platforms.</p>



<p>Inspecting the page source doesn’t give much away, and from what we can see, there’s nothing else of any importance on the site.</p>

So if the Gulf War is part of the game's story, it could be just one element of it.</p><p dir="ltr">Rumors have suggested the new game has been in the works for a long time and will be the first game in franchise history to have been <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1782123698893279545">developed over a four-year period</a>. This lies in stark contrast to 2023's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-campaign-was-developed-on-a-very-rushed-schedule-report/1100-6519074/">reportedly made in just 18 months.</a></p><p dir="ltr">If this year's game is indeed a Black Ops title, it will be the sixth entry in the series since it debuted in 2010. The Black Ops franchise within Call of Duty has become one of the most popular of all, and lucrative, too. Dave Anthony, the director of the first two Black Ops games, recently discussed how he made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-call-of-duty-boss-lists-bel-air-mansion-for-astronomical-price-see-inside/1100-6523192/">"incredible amounts of money"</a> during his career.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of returning characters, it's rumored that Adler is coming back, but that's all we know so far. The Black Ops series is known for featuring real-life people, like Ronald Reagan (Black Ops Cold War) and Robert McNamara (Black Ops 1), so it wouldn't be surprising to see real-life military and political leaders from the Gulf War era appear in the new game.</p><p>A report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-gulf-war-campaign-open-world/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a> said Raven Software is developing the game's campaign, with Treyarch--the creator of the Black Ops series--handling multiplayer and Zombies. Activision is known to recruit teams from across its entire network of Call of Duty studios to contribute to each year's new release in some fashion, and that formula is expected to continue this year.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">everything we know about the next Call of Duty. </a>Whatever the game turns out to be, it will join Call of Duty: Warzone, Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, and Call of Duty: Mobile on the market at the same time.</p>

                <p>Super Smash Bros. players are well-known for their strong opinions on character balance, and it seems that Masahiro Sakurai is no different. In a recent video on game design, Sakurai says that trying to make everything "fair" will produce a less interesting game. Or, as he puts it: "Average and mediocre are the same thing."</p><p>In the video, Sakurai explains that having characters with different sets of strengths and weaknesses gives the game a sense of "push-and-pull." He cites an example of a Mario vs. Mario mirror match--while it resolves these "balance issues," it also creates a static experience. He also calls the internet an "echo chamber of sorts," stating that players tend to believe community opinions of relative strength, even when they aren't necessarily true.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW4x-_Y8BmM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KW4x-_Y8BmM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To support his arguments, Sakurai revealed some interesting data regarding the relative win rates of each character in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate/" data-ref-id="5000-480957">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> online matches. He reports that the highest win rate of a character in the game is 51.43%, while the lowest is 47.18%, a difference of around 4%. The director is clearly happy with this data, concluding it as follows: "any fighter has a shot at winning a match." So, the next time your hardcore Smash friend makes fun of you for picking a low-tier like Little Mac, try sending them this video.</p><p>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, the latest entry in the series, first came out in 2018 and received regular DLC updates until late 2021. While the future of the series is unknown, Sakurai said in a video released earlier this year that he's working on another project, which may indicate that Smash 6 is in development in some form or fashion. Sakurai did say he was going to step away from the series after Ultimate, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/smash-bros-creator-on-franchises-future-i-cant-imagine-a-smash-bros-title-without-me/1100-6516378/" data-ref-id="1100-6516378">indicated</a> last year that he "can't imagine [a Smash game] without me." So, if there is another Smash game, it's almost certain that Sakurai will be involved.</p>

        <p>But StreamElements reports Rust enjoyed 19 million hours increase thanks to Waves of Change update</p>

</header>  <div>



            <p>The latest StreamElements report reveals that Twitch users watched 1.64 billion hours of livestreamed footage in April.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/twitch-hours-watched-drop-another-5-in-march">Last month's report</a> put March's total viewing hours at 1.56 billion, but StreamElements and Rainmaker.gg have since updated the data, showing that April is actually 7% down on the 1.77 billion hours recorded in the previous month.</p>
<p>Similarly, daily hours watched were down 5% from 57 million to 55 million. In fact, the number of daily hours watched has dropped slightly each month this year.</p>
<p>The declines can be attributed to a quiet April, with no major game releases or events to deliver a boost.</p>
<p>While Fallout games have <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fallout-4-jumps-to-no1-across-europe-following-tv-show-launch">rocketed up both the physical and digital charts</a> in the UK and Europe, these titles do not appear in the Top 10 most watched categories, which are instead led by Just Chatting (238 million hours watched) and Grand Theft Auto 5 (128 million), as well as live service games such as Fortnite, Counter-Strike GO and League of Legends.</p>
<p>Only two of the Top 10 categories saw an increase in hours watched, with Rust seeing the biggest increase month-on-month. The game's Waves of Changes update pushed viewing hours up by 227% — or 19 million hours to put it into context.</p>
<p>Total hours watched for Rust came in at 27 million, putting it at No.9. Call of Duty Warzone was at No.8 with 33 million hours — the only other game to see an increase at 19%.</p>
<p>"April was a slow month with few significant events and no major game launches, but Rust's massive update provided one notable peak among the valleys regarding viewership," said StreamElements co-founder Or Perry.</p>
<p>"Jynxzi was another highlight by being the first creator to be a top streamer twice in 2024 and putting him on the short list of recurring crown wearers, like xQc, Gaules, KaiCenat, and fps_shaka."</p>

In the last half-decade, Shiver has focused on bringing high-profile triple-A games to Nintendo Switch, including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mortal Kombat 11 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hogwarts Legacy</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Under Embracer’s ownership, Shiver also worked alongside Saber Interactive, a company with a renowned reputation for producing impressive Switch ports of games such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Witcher 3, Crysis, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Kingdom Come: Deliverance – </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">games</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">once considered not feasible for the platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo notes that Shiver’s current focus will continue – that is, it will be involved in commissioning and producing ports of games to platforms including Nintendo Switch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Omdia expects the next-generation “Switch 2” to continue aligning with the console software landscape. Unlike Steam Deck, which utilizes a translation layer (Proton) to enable compatibility with existing PC titles, Switch 2, like PS5, will require its own versions of games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Switch 2 is expected to provide a sizeable leap in hardware performance as the original Switch approaches its eighth birthday. This should help Nintendo fill the gap when it comes to attracting third party support of titles that would have been too ambitious for the original Switch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo has also hired Gio Corsi for its triple-A third party management team. Corsi previously led PlayStation’s third-party production and developer relation efforts, suggesting Nintendo is eager to attract third-party support of triple-A titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo can no longer rely on a library of unnoticed Wii U software to bulk out its first-party release schedule. With production timescales also increasing gen-on-gen, Nintendo will be more reliant on third-party content to fill the gap.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shiver will help Nintendo bolster its third-party portfolio. Its alignment under Nintendo should give it access to the company’s hardware and software engineering teams, improving its capability to deliver quality conversions. It also secures their exclusive attention on working with Nintendo platforms, which may become less guaranteed as more players offer triple-A gaming on the go, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/apple-stakes-its-claim-to-aaa-gaming-on-mobile-with-iphone-15-pro-series">including Apple</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo can also use its ownership of Shiver Entertainment as a bargaining chip when negotiating with publishers to bring their games to “Switch 2”, particularly where resources are scarce. Existing exclusivity agreements may typically involve support for funding, localization, marketing, and distribution – Nintendo could now promise assistance from a first-party specialist developer on top.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo will have to navigate an extended cross-gen period</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Omdia’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Games Addressable Market Metrics Database </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">estimates that 104 million Nintendo Switch consoles will remain in active use by the end of 2024. With Switch’s successor estimated to land in 2025, a huge audience will need shepherding over to the next generation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a challenge that competitor Sony continues to face even as PlayStation 5 enters the latter half of its cycle. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>1H24 Console Report </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">reveals that 50m last-gen PS4 consoles remain in active use (see Figure) as the PS5 active installed base outweighs the equivalent PS4 decline by a factor of 1.16.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Figure: Despite high replacement rate, active installed base for PlayStation 4 remains above PlayStation 3 gen-on-gen</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo must prepare for a similarly prolonged cross-generation period – it needs to juggle onboarding players to Switch 2 with sustaining the software spend and engagement of the portion of its audience that has yet to make the transition.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That is where the acquisition of Shiver Entertainment could come in handy. With its audience split between new and old generations of hardware in the first half of its new console cycle, Nintendo may wish to release Switch versions of select titles originally planned for “Switch 2”. Shiver could be involved in bringing next-generation first-party content to its soon-to-be last-gen Switch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo is about to enter a new generation where digital libraries provide software continuity, making exclusive next-gen content more important than ever. But it also cannot afford to ignore the portion of its audience that will be slower to upgrade. Nintendo’s acquisition of Shiver Entertainment could make for a potent weapon to help it navigate its next-gen transition.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Analyst, Games, Omdia</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">James is part of Omdia’s games team, specializing in the markets for PC and mobile gaming.

The company, which owns a wide array of board and tabletop game developers, publishers, and distributors, took on €900 million in debt as part of the separation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Will that debt weigh down a company carrying a major chunk of the sector on its back? According to former Embracer interim chief operations officer Matt Karch, the answer is "no."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Asmodee's a company that can handle debt, and that's where all the debt's going to be" the CEO (and founder) of Saber Interactive said in a recent conversation with Game Developer about the past and future of former Embracer subsidiary Saber Interactive. He'd been in the midst of praising Embracer's split into a trio of companies, and opined that the decision to assign the debt to Asmodee was likely to pay off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's more to glean from Karch's comments—what is it that makes Asmodee so good at handling debt, and what might it mean for its sibling corporations?</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/opinion-embracer-s-plan-for-the-lord-of-the-rings-is-bad-for-everyone" target="_self">Opinion: Embracer's plan for The Lord of the Rings is bad for everyone</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What does it mean that Asmodee is &quot;good&quot; at paying debt?">What does it mean that Asmodee is "good" at paying debt?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The news of Asmodee's financing made some industry observers nervous. It ostensibly resembled a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/opinion/private-equity.html">widely-criticized</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> corporate tactic: the private equity-driven practice of acquiring companies then saddling them with the debt needed to finance the purchase. The practice allows the new owner to extract value from the company's assets while forcing it to divert resources to paying down the debt.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even if you're not familiar with such financial mechanisms, it's possible to interpret this move as one that makes Asmodee responsible for the financial mishaps that put Embracer in such a precarious position. Is that actually the case?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Probably not, said Dr. Mejda Bahlous-Boldi, an associate professor at Ithaca College and director of School of Business' Investment Program. We'd asked Bahlous-Boldi to weigh in on Karch's comments and evaluate what it meant for a firm like it to be good at handling debt.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A company is well prepared to handle or manage debt if they can generate enough cashflows to service the debt," he explained. "A company that doesn’t have already a lot of debt will more likely be able to manage a debt."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As part of the spinoff, Embracer reported that Asmodee saw net sales of SEK 14.8 billion (about $1.4 billion), and "adjusted EBIT of SEK 1.9 billion on a pro forma basis as per LTM[2] as of December 2023."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's about on par with the $1.22 billion in sales it reported in its 2023 financial release and the $1.27 billion it reported in 2021.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bahlous-Boldi explained that analysts paying attention to Asmodee's financial picture are studying D/E (debt to equity) and TIE ratios (TIE is equal to EBIT/ interest expenses of 1 year). If Asmodee is prepared to manage the debt, its D/E ratio should be lower than industry averages, and its TIE ratio higher than industry averages.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After reviewing Embracer's split, Bahlous-Boldi speculated that the deal was structured this way because "not all divisions are expected to be successful and the parent company is better off splitting into 3 companies." Asmodee's status as a profitable and successful division made it the best candidate to shoulder the burden.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, Bahlous-Boldi warned that Asmodee will need to generate even more profits to pay off the debt, as the company is using money raised from the financing to pay dividends to Embracer. "From my opinion, the tax motive is credible," he concluded.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What does this debt mean for the different arms of Embracer?">What does this debt mean for the different arms of Embracer?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If Asmodee is the most successful of Embracer's three children, which might be the least that it's covering for?

<p data-characters="436" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Diablo 4’s</em> fourth season introduced just a few crumbs of what could be called “seasonal mechanics,” but what’s there is still pretty fun. From the Profane Mindcage, which boosts enemy levels in Helltides by 10 to the Momentum Elixir that let’s you zoom across the battlefield after scoring kills, there’s no shortage of new twists to blasting enemies. But one seems to be standing out from the rest. </p> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">The <strong>Elixir of Holy Bolts</strong> asks, “what if Artillery Shrine, but all the time?” It causes damaging bolts to explode out of any enemy killed, (usually) dealing enough damage to kill another enemy, which <em>also</em> fires out bolts, killing <em>another</em> enemy and.. you get the idea. It’s essentially a cascade of death in any high-density areas. </p> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">This strategy excels most of all in The Pit, <em>Diablo 4’s</em> new endgame activity. Enemies are packed so tightly together that starting a Holy Bolt chain-reaction is sometimes enough to clear entire sections of the map at once. It’s so powerful it could be a “seasonal mechanic” in its own right, if only it didn’t last 15 minutes. </p>
 <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="461" data-injectable="false">The good news is that once your time’s up you can easily get more Elixirs by trading 350 Obols to the Alchemist under the “Seasonal Elixir” tab for another. It’s a hefty price, to be sure, but the power gains and time saved clearing Pit runs is worth it in my opinion. Of course, you can also score these as drops from Helltide Elites and bosses. Whatever you do, keep at least one in your back pocket for those broom closets of baddies.</p>

<p data-characters="421" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>The Final Shape</em>&nbsp;is almost&nbsp;upon&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>&nbsp;players, with the expansion launching on June 4.

 <h2 id="h-still-hunt-exotic-sniper-rifle" data-injectable="false">Still Hunt Exotic sniper rifle</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Still Hunt Exotic Sniper Rifle Preview | Destiny 2: The Final Shape" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AhNlP9rIOoQ?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true">The Still Hunt Exotic sniper&nbsp;rifle looks like it could be wild. Visually, it appears to be a hand cannon retrofitted to a sniper frame, harkening thoughts back to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2s-broken-weapon-builds-were-the-games-best-bug-ever/" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Craftening</a>. In the short teaser, we can see a Hunter use the weapon to great effect, slaying a few Hive before triggering the weapon’s special ability, providing Golden Gun Super shots.</p>
 <p data-characters="497" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true">From the looks of things, the Exotic effect is built up by achieving kills or precision kills. It also looks like Guardians must trigger the effect, typically done in-game with a special reload, as evidenced by the Hunter going into a unique animation just before shooting the empowered shots. While many Hunters’ first question might be whether this works with the Golden Gun-empowering Celestial Nighthawk Exotic helm, players will just have to wait until&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape&nbsp;</em>to see.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Microcosm Exotic trace rifle</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Microcosm Exotic Heavy Trace Rifle Preview | Destiny 2: The Final Shape" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j0r0mUg1jck?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true">The Microcosm Exotic is the first Heavy trace rifle. This meaty weapon is red and gold with a trident-like design at the end of the barrel. The Exotic Perk on this weapon lets it quickly decimate enemy shields, obliterating the foes shown in its preview. Interestingly, if viewers watch closely, they can see different elemental death animations for enemies defeated by the weapon.</p>
 <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true">While the Exotic Heavy trace rifle looks to, and should, do quite a bit of damage, the unique trait initially seems&nbsp;a bit&nbsp;underwhelming.&nbsp;A bonus to shield damage won’t hurt anyone, but since&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‘s removal of the Match Game modifier (making it much harder to destroy enemy shields that weren’t the same element as your weapon), shields aren’t really an issue.</p>
 <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="492" data-injectable="false">Of course, we don’t know what’s to come in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>, and there’s always the chance enemy shields could play a much more significant role than they do now. I don’t know what to make of the enemy death animations showing different elements. Microcosm may have another Exotic Perk like The Fundamentals (allowing Guardians to switch elemental damage types), or it could be something else entirely. Only time will tell after&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape&nbsp;</em>releases.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/card-en-ciel-brings-mega-man-battle-network-like-card-battling-in-october.878400/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/card-en-ciel-release-date-gameplay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Inti Creates has revealed the release date for upcoming card battler&nbsp;<em>Card-en-Ciel</em>, which essentially looks like a less RPG-ified version of&nbsp;<em>Mega Man Battle Network</em>.</p>

<p>The game is launching in October, and in a new trailer, Inti Creates shows off some&nbsp;<em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>gameplay, and it looks...well, a whole lot like&nbsp;<em>Mega Man Battle Network</em>, actually, right down to the grid style and isometric viewpoint.</p>

<p>However, where&nbsp;<em>Battle Network&nbsp;</em>also featured JRPG-style trappings, including an overworld in which you could talk to NPCs and watch the story unfold,&nbsp;<em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>looks to be stripping things back for a more roguelite-inspired take on the genre.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/card-en-ciel-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=2sirlSf7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/card-en-ciel-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=mkRs-1Ax 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>is, ahem, "inspired" by&nbsp;<em>Mega Man Battle Network</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>revolves around Neon, a "gaming detective" (yes, that's Inti Creates' actual wording) who must collect and utilize cards to do battle with a range of enemies.</p>

<p>The game will offer more than 10 different dungeons, each of which is full of monsters to fight, cards to collect, and new synergies to find. You can also look forward to special "Muse Cards", which activate special abilities soundtracked by 50 vocal tracks present in the game.</p>

<p>Along the way, you'll also discover the story of Neon and his friends, although it'll be told largely through visual novel-style static scenes rather than overworld exploration, it seems.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>right here if you want to get a sense for what the gameplay is like.</p>




<p><em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>comes to us from Inti Creates, the studio responsible for franchises like <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/azure-striker-gunvolt-2-review-its-mega-anime-man">Azure Striker Gunvolt</a>&nbsp;</i>and the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blaster-master-zero-2-review-nostalgia-done-right"><em>Blaster Master&nbsp;</em>revivals</a>, as well as, uh, cheesecake-tastic games like&nbsp;<em>Gal Gun</em>.</p>

<p>It looks like the studio is essentially seeking to marry its two great loves in&nbsp;<em>Card-en-Ciel</em>; it's a very&nbsp;<em>Mega Man</em>-esque game with some pretty gratuitous-feeling anime fanservice in it.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>when it launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2730540/CardenCiel/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on October 24th.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/deadlock-footage-leak-characters-world-details/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deadlock-footage-leaks-showing-the-steampunk-world-and-characters-of-valve%E2%80%99s-new-shooter.878397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/deadlock-footage-leak-characters-world-details/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week details emerged that a new hero shooter from Valve, <a href="https://wccftech.com/deadlock-might-be-valves-upcoming-third-person-hero-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entitled Deadlock</a>, had secretly entered alpha testing. Needless to say, a new shooter from Valve is a <em>pretty big deal</em>, and there’s no way those alpha testers aren’t going to keep on leaking things. Case in point, a short clip of the game in action is now in the wild – Valve is trying to pull the footage down, but for now, <a href="https://streamable.com/gjm033" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s available here</a>.</p>
<p>As we’ve heard previously, Deadlock is a 6v6 team-based hero shooter, with a little bit of MOBA flavor mixed in as the game’s maps have multiple lanes with floating grapple lines that can be used for quick travel. The new footage shows a player using one of these grapple lines during training mode. We also get a better taste of the game’s BioShock-esque steampunk aesthetics, with various ads for cigarettes and other things adorning the environment.</p>
<p>The footage also provides a peek at Deadlock’s character select screen. At least in alpha, it looks like the roster will consist of 19 characters, which include steampunk-style robots like “Infernus,” more supernatural characters like the bat creature “Ivy,” and multiple highly-stylized human characters. It seems like many of the characters will have some sort of elemental theme – Infernus uses fire, “Kelvin” uses ice, and so on. While we don’t have details about all the characters, the footage hovers over the following heroes, providing us some details.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ivy</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sets up a power duo with a lucky ally</em></li>
<li><em>Ivy has disruptive combat tricks that slow and stun enemies. She's most effective when linking up with an ally, empowering her and her ally's guns as well as sharing heals.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Infernus</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Lights up enemies and watches them burn</em></li>
<li><em>Infernus has many ways to deal damage over time, burning foes before swooping in for the kill. Due to Infernus' blazing speed, his enemies won't be able to escape the flames.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Haze</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sneaks in and sprays bullets</em></li>
<li><em>When Haze fixates on a target she can hold her own in a firefight. She prefers to creates one-sided exchanges, avoiding damage then picking off unsuspecting targets up close.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Grey Talon</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Delivers long-range skill shots</em></li>
<li><em>A cunning predator, Grey Talon uses a combination of deadly accuracy, traps, and clever positioning to bring down the toughest opponents.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Kelvin</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Freezes enemies in their tracks</em></li>
<li><em>Timely heals and splitting a team fight properly is the difference between an easy victory or a ruinous defeat. Gliding around slowing enemies gives Kelvin's team the maneuvering advantage to make this happen.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Lady Geist</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sacrifices health then drains it back.</em></li>
<li><em>Expending health to achieve devastating effects is the source of Lady Geist's power. When running low she can drain the life out of her rivals.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Seven</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Electrocutes crowds of enemies</em></li>
<li><em>Seven thrives in a skirmish waiting for the time to strike. Then he rolls into the fight like a storm and batters his enemies with a cascade of lightning.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Vindicta</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Snipes the unsuspecting</em></li>
<li><em>Vindicta has the mobility to engage at her leisure, picking at her prey and bleeding them out slowly. Injured enemies at any distance should fear being picked off when she is on the map.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Warden</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Weakens his enemies and chases them down</em></li>
<li><em>Warden leads from the front, jumping into the fray and hindering his opponents' ability to fight effectively. But what Warden considers brave, others consider reckless, and if he's not careful he can easily find himself in over his head.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Wraith</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Melts isolated targets</em></li>
<li><em>Excelling at one-on-one combat, Wraith isolates targets, eliminating them with ruthless efficiency, then teleporting away before anyone can retaliate.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Yamato</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Delivers charged attacks with finesse</em></li>
<li><em>Yamato uses precise strikes to decimate her rivals. However, such damaging attacks often will leave her exposed, so she needs to make every shot count.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Deadlock has not been officially announced by Valve yet, and there’s no word on when that may happen. Given the game is in alpha testing, an announcement likely isn’t too far away, although aspects of the game still look a bit rough, so we’ll see.</p>

<p>Following its rough launch, Fallout 76 turned around to become one of the most entertaining experiences in gaming today. I’ve spent countless hundreds of hours across multiplayer characters enjoying Appalachia, and a big part of that is because of the regular events and community. Now, it’s time for Meat Week! Here’s how to make the most of Grahm’s Meat Cook in Fallout 76!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-grahm-s-meat-cook-in-fallout-76">What is Grahm’s Meat Cook in Fallout 76?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, what the heck is Grahm’s Meat Cook? It’s a seasonal public event that takes place every so often as part of the Meat Week Community Event. During this seasonal event, players will take part in the Primal Cuts Event, which occurs every 15 minutes in there of the five regions across the map. If you take part, you’ll earn items and rewards to help Grahm’s Meat Cook—the second event of the season—succeed!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-grahm-s-meat-cook-start">When Does Grahm’s Meat Cook Start?</h2>



<p>As mentioned, you can take part in Primal Cuts every 15 minutes in three unique zones across Appalachia. As for Grahm’s Meat Cook, it begins on the hour, every hour.</p>



<p>You can find Grahm’s Meat Cook south of Fallout 76 and northwest of the Moonshiner’s Shack. It’s hard to miss, as everything is on fire and glowing. </p>

<p>Prime Meat is the key ingredient to Meat Week. You’ll accumulate as much as possible before bringing the entire lot to Grahm’s Meat Cook. There, during the secondary event, you’ll unlock Legendary Scrip.</p>



<p>You want Legendary Scrip, as it allows you to purchase Legendary Items and Components from Purveyor Murmrgh. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-prime-meat">How to Get Prime Meat</h2>



<p>To get Prime Meat in Fallout 76, you must take part in Primal Cuts. It appears on the map every 15 minutes in three different zones across the game world, so keep an eye out. Upon completing the community event, you’ll earn Prime Meat as a reward, which you’ll later bring to Grahm’s Meat Cook.</p>



<p>Primal Cuts tasks players with banging a drum in the center of the arena to attract predators. You’ll then fight waves of various creatures, with each wave becoming progressively larger and more challenging. The final wave culminates in a boss fight, which is typically a legendary monster.</p>



<p>Once finished, you’ll earn Prime Meat!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/what-should-you-do-with-tomestones-of-poetics-in-final-fantasy-xiv/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=what-should-you-do-with-tomestones-of-poetics-in-final-fantasy-xiv<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="281" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Tomestones of Poetics are a type of currency in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> gained through running a myriad of duties. They’re easy to get, and you’ll frequently find yourself reaching the 2,000 maximum that you can carry. But what do you do with them? Well, you’ve got some options.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">You’ll start to earn Poetics after reaching level 50 in your first Job, and they’re earned by doing basically anything – The Hunt, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-deep-dungeon-how-to-unlock-palace-of-the-dead/">Deep Dungeons</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-ffxiv-raid-unlock-guide-coil-alexander-omega-eden-pandaemonium/">Raids</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-loporrit-tribal-quests-in-ffxiv/">Tribal quests</a>, and even large-scale content such as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-bozjan-southern-front-zadnor-in-ffxiv/">Bozja</a> or Eureka all reward Poetics, as long as they’re from a previous expansion. The only common content I can think of that doesn’t reward Poetics is FATEs.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="606" data-injectable="true">So with that in mind, you’ll very quickly reach the 2,000 maximum Poetics you can hold at any one time. Don’t be like me and exist with them permanently capped, it’s a good idea to spend them on <em>something</em>, but what?&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-augmented-gear" data-injectable="false"><strong>Augmented gear</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true">If you’re leveling alt Jobs, you’ll need to kit them out in the best gear, and this is—without argument—the Augmented gear in each expansion. You purchase Augmented Gear with weekly capped Tomestones for its current expansion, but after a new expansion is released, older gear becomes purchasable through Poetics.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="100" data-current-count="100" data-injectable="false">This gear becomes available to you in stages, only unlocking after you complete a certain MSQ quest:</p> <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Gear name</strong></td><td><strong>Level</strong></td><td><strong>Expansion</strong></td><td><strong>Unlock quest</strong></td><td><strong>Vendor</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Augmented Ironworks</td><td>50</td><td>A Realm Reborn</td><td>The Ultimate Weapon</td><td>Auriana<br>Mor Dhona<br>(X:22.7, Y:6.7)</td></tr><tr><td>Augmented Shire</td><td>60</td><td>Heavensward</td><td>A Great New Nation</td><td>Bertana<br>Idyllshire<br>(X:5.9, Y:5.2)</td></tr><tr><td>Augmented Scaevan</td><td>70</td><td>Stormblood</td><td>Stormblood</td><td>Enna<br>Rhalgr’s Reach<br>(X:13.9, Y:11.6)</td></tr><tr><td>Augmented Cryptlurker</td><td>80</td><td>Shadowbringers</td><td>Shadowbringers</td><td>Aymark<br>Eulmore(X:10.2, Y:11.8)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="221" data-injectable="false">Once <em>Dawntrail</em> releases on July 2, the current Augmented gear (Credendum) will become available to purchase with Poetics, so there’s not much point running Alliance Raids for coins if you’re still thinking about it.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="70" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">Augmented gear costs a fixed number of poetics, depending on the item:</p> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true"> <li>Weapons (600 Poetics) <ul> <li>Paladin weapons are sold separately, costing 430 Poetics for the Sword and 170 Poetics for the Shield</li> </ul> </li> <li>Helm (355 Poetics)</li> <li>Chest (510 Poetics)</li> <li>Gloves (345 Poetics)</li> <li>Legs (510 Poetics)</li> <li>Feet (345 Poetics)</li> <li>Accessories (280 Poetics)</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="99" data-current-count="99" data-injectable="false">To get a full set of Augmented gear for a single Job class, you’ll need a total of <strong>4,065 Poetics</strong>.</p> <h2 id="h-relic-weapons" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic weapons</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="137" data-current-count="536" data-injectable="true">If you’re currently working towards either a Zodiac or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-anima-weapons-guide-every-quest-item-and-duty-required-for-heavensward-relic/">Anima relic</a>, then you’re definitely going to need all the Poetics you can get.</p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">Both Zodiac and Anima relic weapons require large amounts of Poetics in order to complete a single weapon. Currently, other Relic weapons (Eureka and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-begin-ffxiv-manderville-weapon-quest-endwalker-relic-guide/">Manderville</a>) require no Poetics to complete and Resistance weapons (<em>Shadowbringers</em> relics) require only 1,000 Poetics to get started.</p> <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true">Here’s how many poetics you’ll need to complete one Relic for Zodiac and Anima weapons, if you only use Poetics to complete the required steps, rather than the alternative options available:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Zodiac</strong> <ul> <li>3,575 Poetics maximum</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Anima</strong> <ul> <li>23,000 Poetics maximum</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 id="h-swap-poetics-for-gil-or-grand-company-seals" data-injectable="false"><strong>Swap Poetics for Gil or Grand Company Seals</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="721" data-injectable="true">While purchasing items with Poetics and selling them on the Marketboard certainly isn’t going to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-make-gil-without-crafting-in-final-fantasy-xiv/">make you rich</a>, it is a solid way to use those Poetics if you’ve got nothing else to do with them. The items worth the most are always changing, but you can use resources such as <a href="https://universalis.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Universalis</a> to check how much items are currently selling for.</p>
 <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="312" data-injectable="false">If you want some <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-grand-company-guide-how-and-which-to-join/">GC Seals</a>, the best method to do this is by purchasing the highest level of Augmented Shield available (at this time, that’s Cryptlurker), then turning them over to the GC. With these Seals, you can buy items that sell for a profit on the Marketboard, or take your chances with Materiel Crates.</p> <h2 id="h-increase-your-desynthesis-levels" data-injectable="false"><strong>Increase your Desynthesis levels</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="612" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">This is a bit of an obscure option, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t an option. If you’re looking to increase your Desynthesis levels and have a surplus of Poetics, you can purchase high level gear and Desynth it in order to get base materials and boost your level.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true">To tell which class can Desynth a specific piece of gear, just see which Crafting class is needed to repair it. This same class will be capable of Desynthing the item. However, here’s a good outline of which class can do Desynth which items:</p>
 <figure data-found-rows="8" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="false"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Crafting Class</strong></td><td><strong>Items to Desynth</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Blacksmith</td><td>Swords (Paladin or Dark Knight weapon)<br>Gunblades (Gunbreaker weapon)<br>Axes (Warrior weapon)</td></tr><tr><td>Carpenter</td><td>Spears (Dragoon weapon)<br>Bows (Bard weapon)</td></tr><tr><td>Armorer</td><td>Shields (Paladin off-hand)</td></tr><tr><td>Leatherworker</td><td>Armor (Check repair class)</td></tr><tr><td>Alchemist</td><td>Codexes (Scholar weapon)<br>Grimoires (Summoner weapon)</td></tr><tr><td>Goldsmith</td><td>Accessories<br>Star Globes (Astrologian weapon)<br>Rapiers (Red Mage weapon)</td></tr><tr><td>Weaver&nbsp;</td><td>Armor (Check repair class)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wuthering-waves-character-tier-list-%E2%80%93-main-dps-secondary-dps-and-support.878382/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-character-tier-list-main-dps-secondary-dps-and-support/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wuthering-waves-character-tier-list-main-dps-secondary-dps-and-support<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="195" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Keeping your parties at maximum efficiency isn’t always easy, and with lots of characters to pick from in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, you may want to have a little advice on where the real power lies.</p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">Now, tier lists are not easy, so feel free to read through the multiple disclaimers I always put on advice like this before you get to the meat of the article. I’ll break the characters into three main battlefield roles and let you know where I think they lie in the pantheon of power in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-wuthering-waves-character-tier-list" data-injectable="false">Wuthering Waves character tier list</h2> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true">Okay, let’s get down to it. Tier Lists are hard because characters have more nuance than just their primary function. Oftentimes, it is combinations of characters that will really take each other to the next level, or perhaps items or weapons can give them a new lease on life. For simplicity’s sake, this Tier List is judging the character kits alone. </p>
 <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">We will be doing individual guides for the characters that detail weapons to use, Echoes to use, and team comps to really take advantage of them, but that is way too complicated to take into account here. So, this is really just about the basic kit for each character rather than their potential upper limit if you get perfect weapons.</p> <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">The final thing to note is that a lot can change at launch. Some characters will be getting buffs or kit changes, so we will take that into account when we come back to this for an update. There is also a degree of theory crafting involved in these lists, so they will constantly be updated as we explore more of the game or discover some exciting nuance of a character.</p>
 <p data-characters="665" data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true">Ultimately, I advise you to treat this Tier List as it is intended, which is as a rough benchmark of a character’s power within their role only. I’ve limited each character to one role. I’m aware this is not the approach many folks take, but I tend to assume people are looking at these lists to decide where to invest their resources. If you are considering Yinlin as a main DPS, and she is not on that list, it is because I do not think she is a good option compared to other potential characters. The character I have broken this rule for is Rover, as everyone will have them and be trying to build their team around them, one way or the other.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Main DPS Tier List</h3> <figure data-found-rows="3" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Character</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>S</td><td>Calcharo (Electro), Danjin (Havoc), Jiyan (Aero)</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>Chixia (Fusion), Encore (Fusion), Lingyang (Glacio)</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>Rover (Spectro)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/arctic-eggs-cooking-eggs-retro-egg-flipping-simulator-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There is a recurring question in <em>Arctic Eggs</em>, asked by several characters, and repeated almost like a koan: “Do you think you can you fry eggs on top of Mount Everest?” Sometimes the answer is practical, discussing the thermodynamics of the act. Other times the answer is social or existential, addressing the potential motivations behind someone attempting the act. But uniformly the responses are cryptic, haunting, and hilarious, which are not descriptors you would anticipate about a game whose primary verb is frying eggs.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>A balanced breakfast. Credit: The Water Museum</figcaption></figure><p><em>Arctic Eggs</em> is a low-poly, sci-fi cooking simulator. I would throw in the term cyberpunk as well, but in the original bleak sense of the genre, as the last few years have not been too kind to that descriptor. The backdrop is Antarctica in 2091, in a dire city that looks almost post-Soviet. Following your attempted escape from this place, the ruler of the area, known as The Saint Of Six Stomachs, had stripped you of your main functions, reducing you to a “Poultry Peddler” whose only abilities are to walk and cook. You may be granted your freedom, but only if you cook your way to the top, feeding 27 hungry people and potentially gaining an audience with the Saint themselves.</p><figure><figcaption>Moments of kindness. Credit: The Water Museum</figcaption></figure><p><em>Arctic Eggs </em>is a fairly simple game mechanically. You control a frying pan, a low poly version of a T-fal that you may own now, because nonstick pans disintegrate after 2-3 years so it doesn’t make sense to buy anything but the budget option. You tilt the pan back and forth by moving the mouse, and increase or decrease the sensitivity with the mouse scroll. Heat is generated by moving the pan, and you must cook items evenly on all sides by flipping them with a quick wrist flick.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>My boy can work a grill. Credit: The Water Museum</figcaption></figure><p>The game starts you off with eggs, but as you progress between hungry people, new food and non-food items are introduced, each with their own challenging behaviors, from pufferfish that behave like living basketballs to cigarettes that act like slowly burning timers and are added exclusively for flavor. As far as I can tell, this is one of the few games that makes you cook eggs alongside live rifle rounds. The game has multiple difficulty settings, but the only difference is the depth of the pan’s lip, with a wok being easy, and a crepe pan being hard.</p><figure><figcaption>This is more or less how I feel all the time. Credit: The Water Museum</figcaption></figure><p>Different meals are requested by different NPCs, and this is where the mood and writing in <em>Arctic Eggs </em>shines. Each of the character models is rendered with rough and undulating skin, like you’re playing a PC game from 1999 while dosed substantially. It’s deep fried <em>Deus Ex</em>. The characters themselves speak in beguiling and brusque language, oftentimes with intentional and self-correcting typos. I found myself laughing hysterically multiple times less because of jokes and more because of how sentences are phrased.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>That's so sweet of you. Credit: The Water Museum</figcaption></figure><p>The topics are broad. A man expresses regrets wasting his 20s raising a stingray. Another espouses the benefits of drinking early because it’s good to get your crying done before it’s dark.&nbsp; Some motifs repeat, like flamingos, dolphins, cigarettes, and having a Polish girlfriend. And then you get these beautiful, eerie moments of sadness and ennui. In one scene, a fisherman describes how his son is slowly replacing every organ in his body mechanically. He does not dwell over the loss of self, as he can recognize his son despite being mechanically replaced as well, but he is spending his remaining days savoring food because they’re taking his tongue next.</p><p>There are many games that <em>Arctic Eggs</em> reminds me of, but only in its parts. It is funny and abrasive like <em>Cruelty Squad</em>, features haunting vignettes with characters like <em>NieR: Automata</em>, and it’s mechanically absurd like <em>QWOP </em>or <em>Katamari Damacy</em>. But to the game’s credit, none of those comparisons alone capture the totality. Like the taste of an egg, a fish, and a cigarette fried in the same pan, <em>Arctic Eggs </em>has an unforgettable flavor unlike anything else. And it achieves this by sandwiching slivers of absurdity and sadness between slabs of the most absurd gameplay possible. These little scenes, unconcerned with how they would break the larger reality of the world they populate, are more affecting than writing in much larger games, in part because they are cryptic and leave the player to stew in their potential significance.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Egg question. Credit: The Water Museum</figcaption></figure><p>Can you fry eggs on top of Mount Everest? The game has an answer, but I can’t claim to know personally. I do know that it’s a funny thing to think about for a few hours, a terse hypothetical and a wonderful starting off point to one of the funniest and most memorable indie games I’ve played this year. And that’s high praise indeed given the <a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-games-pc-2024-may-hades-2-little-kitty-1000xresist-manor-lords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">competition</a>.</p><p><em>Arctic Eggs </em>is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2763670/Arctic_Eggs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available now on Steam</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The last couple of races have given Formula 1 fans a fresh injection of high octane excitement, with Max Verstappen and Red Bull’s inevitability suddenly in doubt thanks to a resurgent McLaren at the hands of Lando Norris. Throw a healthy step forward for Ferrari, and it this could turn into a very fun season to watch. You know what else is fun? Video games, and Codemasters will be glad of the real sport’s entertainment to drum up interest for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/f1-24">F1 24</a>, which is shaping up to be another big step forward for their motorsports series.</p>

Coming under the capitalise branding of Dynamic Handling – something shared with last year’s excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/ea-sports-wrc-review/">WRC</a> – there’s a new suspension kinematic system that will more accurately represent how cars move around under the massive aerodynamic loads, modelling of how tyres heat up, improved aerodynamics modelling and more.</p>


<p>It’s difficult to truly quantify how meaningful the all-new suspension model is, but without any tweaking it presents a more challenging drive than F1 23, feeling twitchier and more abrupt than its predecessor. There’s a raft of options though to tailor the handling to your personal preferences, and I was able to dial it in to a point that felt comfortable and responsive.</p>


<p>Alongside the handling, there’s been several updates made to the accuracy of each track, but in particular the development team has focused on fan favourites Silverstone and Spa-Francorchamps, as well as giving recent additions Losail and Jeddah another pass, adding extra detail to both the track elements, and the wider setting. You can see this in Saudi Arabia with the arrival of the vibrant colours of the track limits and cut-off areas, making it feel closer than ever to the real thing.</p>
<p>That commitment to replicating the real thing extends this year to the inclusion of speech from each driver, so you can hear Daniel Riccardo’s downbeat response to Lance Stroll causing yet another pile-up, or Lando Norris congratulating his team on their work. Codemasters has been able to draw from broadcast archives for these soundbites, but don’t expect hours of additional dialogue.</p>
<p>Depending on the situation, be prepared to hear the same lines time and time again, and it’s a bit disappointing not to hear them respond mid-race to events that are playing out. It’s an improvement, but an undercooked one. However, your created player can gain additional speech options via the in-game shop, or more can be unlocked via the in-game VIP pass – a premium battle pass for the game which is included if you buy the more-expensive Champions Edition.</p>
<p>What doesn’t feel realistic is the way the game treats its wider simulation, and F1 24 can certainly spit out some very odd results. We’re not just talking about the occasional car failing or crashing out, but races where a driver can have won, despite suffering significant damage earlier on in the session.</p>

<p>As it stands, there are also some oddities to the more… impactful physics model. While the way rogue wheels behave has always caused some issues, they look particularly weird here. It’s a shame that a high-force crash doesn’t result in a realistic-looking wreck, and while the aim of the game is clearly not to crash, it definitely happens with enough regularity that you’ll witness some very odd physics at play.</p>
<p>The visuals have been given a good scrub-up for 2024, and many of the tracks look better than they ever have. One of my personal favourites, Monaco, just looks that much more eye-catching than it did last year, and that’s gratifying after 12 months with the previous game. Foliage, hoardings and track furniture are fuller, more detailed and just nicer to look at, and at this early stage in our F1 24 career it’s pretty enough to be distracting at times. Luckily, you can still rewind your mistakes.</p>
<p>As part of those visual improvements, the drivers themselves look genuinely phenomenal. If you compare them to the previous year’s versions, the improvements are deeply impressive, with revised skin, hair and facial detail ensuring that it feels as though you’re part of the Formula 1 world.</p>

<p>While the current raft of drivers are stars in their own right – particularly after Drive to Survive has made them household names, even in households that don’t like F1 – one of my favourite additions is the ability to take legendary drivers like Nigel Mansell and Ayrton Senna into the career mode. While F1 23 allowed you to choose a number of iconic racers as your teammate for the season, now you can play through a further career with them, perhaps returning them to the spotlight after many years away from the grid.</p>
<p>F1 24 brings VR support to PC players, but PSVR 2 will miss out once again this year, which is disappointing given that it’s the most accessible route into home VR. I really hope that this is an update that PS5 owners can look forward to, but there’s no word on that becoming a reality.</p>
<p>Thus far, PC performance is impressively smooth, with my GeForce 3070-equipped rig sitting right on the Recommended specifications. We were able to run nearly everything at ultra-high graphic settings while maintaining a framerate over 100 FPS, and even in the early review build all of the external options and menus operated exactly as you’d hope. One of the clear improvements is the cinematic view, and replays look and perform more realistically than ever before.</p>
<p>If you’re ready for a new season of Formula 1, F1 24 is already shaping up to be a clear step up from its predecessor, bringing smart changes and improvements to what was already an enveloping driving experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mattel-outright-games-partnership<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Barbie&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Matchbox&nbsp;</em>company Mattel has announced a partnership with Outright Games, which is apparently a "leading publisher" of family-friendly games.</p>

<p>According to a press release, Mattel is looking for "top-tier" studios with which to work on video game adaptations of some of its most beloved IPs, and to that end, the toy giant has apparently settled on&nbsp;<em>Bluey: The Videogame&nbsp;</em>developer Outright.</p>

<p>In said press release, Outright's Stephanie Malham says her studio prides itself on expanding major IPs into "cherished video games", which <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/15882/bluey-the-videogame" rel="noopener" target="_blank">feels</a> just a <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/14459/peppa-pig-world-adventures" rel="noopener" target="_blank">touch</a> like an <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/13427/dc-league-of-super-pets-the-adventures-of-krypto-and-ace" rel="noopener" target="_blank">overstatement</a> to me, but hey.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mattel-outright-games-dc-league-of-super-pets.jpg?itok=sbv5Jtzs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mattel-outright-games-dc-league-of-super-pets.jpg?itok=U0Fa54Jm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Outright Games is best known for "cherished" titles like&nbsp;<em>DC League of Super-Pets: The Adventures of Krypto and Ace</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Together, Mattel and Outright are working on three major projects based on Mattel IPs, and all three of them are set to launch on PC and consoles before the end of 2024.</p>

<p>Those games are&nbsp;<em>Matchbox Driving Adventures</em>, <i>Monster High: Skulltimate Secrets</i>, and&nbsp;<em>Barbie Project Friendship</em>. No prizes for guessing which Mattel IPs they'll all be based on.</p>

<p>According to the aforementioned press release,&nbsp;<em>Matchbox Driving Adventures&nbsp;</em>will offer "high-speed competitive driving adventures", while&nbsp;<em>Barbie&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster High&nbsp;</em>will provide "stories that emphasize teamwork and foster friendship".</p>

<p>Whether or not that means the latter two will be primarily co-op focused remains to be seen, but more information will be available in the coming months. Better get those tenterhooks ready.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-mattel.jpg?itok=5YWQ9_Pp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-mattel.jpg?itok=YVyXxnz1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Mattel is already well-known in the gaming space thanks to games like&nbsp;<em>Hot Wheels Unleashed</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time Outright has teamed up with a well-known company whose products are largely intended for kids. All the way <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outright-games-partners-with-crayola-for-unnamed-upcoming-games">back in 2018</a>, Outright teamed up with Crayola for the&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk</em>-esque&nbsp;<em>Crayola Scoot</em>, which is presumably <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/6754/crayola-scoot" rel="noopener" target="_blank">another one of the publisher's "cherished" titles</a>.</p>

<p>Mattel is also already pretty well-represented in the gaming space thanks to titles like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-into-high-gear">Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 - Turbocharged</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-barbie-collab"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Barbie</em>-themed content</a>, although Outright isn't involved with either of these, naturally.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what this collaboration yields, but I'm sure the three games outlined by the two companies will be all-time classics. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/22/24162373/super-mario-maker-builder-64-rom-hack-nintendo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18758773/super-mario-maker-2-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Maker</em> series</a> of games lets you create your own sidescrolling platformer levels using sprites and 3D objects from several entries in the franchise. It’s created a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/12/24127340/super-mario-maker-nintendo-wii-u-shutdown">deeply devoted fan base</a>, but it’s only ever let you make sidescrolling levels. Now, a pair of fans have changed that with <a href="https://romhacking.com/hack/mario-builder-64">Mario Builder 64</a>, a new way to make and play your own <em>Super Mario 64</em> levels — and do so on Nintendo 64 hardware. </p><p>It’s technically a ROM hack, but the term doesn’t really capture what this is. The developers, <a href="https://romhacking.com/user/Arthurtilly">Arthurtilly</a> and <a href="https://romhacking.com/user/rovertronic">rovertronic</a>, describe it as “a toolbox letting you fulfill all of your SM64 dreams.” Just like the <em>Super Mario Maker</em> series, it lets you create your own levels using a special creator interface that borrows a lot from <em>Minecraft, </em>giving you low-res textured (this is the N64 after all) cubes that you can drop in place. </p><p>You can also decide what music you want, place items and villains, and even play with <em>Mario 64 </em>conventions. For instance, there’s no hard limit on how many red coins you can require players to collect to get a star. </p><p>To use it, you have to patch a <em>Mario 64</em> ROM file yourself. The developers have a <a href="https://rentry.co/mb64-setup-guide">guide for doing so</a> (in addition to the video above), and you’ll need an emulator or an actual Nintendo 64 to play the game with the Builder 64 modifications in place. As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-super-mario-64-mod-may-be-as-close-as-we-ever-get-to-mario-maker-3d-204024562.html?src=rss"><em>Engadget</em> points out</a>, you can do that with a flashcart that supports SD cards — several options are listed in the guide linked above.</p><p>I haven’t been able to play around with Mario Builder 64 just yet, but I’m eager to do so as soon as life affords me the time. It looks like a blast, judging by <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_UnDcfx1Dn4">this video</a> from the Good Vibes Gaming YouTube channel. As pointed out in that video, you can <a href="https://levelsharesquare.com/levels">download other user-created levels</a> from Level Share Square, a site that hosts levels made for various fan-made <em>Mario</em> level creators.</p><div><p>But how long will Mario Builder 64 last? Only Nintendo knows what its bar is for taking down projects like this, but it has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24098640/nintendo-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit-switch-aftermath">put emulator developers on edge</a> with some high-profile takedowns lately. There’s its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">$2.4 million settlement</a> with Switch emulator Yuzu’s developers and subsequent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/3/24147936/nintendo-dmca-takedown-yuzu-emulator-copies">obliteration of GitHub-hosted Yuzu forks</a> — and its insistence that the creators of <em>Garry’s Mod</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/25/24140246/garrys-mod-nintendo-copyright-takedowns-dmca">remove two decades of Nintendo-related content</a>. </p></div><p>To be fair, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24085075/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit">Yuzu let people play</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23706907/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-streams-leak-nintendo"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> before it was released</a>, and people used <em>Garry’s Mod</em> to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DC_Oc9mhyuBQ&amp;xcust=___vg__p_23904287__t_w__r_https://www.google.com/__d_D">turn <em>Super Mario 64</em></a> into a first-person shooter, which Nintendo probably wasn’t thrilled about. Mario Builder 64 is just doing <em>Super Mario 64 </em>stuff, so maybe it gets a pass, but that probably depends on Nintendo’s plans for the <em>Mario Maker</em> series, which could easily involve something just like Mario Builder 64. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161985/tom-king-archie-comic-decision-bettie-veronica<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="KUKiZC">Archie’s been putting his tough choices off for too long. It’s finally time for Riverdale’s favorite son to decide between Betty and Veronica, and thankfully he’ll have a special guest writer to help make sure things go smoothly. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22824979/best-dc-comics-2021-rorschach-watchmen-tom-king">Legendary comic scribe Tom King</a>, along with artist Dan Parent, will step in for a full-length one-shot called <em>Archie: The Decision</em>, in which Archie finally makes his choice. </p>
<p id="MRp3g0">As you might expect for such a landmark moment in Riverdale’s history, <em>The Decision</em> will feature many of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23824779/archie-comics-danni-malloy-trans-representation">Archie Comics’</a> fan-favorite characters, from Josie and the Pussycats to Sabrina the Teenage Witch, all reacting to the decision and sharing their thoughts. </p>
<p id="wsRNjw"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/2/6/18186853/mister-miracle-5-explained-tom-king">King</a>’s reputation as a writer of the biggest, thinkiest superhero comics of the last decade tends to overshadow the consistent humor in his books. The writer of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/20/22240734/wandavision-comics-vision-scarlet-witch-marriage-explained"><em>The Vision</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2016/12/29/14093714/rogue-one-comic-omega-men"><em>Omega Men</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/2/6/18186853/mister-miracle-5-explained-tom-king"><em>Mister Miracle</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/12/19/21028752/batman-85-tom-king-final-issue-joker-dc-comics"><em>Batman</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/7/26/22591012/new-supergirl-superman-comics-tom-king-dc"><em>Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow</em></a> seems excited to fully embrace Archie-style comedy. </p>
<p id="7ZAYPA">“As a massive Archie fan, this is just a pure joy project for me,” King told Polygon via email. “I wanted to do something zany and cool and screwball and hysterical and gorgeous and harebrained and maybe a little tiny itty-bitty bit profound as a tribute to my Golden and Silver Age Archie heroes — people like Dan DeCarlo, Harry Lucey, Bob Bolling, Bob Montana, and Samm Schwartz. And who better to do that with than the modern Archie maestro, Dan Parent, who inherited and brilliantly carried on the legacy of those giants. [<em>The Decision</em>] is an epic, riotous story featuring scores of Archie characters where Dan and I wrestle with the greatest dilemma in the near 85-year history of comics: Betty or Veronica!? I’m not sure we can solve it, but, like all of Riverdale, we’re going to have a ton of fun trying.”</p>
<p id="EvCoz6"><em>Archie: The Decision</em> hits shelves on Aug. 28, clocking in at a full 32 all-ages pages. Archie Comics has shared a sneak peek of the issue with Polygon, including a variant cover by Stephen Byrne and one page of the book itself, that you can check out below:</p>

<p>With the success of Helldivers 2, Arrowhead Games Studios has some big new aspirations. In a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-game-studios-appoints-new-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former CEO, now Chief Creative Officer,</a> Johan Pilestedt said that the studio wants to become the next major studio like Blizzard of FromSoftware. </p>



<p>“We pride ourselves on being an independent studio,” he told the outlet when talking about making the games they want. “We have to see what the future holds, but there’s nothing in the plans where we want to be acquired by somebody.</p>



<p>“I want to see how high we can fly. And bringing Shams on board, we have a good potential to realize that future of turning into the next From Software or Blizzard.”</p>



<p>How that looks, exactly, isn’t clear because it’s not something that happens overnight. Even with the fast rise of Helldivers 2, new CEO Shams Jorjani says he knows there is work to be done, but that he doesn’t want the company to lose focus of why they do what they do.</p>



<p>“We will see growth, but growth as a means to an ends, not as an end itself,” Jorjani said. “We don’t have plans to go public. None of those shenanigans. Measured growth that allows us to make amazing game and be a good place to work.</p>



<p>“We don’t run the business for monetary gain,” Pilestedt said. “The humbleness and the desire to just make great games is the only reason we exist.”</p>

<p>Countless players worldwide didn’t upgrade their last-gen systems to the current-gen, most likely due to the rising cost of console hardware. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X remain costly, and the exclusives aren’t up to snuff, so why upgrade? If you’re one of the many playing on an old system, you still don’t want to miss out. So, can you play XDefiant on Xbox One?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-xdefiant-on-xbox-one">Is XDefiant on Xbox One?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, you cannot play XDefiant on Xbox One. Despite being a free-to-play game that one would imagine Ubisoft wants everywhere all at once, the arena shooter is only available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>That said if you have a PC—not even a top-of-the-line system—you can likely play XDefiant. The overall system requirements, especially the minimum and recommended, are welcoming to most players. To enjoy the free-to-play shooter on PC, download Ubisoft Connect, visit the store page, and add the game to your account. You may then download and install it via your game library and hop into the game!</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-xdefiant-free-on-xbox">Can You Play XDefiant Free on Xbox?</h2>



<p>While you can’t play XDefiant on Xbox One, you can play free on Xbox Series X|S. You can play XDefiant free on all its supported systems: PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. It’s a completely free-to-play arena shooter, though it does have microtransactions, that you can download and enjoy without paying a dime.</p>



<p>On Xbox Series X|S, visit the Xbox Store, search for XDefiant, and add the game to your account to start downloading. Once finished, boot up the game and enjoy!</p>



<hr>



<p>XDefiant is taking the gaming world by storm, which is a pleasant surprise. But does it have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-xdefiant-have-search-and-destroy-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Search and Destroy</a>?

Now, according to former Arrowhead CEO and now Arrowhead Chief Creative Officer Johan Pilestedt, bigger success means bigger toxicity.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Helldivers 2 Polar Patriots Premium Warbond Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>"The big difference now, which is horrifying, is the amount of threats and rude behavior that people in the studio are getting from some really shitty individuals within the community," Pilestedt told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "That’s something new we have to deal with."</p><p>When Helldivers 2 launched it faced significant server issues that made the game unplayable for many, sparking an initial backlash. But since that issue was largely resolved, Arrowhead has faced complaints about everything from weapon balance to low impact Premium Warbonds. But by far the biggest backlash was sparked by Sony’s controversial decision to force PC gamers to link to a PlayStation Network account to play. Sony eventually reversed its decision, but not before a review-bombing campaign savaged Helldivers 2 on Steam. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-to-revert-patrol-and-spawn-rate-changes-admits-psn-controversy-diverted-studios-attention">Arrowhead community managers have said the PSN backlash caused staff to lose a week simply having to deal with the fallout</a>.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The big difference now, which is horrifying, is the amount of threats and rude behavior that people in the studio are getting from some really shitty individuals within the community.</p></div><p>That’s plenty to contend with in just a few months post-launch. But Pilestedt suggested the way Helldivers 2 was designed, with frustration deliberately in place to craft the co-op experience hardcore players fully understand and appreciate, may also fuel toxicity from the wider playerbase. “If you don't have those lows, you can't get those highs,” Pilestedt said.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-is-now-its-chief-creative-officer-i-care-more-about-weapon-balance-than-qbrs">New Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani</a> added: "Arrowhead’s philosophy has always been 'a game for everyone is a game for no-one.' That is the company slogan. It’s how our games are designed. You can feel it in every feature. I think it’s one of the big reasons that Helldivers 2 has been so successful. It feels fresh because it does a lot of unpopular stuff.</p><p>"When you hit this big, much bigger than anyone thought – Sony, us, everyone – what happens is the game finds an audience outside of that niche fan group. So you get this amplification of different voices. Almost all games have a bit of toxicity in the community, but with these big numbers you just get so many, so we need to work with the community to get them to self-moderate, give people the tools to speak with each other in a positive fashion, so we can keep talking to the players openly. The more voices being added to the choir does add complexity."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The more voices being added to the choir does add complexity.</p></div><p>Jorjani said that Arrowhead is currently “learning painfully” how to create systems to deal with this level of toxicity, but the work will benefit the studio’s “next thing, whatever that may be.”</p><p>Arrowhead isn’t the first developer to call out toxicity within video game communities. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cities-skylines-2-dev-calls-out-growing-tendency-of-toxicity-in-its-community">Cities: Skylines 2 developer Colossal Order asked players to help create a more positive environment after noticing “a growing tendency of toxicity” in its community</a>.</p><p>As for Helldivers 2, Arrowhead is full steam ahead on adding content to its live service, although <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-says-it-will-take-more-time-with-patches-to-maintain-the-quality-standard-we-want-and-you-deserve">it has indicated plans to slow down the frequency of patch releases</a> to make sure it gets them right.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Now, Johan Pilestedt, who was Arrowhead CEO, becomes Chief Creative Officer. In a tweet, Pilestedt said this means he will get to focus more on the studio’s games as well as its community.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey everyone,</p><p>Big update, I've decided to hire <a href="https://twitter.com/ShamsJorjani?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ShamsJorjani</a> as the new CEO of <a href="https://twitter.com/ArrowheadGS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ArrowheadGS</a>!

In a tweet, Jorjani said he was “humbled and excited to get to work with such talented nerds (again!).” Pilestedt remains Arrowhead chairman amid the reshuffle.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Shams Jorjani (@ShamsJorjani) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShamsJorjani/status/1793267715756458049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 22, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The shakeup at the top of Arrowhead comes after a particularly difficult time for the developer, which butted heads with Helldivers 2 publisher and IP owner Sony over the PSN account requirement backlash. Sony eventually reversed its decision, but the game remains unavailable in countries where PSN is not live.</p><p>Arrowhead has also indicated it wants to spend more time focusing on things like patches and weapon balance after community complaints around nerfs and low impact Premium Warbonds. Just this week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-says-it-will-take-more-time-with-patches-to-maintain-the-quality-standard-we-want-and-you-deserve">Arrowhead said it was pumping out balance patches too fast</a>, and wanted to slow the live service down a bit.</p><p>In a subsequent <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1793268430734340405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Pilestedt explained his decision to step down as CEO further: “Not nearly done.

                <p>The Philippines-based Polychroma Games is set to release the narrative adventure game Until Then later this year. It follows a young teenager named Mark in the Philippines as he goes through the trials and tribulations of high-school life, such as hitting deadlines and making presentations. However, people from his life start disappearing and his memories become unreliable, meaning it's up to him to check up with his friends to untangle the mystery surrounding his memories. Until Then explores the lives of Filipino students through its gorgeous pixel-art style and how themes like communication and friendship are so integral to Filipino culture.</p><p>Slice-of-life, coming-of-age stories that depict daily school lives are incredibly popular in Asian media, especially in video games. The most prominent example is the Persona series, which is set in Japan. Until Then follows similar footsteps with Mark. "It's the same with the Philippines as well," Polychroma Games senior environmental artist Pia Demanawa tells GameSpot. "This is the part that we romanticize the most, because we feel furthest away from adult responsibilities here, and we can just mess around with our friends."</p><p>Director Mickole Klein Nulud adds that academics and achievements play a big part in many of Asia's youth, saying, "We spend a lot of our time in youth here and, as a result, end up making it a stage for interesting things to happen in stories, both good and bad."</p><p>Until Then also features many nuances of Filipino culture within its themes. Demanawa says that communication is the most important theme in Until Then. In Filipino culture, there's a word, "torpe," which describes a person who doesn't show their feelings towards someone they like. Throughout the game, Mark shows some interest in a few girls, and things sometimes don’t go his way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQQgY2fVTOY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PQQgY2fVTOY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>What exemplifies the concept of torpe more than unrequited teenage love? "Because the characters don't open up with each other, they end up misunderstanding and assuming a lot of things about each other," Demanawa explains. "That threatens and breaks apart the relationships that they have, and in the end, they can only really strengthen their bonds as friends."</p><p>Until Then is presented in a 2.5D pixel-art style, similar to other Southeast Asian-developed games such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/chinatown-detective-agency-review-carmen-singapore/1900-6417856/" data-ref-id="1900-6417856">Chinatown Detective Agency</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/a-space-for-the-unbound-launch-trailer/2300-6460495/" data-ref-id="2300-6460495">A Space for the Unbound</a>. He says that he enjoyed the pixel-art style and thought that having an eye-catching visual style was important for the game. Nulud also specifically cites the cinematic platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/612400/The_Last_Night/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Last Night</a> as an inspiration.</p><p>Nulud says that one of the biggest challenges in developing the game was the sheer number of sprites that needed to be managed. There are tens of thousands of PNG files from all character animations combined just to make the faces of the 2D characters' faces expressive.</p><p>"In scenes, we manually change each characters' facial expressions almost line by line in addition to perfecting the timing of delivery and pauses," he says. "I find it a little funny because, as the director, I am literally directing how these characters act as if they were real people."</p><p>Demanawa adds that the character sprites started with the same number of pixels as their backgrounds. However, the pixel density of the sprites was later increased in order to emphasize the characters' mannerisms. They explain, "This would allow us to have more real estate with poses and expressions, which is necessary to really let the characters' unique identities shine through."</p><p>The game also has many inspirations and references from real-life places in the Philippines. In the beginning of the game, Mark rides the train station to school, which is modeled after the real-life Katipunan station and LRT-2, a transit line in Metro Manila. The Quezon Memorial Circle also shows up in-game briefly, and Mark's school--the fictional Liamson Integrated School--is based off of Nulud's real-life alma mater, Rizal National Science High School.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304473-liamsonintegratedschool.png" data-ref-id="1300-4304473" data-ratio="0.56225528582616" data-width="1277" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304473-liamsonintegratedschool.png" data-ref-id="1300-4304473"></a><figcaption>Until Then</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304473-liamsonintegratedschool.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304474-pixelrenderingguide.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304475-quezonmemorialcirclebyjoshuakyleonunsplash.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304476-quezonmemorialcircle.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304477-spriteaaartstyleprogression.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304478-ss_7a6b9d48d8d4d993560c9bc44bb3c02ceca52c3f.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304479-ss_8403d06de2c801d99bc743c105cd6ef049743d60.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4304474,1300-4304475,1300-4304476,1300-4304477,1300-4304478,1300-4304479" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4304474-pixelrenderingguide.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4304475-quezonmemorialcirclebyjoshuakyleonunsplash.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4304476-quezonmemorialcircle.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4304477-spriteaaartstyleprogression.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4304478-ss_7a6b9d48d8d4d993560c9bc44bb3c02ceca52c3f.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4304479-ss_8403d06de2c801d99bc743c105cd6ef049743d60.1920x1080.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304474-pixelrenderingguide.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304475-quezonmemorialcirclebyjoshuakyleonunsplash.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304476-quezonmemorialcircle.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304477-spriteaaartstyleprogression.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304478-ss_7a6b9d48d8d4d993560c9bc44bb3c02ceca52c3f.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304479-ss_8403d06de2c801d99bc743c105cd6ef049743d60.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>Nulud says, "If it's not any particular place, we take general inspiration from the houses you'd find in the streets, Filipino architecture, and so on."</p><p>Until Then's development started during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Dmanawa says that the team couldn't physically visit places for inspiration, so they had to rely on things like Google Earth and their own memories in order to recreate them. While the locations in Until Then aren't pulled straight from real life, they're the result of amalgamations that the team brainstormed together.</p><p>There were also inspirations from anime and movies as well, and Nulud's taste in film and anime changed throughout the game's four-year development cycle. At the beginning, Until Then's story aspirations were inspired by Naoshi Arakawa's Your Lie in April and Makoto Shinkai's work. However, as development continued, more artful and slower films such as ones by Ryusuke Hamaguchi took a stronger hold on his influences.</p><p>"Now I know we can't just do a 180 and change the story's fundamentals in response to new inspiration," he explains. "We have to strike a certain balance, and indeed, there are times where this side of our influences shows and those are my favorite moments in the game."</p><p>Nulud also notes that human relationships and communication are some of his favorite ideas to tackle, saying, "As for how they're reflected in the game, it's best that players find out for themselves in this beautiful, cathartic journey we crafted."</p><p>Until Then will launch for PS5 and PC later this year--it had been due out on May 23, only to be delayed by a few weeks, with no new date set yet. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574820/Until_Then/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A demo is available on Steam</a>.</p>

                <p>The Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt has a number of projects in the works, including a new IP in the works under the codename Hadar. Maria Mazur, a quest designer on Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty expansion, told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-3-and-cyberpunk-2077-studio-dev-thinks-it-only-makes-sense-for-cd-projekt-red-to-make-a-new-ip-that-comes-straight-from-us/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> that it "only makes sense" for the Polish game studio to branch out and make something brand-new. Mazur also debunked a rumor about the new IP.</p><p>"I feel like it only makes sense given how many kinds of people we have on this, like the storytelling side of things but also our artists," Mazur said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/22/hunt-showdowns-new-gen-console-update-arrives-in-august-rendering-last-gen-versions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Crytek has announced the release date for Hunt: Showdown’s new-gen update, which will also conclude support for the current console versions. This update was first announced last September and will essentially force last-gen players to migrate to current consoles to continue playing the popular shooter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a developer update, general manager David Fifield announced that the CryEngine 5.11 Update will go live on August 15. This update is treated as a “significant relaunch” that brings native PS5/Xbox Series X/S support along with a host of technical improvements. However, it also means the PS4 and Xbox One versions will become unplayable.</p>

<p>That means these players must upgrade to current hardware to continue playing their copies of the game.&nbsp;Crytek assures these players that if they decide to upgrade, player accounts, entitlements, and all owned DLC will transfer to the new-gen version for no extra cost.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M0lAW63LTYo" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>In addition to technical improvements, the 5.11 Update also introduces a new map and biome. In the months leading to 5.11’s launch, Crytek plans to address community and survey feedback. That includes improved reporting systems to address cheating and toxic player behavior, design reworks tackling hunter revival, health chunks, restorations, burning down hunters, and reducing stalemates. The game is also getting a new user interface, and Crytek will continue evolving the game's recruitment and prestige progression requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hunt: Showdown first launched for Xbox and PC in 2019, with the PS4 version arriving in 2020. The PvPvE first-person shooter is set in 1865 Louisiana as players, either alone or with two or three friends, hunt supernatural bounties in the bayou while fending off other player-controlled bounty hunters.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="311" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve been putting off your <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-prepare-for-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> preparations</a> until now, it’s time to put things into high gear at long last. Notably, Bungie’s just announced that <em>all</em> of the game’s Brave weapons now drop at substantially higher rates, giving you a better shot at farming them.</p> <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">For those who aren’t in the know, Brave weapons are the snazzy new kit that’s been added to the game as part of the free <em>Into the Light</em> interim DLC, which has successfully served its role as a lead-up to <em>The Final Shape</em>. Now, with just a few weeks to go before the hotly anticipated DLC launches, Bungie has bumped up the overall drop rates for all the featured Brave weapons <a href="https://reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cxczmt/brave_weapon_rewards_increased/l52ikg4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by a fair margin</a>, according to the community.</p>
 <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">Now, do note that nobody is quite sure <em>how much</em> Bungie has increased the drop rates, with <a href="https://reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cxczmt/brave_weapon_rewards_increased/l53tc9a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some claiming that it’s only the Brave tokens</a> that are more common. The evidence <a href="https://reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cxczmt/brave_weapon_rewards_increased/l52qo6b/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">goes both ways</a> so far, but one thing’s for sure: it’s worth spending some time in <em>Destiny 2</em> if you want to fill out your inventory with solid gear ahead of <em>The Final Shape</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="661" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-don-t-let-the-fomo-get-you-but-do-grab-brave-weapons-while-you-still-can" data-injectable="false">Don’t let the FOMO get you, but do grab Brave weapons while you still can</h2> <p data-characters="547" data-current-count="547" data-injectable="true">This is particularly important because, even though the Brave weapon set itself <em>is</em> sticking around after <em>The Final Shape</em> comes out, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-shiny-destiny-2-into-the-light-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the awesome Shiny Brave weapons</a> are <em>not</em> going to be accessible anymore. Likely ever, considering Bungie’s stance on exclusive ‘you had to be there’ cosmetics. And, since the announcement specifically points out that you may also want to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-into-the-light-brings-back-fan-favorite-superblack-shader/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grab the Superblack shader</a> while it’s still around, it’s entirely possible that it, too, will be effectively sunset after <em>The Final Shape</em> comes out.</p>
 <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">That’s just how it goes in <em>Destiny</em> land, I suppose. A similar fate is about to befall <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/did-you-know-destiny-2-is-probably-going-to-sunset-fishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fishing mini-game</a> too, though I’d be hard-pressed to say that it’s even remotely as enticing or important as the Pantheon, Brave gear, and other such goodies.</p> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="662" data-injectable="true">If you don’t really care all that much about any of these items, then simply waiting until <em>The Final Shape</em> comes out proper is obviously the way to go. The DLC is due to come out on June 4, and its patch notes are so massive that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-final-shapes-patch-notes-are-so-big-that-bungies-splitting-them-across-three-previews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie’s had to split them across three <em>massive</em> preview blogs</a> just to stay on top of them all. That’s pretty exciting, even if you’re a cynic.</p>
 <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">So, all in all, you may as well consider this a last-call sort of thing for a huge list of <em>Destiny 2</em> content. If you have the chance and the inclination to do so, put your farming galoshes on and grind on.</p>

            <link>https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-mp7-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-best-mp7-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-mp7-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant.878313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-mp7-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-best-mp7-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="210" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you are tired of being killed by the MP7 in <em>XDefiant</em>, it might be time to start using the devastating SMG yourself. Here is the best set of attachments, and Faction to use in tandem with the popular weapon. </p> <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true"><em>XDefiant</em> supports several different play styles, depending on how you enjoy approaching a match. For players who enjoy being aggressive, shotguns and SMGs are the two best weapon classes for running and gunning. <em>XDefiant’s</em> meta will still take some time to settle in fully, but the MP7 is the preferred weapon for any gunfight 10 meters away or closer. The MP7 has it’s fair share of shortcomings, but that tradeoff is worth it for one of the best weapons in the title. </p>
 <h2 id="h-best-mp7-loadout-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">Best MP7 loadout in <em>XDefiant</em> </h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Lightweight </li> <li><strong>Front Rail: </strong>Pistol </li> <li><strong>Magazine: </strong>Fast Mag </li> <li><strong>Rear Grip: </strong>Quick Draw </li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong> Collapsed </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="568" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true">The MP7 doesn’t offer much in the way of accuracy, but that’s alright, considering this SMG dominates in mobility, firepower, and reload speed. With this set of attachments equipped, enemies will have a miserable time trying to fight while you slide around and make life difficult for them. I wouldn’t recommend trying to use this loadout for any mid-range gunfights, but it’s perfect for anything within 10 meters. The MP7 is never going to be an accurate weapon, so we leaned in to its strengths and went for attachments that improve mobility even more. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Best <em>XDefiant</em> Faction for the MP7</h2> <p data-characters="602" data-current-count="602" data-injectable="false">There might be better options, but Echelon is the most fun Faction to have while using the MP7. The Low Profile Passive Trait hides you on the mini-map even if you fire your weapon unsuppressed, which is perfect for MP7 flank routes. Additionally, the Digital Ghillie Suit makes you invisible while you attempt to get behind and closer to enemy lines. Players can also choose to equip the Intel Suit instead, if they want to temporarily reveal the location of enemies. And finally, the Sonar Goggles Ultra ability reveals every enemy on the map and gives you a pistol that annihilates the competition. </p>
