		<p>The immersive sim genre is one that’s full of quirky delights as you figure out new and inventive ways to twist the world to your will with the abilities at your disposal. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/skin-deep">Skin Deep</a>, though, is a game that’s more immersivey and simmy than most.</p>
<p>You see, this is the kind of game where sneaking through vents will raise a sneeze-meter until you loudly achoo and alert guards in the room below. It’s the kind of game where crashing through a glass window leads to shards of glass in your feet… because you have no shoes. Coming from Blendo Games, I’d honestly expect nothing less.</p>
<p><iframe title="SKIN DEEP | Coming to PC April 30" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4SvXMG8Ghaw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We played Skin Deep at New Game Plus last week –&nbsp;a new public show in the same spirit of WASD and Rezzed that’s part of London Game Fest –&nbsp;running through the tutorial and an opening level. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/301280/Skin_Deep/">There’s also a demo available on Steam</a>, if you want to try it from the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p>You’re Nina Pasadena, an insurance commando who’s kept in stasis aboard starships transporting valuable cargo across the galaxy, to wake up and protect the ship from any pirates and gangs that try to board and ransack the place. What happens from there is basically Die Hard in space, as you sneak through vents, make use of your environment and try to take down the invaders one-by-one.</p>


<p>The opening tutorial is a wonderful snapshot of the game’s particular style of action. It’s a sequence of short moments, each themed around a particular control or navigation quirk, before skipping forward in time to the next moment. It feels like a bundle of highlights from a film, but also gives you a good tour through what the game offers.</p>
<p>Skin Deep is unashamedly individualistic, shall we say. The crew of the ship is made up of cats (which have all been captured and locked up in boxes for you to rescue), enemies can have a Skull Keeper ability which, in the case of death, detaches their head and slowly moves them back toward respawn points, and one of the most useful items you can find is black pepper to give enemy goons a nasty sneezing fit.</p>
<p>At that point, you can leap onto their back, guiding them around the room to smash into things until you’ve knocked them out. Then pop off their head and flush them down the trash or squat toilet to remove the threat.</p>
<p>You find interactive elements and moments in the strangest of places, such as smashing the front of a washing machine, releasing all the soapy water over the floor, turning it into a slip-n-slide with the emphasis on slip.</p>

<p>If you get hurt, you can heal yourself from a menu, with some great animations to complement the action. Glass in your feet? You’ll be pulling those shards out from your sole in rather gory fashion. Died in the blast from an explosion? Well, luckily, you can have an auto-defibrillator equipped that will kickstart your heart and give you a second chance.</p>
<p>The wider game seems to drop you into a stage to tackle how you see fit, stringing together a bunch of rooms, populating with enemies to defeat, cats to rescue, and hazards and things to interact with. How you take things on will be up to you. Do you take it slow and steady, making use of the fundamentals of stealth? Or do you learn how to embrace the sheer chaotic potential of your surroundings, blasting pipes, venting rooms by shooting out windows (from both inside and outside), and making the floors slick with soap? There’s sure to be some outrageously slick speed runs in a couple of months.</p>
<p>The twist in the tale is that, as is revealed at the end of the tutorial stage, it’s revealed that it’s not the ship’s cargo that the invaders are after. Sure, they’ve been trying to extract from the cat crew details about your location, but instead of just trying to figure out where the danger to their mission is coming from, it’s because their mission is actually to try and find you. Weird, huh?</p>

<p>All of this is rendered in Blendo’s chunky style. OK, so it’s not quite as chunky as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/07/25/quadrilateral-cowboy-review/">Quadrilateral Cowboy</a>, but it’s still full of retro tech, bright colours and the general vibes that you might expect from an 80s action film.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to like about Skin Deep’s riff on the immersive sim, and I’m keen to see how it all comes together later this month on 30th April.</p>

			<p>In the span of a month and a half, we've gone from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-is-a-new-co-op-sci-fi-fps-from-reburn-formerly-4a-games-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of La Quimera (and the rebranding of 4A Games Ukraine to Reburn) to the confirmation of the release date, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/sci-fi-co-op-shooter-la-quimera-arrives-on-pc-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled</a> for April 25 on PC. However, select players will have the chance to try the new sci-fi first-person shooter game this weekend as part of a Closed Beta Test available via Steam.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we reached out to Reburn to discuss their debut project (which is also their first multiplayer game), the split with 4A Games, and more. Keep reading for the answers from Project Director Oleksandr Kostiuk, CEO Dmytro Lymar, and CTO (Chief Technical Officer) Iurii Sashchuk.</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera -  Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVCU_hdG3Iw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>How long has La Quimera been in development?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oleksandr Kostiuk:</strong> La Quimera has been in development since 2020, when we began pre-production with a small team. Around 2021, the project moved into full production, though the team was still growing at the time. Unfortunately, the full-scale invasion of Ukraine at the beginning of 2022 disrupted our plans and affected our timeline—like many others, we had to adapt to a new reality while keeping the project moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>The press release said you received funds for it. Can you disclose the source? Did you ever consider partnering with a publisher?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dmytro Lymar:</strong> The development of the game has been funded through profits from our previous projects, along with additional undisclosed minority investments. These funds were raised to support both the growth of the company and the development of the game. While we are completely open to potential partnerships with publishers - both now and in the future - the current state of the industry makes such collaborations more difficult than usual.</p>
<p><strong>Can you discuss the split of 4A Games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dmytro Lymar</strong>: The split of 4A Games happened back in 2014 when there was an initial invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation and the annexation of Crimea. However, we continued to work on the same project, Metro Exodus, as one team. After completing work on it in 2020, we started our own project, La Quimera, while the other part of 4A Games continued working on Metro and, around the same time, was acquired by Embracer Group. Additionally, due to the confusion of having two companies with the same name now working on different projects, we had to somehow resolve this, and we agreed that it would be better to keep the 4A Games trademark with Metro, so our studio got a new name - Reburn.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose Latin America as the central location for your sci-fi setting? Did you consult with local experts to ensure an appropriate portrayal of the culture?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oleksandr Kostiuk:</strong> Latin America fascinated us as a setting because of its incredible mix of cultures and rich historical layers. Combined with the near-future timeframe of La Quimera, it gave us almost limitless creative freedom to build a unique and compelling universe.</p>
<p>We’ve consulted with Latin American experts to get feedback and help analyze our work to ensure respectful and thoughtful representation. It’s also worth noting that the world of La Quimera is very much a vision of a cosmopolitan future—where the region's historical and cultural roots are blended with new technologies and global influences brought in by settlers from around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit more about the setting and the story's background?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oleksandr Kostiuk:</strong> While we’d prefer to keep some of the significant plot twists under wraps for now, we can share a bit about the setting and story. La Quimera takes place in the 2060s, in a future shaped by political instability that has completely redrawn national borders, effectively erasing global states.&nbsp; The world now resembles a kind of feudal fragmentation on a global scale, yet with 21st-century technology. In this dystopian, post-industrial world, private military companies and corporations that control key resources—such as energy and information—hold significant power and influence.</p>
<p>The game takes place in Nuevo Caracas, a newly-formed city-state where elements of the past mix with future trends. The game’s lore is so rich and detailed that it could fill dozens of pages. We’re incredibly grateful to our writers, Nick and Ed, for their work in bringing this world to life. We’re also planning to launch an online encyclopedia for the game’s world, allowing anyone who’s interested to dive deeper into the setting and learn more.</p>
<p><strong>You said that La Quimera is a story-driven game. I assume this means it won't be semi open-world like Metro Exodus, right? Is there any optional side content in La Quimera?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oleksandr Kostiuk:</strong> Yes, we are highly focused on delivering a tight, story-driven experience where the narrative acts as a guide for the player through the world of the game. As a result, we’ve chosen a more linear approach for the design of our locations. That said, players will still be able to discover secret areas and optional zones that aren’t required for the main storyline. The development of additional content for La Quimera is still in progress, and we’re carefully considering how best to expand on the experience while staying true to the core narrative.</p>

<p><strong>How long do you expect the game to take for the average player?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oleksandr Kostiuk:</strong> Given the challenges we faced during the development of La Quimera due to the war in Ukraine, we made the decision to focus on a more compact experience while still including the most essential elements of the game.</p>
<p>The main storyline for a solo player will take seasoned FPS fans around 5 hours to complete. If you are looking for some additional challenge with your friends playing cooperatively, this should extend your playtime by quite a few hours.</p>
<p><strong>This is your first co-op game, correct? Can you share the main challenges when making a multiplayer game? Also, how is it going to work in terms of hosting/joining, and will it be cross-play?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oleksandr Kostiuk:</strong> Probably the biggest challenge was creating a story-driven game that’s equally engaging whether played solo or with friends. We wanted to ensure the experience remains rich and immersive in both cases, even though there are some nuances that make the two approaches different.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to play both solo and with friends or random players. At the start of each level,<br>
you’ll have the option to choose how you want to play. As for matchmaking, it is a bit too early to say, as currently we release only on Steam, but we aim to make the multiplayer experience as accessible as possible across different platforms.</p>
<p><strong>How does the game scale to take into account co-op players when they join a session?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oleksandr Kostiuk:</strong> The game adjusts the intensity and density of encounters based on the number of players in the session. This includes the number of enemies that can be engaged in combat at once, their overall count, spawn rates, and damage output, all of which scale depending on how many players are present.</p>
<p>Additionally, we’ve developed a system where each player can choose their personal difficulty level in a co-op session. This difficulty will apply specifically to the player who selects it, but it will still be balanced with the difficulty levels of the other players to maintain a fair and enjoyable experience for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>What is your post-launch plan for La Quimera?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oleksandr Kostiuk:</strong> We have a lot of plans and ideas for expanding the storylines and gameplay elements within the world of La Quimera. Player feedback and impressions are also incredibly important to us as we move forward. At this stage, our post-launch plans are still in the works, but we would be excited to share them with the community as soon as they are ready.</p>
<p><strong>Are you still using the 4A Engine or something else? Will the game support NVIDIA DLSS 4 and AMD FSR 4? What about ray tracing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Iurii Sashchuk:</strong> For La Quimera, we’re using Unreal Engine 4, which allows us to create a multiplayer game more easily, having all the necessary tech and tools. However, our experience with the 4A Engine remains a vital foundation—shaping our approach to rendering, performance optimization, multi-threading, streaming, visibility determination, memory management, task scheduling, and content optimization.</p>
<p>Compared to Metro Exodus, we have introduced several key improvements. Notably, we overhauled texture streaming to allow for greater variety and better performance. Scene detail in La Quimera is significantly higher, which required us to develop a new visibility culling system. This lets us handle more objects in a scene without compromising performance. We also made enhancements to Unreal’s shadow mapping cache, enabling us to support more dynamic lights simultaneously. Overall, our goal has been to give artists and designers as much creative freedom as possible while maintaining strong technical performance.</p>
<p>We implemented a custom solution for global (indirect) lighting instead of real-time ray tracing.<br>
This gave us better performance, broader hardware compatibility, and more efficient data storage, while keeping a strong level of visuals. We use DLSS and FSR. They are interesting technologies with frequent improvements. But we have not implemented the latest versions yet, which we plan to implement in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about the recent release of the DirectX Raytracing 1.2 preview with neural rendering support? Do you believe it will take long for it to be applied in games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Iurii Sashchuk:</strong> We’re genuinely excited about the potential of DirectX Raytracing 1.2 and neural rendering. While La Quimera doesn’t currently use real-time ray tracing due to our priority towards achieving strong performance across a wide range of hardware, we do utilize raytracing during the asset creation process to enhance visual quality.</p>
<p>We absolutely see great potential in ray tracing and other neural network–based technologies. These are still relatively early in their development, but we believe they will continue to evolve and eventually become more widely adopted in production environments. As for how quickly this happens—it really depends on specific features, hardware adoption, and the complexity of implementation. We’re following these developments closely and definitely plan to integrate more of these technologies into our future work as they mature.</p>
<p><strong>Would La Quimera support PlayStation 5 Pro if the game makes it to consoles?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Iurii Sashchuk:</strong> We have not yet announced any plans for consoles, so it is difficult to tell anything specific. But we always try to squeeze as much as possible from any hardware, PlayStation 5 Pro should not be an exception.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

But the current <a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3E7e?object_uuid=05961934-c1ee-4ca7-b827-976157765e36&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Best Buy Deal of the Day</a> has me genuinely interested, and not just because I’m weak in the face of shiny foils and stitched-edge playmats. As with all DotD discounts, this is limited just to today as well, so pick up the cheap boosters while you can. Let's dig into what's available, and what I'd recommend picking up.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Discounts On Foundations, Aetherdrift, and More </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s talk <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-foundations-preorders-are-live-right-now-on-amazon">Foundations</a>. This set isn’t trying to wow anyone with lore about a haunted mansion or a squirrel-led uprising. Instead, it focuses on being playable, readable, and shockingly welcoming. I think that’s a big deal, especially since we’re about to get Marvel and Final Fantasy collaborations through Universes Beyond. New players are going to get dropped into the multiverse with zero context, so a solid on-ramp like Foundations is going to be essential.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering Foundations Bundle</h2><div catalogid="acace1da-a03b-4dfd-8975-e2ad8a5865b5" id="218544"><div id="218544" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wizards of The Coast - Magic: The Gathering Foundations Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve never touched a deck in your life, the Foundations Beginner Box is a better teacher than half the humans I’ve seen try to explain Magic at a kitchen table. Pre-constructed decks, visual aids, and a guided tutorial make it absurdly approachable. t. There’s also the Foundations Bundle, which is going for $42.49. That's under market price and loaded with boosters and accessories. It’s great value, especially since Foundations is going to stick around in Standard for five years, giving you time to figure out what the heck a stack is.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering Foundations Jumpstart Booster 2-Pack </h2></div><div catalogid="acace1da-a03b-4dfd-8975-e2ad8a5865b5" id="218545"><div id="218545" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wizards of The Coast - Magic: The Gathering Foundations Jumpstart Booster 2-Pack </h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there's Aetherdrift, which is for people who read the card <em>Blasphemous Act</em> and said, “but what if we did more?” The Aetherdrift Bundle is currently $34.99, which is a solid $16 off its usual price. It includes some of the more unhinged red spells and flashy threats to come out of Standard lately, including Marauding Mako (which is basically Magic's version of a landshark with anger issues) and Momentum Breaker, a mono-black tool that's found a home in aggressive Pixie decks. Yes, apparently that’s a thing now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering Ravnica Remastered Draft Booster Sleeve</h2></div><div catalogid="acace1da-a03b-4dfd-8975-e2ad8a5865b5" id="218546"><div id="218546" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wizards of The Coast - Magic: The Gathering Ravnica Remastered Draft Booster Sleeve</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Foundations also includes some pretty desirable chase cards if you're cracking packs. I’m looking at you, Rise of the Dark Realms with the new Borderless treatment, and Sire of Seven Deaths, the Eldrazi with seven keywords that feels like it was printed specifically to cause someone a rules headache. And don’t sleep on Banner of Kinship, which casually turns your Goblin deck into a math test your opponent definitely didn’t study for.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering Aetherdrift Bundle</h2></div><div catalogid="acace1da-a03b-4dfd-8975-e2ad8a5865b5" id="218547"><div id="218547" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wizards of The Coast - Magic: The Gathering Aetherdrift Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, I noticed Ravnica Remastered is part of this sale. You can grab a Ravnica Remastered Draft Booster Sleeve for $4.99 (down from $6.99), which is actually one of the cheapest ways to chase after format staples like Crypt Ghast, Spark Double, and Divine Visitation. I think that’s a great price for anyone looking to bulk open product or toss a few into a sealed night with friends.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering Aetherdrift Collector Booster</h2></div><div catalogid="acace1da-a03b-4dfd-8975-e2ad8a5865b5" id="218548"><div id="218548" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wizards of The Coast - Magic: The Gathering Aetherdrift Collector Booster</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally, I love Ravnica sets. I’ve always been a sucker for guild mechanics, and Ravnica Remastered is basically Wizards saying, “Let’s throw all the good stuff into one nostalgic blender.” You get a mix of old-school Commander hits like <strong>Cyclonic Rift</strong>, weird-but-powerful tech like <strong>Cloudstone Curio</strong>, and alternate art versions that will either delight you or make you question whether you’re playing Magic or flipping through concept art for a lost anime series</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering Aetherdrift Commander Deck - Living Energy</h2></div><div catalogid="acace1da-a03b-4dfd-8975-e2ad8a5865b5" id="218549"><div id="218549" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wizards of The Coast - Magic: The Gathering Aetherdrift Commander Deck - Living Energy</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up a few sleeves myself, partly for the shot at Anime Borderless Bruvac, and partly because I have no impulse control when it comes to reprint sets. You don’t need to justify $5 packs when they include Shock Lands and cards with infinite combo potential.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering Fallout Commander Deck - Science!</h2></div><div catalogid="acace1da-a03b-4dfd-8975-e2ad8a5865b5" id="218550"><div id="218550" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wizards of The Coast - Magic: The Gathering Fallout Commander Deck - Science!</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're already building for Commander or just pretending your collection isn’t entirely impulse buys, the Fallout Commander Deck – Science! is on sale for $33.99. That’s $26 off retail, and includes one of the better face Commanders to come from Universes Beyond: Dogmeat, Ever Loyal, who floods the board with Junk tokens if you build around equipment and auras. In my opinion, this deck is an underrated engine, and you get to play cards like Radstorm and Feral Ghoul, which sound like B-side punk albums but are surprisingly effective in-game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG: Ultra Pro Mana 8 Stitched Edge Playmats</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t usually care about playmats, but these Mana 8 stitched-edge ones are kinda gorgeous. At $16.49, they’re dramatic in all the right ways without costing you the same as a new commander deck. I think the Lotus one is low-key perfection.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Apr 11, 2025 10:23 am</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </p></div><div><p>The version 1.7 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Bury Your Tears With the Past,” will launch on April 23, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [190 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-957540"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Version 1.7 “Bury Your Tears with the Past” will deliver a riveting finale to Season 1’s story. The long-sought truth behind the Sacrifice crisis will finally come to light as Proxies delve into Vivian’s shadowed past and unravel the mysteries behind Hugo’s demise. Amidst the turmoil in New Eridu, a Void Hunter-rank special investigator—assigned by the Mayor—will join forces with Proxies to confront the encroaching darkness, while vibrant in-game events weave moments of joy and cheer into the thrilling and dangerous journey.</p><p>After Hugo’s fall into the Hollow, tensions between Mockingbird and TOPS continue to escalate, and deeper secrets await revelation in this chapter. Partnering with Vivian, Proxies will infiltrate enemy territory to search for the Sacrifice Core, unearth the mysterious past she shares with certain old acquaintances of hers, and expose the Exaltists’ conspiracy. With a formidable new ally, the Sacrifice crisis comes to a climax, finally unveiling the truth behind all the chaos.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_957541"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Mockingbird’s two S-Rank Agents bring elegance and precision to the battlefield. Vivian, an Ether Anomaly Agent, dances across the battlefield with a parasol and rapier, seamlessly shifting between grounded and aerial attacks. Her Basic Attack: Featherbloom amplifies Anomaly damage and synergizes with allies’ EX Special Attacks to boost the team’s Corruption damage. Hugo, an Ice Attack Agent, wields a suitcase that transforms into a sharp scythe, carving through enemies with slashes and devastating area sweeps. When hitting stunned enemies, Hugo can trigger the Totalize effect, elevating his damage based on the enemies’ remaining stun duration. Joining them is Robin, Mockingbird’s agile Bangboo companion, who pelts enemies with randomized cards that have various effects. Additionally, the Physical Anomaly Agent Jane and the Fire Stun Agent Lighter will rerun in this version’s banners.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Beyond the battlefield, Version 1.7 invites Proxies to unwind or embrace new challenges through in-game events. In “Say It With Flowers,” players step into the role of a flower shop manager, crafting gorgeous floral arrangements for different clients. By completing floral design commissions, Proxies will unlock a permanent interactive floral arrangement gameplay for Quality Time mode and receive exclusive rewards, including A-Rank Bangboo Overtimeboo. For thrill-seekers, the adrenaline-fueled Bangboo Bash returns with a ranked mode. Proxies can compete in obstacle and survival courses, earning points based on match placement and rank. Those who ascend the leaderboards can claim exclusive event titles, Polychromes, and other rewards.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,241 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> via <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009763" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,854 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/south-of-midnight-%E2%80%93-where-to-find-all-notes-%E2%80%93-chapter-3.1161642/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/south-of-midnight-where-to-find-all-notes-chapter-3/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Across <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight's</a> 14 chapters, you'll be able to find 103 notes to read that add a good chunk of context to the greater story being told.</p>
<p>The storytelling is arguably the best thing about South of Midnight, so you'll want to find and read all of these notes. Here's where to find all the notes in Chapter 3.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 3</h2>
<p>There are a total of 7 notes to find in Chapter 3, and the first one will come ahead of meeting your big fishy friend.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Happiest Day</strong> - You'll find this note right after learning the double-jump ability. It's once again a painted symbol note that appears just ahead of collecting the first Health Filament, so if you've reached the Health Filament and haven't collected it, turn back.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The St. Sylvain Bulletin</strong> - Right after your conversation with Rhubarb, turn back to look at his house. This note is on the very front, right next to the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Follow the Lights</strong> - Before leaving Rhubarb's house, go around the back of it to find a set of stairs leading down to a dock. At the back of the small building, there's a Floof knot and a note that's attached to a small post.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Ain't Wanted Here</strong> - After following the main path from Rhubarb's house, just past the first expanding bramble hazard you'll face, there's a two-story house you can walk into. Just beyond the door and on the right-hand side, you'll find this note next to a wooden owl.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Gift for Corrine</strong> - Once you've cleared the first stigma that reveals a memory, to your left will be a house that you'll notice has a staircase you can weave. Weaving that staircase and following it will lead you to a Floof knot, but not this note. Instead, go beyond the entrance to the house and follow the path to the right. At the end of the dock here you'll find a note and a piece of metal you can push for some extra Floof's.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Beggin' your pardon, Mayor</strong> - After collecting the last note, follow the main path, and at the end of your first wall-running section you'll enter into a two-story house. On the first floor, on a table to the left, you'll find this note to the Mayor.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Come One, Come All!</strong> - This last note for Chapter 3 is on the second floor of the same house you'll find the last note in, attached to a post and just ahead of another Floof knot.</p>
<p>That's where you'll find all 7 notes in Chapter 3 in South of Midnight. Only 89 more to go, if you've been following along these guides.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Streets of Rage Finally Hits Nintendo Switch Online, Plus Two More Genesis Games]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/streets-of-rage-nintendo-switch-online</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/streets-of-rage-finally-hits-nintendo-switch-online-plus-two-more-genesis-games.1161639/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/streets-of-rage-nintendo-switch-online<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has added three more Sega Genesis games to its Nintendo Switch Online library, and one of them is one of the most celebrated beat-'em-up games of its generation.</p>

<p>Having already brought the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-genesis-november-2024" rel="nofollow"><em>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron</em></a>, super-hard platformer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-online-june-2023-genesis" rel="nofollow"><em>Ghouls 'n Ghosts</em></a>, and side-scroller&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-gets-new-genesis-games" rel="nofollow">Altered Beast</a>&nbsp;</em>to the Switch Online Genesis lineup, the first game in today's haul is another bona fide classic.</p>

<p>That's right: none other than&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage&nbsp;</em>is making its Nintendo Switch Online debut. You might think you've already played this one on the service, but in fact, you've played the 1992 sequel&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage 2</em>, which was, until today, the only&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage&nbsp;</em>game on Switch Online.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-streets-of-rage-genesis.jpg?itok=TKceEK6N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-streets-of-rage-genesis.jpg?itok=sbCc2yz2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Streets of Rage&nbsp;</em>is finally available on Nintendo Switch Online.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it's not just about&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage</em>, so if you've never been of the side-scrolling beat-'em-up persuasion, don't worry; there are two more games that might tickle your fancy.</p>

<p>The first of these is&nbsp;<em>Super Thunder Blade</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Space Harrier</em>-slash-<em>Star Fox</em>-style shooter with some impressive (if somewhat hard to look at in the year of our lord 2025) visual effects.</p>

<p>Lastly, today's Genesis haul brings&nbsp;<em>ESWAT: City Under Siege&nbsp;</em>to Switch Online. It's a side-scroller, but it's a shooter with more in common with the likes of&nbsp;<em>Super Turrican&nbsp;</em>or the&nbsp;<em>Contra </em>series&nbsp;than with&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage</em>.</p>

<p>All three of these games are available right now with a Nintendo Switch Online membership, although you will have to pick up the Expansion Pack addon if you want to play them.</p>




<p>These Switch Online games come at a time when Nintendo is gearing up to release the Switch 2, the successor to the original Switch (if the name didn't already give that away).</p>

<p>The console is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">due to launch on June 5th</a>, although pre-orders in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow">US</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-canada" rel="nofollow">Canada</a> have been delayed due to the former's President Donald Trump imposing sweeping economic tariffs on various countries and economic bodies around the world.</p>

<p>With that being said, Trump subsequently issued a 90-day pause for those tariffs in all countries but China, so there's every possibility that we'll get a new pre-order date for the Switch 2 sometime soon. While we wait, you can check out these three new Genesis games on Switch Online right now if you've got the Expansion Pack.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It makes sense that other people want to capitalize on the success of Schedule 1. The indie title continues to eclipse all expectations and is one of the most successful games of 2025. Its creator has now commented on other games copying its title, and also given a hint toward a console port.</p>



<p>The days and weeks are going by, and Schedule 1 is showing no sign of slowing up. The player base is reveling in the chance to deal <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/whats-the-best-starter-weed-recipe-to-sell-in-schedule-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drugs</a> and show up thugs. An ongoing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-rival-drug-dealer-simulator-says-there-is-no-lawsuit-amid-review-bombing-investigation-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigation</a> can’t stop it, and with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-april-7-update-adds-pawn-shop-boutique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new updates adding a Pawn Shop</a> and more value-adding features, it’s hard not to love Schedule 1 right now.</p>



<p>Other companies feel this way as they’re using its name. Schedule 1’s developer has taken to X to address the ongoing movement, and also given hope to PlayStation and Xbox fans.</p>



<h2 id="h-schedule-1-developer-would-love-to-port-schedule-i-to-console">Schedule 1 Developer Would “Love to Port Schedule I to Console”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It might not be on a computer screen forever. Credit to TVGS</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Tyler_TVGS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tyler1</a> is the main developer at TVGS—the maker of Schedule 1. This is the company’s first game, and they probably didn’t expect this level of success.</p>



<p>On April 11, Tyler took to X to comment on a recent trend concerning the game: “Hi everyone, As you may be aware, there have been some games on the PlayStation store appearing over the past few weeks with the name ‘Schedule I’ in them. Just confirming these are not affiliated with me in any way.”</p>



<p>You get a lot of ‘smaller’ games appearing on the PS Store in the same fashion as Steam. It can be easy for games to slip through the cracks. But as Schedule 1 isn’t on PlayStation, it gives other games (with the name) a chance to be on there. Whether they get to keep the name remains to be seen. But Tyler1 also commented on Schedule 1’s platform status and plans.</p>



<p>“I’d love to port Schedule I to console when the game is at the right stage for that, but I will announce it to the Schedule I community well before it happens,” he says.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Hi everyone,

<p>Search volume for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1 console port</a> is high. The people want it, the people need it, and it’s clear TVGS wants to make it happen. We’ll keep on top of this to see if a Schedule 1 console port does eventually happen.</p>

			<p>The first version of the Dark Souls Remastered Seamless Co-op mod is now available for download, allowing PC players to enjoy the entirety of the game together with other players with little to no restrictions.</p>
<p>The mod, developed by Yui, the same developer behind the Seamless Co-op for <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-now-works-with-shadow-of-the-erdtree-adds-optional-invasions/">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-3-seamless-co-op-mod/">Dark Souls 3</a>, overhauls the multiplayer component of the vanilla game, allowing up to five players to enjoy the entirety of the game together, removing fog walls and barriers that limit the co-op multiplayer experience of the vanilla game and making game progression and world state sync for all players in a session. To make the experience more enjoyable, the mod also introduces some balance changes with enemy scaling extended to all enemies, unlike the vanilla game, which only has it for bosses, and some quality-of-life improvements, such as the ability to rejoin the session's host from anywhere in the game's world and light sources created by one player in the session becoming available for all players. You can download the mod from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksoulsremastered/mods/899?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> and see it in action in the video below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-announces-catan-sixth-edition-is-out-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A brand new edition of <em>Catan</em> is now available. The aptly named <em>Catan Sixth Edition</em>, is the first significant evolution of the iconic strategy game since 2015, bringing a streamlined and more accessible experience to players worldwide.</p>

<h2>The <em>Catan Sixth Edition</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Catan Studio announced the changes coming to <em>Catan Sixth Edition</em>. Generally, the core gameplay that made <em>Catan</em> a pop culture and tabletop gaming staple is still here. Gathering resources, trading among friends, getting into small arguments over wood and sheep, etc..</p>

It will feature brighter box art alongside updated components and packaging. it isn't as elaborate as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/catan-masterpiece-kickstarter-fully-funded-within-hour-promoting-bespoke-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Catan Masterpiece</a> Kickstarter, but it is a modest upgrade nonetheless.</p>

<p>These new components will be part of <em>Catan Sixth Edition's</em> more eco-friendly design. Box trays have been redesigned to be more environmentally conscious, and the box will contain fewer plastic pieces. The box also has expanded storage, allowing it to accommodate the 5-6 Player Extension Pack. This doesn't mean the base box can contain all expansions, but it is a start.</p>

<p>On that topic, <em>Catan Sixth Edition</em> will have several expansions. These include Seafarers, Cities &amp; Knights, and the aforementioned 5-6 Player Extension Pack.</p>

<p>Lastly, the game will feature more inclusive, user-friendly design elements. The game's artwork will portray more diverse character illustrations. The newly textured hex tiles and premium card trays will provide a more tactile play experience. Finally, the updated rulebook will contain streamlined rules alongside visual examples, helping more players understand the core experience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“For CATAN’s 6th edition, we aimed to enhance the player experience while preserving the game’s core mechanics," said Benjamin Teuber, managing director and game designer at CATAN GmbH. "With updated packaging, refreshed artwork, and a streamlined rulebook, we’re honoring our father’s legacy while making the game more approachable for new and longtime players alike."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Catan Sixth Edition</em> is available right now. The base game is being sold at an MSRP of $49.99. The Seafarers expansion is available at an MSRP of $49.99, and the Cities &amp; Knights expansion is available at an MSRP of $54.99.</p>

            <p>
Tequila Works, the indie developer behind Deadlight, Rime and Gylt, is selling off all of its assets in an open auction after declaring bankruptcy at the end of last year. 
</p>
<p>
The rights and trademarks to its games and several unfinished prototypes are now <a href="https://www.escrapalia.com/en/event/evento-de-subasta-activos-intangibles-de-tequila-works-s-l-202503311113069684">listed for sale on auction website Escrapalia</a>, with bids being taken for the next 32 days.
</p>
<p>
Rime and Gylt are currently both fetching the most interest, with around 150 bids for each and an asking price of €15.5k (£13.5k) for each. At the time of writing, Deadlight is going for €2600 (about £2250).
</p>
<p>
Intriguingly, this sale also reveals prototypes for other Tequila Works projects, sold as "vertical slices" the company likely made to pitch to publishers. 
</p>
<p>
The Ancient Mariner is described as an open-world narrative action adventure "focused on human emotions as the engine of gameplay". 
</p>
<p>
Dungeon Tour, meanwhile, would have been a "mid-core cooperative party game for up to four players" where you managed a horde of tourists through dungeons. Tequila Works says it was aiming for a visual and narrative style featuring "dark and absurd humour, in a conceptual mix between Overcooked and Dungeon Keeper".
</p>
<p>
Then there's Brawler Crawler, a multiplayer title focused on combat in "a chaotic urban universe where the player explores and struggles to master their own combat style". This would have featured procedurally-generated lanes with tough raids and bosses.
</p>
<p>
Back in November 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gylt-and-rime-studio-tequila-works-files-for-insolvency-says-prolonged-market-conditions-left-no-other-option">Tequila Works announced it was filing for insolvency</a> as "prolonged market conditions" had left it no other option. Founded in Madrid in 2009, the company's most recent game was Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story, which was released under the now-defunct Riot Forge publishing label.
</p>
<p>Announcing the company's shutdown, Tequila Works boss Térence Mosca said he was "proud of what [the team] has accomplished together".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The beta version of an impressive Devil May Cry 3 overhaul mod called Crimson will be released next month, introducing many features and improvements that wouldn't look amiss in an official remake.</p>
<p>The release date for the mod's beta, May 13th, was announced with a five-minute-long trailer that goes over the many improvements it will bring to the PC version of the third entry in the series, such as inertia for aerial combat, which will allow players to create intricate movement-based combos, Guardfly, a unique mechanic that allows Dante to fly all over the screen using some unique properties of the Royal Guard's Guard abilities while in the air like in Devil May Cry 4, increased jump cancel hitboxes for better jump canceling, increased enemy juggle time, revamped HUD, and a weapon wheel and on-the-fly style switching, similar to those introduced in the Nintendo Switch port of the game's Special Edition released a while back.</p>
<p><iframe title="Devil May Cry 3 Crimson - Beta Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cEVPo9wxjeg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-5-special-edition/">latest entry in the series</a> having been released a few years back, the Devil May Cry series got into the spotlight once again this month thanks to the release of the Netflix animated show, which has been confirmed to have been renewed for <a href="https://x.com/DevilMayCry/status/1910332636712608222" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a second season</a>. Unfortunately, with series long-time director Hideaki Itsuno having left CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/">last year </a><a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-creator-hideaki-itsuno-joins-tencents-lightspeed-to-work-on-aaa-action-games/">to join Tencent's LightSpeed</a>, the future of the franchise is uncertain, but hopefully, the success of the animated show will convince the publisher to continue the series even without Itsuno-san's involvement.</p>

<p>Balatro creator and developer LocalThunk has praised Blue Prince as one of the best games he’s ever played.</p>



<p>Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Thunk <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1910361969288225080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>, “Blue Prince is already one of the best games I’ve ever played and I still feel like I’m scratching the surface. Released today but lucky me I’ve been playing it all week (perks of the job)”</p>



<p>“Get a journal, a pen, and buy the game already,” he continued. </p>



<p>Blue Prince is developed by Dogubomb and see’s the player explore a mysterious manor with shifting rooms called Mt. Holly. </p>



<p>“In&nbsp;Blue Prince, you embark on a genre-defying experience, filled with a unique mix of mystery, strategy, and puzzles that weave together to create an unpredictable journey. Will your explorative steps lead you to the rumored Room 46?” the game description reads.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, reviews of the game went live and has amassed a 92/100 score via 31 critics, receiving “universal acclaim” status. For those who played the game, it’s already being hailed as a Game of The Year contender and at the very least, is in the running for winning Indie Game of The Year.</p>



<p>Blue Prince is available now on the PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, and available via PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass.</p>

            <p>Black Mirror may show us a variety of near-future dystopias, but at least those unfortunate to live through one of them can play Balatro.</p>
<p>The poker-themed roguelike Balatro became a smash hit on its release last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poker-themed-roguelike-balatro-deals-out-1m-sales-in-first-month">selling 1m copies in its first month</a>, and things have only gone from strength to strength for solo developer LocalThunk. Along with scooping up numerous awards, most recently including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">BAFTA for best debut game</a>, Balatro has now made an appearance on TV.</p>

<p>Yes, Balatro is in the new Black Mirror series, in the third episode of its seventh season. This episode is called Hotel Reverie, and its synopsis reads thus: "A high-tech remake of a classic film sends its A-list star into another dimension, where she must stick to the script if she ever wants to make it home."</p>
<p>Balatro is a pastime of the A-list star's agent. When the two are on the phone together early on in the episode, the card game can be seen on the agent's laptop.</p>
<p>This moment was spotted and shared on social media, with LocalThunk quickly responding. "So uh Balatro is now canonically in Black Mirror," the developer wrote. The show's creator Charlie Brooker then replied with a saluting emoji.</p>
<p>I wonder where Balatro may show up next? Hollywood, perhaps. </p>

            <p>
The director of A Minecraft Movie has reacted to the chaotic scenes seen in some cinemas as viewers interrupt screenings to stand up, scream and empty buckets of popcorn over other people.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">A Minecraft Movie is a breakout success that's performed far beyond initial expectations</a>, seemingly fuelled by its viral nature among younger viewers. In particular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">videos on social media have shown crowds reacting wildly to the film's now-notorious "Chicken Jockey" scene</a>.
</p>
<p>
But while the trend may be popular, it hasn't gone down well with all cinema goers. Viewers have been removed from showings for disruptive behaviour and <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/mat-su/2025/04/08/wasilla-police-eject-rowdy-teens-from-minecraft-movie-showing/">police have been called</a> as the trend has continued - escalating now to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/people-are-taking-live-chickens-into-screenings-of-the-minecraft-movie-now-as-chicken-jockey-meme-gets-out-of-hand">disturbing incident where someone brought a live chicken into a screening</a>.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps unusurprisingly, A Minecraft Movie director Jared Hess doesn't sound too bothered about it all. 
</p>
<p>
"It's way too funny," Hess told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/movies/chicken-jockey-minecraft-movie.html">New York Times</a>. "It's been a total blast. I'm just laughing my brains out every time someone sends me a new video.
</p>
<p>
"Just the fact that people are making memories at the movies  - that's what it's all about," Hess continued. "That's why we do it. I never could have anticipated this level of passion and fun and craziness that's happening."
</p>
<p>
Is it okay to dump your popcorn over other people? Hess seems to think so. 
</p>
<p>
"No one's going to get hurt from popcorn," he concluded. "Look, when I go to the movies with my kids, it’s like a popcorn massacre that happens and they're not throwing anything, but it ends up on the ground, regardless."
</p>
<p>
Just spare a thought for the minimum wage employee who has to come along a clear it up.
</p>
<p>
As you'd expect, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">the success of A Minecraft Movie has already sparked talk of a sequel</a>.
</p>
<p>"Lovely performances elevate a movie that captures Minecraft's many bits and pieces but not its creative spirit," Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">Eurogamer's A Minecraft Movie review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It’s been the week of the Switch 2 pre-order. I won’t bore you with the details, but getting mine felt like one of those levels in a game where annoying enemies keep swiping health off you, making you fall down a hole, and sending you back to the start. Still, I got one in the end, and now I can rest easy that I won’t be mournfully watching all my friends playing Mario Kart World on the 5th of June. When I wasn’t doing that, I was playing the excellent South of Midnight, which has to be one of the most beautiful games of 2025, more Yakuza: Like A Dragon and loads of retro stuff as well, including a blast on Sega Rally Championship and Mario Kart 64.</p>

<p>Aran has played and reviewed his first game of the year contender, Blue Prince. He says, “Every puzzle game fan should play it, because this game will be talked about for years. I’ve also started Promise Mascot Agency for review, and that has made me chuckle quite a few times. Review hopefully next week.” Blue Prince is on PlayStation Plus and Game Pass, so you really have no excuse not to play it!</p>
<p>Tuffcub has been Destiny 2ing as well as making a start on Steel Seed. His review of that will appear in two weeks!</p>
<p>Jim is making good progress in Assassin’s Creed Shadows and he says that some of those rougher gameplay edges have been worn down after unlocking various character upgrades. “Naoe has become a truly overpowered Shinobi who can clear enemy castles with ease – that’s probably thanks to me fiddling with some of the stealth difficulty options but it makes the game damn more enjoyable.”</p>


<p>Gamoc has kept things simple this week, playing Hogwarts Legacy and Balatro. Meanwhile, Steve has enjoyed some time revisiting The Simulation in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/10/the-talos-principle-reawakened-review-more-in-heaven-and-earth-than-your-philosophy/">Talos Principle Reawakened</a>, and he says that, “It joins The Blue Prince in possibly the best day of releases for puzzle fans in history. Also finished Atomfall with the self-destruct ending but will replay at some point to clear up stuff I didn’t do. Played some indie games for review so will get those up soon. Still persevering with Skywalker Saga but easing the pain of that by starting the beautiful South of Midnight. Combat is a bit one-note (although abilities are unlocking to help this) but the world is superb and I’ve always got time for a good linear game with a solid story and an identity of its own.”</p>
<p>Tef, meanwhile, has continued to give us a rundown of every game he played on Switch 2, which has only continued to cause jealousy and dissent amongst the team.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played? And did you get a Switch 2 pre-order?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marathon-players-on-pc-wont-need-a-playstation-account-say-bungie.1161573/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-players-on-pc-wont-need-a-playstation-account-say-bungie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>You won't need a PlayStation account to play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> on PC, promise Bungie as their shooter's marketing blitz picks up speed. Previous games under Sony's umbrella, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, caused frustration and backlash when PC players were forced to register for a PlayStation account just to play online. But it looks like Sony's recent backpedalling on this requirement will save the upcoming extraction shooter from pissing off PC folks. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Marathon will not require a PlayStation Account for players on PC and Xbox," said the developers in the game's <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1303855380845301861/1359676173122146395/1359709351086129326">official Discord</a> (as spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/556790/marathon-psn-account-xbox-pc-playstation-bungie">Polygon</a>). A plain and straightforward confirmation that they won't be doing any of that nonsense. Fans reacted with lots of fire emojis and some pink cats, a reference to the cyberdermal kitty that lies down with the corpse of a defeated runner in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungies-pink-cyborg-pussycat-teases-a-proper-marathon-trailer">most recent teaser trailer</a>. </p>
<p>That teaser was released to build hype for another trailer which Bungie plans to unveil tomorrow, and which should show some footage of the actual stuff you'll be doing in the game. I'm looking forward to knowing what the bullets sound like.</p>
<p>The PSN account fiasco began in earnest when the requirement was introduced to Helldivers 2 post-release. Players were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-has-received-100000-negative-reviews-since-announcing-players-must-link-steam-to-a-psn-account">deeply annoyed at the inconvenience</a>, and some pointed out that it meant the game would become unplayable in certain regions in which PlayStation accounts could not be set up. </p>
<p>PlayStation eventually relented and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">removed the requirement</a> for Helldivers 2 in the wake of angry review bombing but still tried to enforce it on other games, some of them entirely single player in nature, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered. In the end, the company seems to have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-finally-drop-the-psn-account-requirement-that-annoyed-every-pc-player">totally backed down from the idea</a>, making a PSN account optional for their upcoming games. And from Bungie's words it looks like this will also be the case for Marathon. Good to know.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>While <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> may have dominated any and all Nintendo news this month so far, we still have some Sega-related goodness for the here and now to break things up a bit.</p>
<p>Nintendo has today updated its Sega Genesis / Mega Drive catalogue for Switch Online members, and added three more classic games for us to enjoy. These games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Streets of Rage</li>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISTS/index.html">Snakists</a> is a game by Pippin Barr, author of many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/pippin-barr">small and wonderful ludic experiments</a>. The most pertinent of which, in this case, is <a href="https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISMS/">Snakisms</a>. That one takes the can-I-borrow-your-Nokia-for-a-minute-mate 'em up and explores a smattering of experimental design tunnels based on different schools of thoughts. 'Pessimism', for example, forces you to contend with a prized gobblin' dot placed permanently outside the confines of your snakely entrapment box, 'Asceticism' kills you as soon as you eat a dot, and so on.</p>
<p>Snakists takes this concept and applies it to concepts ending with 'ist'. Deist, purist, sadist, and so on, for a total of 20 different tail-wriggling tales. I enjoy them for how they both celebrate Snake and also employ its relative simplicity as a neutral palette on which to mix colourful synthesis of languages both human and game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For example, 'alarmist' is funny to play because it shouts at you whenever you get even mildly close to a wall. But it also stands as a sharply apt metaphor for the self-fulfilling prophecy that is constant anxiety. The closer you get to wall, the more the screen is obscured by the word 'CAREFUL!', until you can see so little you are all but guaranteed to die. The message is clear: get out of your own way. If you spend all your time worrying about tripping over, your legs will seize up and you will eat shit post haste.</p>
<p>Another favourite here is 'tourist', which is effectively just regular snake played over an image of a nice building. I appreciate its non judgemental attitude, leaving me to consider the implications of tourism on my own time, perhaps outside a nice cafe. Perhaps I'll scout around a bit and see where and what the locals are having, or perhaps I'll get really annoyed because this coastal Spanish town can't get my fried egg and chips the way I like it, as is the English way.</p>
<p>Much to think about. Many dots to consume.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>They're surprisingly detailed for something that's mainly there to get you to hoof around a bit. Plus fixed routines are just good world building for a weed selling <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> such as this. They raise pertinent questions. Does the forbidden spinach blur the ache of sharp routine like existential Alka Seltzer? Or does it encourage such contemplation as to appreciate the hidden rapture in the familiar?</p>

<p>Might we imagine Kyle pressing a soft taco shell against his cheek and feeling, for all the world, like he is being caressed by the glove of creation? His is one of the less varied routines, moving mainly between work and home save a half hour break the skatepark. Still, there's nobility in it, I think. Perhaps we've been misled. Perhaps this was the titular Schedule all this time.</p>
<p>Less industrious is Kyle's roommate, Austin, who splits his time between the community centre and the arcade. At 6:00pm each day, he leaves the arcade and furiously drinks for 45 minutes before returning. I get it, man. It's acutely embarrassing to boast to a stranger that you can "beat Time Crisis in one life" only to repeatedly get your bottom mailed to you by a cabinet tuned far harder than the PS1 version. I'd drink too. Heck, I'm drinking now just thinking about it, and also because it makes my breakfast taste better.</p>
<p>Most varied is fan fave product hound Jessi, who visits four separate locations to sit and smoke and consume canned beverages. Like all the NPCs, she walks in real time between destinations. I've been fascinated by this stuff since Oblivion blew my tiny mind when I spotted an NPC's marker move across the map to the destination I was told to meet him at. I can't say it still feels quite as magical as it did then, but it's still retained some wonder for me. Another reminder that there's more going on under the hood in Schedule I than its sudden explosion of memey popularity might suggests. And an extra reminder, for myself more than anything, that sometimes a lot of people like a thing because it's actually good, you shrivelling hipster.</p>
<p>I mean, rarely, but still.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Mafia: The Old Country - the next game in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a>'s Mafia series - will seemingly be arriving as soon as August.</p>
<p>Publisher 2K appears to have accidentally revealed the release date for Mafia: The Old Country via a post on Steam: 8th August 2025.</p>

<p>While the post itself no longer has that all-important date attached, many were able to grab a screenshot of the original with those release details included. "Mafia: The Old Country will be available on August 8, 2025. Pre-orders are available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via Steam," read the text.</p>
<p>This date was likely meant to be saved for Mafia: The Old Country's newly-announced PAX East developer panel, which is scheduled for 8th May at 7pm UK time.</p>
<p>"Watch as Hangar 13 developers debut a new gameplay trailer and offer a rare behind-the-scenes look at the past, present, and future of this storied franchise," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1941540/view/592894082264596999?l=latam">panel's announcement post</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">Mafia: The Old Country was first revealed</a> at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> last year. While the developer has kept many details about the upcoming title under wraps since, it has confirmed the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-developer-promises-sicilian-voice-acting-and-italian-subtitles">will include Sicilian voice acting and Italian subtitles on its release</a>.</p>
<p>"Authenticity is at the heart of the Mafia franchise," the team wrote in August. "Mafia: The Old Country will offer voice acting in Sicilian, inline with the game's setting in 1900s Sicily. Additionally, Italian language localisation will be available for both in-game UI and via subtitles."</p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country will be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Publisher 2K and developer Hangar 13 previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-early-ad-shows-gorgeous-visuals-summer-2025-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that Mafia: The Old Country would launch this Summer. Now, though, we have a semi-official release date: August 8.</p>
<p>The info briefly appeared in a Steam post that announced a developer panel due to take place at PAX East. On May 8 at 7 PM BST (2 PM ET), Hangar 13 developers will debut a new gameplay trailer and provide a behind-the-scenes look at the past, present, and future of the franchise. During the panel, the studio will provide an in-depth look back at the last 23 years of Mafia, insight into how Hangar 13 brought the brutal underworld of 1900s Sicily to life in Unreal Engine 5 for Mafia: The Old Country, a Q&amp;A session and more development insights. Studio President Nick Baynes, Game Director Alex Cox, and Cinematics Director Tomas Hrebicek will be there to attend and reply to several questions, including some taken from the community.&nbsp; Any mention of the launch date was quickly amended, but nothing escapes fans these days.</p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-revealed-for-release-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom 2024, slightly less than a year before its planned release date. As hinted by the title, it will be set in Sicily. The goal is to dive into the criminal organization's origins, dating back to the early 1900s. Players will step into the role of Enzo Favara, who survived a childhood of forced labor and is now all too eager to prove himself to Cosa Nostra and, specifically, Don Torrisi's family.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-linear-narrative-driven-game-powered-by-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> by Hangar 13, the game will be a linear, narrative-driven action/adventure grounded in authentic realism. Combat will include melee fights with blades and ranged engagements with firearms. In certain segments, Enzo will use horses and even early motorcars. Mafia: The Old Country is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and certainly looks the part, although we don't have any info on the system requirements yet.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/sifu-xbox-steam-launch-march-2023-arenas-mode/">Sifu</a> developer Sloclap has announced that its new soccer game, Rematch, will launch on <strong>July 19, 2025</strong>, on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass when it launches.</p>
<p>Rematch was first shown during <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-winners-at-the-game-awards-2024-astro-bot-game-of-the-year/">The Game Awards 2024</a>, and it definitely wasn't what players would have expected to be Sloclap's next game after Sifu. Sloclap has brought its brand of close-up action to the beautiful game, and the trailer that Sloclap showed off today during the Triple-I Initiative Showcase further shows how this will probably be unlike any other soccer game currently on the market.</p>
<p>Rematch features 4v4 and 5v5 matches for players to showcase their soccer skills. If you're especially keen to give Rematch a try, Sloclap also announced today that there will be an open beta test for the game in a little more than a week from the time of writing. The beta test will run from April 18-19 and will be available to PC players on Steam.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rematch - Release Date Trailer | The Triple-i Initiative" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RsItvQSNjLI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You can sign up for the beta test by visiting the game's <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/">official website here</a>. If you're already sure you'll be buying Rematch, you can also pre-order one of the game's three editions, ranging from $29.99 USD for just the base game to $49.99 for the 'Elite Edition.' Buying either of the two top-end editions of Rematch grants you 72 hours of early access to Rematch, battle pass rewards, and a few in-game cosmetics to show off in multiplayer matches.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-3-release-date-xbox-games-showcase/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/will-we-finally-get-a-state-of-decay-3-release-date-at-the-xbox-games-showcase.1161504/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-3-release-date-xbox-games-showcase/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was announced just yesterday the the next Xbox Games Showcase is set for June 8, and there’s one game that I’m keeping an eager eye open for. I’ve been waiting to hear something about the State of Decay 3 release date for the longest time, and this could finally be when we find out what’s going on.</p>



<p>Presently, the game doesn’t even have a <strong>release year</strong>. The running rumour is that State of Decay 3 will be released in 2026, but Undead Labs and Xbox Game Studios haven’t confirmed a thing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-take-me-to-the-apocalypse">Take Me To The Apocalypse</h2>



<p>State of Decay 3 is long overdue, in my book. I’m a huge fan of the franchise and adore the sandbox elements of picking a home and building it up while fighting with a band of permadeath survivors to outlive a zombie apocalypse. It’s everything I want in an end-of-the-world, undead epic.</p>



<p>In September 2024, Undead Labs revealed it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-2-end-support-undead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ending support on State of Decay 2</a> to focus entirely on the sequel, which means the team will have had almost a year to get the game in shape by the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2025.</p>



<p><strong>Last year</strong>, the Xbox Games Showcase played host to a phenomenal new State of Decay 3 trailer, which I and many other fans lapped up.</p>



<p>We don’t know much at all about State of Decay 3, bar the fact that it’s coming. The new trailer that was released almost a year ago revealed a few tidbits, but it’s nothing that we didn’t already expect from the game, such as fearsome undead enemies, vehicular combat, and multiplayer mechanics.</p>



<p>I’d do malicious things to get my hands on the State of Decay 3 release date – hopefully, something is shown at the upcoming Xbox Games Showcase. It has been almost seven years since the last State of Decay game was released.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to a new State of Decay game? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
