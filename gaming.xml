            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/zenless-zone-zero-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Playing with nostalgia-laden imagery from the early 2000s, Zenless Zone Zero sees developer HoYoverse pivot gracefully from the fantastical settings of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/genshin-impact-review">Genshin Impact</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/honkai-star-rail-review">Honkai: Star Rail</a> into an enticing urban dystopia. It’s a universe where you’ll duke it out in glitzy real-time fights as a trio of streetwear-clad agents, solving simple puzzles as their handler between battles to help them navigate a labyrinth of encounters – and that’s before you get to the carousel of social side activities layered on top. A mouthful of tasteful influences combine into something effortlessly stylish but also a bit inconsistent, occasionally undone by a lack of depth. Yet Zenless Zone Zero got its hooks into me regardless; its relentless charm compelled me to keep fighting, one combat puzzle or bowl of ramen at a time.</p><p>Zenless Zone Zero takes place in a world where monster-filled pocket dimensions called Hollows have devastated civilisation. While much of humanity has been wiped out, the cyberpunk bastion of New Eridu survives through a fraught codependence with the Hollows and the valuable resources found within. You play as either Belle or Wise, a brother-sister hacker duo with a knack for navigating this dangerous territory, tackling commissions from a roster of lovable rogues searching for their next big score. It’s a unique and gritty setup that, while convoluted at times, kept me engaged by testing my strategic intuition across a smorgasbord of challenges I became hungry to best. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Your brawling excursions embark from the retro tech-strewn backroom of the siblings’ video rental store, where you’ll pick from an impressive roster of unlockable agents to make up a three-person party and then dive into the perilous Hollows, trading success for XP and upgrade resources. The review build provided by HoYoverse ahead of launch gave me access to all of the currently available agents, and I soon found an affinity for the ones from a faction called Victoria Housekeeping, thanks to their charming British inflexions and battle maid outfits. My personal favourite of the bunch, the shark-tailed Ellen Joe, swipes and slashes with an icy blade, stacking elemental debuffs on enemies and dropping blase quips in the process. While the makeup of your dream team will largely be in the hands of the Gacha Gods, as characters are unlocked through the genre’s usual method of randomized pulls, it’s handy that story missions allow you to try out the cast without the need to pull them first. </p><p>Despite how intense it can seem in motion, Zenless Zone Zero’s combat is forgiving and approachable. You have a basic attack and a dodge for timely escapes from signposted attacks, as well as the ability to swap to other agents to avoid scrapes, parry, or compound their combos. Building an enemy’s daze meter leads to a persistently satisfying chain attack, a slo-mo quick-time event where your colleague swoops in to lay the smackdown. Basic and ultimate abilities round out each character’s combat options, though like any good action game, there’s plenty of variety available through the combination of timely button presses and latent passives.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Districts are full of details that make them a joy to explore.</p></div><p>Challenging boss encounters surfaced to test my reflexes, though I rarely felt overwhelmed as long as I could connect the dots of my combat strategy and juggle incoming attack patterns to keep different enemy types at bay. Intricate build-tinkering systems, difficulty options, and endgame content help raise the skill ceiling for challenge-hungry players, but Zenless Zone Zero seems content to stay out of your way if you just want to simply pick it up and do some flashy moves. Elegant animations footnote most of your attacks, down to the way domestic demon Van Lycaon gracefully lowers his metal heels after a kick. Ultimately, the focus is on indulging the fantasy of fighting with one of Zenless Zone Zero’s wonderfully designed and passionately voice-acted characters rather than rivaling the likes of Devil May Cry with its combat nuance – a tradeoff I’m comfortable with, even if it means less mechanical depth. </p><p>Unfortunately, the dazzling combat is undermined by an overabundance of hacker puzzles meant to signify the link between your team of agents and the proxy guiding them through the Hollow from back home. You’ll be kicked into a labyrinth of chunky CRT monitors between pockets of combat, pushing a little avatar around to trigger mechanisms that lead to your next checkpoint or encounter. The fuzzy aesthetics of this mode are delightful to look at, but the process feels arbitrary and murders the momentum. After marching through walls of screens, I started seeking out the next encounter as fast as possible to boost my morale and return to the frenetic action sequences that actually make Zenless Zone Zero compelling.  </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Zenless Zone Zero Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>That hefty loop of taking on commissions and then venturing into the Hollow to complete them could easily be all there is and it wouldn’t feel scant, yet surprisingly, it only accounts for half of what’s here. The other half is a life simulator where you’ll roam cosy suburbs, manage your heroes’ Blockbuster-esque business, and maintain relationships with locals through dialogue-driven side stories across an atmospheric day-to-night cycle. While not strictly an open world, Zenless Zone Zero’s stunning districts are thoughtfully dressed with environmental details that make it a joy to explore. From rusty riverside kiddy rides to messy bedrooms and vandalised backstreets, there’s attention paid everywhere you look that helps centre you in this fashion-forward science fiction world. </p><p>Once the initial excitement of exploring Hollows started to settle, I became drawn to all the extracurricular activities I had at my fingertips. Stocking my video store turned into the nexus of my daily routines, as each morning, I’d start by pairing eclectic videotapes from my collection with the genre demands of the public. After that, I’d need to venture outside in search of better merchandise, completing tasks for locals like solving quirky riddles or taking editorial pictures in order to earn my VHS reward. That symbiotic process worked well to funnel my attention toward the different social activities, not to mention the money provided by running my business certainly helped fund my story mission exploits.</p><p>This side of Zenless Zone Zero isn’t quite as focused as something like the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review">Persona</a> series it’s so clearly inspired by, so there are some dull spots, but it offers an engaging workload for players to log in and tackle on a daily basis nonetheless. All of your activities are tied together well via a helpful submenu called the Inter-Knot, which let me find my rhythm amid all of the options I was handed. This in-game, everything app quickly became my best friend, taking on the role of job finder, social media platform, and, most importantly, scheduling tool, ensuring I wasn’t completely paralysed by the overwhelming prospect of what to do next. </p><p>I enjoyed shirking my pressing responsibilities by chasing high scores at the Godfinger Arcade, whose moreish snake and spelunking minigames stole an embarrassing amount of my time. But the funny and sometimes profound substories left the biggest mark, reminding me of the human stakes in this world. One side quest involves a homeless robot whose ghostly silhouette scares a local citizen, leading to a surprisingly moving crossed-wires situation. Easily forgotten in a sea of adorable shopkeepers and in-game currencies, the underlying frailty of Zenless Zone Zero’s post-apocalypse is always in frame. Overarching themes of displacement and corruption come through in the cinematic story and the design of its city wards, which range from dilapidated to gentrified.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Sarah's favourite fashion forward games</h3></p></div><p>Given the unusually generous nature of HoYoverse’s review build, it was difficult to get a clear picture of how Zenless Zone Zero’s progression systems will feel long-term, but nothing I've seen looks wildly out of line with the developer’s other gacha games. Still, it’ll be illuminating to start again on a new account at launch and get accustomed to the grind in a more organic live service setting (and we’ll be sure to update this review if things are unexpectedly out of line). Regardless, I forged a strong attachment to this rich world and its cosplay-friendly characters by the end of a main story that easily takes dozens of hours to complete, and left feeling that this ambitious pivot certainly lives up to the high standards set by Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>By leaning into early 2000s nostalgia and then blending it with a stylish vision for the future, Zenless Zone Zero crafts an inimitable world that is easy to get invested in. Exploring New Eridu and getting to know this charming cast both in and out of combat was a thrilling ride I was keen to keep at for hours on end. It’s not necessarily as deep as many of its gameplay inspirations, and momentum-killing hacking puzzles can sometimes sour the mood slightly – but with exhilarating, approachable combat and so many extracurricular activities to take care of, it was always easy to turn a corner and get swept back up in the captivating culture of Zenless Zone Zero.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Japan gets Shin Onigashima, Gomoku Narabe Renju, and Mahjong.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><em>COBRA TRIANGLE</em>, <em>Donkey Kong Jr. Math</em>, <em>Golf</em>, <em>Mach Rider</em>, <em>The Mystery of Atlantis</em>, <em>SOLAR JETMAN</em>, and <em>Urban Champion</em>&nbsp;are now available as part of the&nbsp;<em><a title="Platforms > Nintendo [20,410 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> Entertainment System – <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,597 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Nintendo Switch</a> Online</em> lineup, Nintendo announced.</p><p>In Japan, this month’s update includes <em>Donkey Kong Jr. Math</em>, <em>Famicom Mukashibanashi: Shin Onigashima</em>, <em>Golf</em>, <em>Gomoku Narabe Renju</em>, <em>Mach Rider</em>, <em>Mahjong</em>, and <em>Urban Champion</em>.</p><p>Here is an overview of each game available in the west, via Nintendo:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong><em>COBRA TRIANGLE</em></strong> – Heard of the Bermuda Triangle? Well, that’s a resort cruise compared to what awaits you in the <em>COBRA TRIANGLE</em>. Put your skill and reflexes to the test at the helm of a Cobra Class Speed Boat in this 1989 vehicle-based <a title="Genres > Action [1,989 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> for the original Nintendo Entertainment System. In this part boat <a title="Genres > Racing [188 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> game, part vehicular combat game, you’ll take on high-speed challenges including cannon-equipped enemy craft, imperiled swimmers, deadly sea monsters, dangerous whirlpools and ticking bombs. Play through 25 stages of aquatic mayhem, where you’ll need to collect Power-Up Items scattered throughout levels to upgrade your speed and firepower if you hope to get out of the Triangle in one piece!</li><li><strong><em>Donkey Kong Jr. Math</em></strong> – First question: Donkey Kong + Donkey Kong Jr. ÷ Math Homework = ? The answer: Numerical fun. Originally released in 1986, <em>Donkey Kong Jr. Math</em> takes the vine-swinging gameplay of the original Donkey Kong Jr. game and adds an extra element of mathematical challenge. Play as Donkey Kong Jr. and rescue Donkey Kong, who’s been imprisoned by Mario. Navigate across vines and platforms to solve math-based puzzles, which requires you to do everything from collecting numbers to grabbing appropriate symbols that add, subtract, multiply and divide them as needed to solve each problem. Along the way, you’ll gather fruit and keys, and make sure you avoid the pesky birds, nasty electric sparks and creepy chompers! Sorry, did we not mention there’d be a test?</li><li><strong><em>Golf</em></strong> – Hit the links and revisit one of the original Nintendo Entertainment System <a title="Genres > Sports [553 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/sports">sports games</a>. This 1990 classic brings you 36 holes of realistic golf action, with hazards that change every time you play (so you’ll need to plan a strategy apart from just “swing away”). Check wind direction, select the right club and adjust your swing as you make your drive. A scorecard keeps track of your strokes for each hole as you face twisting fairways and hungry sand traps. Tee time is right now, so grab your clubs!</li><li><strong><em>Mach Rider</em></strong> – Set either 88 years in the future (from today) or 127 years in the future (from the game’s original release date in 1985), <em>Mach Rider</em> is a vehicular combat racing game where players navigate their heavily-armed Quadrunner across the ruined wastes of Earth in the year 2112. Engage in the Fighting Course and blast your way across 10 different sectors, avoiding obstacles and taking down enemies. Or try your hand at the Endurance Course, where you try to complete sectors in a set time limit, with oil drums and opponents determined to slow you down. You can also tackle the time trial in the Solo Course mode where it’s just you against the clock. Remember, you are Earth’s only hope — you are Mach Rider.</li><li><strong><em>The Mystery of Atlantis</em></strong> – Known as <em>Atlantis no Nazo</em> in Japan, <em>The Mystery of Atlantis</em> is a <a title="Genres > Side-Scrolling [705 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/side-scrolling">side-scrolling</a> <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,601 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> where players take on the role of Wyn, an amateur explorer intent on unlocking the secrets of a lost civilization and rescuing his captive master from the forces of the evil Emperor Zavyra. Using sticks of dynamite, Wyn will attempt to survive a myriad of exotic locations such as caves, temples and even clouds. Atlantis is comprised of 100 zones, each one connected by warp doors—but choose wisely! Your success in the island’s maze will depend on which doors you go through and the path you take.</li><li><strong><em>SOLAR JETMAN</em></strong> – You are Jetman on a dangerous quest to collect the lost pieces of the Golden Warpship, a near-mythical vessel capable of interstellar travel. This early-’90s multidirectional <a title="Genres > Shooter [3,813 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> puts you in the cockpit of Jetman’s Jetpod, as you explore 12 menacing alien worlds, each with its own level of gravity! Collect alien goods along the way to earn points you can trade for equipment from the Interstellar Marketing Co. Trading Post. Once you discover a piece of the Warpship, you’ll have to tow it back to your Mothership, fighting against the added drag that impacts your maneuverability (and burns away your fuel—keep an eye on those gauges!). Recovering the pieces will be no easy task, and Solar Jetman is the only hope!</li><li><strong><em>Urban Champion</em></strong> – On these streets, there is only one rule: Punch or be punched. Nintendo’s first 2D fighting game from 1986, <em>Urban Champion</em> is a bare-knuckle throwdown between fighters looking to earn the rank of Champion—and send their opponent plummeting down the nearest manhole in the process. If successful, they will earn confetti showers from local residents and, eventually, enough victory symbols to proclaim themselves the undisputed champ. But watch out for angry neighbors who will attempt to drop flowerpots on your head, and the police will make occasional appearances to temporarily break up the fight, or to make an arrest if the fight clock runs out. Spar against a computer opponent or a friend and prove your worth in becoming the Urban Champion!</li></ul></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/copa-america-ea-sports-fc-pes-tv-broadcast-angle<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Copa America--South America's continental football championship, held every few years--is on right now, and because it's a weird tournament (<a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/story/_/id/37615113/conmebol-bizarre-decision-press-full-copa-america" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I don't have time to get into it</a>), the 2024 edition is actually being held in the United States of America. Which has, of course, led to even more weirdness.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/30/expensive-tickets-empty-seats-and-brutal-heat-copa-americas-fan-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It's been an organisational disaster</a> for fans, of course, that much was to be expected. But players have also been complaining about the pitches, <a href="http://stadiumdb.com/news/2024/07/copa_america_2024_empty_seats_narrow_pitches_high_prices_and_heat_failed_test_ahead_of_world_cup#:~:text=Too%20small%20pitches%20%2D%20problems%20for,forcing%20players%20to%20adapt%20quickly." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying they've been of poor quality and too small</a>. Even people watching the tournament at home have found stuff to hate, chief among them some very bizarre camera angles.</p><figure><figcaption>USA vs Uruguay as the broadcast appeared during the first half</figcaption></figure><p>The big USA v Uruguay match a few days ago featured--for the first half at least--a distant view <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5610192/2024/07/01/usmnt-camera-angle-fox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that had folks at home saying it looked like the game was being played in a "stadium for ants"</a>. This is not how football matches are normally televised, and people were upset! Normally the view is much closer to the pitch, where you can actually see who is who. Like this:</p><figure><figcaption>It doesn't matter which league or which country, nearly every football broadcast camera angle looks like this</figcaption></figure><p>It wasn't the first time a Copa America broadcast had featured the angle, taken from cameras mounted high in the stands in a stadium usually used for NFL games. Viewers hated it so much that during halftime the cameras were moved back to a more traditional perspective, so the second half looked like this:</p><figure><figcaption>USA vs Uruguay as the broadcast appeared during the first half</figcaption></figure><p>While headlines in the sporting world in the wake of this debacle have all focused on how many people hated the view, I would like to say that I loved it. And I loved it because that's exactly how I play <em>FIFA/EA Sports FC</em>. </p><p>That game's default camera angle is pretty close to traditional broadcast stuff--not a surprise given <em>EAFC </em>is more concerned with mimicking how football games look on TV than with how they feel to play--but what the game allows that TV broadcasts don't is the ability to change that view.</p><p>And I normally change it to something pretty similar to that Copa America "ant" setting! Here's the view I normally play using:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 24 &quot;Tactical&quot; Camera Settings 15 height 0 zoom (really non meta?)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hlb7GKqjs0Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It might be a "stadium for ants", but I love it. Sure, you can't always make out who is who, but that's less important to me than being able to actually see what's happening. Football is a fast, fluid sport that at any moment can shift the action 50 yards away, or see a passing move involve eight players all running around open spaces. The higher the camera is, the easier it is to see that action develop and then take place.</p><p>I thought the Copa America broadcasts were just thinking the same thing! After all, it wouldn't be the first time televised world football was influenced by video games; a few years back many penalties (which used to be shown from the regular match perspective) started being shown like this, an almost exact copy of the penalty view seen in both <em>EAFC </em>and <em>PES</em>:</p><figure><figcaption>How Messi takes a penalty in EA Sports FC</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>How Messi takes a penalty in a World Cup final</figcaption></figure><p>While the EAFC penalty view has been a huge success, I guess folks aren't ready for the ant view just yet. I hope broadcasters keep trying it out though, because I think the more you can see of what's happening on the field, the better!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review.918738/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>I’ve spent every evening the past week reuniting with a dear old friend. Super Monkey Ball and I were inseparable back in the GameCube days, but we grew apart when the series traded in its perfect blend of devilish challenges and finely-tuned physics for bland level design and imprecise motion controls aimed at a more casual audience – so you can imagine my apathy when Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble’s initial announcement focused so heavily on the uncontrolled chaos of its 16-player online battles. But I’ve never been happier to be wrong, as tucked away inside Banana Rumble is the greatest set of traditional Super Monkey Ball levels the series has seen since the GameCube originals, backed up by tight mechanics that give me the complete control I needed to overcome its demanding late-game obstacles. Monkey Ball is finally back, and now all I want to do is roll.</p><p>Banana Rumble’s impressive set of 200 courses is divided into 20 cartoony worlds containing 10 stages apiece. In classic Monkey Ball fashion, the setup is delightfully simple: You have 60 seconds to roll your monkey from the start to the goal, but the hurdles between those points change radically across the adventure. The opening stages aren’t too challenging, smartly acquainting you with Banana Rumble’s mechanics so you’re ready to go when it does turn up the heat. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>As a certified <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/08/24/super-monkey-ball-2-gamecube-review">Super Monkey Ball 2</a> master, I had no trouble with the first 80 levels or so. But they’re still a joy to roll through, as I had to deal with curves, ramps, rails, switches, and bumps reminiscent of the level design seen in the excellent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/11/16/super-monkey-ball-3">Super Monkey Ball 1</a> and 2. Plus, speedrunning is a classic element of the originals, and it was a ton of fun to see how rapidly I could blast through levels that don’t demand too much precision, like stages where you can slam dunk into the goal with a perfect launch right from the start if you know what you’re doing. I realized pretty quickly that Banana Rumble was a return to form for the series, and I had the best time rolling through the early levels while bopping to the wonderful GameCube-inspired soundtrack.</p><p>That breezy feeling didn’t last long, though, as Banana Rumble does not hold back in its second half. The 10 EX worlds unlocked after completing the main story delivered on all the Monkey Ball challenge I’ve been begging for the series to bring back. Suddenly, I was dealing with grueling stages that truly tested my monkey mettle, from crazy rotating contraptions to invisible tilting seesaws to the narrowest of walkways you have to carefully tiptoe across, Banana Rumble is constantly introducing new challenges and smart twists on old ones. Some of the final levels took me dozens of attempts, and there’s nothing quite like the feeling when my main monkey AiAi finally breaks through that one elusive goal. In fact, I’ve been so engrossed in completing every stage Banana Rumble has to offer that one night I couldn’t even be bothered to get up to turn the lights on after it got dark outside, so I was sitting in complete darkness rolling my monkey around until well past midnight. Totally worth it.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Logan Ranks Every Super Monkey Ball</h3><p>Super Monkey Ball: Banana Rumble is the first brand new Monkey Ball game in over a decade, and the series' first chance to be truly good since over two decades ago. </p></div><h2><strong>Chaos, Controlled</strong></h2><p>That fantastic stage design and variety means nothing unless it <em>feels </em>right, and Super Monkey Ball nails it for the first time in decades. While it may look like you are directly moving your orb through each course, Super Monkey Ball is actually about controlling the stage, not the monkey. At its best, the control stick is aligned 1:1 with the angle of the stage, giving you pinpoint-precise command over how the terrain tilts – and in turn, how your monkey rolls through it. </p><p>2021’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-mania-review">Banana Mania</a> (which remade all the levels found in Super Monkey Ball 1, 2, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/03/09/super-monkey-ball-deluxe">Deluxe</a>) should have been a home run as it returned to the best stages in series history, but the controls were so sluggish and imprecise that it made them overly frustrating at best and borderline unplayable at worst. Exact controls are a necessity for the toughest levels, and Banana Rumble handles so well that whenever I fell off the stage it almost always felt like my fault, which inspired me to improve on the next run. Banana Rumble even offers extensive control options for both the stage and the camera, so I cranked every possible setting to the max and found that gave me the expert level of control I was seeking. The physics aren’t entirely perfect – sometimes I didn’t get the level of bounce I expected when dropping from a high ledge – but this is still easily the best-feeling Super Monkey Ball since the first two.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is easily the best-feeling Super Monkey Ball since the first two.</p></div><p>Banana Rumble has also finally ditched the series poorly-implemented jumping mechanic (if I’m tilting the stage and my monkey is trapped in a ball, why would they be able to jump?) in favor of an exciting new spin dash, which takes a page from Sonic the Hedgehog and lets you charge up and release a quick burst of speed. Whereas the jump never amounted to more than a gimmick in past games, the spin dash is a genius evolution of Monkey Ball’s core mechanics. It’s only mandatory in a handful of levels, but almost every single stage has some sort of shortcut or exploit that’s only possible to pull off thanks to this new ability. </p><p>A properly-aimed spin dash can catapult your poor monkey across the map in the blink of an eye, and it’s a speedrunner’s dream to uncover all the ways to take advantage of this smart addition. Banana Rumble rewards players who understand the mechanics and level design with optional routes hiding in plain sight that require expert skill to reach, and it adds a lot of replay value to an already packed adventure.</p><h2><strong>Banana Split-Screen</strong></h2><p>Multiplayer has been welcomed back to the main game, which was shockingly missing from the last two entries. You can tackle all 200 stages with up to three other players in split-screen local multiplayer or online co-op. Playing with others online is pretty seamless – I played through the entire campaign online with a friend and we never had a disconnect. Banana Rumble also runs at a very smooth 60 FPS when playing alone on Nintendo Switch, and it maintains that level of performance when you add online play into the mix. The frame rate takes a slight hit in split-screen, but not to the point where it feels unplayable.</p><p>Playing with others turns Banana Rumble into a surprisingly strategic cooperative experience. Everyone begins the stage at the same time, and only one player has to complete it in order for the group to move on. This also makes each level’s optional missions easier to complete: Every stage tasks you with collecting a certain number of bananas, completing it in under a certain number of seconds, and finding the hidden golden banana which often requires a high-level technique to snag. Assigning one person to get to the goal as fast as possible while the rest seek out bananas adds a fun layer of planning to the whole experience. I even had fun tackling levels online with random players, as I helped some Monkey Ball rookies clear some easier worlds and worked with others to grab some tricky golden bananas in later stages, using encouraging emotes and phrases to cheer my teammates on. I only wish Banana Rumble also included a more traditional Challenge Mode where you take turns and work through all of the levels individually at your own pace.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One issue with online multiplayer is that it kicks all of you out of a party after you complete a world, so I would have to share a new lobby code with my friend every single time we wanted to keep playing. Additionally, when working through the adventure mode online, Banana Rumble doesn’t show you the story cutscenes, meaning if you want to know what’s going on with AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, GonGon, and their new friend Palette, you’ll have to either play locally or catch up on all the cutscenes in the gallery after the fact. I don’t play Monkey Ball for the story – and the story here is extremely basic and barebones anyways – so I actually preferred not seeing the cutscenes so we could get straight to the stages, but it does feel like a strange omission.</p><p>Banana Rumble’s biggest monkey’s paw wish is its aforementioned battle mode. Longtime Super Monkey Ball fans know how iconic legacy party games like Monkey Target and Monkey Bowling are, but there’s nothing here that held my attention for more than a couple minutes. The five modes all feel extremely shallow and uninspired, with so few maps in rotation that I felt like I’d seen everything they had to offer after less than an hour. There’s generic racing, banana gathering, and bomb passing that feel like cheap knockoffs of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>’s battle mode. I’m guessing others feel the same way, as it took me several minutes to find a match with a full 16 players just a few days after launch. The performance also takes a serious hit in battle mode, reducing the smooth 60 FPS of the adventure mode to a choppy slideshow at times. Local multiplayer comes with its own set of limitations, as you can’t play battle mode online with two people on the same system, and three-to-four player battles aren’t even an option locally. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The five battle modes all feel extremely shallow and uninspired.</p></div><p>But even if you completely ignore Banana Rumble’s undercooked battle mode, there’s still so much to do here. I’ve already completed all 200 stages, but I’m nowhere close to finishing all of the stage missions – some of which I’m still scratching my head at as I try to figure out how I’m supposed to grab dozens of bananas and make it to the goal in time. There are hundreds of cosmetic items to buy with in-game points to style your monkey, too. I’m a simple man, so I bought AiAi’s classic orange T-shirt from the original games and called it good, but it’s cool how many outfits and accessories are available for Banana Rumble’s 12 playable characters (or more, if you get the optional SEGA Pass that adds Sonic the Hedgehog and friends to the mix).
</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble is a brilliant return to form. Monkey Ball has finally found its way home again with a set of 200 fantastic courses that range from delightfully charming to devilishly challenging, backed up by tight mechanics and predictable physics that put me in total control of my monkey’s fate. This isn’t just a cover album of Monkey Ball’s greatest hits, though, as the new spin dash ability is a genius evolution of the franchise’s core ideas, and smartly-implemented online play adds fresh layers of cooperation and strategy. The underwhelming and forgettable battle mode is Banana Rumble’s biggest disappointment, but the sheer amount of optional objectives and replayability found in its adventure mode make it easy to ignore. It doesn’t quite reach the heights of the amazing GameCube originals, but Banana Rumble is easily the best Super Monkey Ball game in over 20 years. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

ack in March, Diablo 4 became the first Activision Blizzard title to join Xbox Game Pass post-Microsoft's acquisition of the publisher, and it looks like the floodgates are finally starting to open; Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is reportedly set to hit the subscription service this August, with more Activision games coming "very soon".
</p>
<p>
That's according to reliable leaker eXtas1s who, <a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/exclusive-new-details-regarding-activision-games-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-emerge.222/">writing on eXputer</a>, claims to have spoken to sources and seen "certain graphic evidence" pointing to Game Pass releases for a number of Activision titles in the not-too-distant future. eXtas1s' most specific claim is that of Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy's August arrival - since <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/report-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-august">corroborated by Windows Central</a> - but there's reportedly more on the way.
</p>
<p>
eXtas1s says Activision's Tony Hawk 1+2 remake and Spyro Reignited Trilogy are also heading to Game Pass - and while they "cannot guarantee" the titles will arrive alongside Crash Bandicoot, they're both reportedly joining the subscription service "very soon".

To date, Microsoft has only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-2024-will-launch-into-xbox-game-pass-microsoft-has-reportedly-decided">confirmed one Activision Blizzard title for Game Pass</a> beyond Diablo 4 - this year's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, which is set to be a release day addition to the catalogue on 25th October, just over a year after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft's $69bn acquisition of Activision was made official</a>. Last year, Xbox boss Phil Spencer warned fans the publisher's titles <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-blames-lengthy-buyout-process-for-delay-in-adding-activision-blizzard-titles-to-game-pass">wouldn't start showing up on Game Pass until 2024</a>, blaming the holdup on "a lot of uncertainty" around the buyout process.
</p>
<p>
But with the wheels seemingly now in motion, it hopefully won't be long before Microsoft and Activision finally give the masses exactly what they've been clamouring for: every Zork title on Game Pass for PC. Until then, there's always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-lineup-for-july-2024-announced">July's Xbox Game Pass additions</a>, including the likes of Journey to the Savage Planet, Tchia, Neon White, and The Case of the Golden Idol.

The dock can also back up save game data or easily extract photos captured by the Game Boy Camera.</p><p>Epilogue, the company behind it, shared a short video of the new feature on X and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/07/the-gb-operator-turns-your-game-boy-camera-into-the-worst-and-best-webcam-youll-ever-have">told <em>Time Extension</em></a>, “We now have a live feed from the Game Boy Camera, but still need to fine-tune some things and allow for configuration options.”</p><p>It also described the new feature as “the worst and the best webcam you’ll ever have.”</p><p>A previous attempt at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DgSWPvqUGIto">turning the Game Boy Camera into a webcam</a> required a stack of hardware, including a Super Nintendo, a Super Game Boy cartridge, a device to convert a composite video signal to HDMI, and a video capture card for a PC. Epilogue’s solution looks much simpler and nearly painless — except for those forced to see their co-workers livestreamed through a relic of digital photography.</p><p>In addition to the Game Boy-focused GB Operator, Epilogue recently shared the first images of its upcoming SN Operator, which offers the same functionality and PC connectivity but for Super Nintendo cartridges. There are currently no details on when the SN Operator will be released, and “coming soon” is the only timeline shared for the GB Operator upgrades.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/2024-gama-horizons-fellowship-offers-grants-to-diverse-creators-and-businesses<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Game Manufacturer's Association (GAMA) has opened applications for its annual diversity drive. Officially called the GAMA Horizons Fellowship, the program will provide grants and support to tabletop publishers and retailers from marginalized groups.</p>
<h2>The 2024 GAMA Horizons Fellowship program</h2>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2024/07/02/gamas-annual-diversity-drive-opens-offering-1000-grants-convention-support-to-fledgling-board-game-publishers-retailers/">Board Game Wire</a>, the GAMA Horizons Fellowship is an eight-month accelerator program. It will offer $1,000 grants and support to creators and retailers from historically sidelined demographics, including race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and ability.</p>

<p>The program is open to new or prospective US and Canada-based board game publishers. The companies must be at least 51% owned or operated by people from the above-mentioned demographics.</p>
<p>Successful GAMA Horizons Fellowship program applicants will get more than just money. Those select few will receive mentoring and peer coaching, a one-year complementary GAMA membership, free admission, and booth opps at GAMA Expo and Origins 2025 with travel and lodging included, and access to virtual classes from industry veterans.</p>
<p>For those wishing to get their foot in the door of the tabletop industry, GAMA is one of the biggest organizations in the business. In addition to hosting two major board game conventions, they assist publishers and retailers in all assets of development and marketing. This organization can make <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jon-del-arroz-suspended-from-gama" rel="noopener" target="_blank">or break</a> one's career in the tabletop space.</p>
<p>The report ends with testimonials of earlier GAMA Horizons Fellowship program applicants. Golden Lasso Games' Kimi Hughes stated it "opened up a whole new world of knowledge and connections."</p>
<p>PlayForge's Jesse Stommel provided a similar anecdote. He mentions the difficulty of management during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as his struggles being queer and disabled and how the program let him find invaluable people that were in his corner.</p>
<p>Further details on how to apply to the GAMA Horizons Fellowship program can be <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aH3DCXoDIOTnQcIGOTtcwa3KdwHSovSWLYjGumk74Dg/edit">found here</a>.</p>

Instead, I’ve rounded up an eclectic mix of 4th of July gaming deals and culturally adjacent curios that happen to be discounted right now. Check them out.

If you want something more fancy, you’re also in luck. While you could spend thousands on a truly top-of the line TV with blacks as dark as an event horizon, you could also splurge on a 48-inch LG OLED. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-48-class-b4-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv/6584787.p?skuId=6584787&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-48-class-b4-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv/6584787.p?skuId=6584787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Buy is also selling those</a></span> for just $800 (almost 50 percent off the sticker price). </p><h2 id="h204763"><a id=""></a>Best Used Game Sales</h2><p>GameStop is currently running a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamestop.com/search/?pmid=30006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamestop.com/search/?pmid=30006" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">buy 2, get 1 free on all used games</a></span>, including its (very limited) retro collection. It’s great way to catch up on bargain bin stuff you might have never gotten to (<em>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</em>, <em>Watch Dogs 2</em>, <em>GTA V</em>) as well as more recent stuff that hasn’t dropped in value yet. For example, you could play some of 2024's biggest games so far like <em>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</em>, <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, and <em>Tekken 8</em> and save roughly $50 in the process. Have fun mixing and matching. Just make sure they actually have used copies of the games in stock. </p><h2 id="h204764"><a id=""></a>The Best Of The Rest </h2><p>Here’s where we have fun with a rapid-fire round of some other neat deals:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>3 Months of Xbox Game Pass</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://electronics.woot.com/offers/digital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://electronics.woot.com/offers/digital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for $35 (24 percent off)</a></span></li><li><strong>Xbox Series X/S controller </strong><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Core-Wireless-Controller-Deep-Controllers/dp/B08K4HLCPR?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/4th-july-gaming-deals-nintendo-switch-tvs-amazon-1851576442&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-amazonasin="B08K4HLCPR" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">for $47 (22 percent off)</a></span></li><li><strong>Sony INZONE H3 Wired Headset </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-inzone-h3-wired-gaming-headset-white/6510365.p?skuId=6510365&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-inzone-h3-wired-gaming-headset-white/6510365.p?skuId=6510365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for $60 (40 percent off)</a></span></li><li><strong><em>Seven Samurai </em>4k Blu-ray</strong> <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Samurai-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B003KGBISY?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/4th-july-gaming-deals-nintendo-switch-tvs-amazon-1851576442&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-amazonasin="B003KGBISY" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">for $20 (50 percent off in the Criterion sale</a></span>)</li><li><strong><em>Dragon Ball: A Visual History </em></strong><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-History-Akira-Toriyama/dp/1974707407?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/4th-july-gaming-deals-nintendo-switch-tvs-amazon-1851576442&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-amazonasin="1974707407" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">for $25 (38 percent off)</a></span></li><li><strong><em>Disney Lorcana </em>Into the Inklands Booster Box</strong> <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Enthusiasts/dp/B0CFRDMPWZ?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/4th-july-gaming-deals-nintendo-switch-tvs-amazon-1851576442&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-amazonasin="B0CFRDMPWZ" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">for $98 (32 percent off)</a></span></li><li><strong><em>The Lord of the Rings Ilustrated Trilogy</em></strong><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Lord-Rings-Illustrated-J-R-R-Tolkien/dp/0358653037/?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/4th-july-gaming-deals-nintendo-switch-tvs-amazon-1851576442&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-amazonasin="0358653037" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20"> for $39 (56 percent off)</a></span></li><li><strong>Hori Nintendo Switch Pikachu Adventure Bag</strong> <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Adventure-Pack-Pikachu-Travel/dp/B07WWZZBSQ?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/4th-july-gaming-deals-nintendo-switch-tvs-amazon-1851576442&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-amazonasin="B07WWZZBSQ" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">for $25 (17 percent off)</a></span></li><li><strong>Nintendo Switch Lite</strong> <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V4GCFP9?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/4th-july-gaming-deals-nintendo-switch-tvs-amazon-1851576442&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-amazonasin="B07V4GCFP9" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">for $184 (8 percent off) </a></span></li></ul><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp;

Now that the deal is finalized, Xbox owns a ton of franchises and games, including <em>Call of Duty, Warcraft, </em>and <em>Candy Crush. </em>But so far, eight months after the deal was completed, only one Activision game—<em>Diablo IV</em>—has made its way onto Game Pass. However, it appears more are finally on the way. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/report-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-august&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/report-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-august" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to a report by <em>Windows Central</em></a></span> on July 3, <em>Crash Bandicoot N.
