			<p>It's shaping up to be a busy year for Dead by Daylight, as they have plenty of updates to share over the coming months. Behavior Interactive has shared its 2024 roadmap for <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1819387887915331625/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead by Daylight in a new post on X</a>, covering all updates players can expect to see throughout the year. This roadmap takes players up to November 2024</p>
<p>August is looking to be the busiest month of the year for the dev team. Dead by Daylight will receive ten new updates this month, including quality-of-life updates, perk tweaks, and killer tweaks.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent quality-of-life updates for Dead by Daylight coming in August is the change to scratch marks. For those who have color blindness, the scratch marks were quite difficult to see. As a result, they've made them more vibrant and plentiful so killers can track their targets accordingly.</p>
<p>As seen on their roadmap, The Doctor, The Nemesis, and The Dredge will all receive tweaks that may make them more powerful or dull their abilities to make it easier for survivors. In addition to killers getting tweaked in August, five perks will also receive some tweaks to balance them out.</p>
<p>These perks include Dance With Me, Deception, Diversion, Chemical Trap, and Mirrored Illusion.</p>
<p>According to the Dead by Daylight roadmap, September and October are shaping up to be busy months. Finisher Moris will receive a quality-of-life update, and more of the killers will be balanced out.</p>
<p>Between September and October, players can expect to see killers such as The Skull Merchant, The Unknown, The Hillbilly and The Twins. In addition, perks such as Leverage, Hex: Crowd Control, Distortion, and Blood Rush are all expected to be tweaked.</p>
<p>Finally, in November, major quality-of-life updates will be made to the Pharmacy, Scene Partner, Weave Attunement, and Shadowborn. According to the roadmap, there will be no perk tweaks; instead, The Cenobite and The Plague will be tweaked.</p>
<p>This year, Dead by Daylight has received many major content updates, such as the 2v8 game mode and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-by-daylight-2v8-game-mode-and-cross-progression-date-reveal/">cross-progression</a>. The game also introduced Lara Croft. Outside of Dead by Daylight, Behavior Interactive has been working on a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe alongside Supermassive Games titled The Casting of Frank Stone.</p>
<p>As with any updates, the Dead by Daylight team added, "timelines may change, but we'll keep you updated as we progress." This means that there may be more tweaks to come, or some may be removed from the upcoming roadmap.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/game-informer-shut-down-gamestop/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>After more than 33 years of operations, Game Informer has announced today that it’s shutting down, effectively immediately. If you try to access the Game Informer site, you will be met with a holding page explaining that the brand no longer exists. In a post on social media, the team lamented the closure of the platform, which has been one of the most pivotal sources of gaming news and coverage for more than three decades.</p>



<p>While the Game Informer team didn’t delve into the reasons for the closure, Geoff Keighley explained in <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1819408173133910500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a follow-up post</a> that the label has been shut down because the staff have been laid off by GameStop, GI’s parent company.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-so-many-memories">So Many Memories</h2>



<p>In a post on Twitter, the Game Informer team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After 33 thrilling years of bringing you the latest news, reviews, and insights from the ever-evolving world of gaming, it is with a heavy heart that we announce the closure of Game Informer.</p>



<p>From the early days of pixelated adventures to today’s immersive virtual realms, we’ve been honored to share this incredible journey with you, our loyal readers. While our presses may stop, the passion for gaming that we’ve cultivated together will continue to live on.</p>



<p>Thank you for being a part of our epic quest, and may your own gaming adventures never end.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Game Informer was one of the top paper-based publications on the market, offering an unforgettable print media circulation that ran from August 1991 to June of this year. When the rise of digital journalism came about, Game Informer was front and centre for the gaming industry, and for more than a decade, the team maintained a site that was, in many ways, a spearhead for the wider business.</p>



<p>GameStop has yet to make a statement confirming why it has so suddenly shut down the Game Informer brand, but we’ve reached out for comment.</p>

Here's where Xur is this week and what he has for sale.</p><p>This week, Xur is offering the Exotic weapon catalysts for <strong>Coldheart </strong>and <strong>The Colony</strong>, and for Exotic armor, Hunters can pick up <strong>Orpheus Rig</strong>; Titans can grab <strong>Heart of Inmost Light</strong>; and Warlocks can buy <strong>Sunbracers</strong>.</p><h2>Xur Location</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4344649-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4344649" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4344649-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4344649"></a><figcaption>Xur's location inside the Tower's Bazaar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4344649-xur-tfs.jpg"></figure><p>Spawn in at the Tower and hang a right past Banshee-44.

This isn't a great roll of the Exotic as mobility gobbles up most of the available stat points, resulting in poor resilience and recovery. You probably have a better version of the Exotic in your arsenal, so feel free to give this one a skip.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 20</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 7</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 15</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 64</li></ul><h3>Heart of Inmost Light (Exotic Titan chest armor)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4344746-destiny22024-08-0219-05-41.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4344746" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4344746-destiny22024-08-0219-05-41.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4344746"></a><figcaption>Heart of Inmost Light</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4344746-destiny22024-08-0219-05-41.jpg"></figure><p>No, you're not seeing double: Xur really did offer this Exotic chest armor last week. Using an ability will improve your other abilities, so you'll want to cycle through them as you activate them, making this a good Exotic for Prismatic builds. This is a better roll than last week's version of the Exotic, as you're getting chunky resilience, a really good strength stat, and decent numbers for recovery and discipline. It's worth picking up, especially if you gave last week's Exotic a miss.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 4</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 19</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 11</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 15</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 65</li></ul><h3>Sunbracers (Exotic Warlock gauntlets)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4344745-destiny22024-08-0219-05-49.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4344745" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4344745-destiny22024-08-0219-05-49.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4344745"></a><figcaption>Sunbracers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4344745-destiny22024-08-0219-05-49.jpg"></figure><p>Sunbracers aren't as good as they used to be, but that doesn't mean they're bad. Increased solar grenade duration is always good, and when the armor perk kicks in, you can get up to four of these grenades out and make the battlefield look like a volcanic eruption. The stats are well-balanced across the board, although mobility could have been lower and the essential discipline stat will need to be buffed. Not a bad roll, and one that you can work with when you're doing some buildcrafting.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 11</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 12</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 11</li><li

His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

            <p>
Activision and Microsoft have reportedly approved the creation of a new "smaller" team within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/blizzard-entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a> - mostly comprised of employees from Activision's mobile-focused King division - to develop new "AA" games based on existing Blizzard properties.
</p>
<p>
That's according to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-and-activision-have-formed-a-new-team-within-blizzard-to-work-on-smaller-aa-games-based-on-existing-ip">Windows Central's Jez Corden</a>, whose sources say the new initiative reflects an eagerness at Microsoft to "explore and experiment" with smaller teams within the larger organisation, in response to the "monstrously ballooning costs" of AAA game development.
</p>
<p>
Corden notes Microsoft has seen success with the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-review">Sea of Thieves</a> and Grounded, both built by comparatively small teams - and, of course, 2023's Hi-Fi Rush, created by a small team within Tango Gameworks, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-insists-hi-fi-rush-a-break-out-hit-for-xbox-amid-claims-it-underperformed">heralded as a "break out hit" by Microsoft</a> after its release.

<p>
And if you're wondering why Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">closed Tango Gameworks in May</a> if the studio had already demonstrated success using a development approach it was looking to adopt further, Corden claims Microsoft <em>did</em> see Tango as fitting into its new strategy - but its geographical location made "inter-studio collaboration logistically difficult".
</p>
<p>
Back to Blizzard's new team, Corden says it's "geared up for agility, eschewing some of the bureaucratic bloat" of larger teams. But as to what it'll be working on <em>specifically</em>, that remains unclear. The goal, though, is reportedly to create smaller-scale, lower budget titles built around Blizzard's existing franchises - which could potentially mean anything from current hits like Overwatch to long-dormant series such as StarCraft.
</p>
<p>
Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/age-of-empires-25-anniversary-console-launch-xbox/">told Wired</a> back in 2022, roughly a year before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft's acquisition of Activision was approved</a>, that he was "excited to sit down with the teams at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> and King to talk about back catalogue and opportunities we might have there."
</p>
<p>
All of which just leaves the question of <em>platforms</em> Blizzard's reported new studio might be targeting, given it's being populated by King developers who've historically created games for mobile. Corden notes a mobile focus would make sense for the new team, given Microsoft is currently looking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-actively-working-with-partners-on-mobile-store-phil-spencer-says">launch an Xbox gaming store for iOS and Android</a> following new EU laws demanding Google and Apple open their platforms up to competitors. But with Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-bosses-reportedly-pushing-for-no-red-line-around-which-xbox-games-launch-on-playstation">exploring a multi-platform strategy for its releases</a>, anything is possible.
</p>
<p>
Today's report follows the news Microsoft's gaming revenue grew 44 percent in its last quarter, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-console-sales-decline-continues">declining Xbox console sales</a>, in large part thanks to its $69bn Activision Blizzard acquisition. Without Activision Blizzard on its books, that growth would be just three percent.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft's is also starting to leverage its acquisition on Game Pass. Diablo 4 became the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-will-make-a-hellish-addition-to-xbox-game-pass-this-march">first Activision Blizzard game</a> to arrive on the streaming service back in March, while Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-is-heading-to-xbox-game-pass-this-week">launched for members this July</a>. Additionally, Black Ops 6 comes to Game Pass on 24th October, but only for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers, following Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">recently announced service overhaul</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/video-game-hardware-content-and-accessories-spending-falls-by-5-in-june-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For June 2024, video game hardware, content, and accessories spending was <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1819366670282248225" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down by 5% compared to June 2023</a>. Despite this, it still brought in a hefty $4.6 billion. Despite this, the first half of the fiscal year saw a small 1% increase in spending compared to 2023, which saw the overall income reach $27.3 billion.</p>
<p>In June, <a href="https://wccftech.com/video-game-sales-in-the-uk-dropped-by-30-in-first-half-of-the-year/">content spending</a> dropped by 2%, bringing in a profit of $4.1 billion. Surprisingly, mobile gaming content spending grew by 12%, combined with a 4% increase in non-mobile subscription content spending, such as Xbox Game Pass. Despite the increases in these categories, a 26% drop in console content spending offset it.</p>
<p>Some of the top-selling games for June 2024 include Elden Ring, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Hogwarts Legacy, and, most surprisingly, Kingdom Hearts: Integrum Masterpiece. The surprise comes from the huge change in rank positions. Last month, it was at 399, and now it's soared to the top and sits at number three on the ranking. However, this huge change in sales most likely comes from the fact that the games were all recently available on Steam, which fans of the franchise have been waiting for. Previously, it was only available on the Nintendo Switch via Cloud saves.</p>
<p>Looking at the most played games for PlayStation, many of them are free-to-play games. Roblox, Multiversus, and Fortnite are among the top three. However, games like Elden Ring and Grand Theft Auto V also made their way into the top ten games played in June 2024.</p>
<p>In terms of mobile gaming, Roblox remains one of the top games, with a 15% increase in revenue month over month. This increase was predominantly driven by a UA campaign, which increased downloads by 22%.</p>
<p>June's video game hardware spending fell by a further 37%. During the first half of the year, the Nintendo Switch suffered the most, with a decline of 48%, followed by the PlayStation 5, which declined by 28%, and the Xbox series, which fell by 18%.</p>
<p>Despite the heavy decline for the PlayStation 5, the console was the most sold console out of the three, leading the month's hardware market in unit and dollar sales. Followed by the PlayStation 5, the Nintendo Switch ranked 2nd in terms of unit sales, with the Xbox Series coming 2nd in dollars.</p>
<p>Overall, June 2024's spending was a little bit rockier than June 2023's, but there still remains an element of positivity for the month. Shadow of the Erdtree helped bolster Elden Ring, and Roblox has gained a huge resurgence in audiences of all ages, which may continue to help the mobile market sales increase.</p>

<p>Naming a game must be incredibly hard. How many more <em>Dark Fallen Journeys </em>and&nbsp;<em>Noun: Verb of the Noun</em> games can fit into the market? And yet certain games just appear with a near-perfect, properly descriptive label.</p>
<p><em>Metropolis 1998</em> is just such a game, telling you what you'll be doing, how it will look and feel, and what era it harkens back to. You can verify this with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287430/Metropolis_1998/">its "pre-alpha" demo on Steam</a> and <a href="https://yesbox.itch.io/archapolis">Itch.io</a>. There's plenty more to come, but what is already in place is impressive. And it's simply pleasant to play, especially if you're the type who wants to make something entirely yours. Not just "put the park inside the commercial district," but <em>The Sims-</em>style "choose which wood color for the dining room table in a living room you framed up yourself."</p>
<p>You start out in a big field with no features (yet) and the sounds of birds chirping. Once you lay down a road, you can add things at a few different levels. You can, <em>SimCity</em>-style, simply plot out colored zones and let the people figure it out themselves. You can add pre-made buildings individually. Or you can really get in there, spacing out individual rooms, choosing the doors and windows and objects inside, and realizing how hard it is to shape multi-floor houses so the roof doesn't look grotesque. You can save the filled-out house for later reuse or just hold on to its core aspects as a blueprint.</p>

                    It takes a bit to get used to it, but the detailed building designer is full of wonderful little pieces, like this classic speaker cabinet with the black and red wire clips visible on the back.                  </p>

<p>The game is still early in development, so its mechanics are not introduced in tutorials, and the interface requires a lot of clicking, reading, and wondering. I got a reasonable feel for it after about 30 minutes of tentative placing and bulldoze-deletion. You can save your game and come back to it, though the developers note that your saves may not transfer to future versions. You're putting your time in now, so you'll be ready to start fresh when the game releases into early access ("ETA sometime between Q4 2024 and Q2 2025"). If you're into this kind of fine-toothed builder, a fresh start is a gift, anyway.</p>

<h2>Bank robberies and zombie scenarios ahead (maybe)</h2>
<p>What will the game look like when it's finished? Developer YesBox has <a href="https://yesboxstudios.com/roadmap/">a detailed roadmap</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://yesboxstudios.com/blog/">a blog</a>&nbsp;detailing how it's going. The very small team, seemingly a solo developer with art help from two others, <a href="https://yesboxstudios.com/blog/2022-06-13-november-december-2021.html">started off in December 2021</a>&nbsp;and has achieved quite a lot, including an algorithm seemingly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q0l87hwmkI">ready to handle big populations</a>. A key promise of the game is that you won't just lay down zones and wait for people and problems to show up. You will lay down specific buildings, like hospitals and police stations, and manage the usual concerns of traffic, zone demand, and the like. The "Post-1.0 Aspirations" hint at the game's direction: "Visible Crime (e.g., watch a bank robbery)," "Zombie Mode (your police vs. your zombie population)," and "Live in your own city" in a "<em>Sims</em>-like mode" imply more of a toybox mentality than a "Highly realistic ports and infrastructure" ambition.</p>

<p><em>Metropolis 1998</em> is not alone in seeking out city-builder fans living in the long wake of any proper&nbsp;<em>SimCity</em> release. But unlike games like&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>, it's not seeking the kind of mechanical complexity that would see it, say, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/the-rent-is-too-dang-high-in-cities-skylines-2-so-the-devs-nuked-the-landlords/?comments=1&amp;comments-page=1">figuring out eerily familiar housing cost crises.</a> Building this kind of game is still fiendishly complex, of course. But how that complexity is presented to the player is something else.</p>
<p>The most interesting line in the roadmap<span>&nbsp;is "player starts with land purchased from successful business exit." I can't help but think of&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/03/stardew-valley-review-a-pastoral-contemporary-escape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a>, which can also sprawl to ridiculous levels</span>&nbsp;but has at its core the arc of a person who got tired of the rat race and inherited a farm. I'm looking forward to this invitingly retro and human-scale city-builder, with patience and respect for what seems like a massive developer undertaking.</p>

By 9 AM, there are already enough people participating in the strike to cause mild congestion; cars honk as traffic piles up along the semi-residential roads. News crews hug the curb as they interview SAG-AFTRA representatives, all squeezed together at the edge of the sidewalk. Police stand at the intersection, watching the strike — a strike that has come about as negotiations between the union and game companies have slowed to a crawl.</p><p>Video game performers represented by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went on strike on July 25</a>. The union and game companies such as Activision, EA, Take-Two, and WB Games <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-grand-theft-auto-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit an impasse over AI protections for performers</a>, part of negotiations that have gone on for 18 months. Zeke Alton, a member of SAG-AFTRA and an interactive negotiator who has lent his likeness to games such as <em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, says that it has been a long and difficult road. He feels that public support, and support from within the entertainment industry, has been critical in the steps that SAG-AFTRA has made. It just isn’t there yet in terms of a deal.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re looking for protection against the use of generative AI to create synthetic performances to replace us,” Alton told Aftermath, elaborating that this is not an issue unique to video games and pointing to the <a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/ai-nurse-chatbots-nvidia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nursing industry</a> as an example. But Alton feels that performers are the canary in the coal mine: “If we can’t get protection, then it sets a precedent where no one can get protection.”</p><p>But Alton remains hopeful. He feels as though unionization at studios like <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-union-unionize-fallout-elder-scrolls-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bethesda</a> and within pockets of <a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard Entertainment</a> has been a wakeup call. “It’s gotten to a point where people are realizing they can’t just be beaten around by the C-Suite anymore. They’re starting to realize that the ability to maintain a living wage in this country comes from standing together and withholding your work. Not only do developers understand that what we’re asking for is extremely reasonable, but even AI companies themselves agree.”&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Kazuma Hashimoto</figcaption></figure><p>He spoke positively about SAG-AFTRA’s previous deal with AI firm <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-and-replica-studios-introduce-groundbreaking-ai-voice-agreement-ces" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Replica Studios</a>, which was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/01/10/video-game-voice-actors-criticize-sag-aftra-over-agreement-with-ai-company/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divisive</a> among union performers. “They [Replica] gave us consent, control, and compensation for both digital replicas and generative AI for synthetic performers. So it seems unreasonable that a few companies in the room are trying to gather all the rights to have the opportunity, should the tech allow, to completely replace us.”</p><p>Torian Brackett, a voice actor in Los Angeles, shares a somewhat similar sentiment regarding the deal between SAG-AFTRA and Replica, stating that it seemed to be a good template that would allow voice actors to operate on their own terms. But he feels as though corporations see AI as a “shiny new toy” that they want to use at the expense of their performers. While he doesn’t see generative AI going away any time soon, Brackett believes consumers have a fair amount of power, and that the power of the dollar simply cannot be ignored.&nbsp;</p><p>“It's really the consumers that will decide whether, you know, if they'll accept this, and it's going to keep happening,” Brackett said. “But I'm very heartened by what I see in the gaming community. I'm a gamer as well, and people seem, across the board, not interested in hearing AI voices. [Performers] are the people that bring us to tears and elevate the experience we have when we pick up that controller or sit at our keyboard. And they [players] see the value in it. So I hope our bargaining partners will see that same value when it comes to voice acting, when it comes to emotion, when it comes to the entire industry of performance that ties into gaming.”&nbsp;</p><p>More than anything, Brackett hopes negotiations end soon and that some kind of agreement will be made and the contract signed. In 2023, film and television actors covered by SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-06-29/what-to-know-sag-aftra-strike-actors-hollywood#:~:text=SAG%2DAFTRA's%20strike%20against%20major%20media%20companies%20stretched%20118%20days." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went on strike for nearly four months</a>, shortly after members of the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-05-01/writers-strike-what-to-know-wga-guild-hollywood-productions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Writers Guild of America began a nearly five month strike</a> of their own.&nbsp;</p><p>Ray Rodriguez, Chief Contracts Officer for SAG-AFTRA, shared that this contract wouldn’t just cover voice actors, but extend further to include performers across the industry. “The strike came to be because we have not been able yet to reach agreement on the protective terms that we need for the use of artificial intelligence involving our members and their performances in video games. So we've been bargaining for 18 months — this contract actually expired in November of 2022, and we started negotiating a month before the expiration of the contract.”</p><figure><figcaption>Kazuma Hashimoto</figcaption></figure><p>Rodriquez shared that a significant number of video game producers are signatories,&nbsp;but this does not make them staunchly pro-union. “I'm not sure that even all of the people who are assigned to our contract would necessarily describe themselves as pro union. I think they gladly or grudgingly acknowledge the importance of union performers, because they need them to work on their games. And that's their incentive, not necessarily to make a social statement in favor of labor, although we'd love that,” he said.</p><p>This hasn’t deterred SAG-AFTRA in their desire to expand their footprint and eventually cover all performers in the video game space. Rodriguez said that this fight is for the entire community, and more broadly, everyone, which seems to be a common sentiment across the board.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don't think anybody wants other people to have the right to take your voice and your image and digitally replicate you without your consent and not pay you, and use you in ways that generate profit for multibillion dollar corporations,&nbsp; that's just not a circumstance that I think is tolerable to anyone,” he said. “And I think people really need to see that they have an interest in the outcome of this fight and all the fights that we have had on AI and that we're going to need to have on AI in order to make sure that basic rights like that stay protected.”&nbsp;</p><p>This includes the protection of performance capture artists, whose inclusion in AI provisions is at the heart of the strike. As Rodriguez <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-grand-theft-auto-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously told Aftermath</a>, the companies currently want AI protections to extend to performers only if their likeness is recognizable–but, as Rodriquez said to Aftermath in July, “you could be doing the stunts that form the movement for Spider-Man, but what the player is going to see is Spider-Man. So that requirement of identifiability really leaves movement performers out of the scope of coverage."</p><p>Jasiri Booker, a performance capture artist who has worked on Insomniac’s <em>Spider-Man 2</em> and several other projects currently under NDA, said that performance capture artists are represented by SAG’s Interactive Media Agreement, but companies have been using a gray area to hire performance capture artists as non-union. “Because what we do gets animated, it’s not viewed as a true performance,” he said. “As far as the strike and what’s on the negotiating table for us, it’s protection against AI. The ability to be informed and to give our consent if a company does want to train an AI program off of our library of moves, that’s kind of the main big topic for us.”</p><figure><figcaption>Kazuma Hashimoto</figcaption></figure><p>Seth Allyn Austin, a performance capture artist who has also worked on numerous titles under Insomniac, such as <em>Spider-Man</em>, and several others under NDA, jumped in to share that a lot of this ended up coming to light during the COVID-19 pandemic. “It doesn’t take a whole army of performers like it does for TV or film to create a project; we could go in essentially one at a time and work, but then learn that we still don’t qualify for health insurance because we’re under a non-union contract. And that’s when stuff got real.”&nbsp;</p><p>When asked about who he felt was causing negotiations to lag, Austin said that it would be difficult to pinpoint any individual studio. “Video games are an interesting space where you have developers and publishers making games. But the bargaining group of those individual studios can’t come to an agreement to cover us. They won’t come together collectively to give us the protection we want.”</p><p>Booker clarified that this strike is not a fight between those looking to unionize and those involved in the hands-on process of making games.“This is not against animators, this is not against designers, this is not against directors. There is this weird invisible ‘they’ that always exists, these kinds of people that have jumped into the video game market during COVID-19 and are now looking for a return on their investment. They’re trying to milk this industry and the performers out there for everything they’re worth and that means, for them, cutting as many people out as possible.”</p><p>Austin said that even the more “bread and butter” jobs, such as locomotion, are just as important as more evocative motion capture, and he fears that if those opportunities are taken away, the barrier of entry into performance capture could increase significantly. “When I worked on <em>Spider-Man,</em> I was brought in to flip. But then they [Insomniac] learned that I could act, and my career and my usefulness in that space grew because they gave me that opportunity. And if those simple jobs are taken away, there is going to be an entire generation of performers that won’t have the same opportunities we had.”</p><p>Booker and Austin don’t believe that AI could replicate the performances given by actors, or at least not yet. That was something both actors stressed, with Booker believing that those pushing the narrative about this technology and its integration in games don’t understand that it doesn’t, or won’t, work in the way that they believe it does.&nbsp; “AI is a tool and it could be helpful,” Austin said. “But any tool used inappropriately becomes a weapon.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-june-2024-elden-ring<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sales analysis group Circana has released its US sales data for the gaming industry in June 2024, and given the release of a certain high-profile DLC expansion, the month's best-selling game probably won't come as a surprise.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1819366822606786676" rel="noopener" target="_blank">always-dependable Mat Piscatella on X</a> (formerly Twitter), the best-selling game for June was&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, almost certainly driven by the release of&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-release-date">on the 21st of that month</a>. Given that&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>had sold five million copies at last count (which was less than a week after the DLC's release), it's fair to say the expansion has been an unqualified success.</p>
<p>If you're wondering what's trailing behind&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>on the all-format sales chart, <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</i>&nbsp;is in second place, and&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece</em>, a collection of many of the games in that venerable franchise that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-steam">launched on Steam in June</a>, is in third.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it looks like the strong sales performance of that collection is based entirely on its Steam release. Hey, publishers! Release your games on Steam!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-hearts-integrum-masterpiece-circana-us-sales-data-june-2024.jpg?itok=MojB0A26 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-hearts-integrum-masterpiece-circana-us-sales-data-june-2024.jpg?itok=q8tglr_M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece&nbsp;</em>was released on Steam in June, and it looks like it's done pretty well sales-wise.</figcaption></figure><p>On a year-to-date basis, the best-selling premium game as of June 2024 is still&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, with&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>taking the second and third spots.</p>
<p><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>was June's most-played game on both PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, although on PC, the title goes to&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>. Admittedly, that's probably because Circana is using Steam as the basis for its data, and&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>isn't available on Steam.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>was also the best-selling premium game on both PS5 and Xbox Series X|S for June, while&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD&nbsp;</em>was the month's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-profits-plummet-financials-q1-2025">best-selling game on Switch</a>. Again, though,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>isn't available for Nintendo's platform, although it's pretty amusing to imagine what an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>Switch port might look like.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/circana-us-sales-data-june-2024-luigis-mansion-2-hd.jpg?itok=cdNeWhax 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/circana-us-sales-data-june-2024-luigis-mansion-2-hd.jpg?itok=pXv28L2A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD&nbsp;</em>has done pretty well for Nintendo in June.</figcaption></figure><p>In hardware terms, the PS5 led June's sales figures for both unit and dollar sales. The Switch trailed behind in second place in unit sales, while the two Xbox Series models combined took second place for dollar sales.</p>
<p>As always, it's well worth reading Piscatella's <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1819366670282248225" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full thread</a> if you want some more nerdy stats about gaming industry sales. July's figures will inevitably be released in the coming weeks, so stay tuned for those as and when we get them.</p>

After a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173544/valorant-ps5-xbox-release-date-riot">brief beta period in June</a>, the console version of <em>Valorant </em>will be available in the US, Canada, Europe, Japan, and Brazil and features all the same gameplay, heroes, and abilities as the PC version.</p><p><em>Valorant </em>on console won’t have crossplay support because Riot Games wants to maintain “competitive integrity.” That means PC players won’t be getting controller support, either. The game will support cross-progression, so any skins and progression will carry over between PC and console. Both PC and console players will also receive simultaneous platform releases, including balance patches, new agents, map updates, premium content, and more.</p><div><figcaption>Valorant<em> Xbox gameplay.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Riot Games</cite></p></div><p>Riot Games has also made some tweaks to the console version of its 5v5 tactical shooter, largely to make it more controller-friendly for hip-fire gameplay. “Focus is a new shooting mode that behaves essentially like hip-fire, but with reduced sensitivity,” explains Arnar Gylfason, production director of <em>Valorant</em>. “This way, players can use hip-fire whenever they need speed in moving their camera / aim, but utilize focus mode whenever they need precision. This also approximates the shooting mechanic to what console players are used to in shooters, all of this without losing the added value <em>Valorant</em>’s aim down sights provides.”</p><p><em>Valorant </em>is now available to play for free on PC, Xbox Series S / X, and PS5.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bungie have reportedly cancelled Payback, an unannounced project in the Destiny universe from former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> game director Luke Smith and project lead Mark Noseworthy. Both Noseworthy and Smith appear to have lost their jobs in the course of Bungie's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">brutal cost-cutting</a> this week, but Payback's cancellation pre-dates the layoffs. Envisaged as a Destiny spin-off, rather than Destiny 3, it was apparently dropped "a while ago".</p><!--more-->
<p>All that's according to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-layoffs-include-senior-execs-luke-smith-and-mark-noseworthy/1100-6525488/">Gamespot</a>'s Tamoor Hussain, Giant Bomb's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yszLbBLdM3Y">Jeff Grubb</a> and Bloomberg's <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1819075149360185737">Jason Schreier</a> (the source of the "a while ago" quote), as reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-destiny-project-payback-no-longer-happening-senior-execs-depart">Eurogamer</a>. Payback's existence came to light in April, though Bungie have yet to formally comment on the subject. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny2Leaks/comments/1c0c0zg/dont_read_too_far_into_payback/">According to one self-alleged leaker</a>, the name is a reference to "Bungie getting payback against themselves by creating something they hope everyone will love". I don't quite follow this explanation, but the leaker in question did <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny2Leaks/comments/1b17fzi/comment/ksg63he/?context=3">correctly predict</a> the introduction of Destiny 2's Prismatic character subclass, so they're more trustworthy than the average redditor with a bridge to sell.</p>
<p>Payback's cancellation seems to have paved the way for Smith and Noseworthy's departures. Gamespot sources claim that executive restructuring during this week's layoffs means the pair have "no path forward at Bungie". </p>
<p>The shockwaves from Bungie's headcount reduction continue to spread. As Nic wrote earlier today, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-layoffs-couldnt-be-avoided-even-if-destiny-2-the-final-shape-had-blockbuster-performance-says-report">insiders allege that the cuts have been in the works for a while</a>, regardless of the success or not of Destiny 2's excellent recent expansion The Final Shape. Many of The Final Shape's senior team are now gone, including <a href="https://x.com/Sphynxian/status/1818677295424717041">senior narrative designer Robert Brookes</a> and <a href="https://x.com/kperng/status/1818703463645430268">narrative lead Kwan Perng</a> - a miserable reward for yanking Destiny 2 out of the nose-dive instigated by the disastrous Lightfall expansion.</p>
<p>Aside from laying off staff, Bungie have also transferred 155 roles to parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment. Some of those roles will form a new PlayStation studio working on an untitled "action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe". Those remaining at Bungie will double down on development of the Marathon reboot and future Destiny projects.</p>
<p>This week's layoffs were announced by Bungie CEO Pete Parsons, who confessed that Bungie leadership have been "over-ambitious" in their handling of the business. Parsons has been lying low on social media after it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-ceo-criticised-for-spending-millions-on-classic-cars-as-calls-for-leadership-changes-escalate">discovered</a> that he'd spent $2,414,550 on cars since September 2022, including a Porsche costing over $200,000 in the wake of a previous round of layoffs last October.</p>
<p>$2,414,550 is a tiny dent in the outgoings of a video game developer that even now has around 850 people on the books, but still - I wonder how many narrative designers you can hire for $2,414,550? Payback is certainly the word: laid-off Bungie <a href="https://x.com/DirtyEffinHippy/status/1818677930622685516">developers</a> and <a href="https://x.com/MyNameIsByf/status/1818671790538809555">Destiny players</a> continue to call on Parsons to do the decent thing and resign his position.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I wanted it to be clear that Artemis is an immortal with privileges that the mortals don't have, and that she’s [initially] blind to her privilege and how much harder life is for mortals, so I think that was a really important theme.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To make a game about belonging and community, Yu also wants to avoid the pitfalls we’ve seen from the likes of indie studios like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/new-allegations-of-sexual-assault-surface-against-established-game-devs">Mountains</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/steve-gaynor-steps-back-from-fullbright-following-toxic-work-environment-allegations">Fullbright Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, studios that have also released games focusing on a female perspective but led by male auteurs who have since been accused of abusive behavior. “I don't like over-concentrations of power,” says Yu. “I very much consider myself someone that helps and provides and builds community.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Mythmatch "><span>Mythmatch </span>is a community sim about privilege and power</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yu wasn’t however blind to the fact that the characters meant the narrative, while analogous to his own experiences, including finding a community to belong to (he also cites the movies Legally Blonde and Amélie as inspirations), is ultimately centered on gender issues. It was therefore always important for him to build an inclusive studio whose team members reflected the game he wanted to make.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Specifically, the writer must be a woman, must be able to understand instinctively rather than me doing research and trying to vaguely understand,” he says. Indeed, almost all of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.teamartichoke.com/">Team Artichoke</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s members are women, including artist Beidi Guo, writer Lara Barbier, and content designer Albertine Watson. Although the team is made up of part-time roles, Yu being the sole full-time developer on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mythmatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (an arrangement admittedly down to what he’s able to afford to pay), they’re all equally credited as team members, as evidenced on the studio’s homepage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“There’s this obsession with art having this magical intrinsic value outside of the people that create it, but for me, the goal is to bring the people together. There's so much joy in working with others and getting the best out of everyone but also watching stuff come together and seeing how ideas mix together constantly.”</span></p><p>Image via Team Artichoke.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One important perspective he had learned was shaping </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mythmatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s arc, which was going to have a progression one might associate with other cozy community sims. “At the beginning it was like, Artemis is trying to impress the gods [until] she's finally good enough,” he explains. “But the more I spoke to [the team], the more it became, 'You will never be good enough'-that’s the whole point of gatekeeping.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making sure narrative aligned with the mechanics was also important. For instance, when art came back that depicted Penelope (queen of Ithaca and Odysseus’s wife) as a Black woman, having Artemis come down as this white immortal ordering a Black mortal around suddenly felt very wrong. “Artemis doesn't understand the troubles that the mortals are going through, she shouldn't have the solutions,” Yu explains. “It should be coming from the mortals themselves.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Subverting the usual expectations of other life sims where you go into a town and effectively become its mayor creating a place in your own image, Artemis is helping the community of Ithaca. But also rather than doing this as a white savior, the gameplay is designed so that the mortals are doing the work to solve their problems, while Artemis is more of a support in a collaborative effort.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Artichoke Studios values people and process">Artichoke Studios values people and process</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a part-time team, that does mean a slower development process, with no set release date for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mythmatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but Yu accepts and embraces this. “As long as we're making the game we want to make and it comes out okay in the end, I think that's the higher priority,” he explains. “I tell everyone on my team, this is the rate, this is what I can afford. If you can find work that pays better, always prioritize that. Even if it did harm the project, the people are more important than the project.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In getting the best out of everyone with what they can give to the project as fairly as possible, everyone is also paid a flat day rate, a practice Yu had learned from working with Die Gute Fabrik. “It’s great because it made it so you don't have a concept of juniors anymore,” he explains. “You never say, 'we'll just give juniors the junior tasks' - everyone just has tasks. Everyone asks questions to everyone else, everyone ramps up, you're never thinking, 'this person makes less so we expect less of them'. It was just such an incredible experience to be part of that, so I wanted to replicate that as much as I can.”</span></p><p>Image via Team Artichoke.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s also a practice that means avoiding the alternative other studios might be tempted to take, lowballing staff or where they feel compelled to work for free. Yu even mentions a team member who, as a newcomer to the industry, had not been expecting to be paid the full rate advertised. “I'm like, of course I'm going to pay the full rate advertised - I hired you because you can do the work I need, and this is how much the work is worth to me.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it comes to hiring people, it has also been important that job descriptions do not exclude people based on arbitrary parameters like number of years of experience or number of games shipped. “It's like, here's what we need you to do, and if you think you can do that, please apply,” he says, adding that this has also attracted people both new or outside of the industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“When you don't pay well, you naturally add bias and discrimination into your process for people, you can easily weed out certain massive demographics of people,” Yu concludes. “If you're trying to tell a story that's about gatekeeping and exclusion, you need those people on your team because they have these great stories to share about it.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While Yu acknowledges his decisions may not be 100% satisfactory for everyone, and not all studios can afford to work slowly, at least not if its team members don’t have other projects to sustain themselves, the intention is there to make an environment where people can enjoy working in where they’re treated fairly, an issue he still thinks isn’t very common in the industry.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Riot Games' free-to-play hero shooter Valorant launches today for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-hero-shooter-valorant-is-running-an-open-console-beta-and-its-live-right-now">recent console open beta</a>.
</p>
<p>
The game will not offer crossplay between its existing PC version and consoles "to maintain Valorant's renowned standard for competitive integrity", Riot has said.
</p>
<p>
In a press release issued today, Riot did at least promise future game updates would release simultaneously, so all additional maps and characters will arrive at the same time.

<p>
Today's launch caps off a four-year journey for Valorant from PC to consoles, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-is-prototyping-valorant-on-consoles-but-only-if-its-certain-the-console-port-can-deliver-the-experience">previously saying it was not "entirely sure" the game translated to console play</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Riot Games delivers a masterclass in competitive integrity, soulless precision and zealous, life-consuming obsession," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valorant-review-exacting-infuriating-sublime">Eurogamer's Valorant review</a>, published back in 2020. "By design Valorant is a severe, soulless and uncompromising experience. That's often to its detriment, but it's more often to its success."
</p>
<p>
Valorant has repeatedly hit the headlines as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-outlines-plans-to-start-monitoring-valorant-voice-chat-in-a-bid-to-combat-disruptive-behaviour">Riot grapples</a> with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valorant-pledges-harsher-more-immediate-punishment-for-voice-and-chat-toxicity">toxic elements</a> of the game's community. In May this year, Valorant's studio head said toxic players should go "play something else, we won't miss you." Said Riot Games boss Anna Donlon: "If you want to make evil statements under the guise of s**t talk, you aren't welcome here."
</p>
<p>On a more positive note, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-changers-making-valorant-esports-inclusive-for-women">Riot's Game Changers programme for Valorant</a> has aimed to make its esports scene more inclusive for women.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
