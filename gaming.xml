			<p>Hytopia is a platform of games not entirely dissimilar to Roblox, with the key difference being its focus on blockchain games, and it has just launched its latest major title, SkyGarden, in open beta on its <a href="https://hytopia.com/games/">website</a>.</p>



<p>SkyGarden is a farming MMORPG that will immediately remind you of games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-creator-buying-game-purchase-pirating-not-theft/">Minecraft</a>, but that's not a mistake considering the fact that the development team includes the Minecraft artist Sebu, and is led by notable web developer<a href="https://x.com/GamingEtheria"> Shrimp</a>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SkyGarden A New Era of Cozy Farming MMORPG on HYTOPIA" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QDpe2sNipC4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The game is free-to-play and allows players to build their own farms, grow crops, raise cattle, and create decorations for their farm to make it their own. Crops will also continue to grow even when players are offline, so you'll need to check in to keep your farm tidy and successful as you sell your crops and grown resources.</p>



<p>It's a milestone launch for the platform as it continues to try and grow its player base and developer base with games like SkyGardens and calls for developers, giving them <a href="https://www.blockchaingamer.biz/news/39771/hytopia-paying-25000-dev-teams-make-a-game-in-90-days/">$25K</a> if they can make a game within 90 days.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Why was a decision that saved <em>Borderlands</em> such a dumb one to make? What was it like to play <em>Prey 2</em> at E3 2011? Will <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> eventually come to Switch 2? Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Yours truly is still recovering from the weekend’s PAX West marathon and I have a bunch of interviews and previews still to publish on the site throughout the week. In the meantime, let’s take a short walk down memory lane.</p> <h2>Watch someone play Bethesda’s canceled sci-fi shooter <em>Prey 2</em></h2>  <p>Let’s talk about <em>Prey 2</em>. The short version is that <em>Prey 2</em> was a sequel to a popular 2006 shooter by Human Head Studios about solving puzzles on an alien spaceship. It got a big blowout showing at E3 2011, including a playable demo that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/jun/20/e3-2011-prey-2-game-preview">generated a ton of buzz</a>. As a bounty hunter in an alien city, players used guns and parkour to chase suspects and choose how to apprehend them. A robot punished you if you caused too much immersive sim chaos,&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>style.</p> <p>The game was supposed to come out in 2012 but never did. What was most surprising of all was that Bethesda never provided clear reasons for why the project was suddenly scuttled. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/05/what-went-wrong-with-human-heads-prey-2">There were reports</a> of contractual disputes and Bethesda leveraging the <em>Prey 2</em> publishing agreement to try to fully acquire Human Head Studios. Ultimately, Arkane began working on a reboot of the game that would become 2017’s very different sci-fi immersive sim <em>Prey</em>. This is where the <a href="https://kotaku.com/leaked-e-mails-suggest-bethesda-misled-gamers-about-pre-1149092622">term of endearment “press sneak fuck” was born</a>.</p>

 <p>Now fresh footage of the original <em>Prey 2</em> has leaked on YouTube under the account “David Halsted.” There are five videos totaling just over 20 minutes of gameplay showing off different features as well as the E3 demo. “I remember when they revealed this at PAX back in the day,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n6zcc8/prey_2_development_videos_leaked/?share_id=GehdxVGPPqJefxwNWn5Ci&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">wrote one fan on Reddit</a>. “The whole con was buzzing about how cool it was and how hype we were for it. And then we got whatever it rebooted as. Dream revival game though.”</p> <h2><em>Borderlands</em> devs reflect on its “insane” art style overhaul</h2> <p>Gearbox’s loot shooter series is known for its <em>Diablo</em>-style loot, rude attitude, and bubblegum wrapper cel-shaded art style. But it was not always thus. Early in development, the first game in the shooter series looked like a broke knock-off of <em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>Rage</em>. That’s how it appeared in a <a href="https://kotaku.com/that-time-team-fortress-2-and-borderlands-changed-art-s-1749106652">demo at E3,</a> and on the cover of a 2007 <em>Game Informer</em> containing a deep dive on the game back before anyone had ever even heard of Claptrap.</p>

 <p>The magazine is back <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/01/the-behind-the-scenes-story-of-the-art-style-swap-that-saved-borderlands-1">with a new series of interviews</a> about Gearbox’s race to overhaul the grim, gritty, and dull look of the game to help it stand out and eventually become the mega-hit it is today. Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford gave members of the art team permission to look into overhauling the art style, even as milestone deadlines were breathing down their necks:</p> <blockquote><p>It was, like, five guys with two weeks to go mess around with the look and the feel, and I immediately knew I made a mistake. I was like, ‘S—. We’re trying to get to Alpha, dude. There’s a business here. I’m responsible for other people’s money. I’m going to let these guys spin for two weeks, which means they’re going to be even more invested in what they’re doing, and then I have to go in and look at what they did, and I have to shoot it in the head. That’s what’s going to happen here. Son of a b—-. I’m an idiot. Why did I do that?’ But there was something in my heart that knew that we had to at least look at and explore. I knew we weren’t right.</p></blockquote> <h2>There’s another <em>28 Years Later</em> movie coming in just a few months called<em> The Bone Temple</em></h2> <p>Ralph Fiennes got so ripped fo<em>r 28 Years Later</em> that they made him the star of the sequel just 12 months later. <em>The Bone Temple</em> will briefly have Cillian Murphy return as Jim from the original movie as well. He’ll have a much bigger role in a trilogy-capping third movie arriving after <em>The Bone Temple</em>.</p>

  <h2><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> director can neither confirm nor deny the existence of a Switch 2 port</h2> <p>The turn-based GOTY contender seems like a perfect fit for Nintendo’s new handheld hybrid. Will it get there sooner or later? Sandfall Interactive isn’t saying. “We have some possibilities that we will explore, but at the moment we cannot confirm anything,” the studio <a href="https://www.nintenderos.com/nintendo-switch-2/sandfall-interactive-esta-explorando-lanzar-clair-obscur-expedition-33-en-nintendo-switch-2/">told <em>Nintenderos</em></a>. That sounds like a studio who promised not to disclose that they have a Switch 2 dev kit.</p> <h2><em>Stellar Blade 2</em> is fully in development</h2> <p>That’s according to <a href="https://x.com/genki_jpn/status/1963102317886283809">developer ShiftUp’s latest financial report</a>. “We are actively pursuing the franchise development of the ‘Stellar Blade’ IP and are currently developing a sequel to ‘Stellar Blade.'” The game is supposed to have a bigger world and some additional action mechanics. In the meantime, the first game is another candidate ripe for porting to Switch 2.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367">Fighting game pros are confronting Saudi Arabia’s new co-ownership of Evo</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-corvette-steam-players-2000622428"><em>No Man’s Sky</em>‘s Voyager update is leading players and the game’s Steam records to new heights</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381">A look at&nbsp; <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em>‘ cultural takeover</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movies-tone-is-more-in-line-with-re4-says-director/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-movie%E2%80%99s-tone-is-more-in-line-with-re4-says-director.1287633/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Resident Evil Movie’s director has stated that it “adheres more to the tone” of RE4. </p>



<p>We have yet to see an official trailer for the upcoming Resident Evil Movie, but new information about the adaptation seems to emerge periodically. Last time, we learned the movie’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie-leak-reveals-link-to-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">link to the game series</a>. Now, the director has revealed that the upcoming RE movie will be aligned with the tone of RE4. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-movie-is-much-bigger-in-scale-than-the-director-s-previous-movies">Resident Evil Movie is Much Bigger in Scale than the Director’s Previous Movies</h2>



<p>Resident Evil Movie’s director, Zach Creggor, was recently interviewed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnKTQ2Xenbs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Double Toasted</a> (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/resident-evil-2026-movie-zach-cregger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>) and was asked questions about the adaptation. When discussing the approach, Cregger explained that the upcoming movie is “true to the experience of the games.” The journey the audience would have as a viewer in this movie is similar to a player of these games, where we follow “one protagonist from point A to point B as they just descend deeper and deeper and deeper into Hell.”</p>



<p>Cregger elaborates that he has played “thousands and thousands of hours of Resident Evil,” which has made him well-versed with the franchise’s pacing. He understands that it is “inherently cinematic” and is “really pumped” about the story they are building in this world. The Resident Evil movie features an original story and is very much in line with Cregger’s sensibility and his “sense of tone”. Moreover, “it is just a much bigger scale than Weapons and certainly Barbarian”. </p>



<p>Cregger adds that fans of the Resident Evil movie franchise might not be prepared for what he has planned, but fans of the games “are probably going to be stoked.” </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-movie-s-tone-and-inspiration-from-games">Resident Evil Movie’s Tone and Inspiration From Games</h2>



<p>The upcoming Resident Evil movie is more closely tied to the world of the games, the director states. Cregger explains that the upcoming Resident Evil movie probably “lives more” in the world of RE2 and RE3, but it “adheres more to the tone” of RE4. He explains that the game franchise has always been malleable, with every new game featuring different settings and tones. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-movie-is-being-shot-in-prague-and-shooting-begins-mid-october">Resident Evil Movie is Being Shot in Prague, and Shooting Begins Mid-October</h2>



<p>Zach Cregger has revealed that shooting for the Resident Evil Movie begins in mid-October and is expected to wrap up by January 2026. The movie is being shot in Prague, and when asked why that location, the director explained that it has a rebate that allows them to make this movie with the budget they have. Moreover, it has a talented crew, great stages, and a lot of resources; “it is the right place for it”. </p>



<p>In other news, the director of the Resident Evil movie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie-director-wont-focus-on-lore-people-are-going-to-come-for-me-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not be “completely obedient</a>” with the series’ lore. Additionally, the upcoming adaptation will feel “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-resident-evil-movie-fresh-edgy-weird/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh, edgy, and weird</a>“. What are your thoughts on the Resident Evil movie following the tone of RE4?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fresh from serving up a smalltown, psychological scare-a-thon in the form of 2024’s superb <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2</a> remake, developer Bloober Team has since focussed its energy on birthing a snarling, spiritual successor to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-space-2008">Dead Space</a> series in the form of Cronos: The New Dawn. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2</a> is a tough act to follow, though, so even though Cronos is a respectable creep show it’s hard not to be a little disappointed it didn’t knock my socks off in the same way. This survival-horror shooter takes place amidst the ruined, futuristic hellscape of a plague-riddled Polish city, a fascinating and foreboding expanse to set its slaughter in, but its fairly uninspired combat doesn’t do enough to distinguish itself from the necromorph-dismembering series it clearly draws so much inspiration from. Cronos still manages to deliver a solid slab of spooky mutant-slaying action, but a new dawn for survival horror it most certainly is not.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cronos: The New Dawn - Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We step into the space suit of the Traveler, an investigator searching the desolate ruins of the city of New Dawn after her comrade goes missing. It quickly becomes clear that almost every remaining local – aside from the curious abundance of friendly stray cats – is a hostile mutant out for blood rather than conversation. Thankfully, the Traveler has an interesting trick up her sleeve: the ability to temporarily travel back through rifts in time in order to harvest the essence of New Dawn residents before they succumbed to the plague and interrogate them for clues about the fate of her fellow Traveler. It proves to be a compelling mystery presented in a fairly novel way, one that seems to take as much inspiration from Netflix’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/dark">Dark</a> as it does <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alone-in-the-dark-1992">Alone in the Dark</a>.      </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Traveler herself is a bit like a slightly more murderous <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-the-mandalorian">Mandalorian</a>: she’s short on words, never takes off her helmet, and signs off on each communication with the same solemn mantra – in this instance, “Such is our calling” in place of “This is the way.” However, despite her initial lack of personality I found myself growing more and more interested in her plight, since each essence she harvests seems to have adverse effects on her mental state. This manifests in an increasingly unsettling state of psychosis (not unlike that suffered by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-space-2008">Dead Space’s</a> Isaac Clarke) that injects nightmarish hallucinations into the already-volatile world around her.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although many of Cronos’ haunted houses are straight out of the survival-horror playbook, from decaying apartment blocks to the obligatory menacing hospital, each area feels distinct and dreamlike thanks to hauntingly fractured architecture that seems trapped in some sort of limbo between time and space. However, connecting these interesting major areas is a noticeable amount of padding that adds unnecessary bloat to its 14-hour runtime. Even the Traveler herself gave voice to my exasperation the second time I had to put story progress on hold for upwards of an hour in order to gradually bring a trainline power generator back online, and I lost count of the times I had to slowly inch my way through boil-covered corridors of biomass that felt like squeezing through Satan’s lower intestines. It certainly looks and sounds revolting, but it’s the sort of thing that becomes mundane pretty quickly, and the tortured torsos waiting in the walls to ambush you in these areas only grow easier to anticipate over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, although Cronos’ atmosphere is consistently moody and sinister, it never quite intensifies into the full-on frightfests that developer Bloober Team itself so expertly conjured up in last year’s Silent Hill 2 remake. Sure, there are plenty of cheap jump scares from monsters crashing through walls like they’re the <em>Ghoul</em>-Aid Man, but nothing terrifying enough to compel me to nervously turn on an extra light and check the shadows behind my couch midway through each play session. That said, there is some creepy environmental storytelling to be found here, from bloodstained interrogation rooms to hallways lined with the severed limbs and scattered shields of riot police. In tandem with the many interesting notes and audio recordings that give welcome context to how its society crumbled, Cronos consistently presents an intriguing world that feels at once both lived in and plagued by death.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fighting Orphan Power Ragers</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Cronos’ bloodsmeared hallways might look like they were decorated by a butcher, but the monsters stalking within them have clearly been inspired by a carpenter. Specifically, John Carpenter. The iconic horror director’s influence has reared its disturbingly ugly head in a survival-horror adventure once again, and Cronos is filled to the pus-oozing gills with twisted freaks that look like wax figures that have been left out in the sun too long. These mutated humans – known as “orphans” – come in a handful of forms, from stretched-out fiends with whipping tentacles for arms to towering, tank-like toughs that absorb multiple shotgun blasts before they drop, to the spider-like messes of body parts that scurry erratically along walls and ceilings, making it a challenge to keep them in your ironsights. Later, almost every enemy type is reintroduced in acid-spitting forms, putting greater emphasis on the importance of staying mobile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your main weapon to dispatch them with is a fairly rudimentary yet reliable pistol that can fire either standard shots or charged-up blasts, should you opt to deal extra damage on delay at the risk of leaving yourself open to a lunging attack. Extra ammunition can be crafted on the fly using chemicals and scrap scoured from the environment, but there’s clearly some intelligent balancing going on behind the scenes to only ever present just the right amount of resources to make you feel like you’ve barely got enough to survive rather than ever having the luxury of a surplus. That kept my paranoia levels at a consistent peak and meant that I stayed switched on as I entered each new hallway of horrors.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Cronos is filled to the pus-oozing gills with twisted freaks that look like wax figures that have been left out in the sun too long.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the course of the journey gun mods can be found, both as part of the main story’s path and also by sniffing out secrets behind locked doors, but for the most part these are fairly subtle variations on the same pistol, shotgun, and assault rifle types. One shotgun variant can fire high-powered charged-up blasts, while the double-barreled version can fire two blasts in quick succession, for example. It doesn’t seem to make a drastic difference one way or the other in terms of power, so it’s more a matter of letting you fight how you want to rather than upgrading from one to the next. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I did manage to get my hands on a high-powered railgun of sorts, but I mostly kept it locked up in the safe house storage chest because I could never make enough room in my inventory to be able to carry it. Speaking of which, it strikes me as odd that despite the fact the Traveler’s gun appears to shapeshift between weapon types while held in her hand, not unlike the all-in-one firearm found in Remedy’s Control, each gun variant takes up its own individual slot in her heavily restricted inventory space. How does that make sense? It would be like using an entire cutlery drawer to hold a single Swiss Army Knife.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At any rate, the bigger problem here is that because Cronos wears its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-space-2008">Dead Space</a> influence so plainly on its sleeve – from the messages written in blood on the walls, to the Isaac Clarke-style fashion the Traveler stomps through item crates, to the zero-gravity stretches that have you zipping between drifting chunks of terra firma – it practically begs for comparisons to that seminal survival-horror classic (and its excellent 2023 remake). Unfortunately, going toe to toe it comes up shorter than a zombie after a shotgun round to the head. Where the combat in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-space-2008">Dead Space</a> is wonderfully dynamic, enhancing the already-flexible gunplay with stasis powers to slow the charge of fast-moving monsters and telekinesis to turn their own detachable limbs into projectiles, Cronos is disappointingly one-note by comparison. You can shoot the legs out of certain enemy types to trip them up if you want, but generally your best option is almost always to aim for the head or a conveniently placed explosive barrel. It never really inspires much more improvisation or creative killing than that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no telekinesis, but there is the ability to target orb-like “oddities” found in the world and reverse their trajectories through space and time, introducing some light environmental puzzle solving in between enemy encounters that challenge you to rewind collapsed bridges and tunnels to clear the path forward. But this time-manipulating ability sadly has no application for elevating the fairly stock-standard combat, aside from occasionally allowing you to rebuild explosive barrels for repeat blasts during boss fights. It would have been interesting if you could perhaps reassemble one of the suicide-bombing acid monsters and set them as some sort of time bomb to trip up other attackers, or rewind one of the rushing ghouls back a few steps to buy yourself the breathing space to chamber your next shotgun round, but sadly you can’t do anything of the sort.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, Cronos’ main combat idea is that some of its enemies will attempt to absorb the power of any corpses found in their vicinity, evolving them into stronger mutations that deal greater damage and withstand more of your limited ammunition should you fail to disrupt them in the process. This again, is not too far removed from the Infector necromorphs in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-space-2008">Dead Space</a> that reanimated human corpses if you didn’t kill them quick enough, and although it did create some added urgency to prioritise specific foes anytime the telltale swirl of corpse-sapping tentacles sprouted out of them, it never really made a huge difference to my general approach to each encounter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Initially, Cronos encourages you to use single-use flamethrower bursts to burn any carcasses you come across lest they become energy-dispensing ATMs for the other orphans still standing, but I typically used the scrap parts required to craft flamethrower rounds for shotgun shells instead and never really ran into any major hurdles as a result. (The post-game stats screen indicates that I allowed just 20 enemies to merge with fallen foes, which is a pretty small percentage of the sizable number of disfigured demons I dispatched over the course of the campaign.)</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Cronos is capable of creating survival horror at its stressful best, at least in short bursts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However, I did enjoy Cronos’ half a dozen or so boss fights. Although in practise they rarely require much more strategic complexity than to shoot the standard three glowing weak spots, they’re each nonetheless intimidating in size and the arenas you face them in are intensely claustrophobic, from the swirling mass of blackened tendrils that assembles into a towering golem to stalk you through a ruptured apartment, to the disgusting conjoined twins that crash through the walls of the steelworks’ basement. Each climactic clash had me desperately scrambling for ammo and panicking over each pistol shot, sometimes just barely making it through with my heart monitor redlining and only a couple of rounds left in the chamber. The handful of moments like these prove that Cronos is capable of creating survival horror at its stressful best, at least in short bursts.     </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Harvester of Sorrow</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from the corpse-merging mechanic mentioned earlier, the only other notable point of difference that Cronos’ combat presents is the essence system. As the Traveler harvests the essence of specific story characters and other fallen comrades you find along the way, they each give you an attribute buff, like increasing the damage you deal to enemies that are on fire, or reducing the amount of resources required to craft ammo and medkits. In a system reminiscent of the equipable status effects typically found in roguelikes such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a>, you can only have three of these essences active at once, and you can only add a new one by sacrificing one of your existing buffs – once it’s gone, it’s gone for good. That presented me with some interesting choices to shape my character with, even though it wasn’t always totally clear how much benefit I was getting. In one extreme case, the description of an essence was just a random string of numbers and letters like a suggested password from Google Chrome – I equipped it out of curiosity, but I have no idea what effect it had or indeed if it had any effect at all.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tristan's Favourite Horror Games</h3><p>Intensity in ten entries.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere there are a few too many unwanted nasties that creep into the campaign on PlayStation 5, and I'm not talking about the tortured ghouls with second jaws for necks that stalk you at every turn. Oftentimes I’d have to stomp an item crate repeatedly before my hits would register, which became annoying particularly during the many horde mode-style arena fights when enemies were swarming from all angles. At other times I’d waste precious pistol rounds because the gas canister or explosive barrel just failed to rupture at first shot, which is not ideal when ammunition is at such a premium. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most egregious, though, were the handful of times that the Traveler would get stuck on scenery. At one point, after surviving a particularly brutish late-game boss, I was heading back to save my game at the nearest safehouse when I got trapped in a room full of infinitely respawning acid bombers because the Traveler just straight-up refused to walk through a wide-open exit. That forced me to reload my save and fight that same boss all over again, which was more deflating than a punctured spacesuit. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/cronos-the-new-dawn-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/forsaken">Forsaken 64</a> is the surprise next N64 game coming to the Nintendo 64 – Nintendo Classics: Mature app for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack members.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some N64 games on Switch and Switch 2 via the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription are only available via the separate Mature app. The list includes Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, Shadow Man and Perfect Dark. Now, add Forsaken 64, which launches September 4, to the list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Forsaken 64 launched in 1998 courtesy of developer Iguana UK, which handled the port, and publisher Acclaim. It’s a 3D first-person shooter similar to 1995’s influential Descent, with a whiff of Quake. You navigate through a series of tunnels while blasting enemies in a sci-fi setting.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb from Nintendo:</p><blockquote>You are a ruthless mercenary, sent to the condemned remains of Earth as part of a covert operation codenamed "Forsaken." Your mission is to infiltrate and destroy the last bastions of the mechanized terror that wiped out all life on the planet. Earth is a death trap riddled with merciless mechanoid adversaries and gangs of rival bounty hunters, and you'll have to brave them all astride your anti-grav pioncycle to make your fortune...or meet your doom. Choose between different modes in this first-person shooter title released for the Nintendo 64 system in 1998, and enter the fight in Single Player Mode or Multi-Player Mode. Then, select your bike. Each bike has different attributes, each biker a different attitude. Pick one that suits your style, then dive into your mission. The availability of weapons, enemies, and powerups changes depending on the level you play, so stay sharp!</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Forsaken 64 is infamous for its U.S. box art, which leaned on the game’s Mature rating by showing a random woman’s face with a solitary tear and tattooed cheek. The woman did not appear in the game, with some fans accusing the image of being misleading. The PAL box art, on the other hand, simply displayed the Forsaken 64 logo on an image of Earth.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/screenshot-2025-09-03-130611-1756901207271.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Remember the Forsaken 64 box art?</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Every now and then <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/n64/comments/1hofdjr/what_is_everyones_favorite_n64_box_art_and_why_is/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forsaken 64’s box art comes up in online conversation around the N64 console</a>, with some fondly remembering how out of place it looked. “Without any previous knowledge or looking at screenshots, would you be able to guess Forsaken 64’s genre based on the boxart alone?” asked redditor Drowsy_Drowzee in a post eight months ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I remember picking up Forsaken 64 as a loose cart back in the early 2000s and thinking it would be a cool horror/survival horror based on the name, cover art, and age rating. To my surprise, it was a vehicular action game.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Top 10 N64 Games of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Forsaken irritated me as a kid,” added InfiniteRespond4064. “I rented it not knowing what it was and found the gameplay really obtuse and boring.

<p>"You can take a certain amount of decisions based on that, but at the same time, you don't want to make too many concessions," Andersson said. "It needs to be a great game for the player who plays all the way through. That's the most important part for us, being the story-centric studio as we are."</p><p>Overall, Andersson described this as "a hard balance" to strike for The Great Circle. "You always know that you should worry about that more, but at the same time, you care about the grand scheme of things," he said.</p><p>The Great Circle launched in December 2024 for Xbox Series X|S and PC before coming to PS5 in April 2025. A Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game is coming in 2026, but a release date has not been announced.</p><p>Next up for The Great Circle is the game's new expansion, Order of Giants, which launches on September 4.

                <p>If you're at the intersection of ultra-wide monitor users and fans of Hollow Knight, then you're in luck. On the eve of the long-awaited (hard emphasis on "long") release of Hollow Knight: Silksong, the game's marketing lead confirmed that the metroidvania will support 21:9 displays, giving players another option on how to view its gorgeous 2D art.</p><p>Matthew Griffin, the marketing and publishing lead for Silksong, shared four screenshots from the game's PC version in ultrawide format, each showcasing a different biome from the setting of Pharloom. The original Hollow Knight, released in 2017, lacked official 21:9 support.</p><p>Including ultrawide support in a video game is easier said than done--it's a complete change in the game's field of view and resolution. A sidescrolling game like Hollow Knight: Silksong has to take into account the extra view space an ultrawide screen provides that a 16:9 screen won't have, and the developers at Team Cherry would have had to design around it.</p><p>Silksong is launching for all modern platforms, but as ultrawide monitor support is a PC-only feature, it may be the deciding factor for players who own multiple platforms. In the lead-up to the game's launch, Team Cherry shared <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight/posts/4473863" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">details about the Nintendo Switch release</a>, confirming that Switch 1 owners can upgrade to the Switch 2 version for free.</p><p>No matter where you play Hollow Knight: Silksong, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksongs-price-is-cheaper-than-you-might-have-guessed/1100-6534401/" data-ref-id="1100-6534401">it'll be relatively cheap</a>, only going for $20. Xbox owners who subscribe to Game Pass can also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-on-xbox-game-pass/1100-6534209/" data-ref-id="1100-6534209">play Silksong on day one</a> at no additional cost.</p><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong releases on September 4, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-reviews-probably-arent-going-to-be-ready-for-launch/1100-6534191/" data-ref-id="1100-6534191">don't expect any advance reviews</a> to come out on launch day. But after the infamously long wait for the game, you probably already know whether or not you'll buy it--the question is which platform you'll play it on.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's only<a href="https://aftermath.site/9-kings-pc-roguelike-deckbuilder-impressions-pc-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> been a few months since I wrote about the excellent <em>9 Kings</em></a>, a roguelike 'Kingdom Sim' that had you juggling base-building with tower defence. Now I am here to write about another member of the same deeply-specific genre that is also excellent: <em>The King Is Watching</em>.</p><p>The deal here is very similar! You pick a King and make "runs" through the game, unlocking more stuff every time so that your subsequent runs are easier/more interesting. You have to juggle one side of your screen being about building placement, adjacency bonuses and the gathering of resources, while the other has bad guys constantly turning up to try to kill you. It even has a very cool pixel art thing going on.</p><p>But within the confines of that deeply-specific genre, these games are pretty different! Where <em>9 Kings</em> was a very quickfire experience,<em> The King Is Watching</em> is a deeper, more sedate strategy game, with a much wider variety of buildings to choose from, way more resources to gather (and juggle) and more things you can research and trade.</p><figure></figure><p>I'm not saying this to compare them quantitatively (oh, this one has <em>more</em>, so it's <em>better</em>), but to say that the elegance with which <em>The King Is Watching</em> ties everything into its central mechanic–only the limited number of buildings that you're "watching" will generate resources, basically an Eye Of Sauron for a labour force–works a treat. Were this just a resource-gathering x tower defence game on its own, with its pleasant visuals and variety of stuff on offer, I'd probably have had a good time! But having to juggle all that <em>and </em>make sure my buildings are placed in such a way that I can watch certain types at certain times, making sure my "gaze" is powerful enough that it can oversee six buildings instead of three at a time, turns this into my favourite type of chin-scratcher.</p><p>There's no wrong way to play this! But I can't find a right way either. Every game has this wonderful tension to it, where I always feel like I'm doing well enough to survive, but never like I've <em>perfected </em>my build, a constant pull between doing well enough to progress but always feeling like I could do, and learn, <em>more</em>.</p><p>Which is the whole point of a game like this in a genre like this, so...well done, <em>The King Is Watching</em>, you absolutely nailed the brief.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bet-kakegurui-netflix-live-action-anime"><h3>I Unironically Like Netflix’s Live-Action Kakegurui TV Series</h3></a><p>Bet is a fun watch when you don’t have sweaty anime fans breathing down your neck

But its announcement also may have confirmed a major leak for the service — a line-up of games coming to the N64 app (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendos-latest-switch-online-news-couldve-just-confirmed-a-major-leak/">VGC</a>).</p>

<p>Forsaken's arrival on the Mature app seems to have all-but-confirmed that the other titles spotted above are also coming. You can see the blurred boxes <a href="https://youtu.be/wDNg1pwrTVg?si=A4xAoMBhc0OHgzGx&amp;t=41">at around 0:41</a>.</p>

<p>If true, that's a pretty solid list of games — and given <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>'s release in July, many have been clamouring for DK's other 3D platformer to make its way to the service.</p>
<p>Crucially, of course, nothing is confirmed until Nintendo itself makes the announcement, and we have no idea when we'll actually get these games, <em>if</em> the blurred-out image is to be believed. We'll just have to wait and see...</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can check out Forsaken from tomorrow if you have the Expansion Pack.</p>
<p><em>Do you hope to see DK64, Smash, Glover, and Rayman 2 on NSO soon? Do you see the games in the blurred image? Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Silent Hill F will be a great showcase of what Unreal Engine 5 can deliver with proper work in terms of image quality and performance, judging from some early impressions.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> revealed that the PC and PlayStation 5 build available during Gamescom last month behind closed doors did an excellent job showing how the engine by Epic is fully capable of delivering clean image quality and stable performance with no stuttering. The game's performance, in particular, sounds impressive for a game powered by the engine, as it ran at stable 60 FPS on base PlayStation and PC, though not at native 4K resolution, with 30 FPS-locked cutscene that still managed to look great thanks to a very good usage of motion blur. Better yet, none of the obnoxiuous stuttering issues too often seen in Unreal Engine 5-powered games were present, which definitely sounds promising. The game looked so clean, without the typical temporal noise seen in other games, and ran so well that it was almost difficult to tell it is powered by Unreal Engine 5, according to Digital Foundry, although a more in-depth look revealed the use of software Lumen which delivers great lighting in the vast majority of scenarios.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's definitely great to hear how Silent Hill F will deliver on the technical front, as it is the first brand new entry in the series to be released as part of Konami's revival of the franchise. It is also set to be among the most unique entry in the series to date, featuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-gamescom-onl-2025-trailer/">combat mechanics</a> like dodging and a stamina bar which many thought were influenced by FromSoftware's Souls series. This, however, isn't exactly the case, <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-producer-game-is-not-a-soulslike/">according to producer Motoi Okamoto</a>, as similar mechanics not only were featured in past entries in the series in some form, but they also aren't exclusive to the soulslike genre.</p>



<p>Silent Hill F creeps worldwide on PC and PlayStation 5 on September 25.</p>

            <p>A company backed by the Saudi Arabian government's Public Investment Fund have become the co-owner of the Evolution Championship Series (Evo) fighting game tournament.</p>
<p>Following Sony's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-sells-ownership-stake-in-evo-to-nodwin-gaming">sale of their stake in Evo</a>, with India-based esports company Nodwin gaming buying it up, the event's co-owners have been Nodwin and talent management company RTS.

He added: "Most importantly, this will enable Qiddiya to keep fueling the continued growth of Evolution Championship Series (EVO), the world’s largest fighting game event since 1996, with unlimited potentials."</p>
<p>As with the array of other games industry-related <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/saudi-arabia-increases-stake-in-electronic-arts">investments</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/snk-saudi-arabias-96-ownership-doesnt-affect-us-in-any-way">acquisitions</a> Saudi PIF and Saudi government-backed firms like <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/what-is-savvy-games-group-and-how-is-it-trying-to-change-saudi-arabias-image">Savvy Games Group</a> have made in recent years, the word of the day is sportswashing. The country's been accused of using videogame investments like these and the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/gaming-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia-call-of-duty-ronaldo-b2786237.html">Esports World Cup</a> - as well as paying to host the likes of the 2034 World Cup, WWE events, and the LIV Golf series - as part of efforts to turn around its terrible international reputation.</p><p>A bad reputation Saudi Arabia and bin Salman's regime have earned through an abysmal <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/">human rights record</a> including <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/05/17/lgbtq-death-penalty-idahobit/">state-sanctioned homophobia</a>, the murder of journalist <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45812399">Jamal Kashoggi</a>, and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2023/08/21/they-fired-us-rain/saudi-arabian-mass-killings-ethiopian-migrants-yemen-saudi">mass killings of migrants</a> at the country's border with Yemen. Invest in things people in other countries already like or follow, and maybe all of that gets buried a bit in the collective consciousness - or so appears to be the goal.</p>
<p>It's not surprising then, that when you visit <a href="https://qiddiya.com/">Qiddiya's website</a>, the first thing you see is big splash about the freshly-built Qiddiya City golf course. "This is the stage on which the Kingdom showcases its rich culture and traditions to the world and the bridge that connects us to the wonderful things the rest of the world has to offer," reads the self-described "PIF company and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/12/04/die-first-and-ill-pay-you-later/saudi-arabias-giga-projects-built-widespread">giga project</a>"'s blurb on culture.</p>
<p>We'll have to see what immediate effects, if any, this ownership change has on Evo. However, as my former VG247 news running mate Connor Makar notes at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fighting-game-players-in-uproar-after-evos-new-saudi-government-owners-calls-to-support-grassroots-events">Eurogamer</a>, several prominent members of the Evo/fighting game community have already shared their disapproval or begun looking towards alternative events.</p>
<p>"Not terribly surprising, but still unfortunate news," <a href="https://x.com/ChrisCCH_/status/1963035397988221121">wrote</a> professional Street Fighter player ChrisCCH. "Sad for the LGBTQ+ members of the community, and also worried about the scene becoming increasingly funded by money that will disappear as soon as the funders get bored."</p>

              <p>Laptops are miracles of productivity, but they’re limited to just one screen of workspace. Even the big boys with their ultra-sharp 17-inch displays are, well, just one 17-inch display for all of those windows you multitasking mavens want to have open at one time. Reaching the full potential of your laptop or even your tablet requires an extra screen, or maybe even two, and the <strong>Anker USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter </strong>is the perfect tool to make that happen. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3881/">Even better, it’s just $25 right now in a limited-time Amazon deal</a>.</p>
<p>The Anker USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter requires no extra software or drivers, just plug-and-play with any compatible laptop or tablet with an USB-C port. Windows laptops can be extended to two additional 4K monitors either in mirror mode, with all three screens showing the same image, or extended desktop mode with A-B-B or A-B-C configuration. MacOS laptops can extend to two additional 4K monitors in mirror mode or A-B-B extended desktop mode. Smartphones with a USB-C port can also be connected to a dual-HDMI display.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3881/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Huge Configuration Potential</h2>
<p>While the Anker USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter can definitely be thought of as an ideal laptop-to-external monitor device, its capabilities don’t end there. On the USB-C source side of the adapter, compatible tablets and smartphones are also just a plug-and-play connection away from being mirrored onto a much-larger screen. That screen isn’t just limited to HDMI-compatible external monitors, either. TVs and projectors with an HDMI input port are also accessible to your USB-C devices, and without the need for a driver or app.</p>
<p>The potential use for these connections is nearly limitless. The productivity boost of going from one small screen to one small screen and two large 4K screens is obvious. But now instead of having to pass your smartphone or tablet from person to person to show off those pictures and videos you shot on vacation, you can connect your compatible USB-C device to an external monitor, big-screen TV, or projector and put on a show.</p>



<h2>Pocket-Sized Power</h2>
<p>We’ve seen hubs and ports that, while powerful and versatile, are large and/or requiring their own source of AC power. The Anker USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter is anything but bulky. It’s 2 inches by 2.5 inches in size — smaller than a credit card — and just under a half-inch thick. The adapter’s weight is negligible at 1.7 ounces, so you can stick it on your pocket or laptop bag and bring it out anywhere there’s a HDMI-compatible display at the ready.</p>
<p>The Anker name that’s so trusted for charging devices is also a sign of quality for this multi-device adapter. Anker covers the USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter with a worry-free 18-month warranty should anything go wrong. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3881/">Amazon’s limited-time deal makes this a $25 accessory that guarantees you’ll never look at working on one small screen the same way again.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/reaper-actual-blockchain-developer-why-interview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/reaper-actual-has-blockchain-features-and-i-spoke-to-the-developer-to-figure-out-why%E2%80%94interview.1287585/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Reaper Actual is an upcoming open-world first-person shooter with persistence. It will one day accommodate hundreds of players on a single server, boast a breathing ecosystem featuring the evolution of time, weather, and factions, and it’s going to be free to play. If that doesn’t sound good enough, consider that it’s designed to be accessible, no matter your skill level.</p>



<p>Well, the first impressions of Reaper Actual are often derailed slightly when prospective fans learn that the game has blockchain and NFT elements built into it. This was a huge concern for me, but since talking to the team at Distinct Possibility Studios at Gamescom, I caught up with them once again to dispel any worries about the NFT mechanics in Reaper Actual.</p>



<p>I’m happy to say that, once I learned how it all works, I’m satisfied it’s not going to be a problem.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview, if you’d rather see it that way:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Reaper Actual's PvPvE(vE) World Explored with Matt Higby - Developer Spotlight" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f-vRol-pTgk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-getting-into-the-blockchain-with-reaper-actual">Getting Into the Blockchain with Reaper Actual</h2>



<p>Reaper Actual takes elements from open-world shooters, arcade games like Call of Duty, and extraction shooters like Escape from Tarkov. It’s from developers that formerly worked on the likes of PlanetSide and H1Z1, and it’s being designed as an open-ended and ever-evolving game with a rolling meta and customization features out the wazoo.</p>



<p>It’s surprising to some to learn that Reaper Actual also has elements that place the game on the blockchain. I don’t <strong>fully </strong>understand that world, but I know enough to appreciate that, for some gamers, that’s a <strong>huge </strong>red flag.</p>



<p>I sat down with Distinct Possibility Studios co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, Matthew Higby, to learn how these NFT mechanics work in Reaper Actual.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The things that you’ll be able to buy, sell… Bases are a good example. You’ll be able to buy a base which will be a unique unit at an address in the game world. You can think of that like an elevator in a high-rise building or the entrance to a bunker facility — multiple people can have bases within that same location, but each one is like a unique fingerprint.</p>



<p>Not only is it unique in terms of what the base by default is, but it also contains all of the upgrades that you do to it as a player over time.</p>



<p>If you levelled up your base to be able to make really good sniper rifles and that represents some number of hours and some number of credits and investments to level your base up, if you decided to sell that base, you could just rip out all those upgrades if you wanted to and get your credits back, but you could just package up the base with the upgrades you’ve installed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Higby’s words, it’s ‘an increase to ownership’ in Reaper Actual, giving players a kind of <strong>financial control </strong>over their bases that they invest time and effort in to build up. While we discussed <strong>bases</strong>, I also learned that <strong>Reapers</strong>, the game’s character models, will be available to list as NFTs after being upgraded and evolved by players.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Another thing you’ll be able to mint and sell are Reapers. As I mentioned, they’re permutationally unique characters that exist within the game. They have a combination of things that can make them situationally attractive for different roles and missions.</p>



<p>Between all of this and their biography, their name, their look, they have a pretty unique combination of things, and it’s just a very easy way to convey that, to allow people to trade those things. It’s with the functionality that you get with an NFT, where it’s just all contained in one cryptographic asset.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-but-are-nfts-optional-in-reaper-actual">But Are NFTs Optional in Reaper Actual?</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>As I dove down the rabbit hole with Matt, I learned how <strong>practical </strong>the blockchain mechanics are in Reaper Actual. Players can spend hours building up a base to then sell it to someone who would rather purchase one ready-made than grind themselves to get it. It’s a real estate market in that respect.</p>



<p>Matt explained further:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It makes it feel like it’s something that’s yours, and that’s how we’re trying to lean into NFTs. One of the things that they get maligned on, and people have opinions on all sides of the map about this stuff, is that they tend to be viewed only as this speculative vehicle and the reason they’re in the game is because people want to be doing money stuff with them, or whatever.</p>



<p>In reality, a lot of these mechanics can be utility-granting and utility-oriented, right?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Practical is one thing, but what about optional? Not everyone enjoys the concept of NFTs, and in the gaming world, the term has long been seen as the boogeyman. I asked Matt if you could play Reaper Actual just fine without investing in the blockchain side of things.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Totally, yeah. We’re going to be running the game on Steam, we’re going to be running on Epic, and those environments, it’s going to be completely devoid of the Web3 mechanics. All of the functionality is going to be exactly the same.</p>



<p>There will still be permutationally unique Reapers, you’ll still be able to upgrade and sell your house, you’ll just be using it with a different kind of currency.</p>



<p>What I hope that we can do is show that these blockchain mechanics can be a force for good and not just for greed, and that there’s actually a sort of value that gets unlocked by using them. One thing that is guaranteed to be true about this game is that it’s unlike any other game you’ve played before.</p>



<p>If people really like the feeling of playing one of these peristent world games, then maybe they’ll decide to take the extra step and go try it on the Web3 service if they feel like it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team at Distinct Possibility Studios wants to offer the NFT mechanics to those who want them, but it’s not at all critical to the overarching game <strong>experience</strong>.</p>



<p>Everything else that I learned in my deep dive with Matt Higby was more than enough to fill me with serious interest in Reaper Actual, and with an intended release window of Q1 2026, it’s only a matter of time before we can all dive in.</p>



<p>Do you think Reaper Actual is your kind of game? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to spend more on the new James Bond game from the makers of Hitman, you'll apparently be able to. Another Amazon listing reveals a collector's edition that costs $300. There is no word on what may be in the collector's edition to justify the price tag, but the description says the package weighs six pounds. Listings for the $300 edition were discovered for all platforms except Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>Industry experts believe people are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">ready and willing to pay $80 or more for new games</a>, and that it's just a matter of time before higher price points for games become normalized. For now, though, many companies are sticking with $70 for new games (and also offering more expensive premium editions and selling lots of DLC and microtransactions at the same time). </p><p>Mario Kart World was the first major game to jump up to $80, though it is also available within a $500 Switch 2 bundle. Microsoft planned to charge $80 for games this year, beginning with The Outer Worlds 2, but later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374">scuttled those plans.</a> For its part, EA has said it has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/with-battlefield-6-coming-ea-reiterates-that-it-has-no-plans-to-charge-80-for-games/1100-6533540/" data-ref-id="1100-6533540">no plans to charge $80 for games</a>, while Rockstar owner <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-addresses-rumored-price-hike-for-grand-theft-auto-6/1100-6533788/" data-ref-id="1100-6533788">Take-Two responded to a question about GTA 6's price</a>, but didn't confirm anything.</p><p>These listings were first spotted by <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1963188327881875580" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a></p><p>007 First Light is set for release in 2026 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC. There have been numerous James Bond video games over the years, of course--including the iconic GoldenEye 007--but 007 First Light is the first to tell an origin story for the world-famous character.</p><p>You'll play as James Bond when he's 26 years old and in the Royal Navy, prior to becoming the British superspy everyone knows today. He gets recruited for MI6 and eventually its elite 00 section.</p><p>The State of Play today, September 3, will showcase 30 minutes of gameplay, showing off Bond taking on his first mission.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-everybodys-golf-hot-shots-switch-silly-satisfying-but-hampered-by-patchy-performance-presentation.1287561/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Everybody's Golf Hot Shots Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158443/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Fans of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/everybodys_golf">Everybody’s Golf</a> have had to twiddle their one-gloved thumbs for a while now, waiting since 2017 for a new official entry in the series. Mashing together the series’ previously regionally distinct names (Everybody’s Golf and Hot Shots Golf), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/everybodys_golf_hot_shots">Everybody’s Golf Hot Shots</a> has finally stepped up to the tee. Have series newcomers Hyde (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tamagotchi-plaza-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tamagotchi Plaza</a>) hit a hole in one, or is this more like a triple bogey? Well, a bit of both really.</p>
<p>For almost all of its history, Everybody’s Golf was developed by Clap Hanz and published by Sony. Hyde is in the driving seat now, with Bandai Namco on the publishing side, unlocking the series from PlayStation for the first time. However, they’re clearly working from the same playbook, keeping what works best in the series while adding some novel ideas of their own.</p>
<p>The Everybody’s Golf series combines deceptively detailed physics and subtle controls with cartoonish characters. It absolutely works as a pick-up-and-play party game, but equally rewards deeper engagement. The basic controls involve facing where you want the ball to go, then pressing 'A' three times to set power and accuracy.</p>
<figure><a title="Everybody's Golf Hot Shots Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158442/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That works well for a breezy round of golf, but once you start getting into the intricacies of spin, accounting for the wind, and working with the slopes of the course — and, as your stats develop, exploiting silly shortcuts like using the fairways of other holes, skipping across water, or bouncing along paths — the skill ceiling leaves lots of space to have fun.</p>
<p>Everybody’s Golf Hot Shots follows this formula with gusto. There are more than 25 characters to unlock, and 10 regions on the World Tour. You can now choose a caddy to accompany you on the course – this gives a face to the previously disembodied voices offering encouraging comments after teeing off, putting advice on the green, or squeaks of dismay when you fluff a shot.</p>
<p>The core game mode is Challenge, which sets up short tournaments or versus matches, and winning them levels up and unlocks more courses. World Tour, meanwhile, is a bizarrely story-led setup. Fairly tedious cutscenes present odd tales — a girl seeking stardom, a hostile takeover of a golf theme park — somehow circuitously resulting in the repeated need to play golf. It seems the devs know what they've done here, as the option to turn off all cutscenes is front and centre. Online play makes a return, although no games were available while testing.</p>
<figure><a title="Everybody's Golf Hot Shots Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158444/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest addition is Wacky Golf, which lets you play with obstacles scattered around the course, play a game stealing your opponents' clubs, or have a round of “boom golf” where your ball may spontaneously explode after any shot, sending it flying in a random direction. These were fun for a bit of multiplayer, but ultimately throwaway. When it comes down to it, the core of the game is well balanced – these quirky ideas only interfere.</p>
<p>For those looking to get deep into the game, a loyalty system lets you develop individual characters by playing as them, unlocking special skills and abilities. You can purchase food, which boosts stats like power or spin, and can be shared across characters, letting you spread progress instead of getting stuck with one overlevelled main. Essentially, you can fatten up one character by feeding them on the winnings of another.</p>
<p>Now, all of this so far would suggest that we have a solid Everybody’s Golf on our hands, and series fans will be all smiles. Here comes the big 'but', and it’s all about performance on Switch. This is a game all about pressing a button at just the right time, and for that you need fluid visual feedback. I felt a lack of smoothness made accuracy suffer. I went back to my PS TV to compare with the 2011 entry in the series and definitely found that to be smoother.</p>
<figure><a title="Everybody's Golf Hot Shots Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158450/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>What’s worse is that using special skills — decorated as they are by fancy graphical effects — dropped the frame rate even further. Those special shots are supposed to get you out of difficult situations, but they’re too risky to be usable on Switch. I tried out Switch 2 and things were noticeably better. However, the overall frame rate was not improved. I got used to it, but the game deserves better.</p>
<p>Even with these performance limitations, trees look simplistic, there’s heavy level-of-detail pop-in, and grass textures are flat. The lighting and colours are nice, with night golf now an option, but I would take just about any visual cut to get smoother performance. One footnote here is that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2730810/EVERYBODYS_GOLF_HOT_SHOTS/">Bandai Namco revealed</a> some of the foliage textures were produced using generative AI. Looking at the results, it’s hard to imagine that any added efficiency was worth the loss of cred from using the controversial technology.</p>
<p>The soundscape of the game is chaotic. The swings and strikes and the tuneful rattle of the ball into the cup are all delightful, while the music is like a corny jingle from a Tokyo convenience store. Over the top of everything, your multiple caddies and players make extremely caricatured remarks – often all at the same time. There’s no way on Earth that Hyde didn’t realise how bonkers it all sounds, so you have to take it as a stylistic choice – one that strangely grew on me, I must admit.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Everybody’s Golf Hot Shots carries on the series traditions with solid courses, a robust character levelling system, and the appropriate level of silliness. However, the experience is uneven on Switch. Fans may enjoy it in short bursts, but technical issues and patchy presentation stop it from being the standout entry it could have been.</p></section>

<p>Marvel Rivals Season 4 leaks have arrived, revealing the new season’s heroes, battle pass, skins, team-ups, a new game mode, and more. </p>



<p>As we draw closer to Marvel Rivals season 4, more leaks and rumors have started circulating. A recent claim stated Marvel Rivals could finally be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-debut-could-finally-be-happening-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making its debut on PS4</a>. New leaks regarding Marvel Rivals Season 4 have surfaced online, revealing details about the upcoming content expected in the next season.  </p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-4-leaked-heroes">Marvel Rivals Season 4 Leaked Heroes</h2>



<p>The leaked information about Marvel Rivals Season 4 originated from a Russian Discord channel, via XOXLEAK on <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1962964070581338220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) and Dylbobz on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92EIFCUXkrI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>. Their new post states that the season name is called Heart of the Dragon, the launch hero will be Angela, and the second hero is Daredevil. Angela has some kind of temporary flying mechanic and has a melee-based skillset with a “bow or perhaps a spear”. Daredevil has an Asian-styled design and opposes Angela, “embodying the Dragon and the Tiger.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>POSSIBLE Season 4 leak:</p><p>Launch Hero: ANGELA</p><p>Angela has some kind of fly mechanic (temporary), looks to be a melee hero but it seems she has a Bow or perhaps a Spear. </p><p>Battle Pass:<br>"FRUIT OF IMORTALITY"<br>Skins: <br>– Moon Knight (Mecha Knight from what if)<br>– Phoenix (presumably… <a href="https://t.co/2G4m37DfOT">pic.twitter.com/2G4m37DfOT</a></p></div>— X0XLEAK (@X0X_LEAK) <a href="https://twitter.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1962960946340548810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-4-battle-pass-and-skin-leaks">Marvel Rivals Season 4 Battle Pass and Skin Leaks</h2>



<p>Coming to Marvel Rivals Season 4 Battle Pass, it is reportedly called “Fruits of Immortality”. It will feature skins like Moon Knight Mecha Knight from Marvel’s What If…? series, a new Phoenix skin which is “presumably Dark Phoenix”, and a Phoenix Force Loki skin which is Red and has feathers. There is seemingly a new Ultron Wasteland skin to look forward to as well. </p>



<h2 id="h-new-game-mode-and-team-ups">New Game Mode and Team Ups </h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 4 is reportedly arriving with a new quick-play game mode that allows players to select the same heroes multiple times. Regarding Team-Ups, Human Torch, Black Panther, and Psylocke are the first ones; Venom and Captain America are the second ones. </p>



<p>Regardless, the information doesn’t come from the usual source; therefore, readers should take it with a massive grain of salt. All will be confirmed when the new season trailer arrives this week. </p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-explained-start-times-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> isn’t for the faint-hearted. It’s a survival-horror game with an emphasis on psychological torment, as well as physical endangerment—thanks to the game’s litany of disfigured, slimy menaces. I had an endless sense of unease playing the game, but it was worth it. I also happened to scoop up a ton of trophies and achievements on the way.</p>



<p>If you want to see the Cronos: The New Dawn trophy list for yourself, you’ve come to the right place.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-and-trophies-are-in-cronos-the-new-dawn">How Many Achievements And Trophies Are In Cronos: The New Dawn?</h2>



<p><strong>There is a grand total of 48 PlayStation Trophies and 47 Xbox Achievements for you to pursue in Cronos: The New Dawn.</strong></p>



<p>Granted, a lot of Cronos is <em>you </em>being hunted and chased down. If you’re hankering for the game’s full set of extra accomplishments, though, you need to keep the entire list in mind. You can’t get every trophy and achievement on your first playthrough, as it’s impossible. </p>



<p>Getting the Platinum Trophy requires at least one more run—there is no Platinum Trophy for Xbox users, be warned.</p>

As players have discovered, gigantic Hive Lords that can give Destiny 2's Hive Worm gods a run for their money are lurking beneath the surface, and they're the <em>devil </em>to kill.</p><p>Easily one of the biggest bosses to date in Helldivers 2, Hive Lords boast an incredible amount of health and are covered in rocky scales of armor. These bullet-sponges can shrug off just about anything you can throw at them, and while they aren't unkillable, a Helldivers team is going to need to call in multiple drops of anti-tank weaponry and hellbombs to take down this skyscraper-sized titan.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ34QSm-nJw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yZ34QSm-nJw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Fighting a Hive Lord is challenging enough, but defending yourself from one is also a Herculean labor. The massive worms can burrow underground for surprise attacks, erupting to shower the battlefield with rocks or flatten you with their sheer mass. If that wasn't bad enough, they can blanket the area in corrosive bile, forcing teams to stay on the move during these fights.</p><p>So far, the best strategy for dealing with a Hive Lord is a classic from Arthurian legend: <a href="https://youtu.be/MUG9VzHoEoc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">run away</a>. Sure, a Hive Lord has a few exposed areas under its armor and a mouth that an anti-tank rocket can comfortably fit inside of, but the best course of action here is to strategically retreat and carry on with your regular mission objectives.</p><p>Hive Lords require an absurd amount of resources to take down--<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1n6m0vo/they_are_real_and_we_killed_one_raaaahhhh/" rel="nofollow ">one team says it used 10 Hellbombs, eight 500KG bombs, and several stratagems to get the job done</a>--and so far it looks like there's no reward for killing one, other than the sweet feeling of protecting democracy for another day from the monster.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

This original game blends survival horror with sci-fi, taking place in an alternate history Poland in the 1960s, under Soviet control. You explore the destroyed and life-less city, looking for jump points to find people in the past who could help prevent disaster.</p><p dir="ltr">For tips and guides on the toughest parts of Cronos: The New Dawn check out our guide on the optional <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-solve-the-hospital-chapel-puzzle-in-cronos-the-new-dawn/1100-6534152/">Hospital Chapel puzzle</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How long is Cronos: The New Dawn?</h2><p dir="ltr">Based on the completion time of three members of the GameSpot team, Cronos: The New Dawn will take you between 15 and 20 hours to complete. While there is some optional exploration and puzzle-solving to be done, the biggest swing in playtimes will come down to how difficult you find the combat to be. Cronos: The New Dawn has some tough encounters and restrictive inventory management, which could result in you getting stuck on some of the harder combat challenges.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Cronos: The New Dawn chapter list</h2><p dir="ltr">Cronos: The New Dawn comprises four major sections rather than distinct chapter names, so there is no true Cronos: The New Dawn chapter list per se.. The location names don't contain any spoilers beyond what kind of areas you will eventually explore. Between these areas, you will often travel back to a hubspace inside a defunct tram station, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Cronos: The New Dawn sections:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Apartments</li><li dir="ltr">Steelworks</li><li dir="ltr">Hospital</li><li dir="ltr">Church Abbey</li></ul>

			<p>Bloober Team has always been synonymous with horror, from their earliest days with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/02/16/layers-of-fear-review/">Layers of Fear</a> through to the high profile <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2</a> remake. It has, however, been nearly 5 years since their last original title, the somewhat divisive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/27/the-medium-review-xbox-series-x-pc/">The Medium,</a> so the pressure on Cronos: The New Dawn to deliver is heightened. Can the Polish developers follow up on the success of their work on Konami’s legendary series in a story of their own devising? To do so, Cronos takes clear influences from the usual survival horror mainstays of Silent Hill and Resident Evil but there is also a large slice of Dead Space, from character design to gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | A New Breed Of Horror" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9dY2fTE07h0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cronos features a complicated narrative full of time travel and dimensional travel, but it all boils down to a story of betrayal, grief, and coping with the effects of a pandemic. Post Covid-19 any story that revolves around communities locked down to prevent the spread of disease will take on a greater resonance for players and this is certainly the case here. Notes and environmental cues abound that tell a tale of a scared population torn between self preservation and communal survival. The disease here is a mysterious affliction that turns victims into monstrous ghouls that merge with each other to create even greater threats.</p>


<p>Dead Space is the most obvious influence here graphically, with the main protagonist, enigmatically named The Traveller, wearing an exosuit that recalls Isaac Clarke (and Bioshock’s Big Daddy to a lesser extent). The Traveller feels similarly chunky too, with deliberate movement rather than agility being the name of the game. Environments are largely dark and depressing, with effective mood lighting and signposting alongside some gnarly body horror aspects. Many areas are covered in a biomass that oozes and throbs as you move past it, whilst others are desolate and windswept. These environments are contrasted with occasional serene moments where you travel back to the town of New Dawn before the epidemic and are faced with scenes of everyday normality.</p>


<p>Exploring the world of New Dawn follows the familiar pattern of finding keys, unlocking shortcuts and solving environmental puzzles. The latter does feature the new addition of a power that can manipulate timespace anomalies to change the environment for your benefit. This is mostly used to reveal hidden paths (sometimes requiring you to take detours to find an angle where the anomaly is visible) or to access secret areas filled with loot but later game boss fights also use this mechanic to great effect. The progression is quite strictly linear, which feels appropriate for survival horror and means that there is little backtracking.</p>
<p>Alongside your anomaly manipulation power, you have a basic melee attack which is mostly used to destroy item boxes or as a last resort when ammo is low, and an adaptable sidearm which can take various forms to mimic the standard horror arsenal. It starts as a basic handgun that can be charged for extra damage, but you find shotgun, automatic, and even a powerful arbalest as you make your way through the horrors of New Dawn. Somewhat annoyingly, however, these different forms take up extra spaces in your limited inventory so I found myself sticking to the initial handgun and shotgun throughout. I appreciate that this is a convention of the genre, but some games have taken to separating the inventory from your weapons and I think this enables you to try out a greater range of weapons, aiding in a feel of gameplay variety. Upgrading weapons is a slow process too and whilst this is undone for a small cost your current guns are usually more effective than the ones you find.</p>

<p>Combat is a deliberate and intense affair. Many enemies take multiple shots to go down, with fully charging being essential. If you allow enemies to merge they become even more powerful, eventually being impervious to bullets and requiring you to use fire and explosive barrels to damage them. My first playthrough resulted in me being hunted by a merged enemy when I had no ammo to damage it and necessitated a reload as I came to terms with this mechanic. Setting fire to corpses prevents merging, but you also have limited torch ammo so you need to be strategic as to when to use it.</p>
<p>You are not entirely alone in your quest though as you are preceded by a host of former operatives who leave clues, tools, and pathways for you to find. Fairly early on you’ll also meet The Warden, a fellow traveller who plays an increasingly important role in the story of Cronos. Alan Turkington brings a welcome degree of mystery and gravitas to this role in his vocal performance. You’ll also find survivors, some of whom are targets for retrieval as you are sent to recover their ‘essence’ in order to learn how to prevent the tragic disease from happening. The moral ambiguities around this process are a key part of the larger tale being told and it is far from a simple hero’s story.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, however, are the ten cats that are scattered throughout the game. Finding these furry friends almost always requires venturing off the main path or solving optional puzzles, but the rewards for doing so are worth it. Most obvious are extra currency or upgrade materials but, once rescued, these feline companions also congregate in your main base and provide a welcome level of life to the desolated environment. Other upgrades can be found through absorbing the aforementioned ‘essence’ with each providing different buffs. There are various achievement that rely on you maintaining specific essences throughout but an initial playthrough will see you swapping each out as you progress with only three being able to be stored at once.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Cronos: The New Dawn is a great new survival horror property and I hope we see more of The Traveller’s adventures in future. The clear influences from genre legends are combined with some original touches to make a game that feels familiar but also manages to innovate and surprise players too. The intriguing narrative, the enjoyable progression, and the challenging combat all combine to make an experience that cements Bloober’s place as horror specialists.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Before Arkane Austin made its Prey game, a developer called <a href="https://wccftech.com/human-head-rune-ragnarok-interview/">Human Head Studios</a> created and developed Prey as a first-person shooter centered around a Cherokee named Domasi "Tommy" Tawodi, who ventures on a quest to save his grandfather and his girlfriend after they're taken by an alien spaceship currently in orbit around the Earth. It was released on PC and Xbox 360, and a sequel was in development until the game was cancelled in 2014.</p>



<p>Between 2006 and 2014, the rights for Human Head Studios' Prey went from its 3D Realms, who initially helped publish the game, to a different company called Radar Group, to ZeniMax Media, who modern players will recognize today as a Bethesda and ZeniMax company, and overall a subsidiary of Microsoft and Xbox. It was under ZeniMax, unfortunately, where Prey 2, which had bounced around in development limbo for years, was canceled, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/rune-developer-human-head-studios-closes-down-and-reopens-as-roundhouse-studios-at-bethesda/">Human Head Studios was officially shuttered</a> and subsumed into Bethesda as Roundhouse Studios in 2019.</p>



<p>Now, more than a decade after Prey 2 was cancelled and a little under a decade since Arkane Austin made its entirely separate but similarly titled Prey, gameplay footage for Human Head Studios' Prey 2 has leaked online.</p>



<p>A post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n6zcc8/prey_2_development_videos_leaked/">Reddit</a> includes links for what would have been Prey 2's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5vbwq7X3G8">opening</a>, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSNdZBLCvog">gameplay demo</a> that might've appeared at an E3 show, and a couple of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDwfoEv20iE">earlier development</a> clips of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoYaYVPY5WA">gameplay</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7OIifeZ-s">combat</a>, all uploaded by a YouTube channel under the name '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@davidhalsted2611">David Halsted</a>.'</p>



<p>The footage is incomplete, but it does give fans of the 2006 Prey a sense of what the team was striving for in a sequel, hoping to take the core elements of Human Head's first Prey game and evolve on them.</p>



<p>At the time of Human Head Studios' shuttering, co-founder Chris Rhinehart said, "<em>Sadly, we had to wind down the business of Human Head Studios and close its doors, which was particularly devastating due to the passion and creativity of the team we’d assembled</em>."</p>



<p>The video game industry wasn't in such dire straits in 2019 compared to its current state, so thankfully, at the time, the whole team was able to stay together and were given new jobs at the aforementioned Roundhouse Studios, which was formed under Bethesda as a way to keep Human Head together. Though it only bought them a few more years, since the mass layoffs since then, not to mention the latest round of mass layoffs that saw significant cuts to <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">ZeniMax Online</a>, likely split the team up for good. </p>

			<p>Following the release of several <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/layers-of-fear-now-truly-finished/">horror games</a> to a reception ranging from positive to mildly negative, sometimes due to how particular sensitive themes were addressed, Polish developer Bloober Team has risen considerably in the estimation of survival horror fans for the excellent work the studio has done with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, a faithful adaptation of the classic Konami game enhanced by some modern features that make it a joy to play. While the Polish studio is set to continue this fruitful collaboration with the development of the<a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/"> remake of the first entry in the series</a>, Bloober Team is also expanding its own properties with new titles, the first of them being Cronos: The New Dawn. Right from the game's reveal, it was made clear how this game would be a threshold release for the studio, moving past the narrative-focused experiences such as the<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/layers-of-fear-now-truly-finished/"> Layers of Fear series</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-medium-silence-of-the-damned/">The Medium</a> to delve deeper into the survival horror genre. And while it is definitely a little flawed, there's no denying that Bloober Team created a solid game that becomes rather engaging once things really get going.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The true mission of The Travel and the real purpose of The Collective are among the mysteries hidden in Cronos: The New Dawn</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is set in a twisted reimagining of Krakow's Nowa Huta district, one of the city's districts built as a utopian ideal city meant to mirror European capitals like London and Paris. Instead of exploring the grandeur of the most populous district in Krakow, players will get to explore a ruined version of the district, its population completely decimated by a terrible plague known only as The Change, which turns human beings into horrible, mutated monstrosities known as The Orphans. Despite the current situation, humanity doesn't seem to have been left to its doomed fate, as a mysterious organization known as The Collective is sending individuals wearing massive protective armor to investigate The Change and fight off any monsters on their path. After many of these individuals have died on the path to truth, it will be up to a new Traveler to retrace their steps and rescue certain individuals from the 1980s via time rift before they succumb to the Change. After meeting The Warden, another armored individual tasked with providing members of The Collective with the tools needed to survive New Dawn, however, it starts becoming clear how there's a lot more behind The Change, the recovery of individuals from the past, and the purpose of The Collective.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn's setting and story are undoubtedly some of the best features in the game. The Polish setting is rather unique for video games, and the game's time-travel gimmick allowed for the creation of dual worlds, which are incredibly interesting to explore, although the almost constant nighttime doesn't provide a lot of visual differences between the two. With environmental storytelling in the vein of the Souls series, and scattered documents in the vein of classic survival horror games, piecing together the story and the events that happened before and during the outbreak of The Change is also quite engaging, although the game does feature plenty of cutscenes that provide clarity on some of these events and make it easy to follow the plot at its base level. With some difficult choices to make at times as well, Cronos: The New Dawn does an excellent job immersing players into the role of The Traveler, making them hunger for the next big reveal.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Cronos: The New Dawn's story is engaging and immersive right from the very beginning.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Having a great story that's gripping right from the start is generally good for any game, but in the case of Cronos: The New Dawn, it's even better for a particular reason: the first few hours of the game do a terrible job introducing the experience, so much so that I expect some will drop the game entirely before things start getting good. This is caused mainly by what immediately feels like a by-the-books survival horror experience clearly inspired by the Dead Space series, only with a really unremarkable enemy design, both in terms of combat and visual design, and a considerably worse combat system with no dismemberment mechanics that requires some time and resource investment in weapon upgrades to become fun. Exploration and traversal fare a little better thanks to an intricate level design, and the lack of an in-game map, which enhances immersion considerably while forcing players to rely on the environment's visual elements to find their way (although there's an optional waymarker system that guides players to their next objective).</p>



<p>Though exploration and traversal improve fairly quickly with the introduction not only of optional locations filled with much-needed resources like Energy, materials to craft items, and spare ammo as well as documents and Travelogs that provide additional information on the setting and story, but also of the Anomaly mechanics, which can be used to alter the environment by manipulating time, representing a unique way to provide additional puzzles alongside those of the more traditional variety, like locked doors and passwords to find, combat does not. </p>



<p>With their hulking armor, The Traveler is really slow and has no real defensive option, not even the ability to turn 180 degrees when needed, so proper positioning and headshots with the handgun, whose shots can be charged for extra damage, are the only things that separate The Traveler from an early death at the start of the game. With enemies not reacting a lot to shots, combat feels unsatisfying in the first few hours, dragging the entire experience down. Even after introducing the Orphans' ability to consume their dead to power up, requiring The Traveler to burn their bodies using the Shell Suit's flamethrower, things don't improve. In its basic form, the handgun is a really weak weapon, and with ammo being so scarce, every combat encounter becomes a stressful exercise where luck seems to play a bigger role than skill. Ending up with no ammo in a forced combat encounter, with no weapon to rely on other than the weak melee attacks, including a stomp that looks more powerful than it actually is, is a frustrating experience that I expect will make a few players simply give up on the game.</p>



<p>My frustration with the Cronos: The New Dawn's combat system reached its peak right before the game's first boss battle against a massive Orphan set in a small location with several rooms whose design provides the cover needed to shoot the canisters scattered around to stagger the enemy and reveal its weak points. It's during this battle, or rather after a few failed attempts, that I started appreciating what the game tries to do with its combat mechanics. Upgrading the handgun and the shotgun, deciding on the fly how to use the resources in my possesion to craft either ammo or healing items, which can be easily done without opening the menu by holding either the directional shortcut to which a weapon is assigned or the healing button, picking up some resources on the combat grounds to allow for emergency crafting, finally clicked together, completely changing my perspective on the game. </p>



<p>After obtaining the first Essence, the soul of one individual related to The Change outbreak, and enjoying a welcome passive bonus, and meeting The Warden, ammo started becoming available in bigger quantities, making it much easier to handle Orphans and manage resources, which continue to be scarce, but not as scarce as they are in the first couple of hours, although that wasn't the end of the frustration, as there still some forced enemy encounters on the way that were, sometimes, a little too challenging with the available resources.</p>



<p>As The Traveler's mission proceeds, more combat and exploration tools are unlocked, including small explosive bombs called Pyre and anti-gravitational boots that further enhance the experience a lot, so much so that I had a difficult time putting the game down. Granted, some flaws remain evident, such as the average enemy visual design, which makes it almost hard to tell one enemy type apart from another, and the generally predictable survival-horror experience, but how every gameplay element comes together in the end made it easy for me to look past most of these issues, ultimately making making me appreciate some of the game's unique quirks even more, including managing how to burn the bodies of dead Orphans to prevent a powerful enemy from becoming even more powerful, while making me forget the frustrating first couple of hours.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Cronos: The New Dawn takes a few hours to get going, but when it does, the experience becomes quite engaging.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Enhancing the Cronos: The New Dawn experience are the game's visuals, powered by Unreal Engine 5. While the game eventually becomes a little predictable in terms of visual design, as already mentioned, it's difficult not to notice how the good usage of lighting and volumetrics enhances the entire experience, even without hardware ray tracing. The solid visual design of New Dawn, which gives it a distinct industrial vibe, is accompanied by great texture and character models work, except for the aforementioned enemy design, which looks rather generic, and some evident asset recycling from the Silent Hill 2 remake, as the hair of one character makes really evident.</p>



<p>Being powered by Unreal Engine 5, however, some stuttering issues were expected on PC, and they sadly are in. Though the game has a shader precompilation step, which reduces shader stuttering issues, the game clearly suffers from traversal stuttering issues that, while not frequent, are easily noticeable and immersion-breaking. Given the game's visuals which rely a lot on lighting, enabling hardware ray tracing hits performance considerably, as the game ran at an average of 55 FPS with NVIDIA DLSS in Balanced Mode without Frame Generation at the high Quality Preset at 4K resolution traveling around The Terminal, which serves as some sort of main hub, on my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32GB RAM). At the same settings, enabling Frame Generation (and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-available-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multi Frame Generation for GeForce RTX 50 users</a>) boosts performance in the same area at an average of around 80 FPS, so using frame gen tech will be the way to go for the vast majority of players who want to experience the game with ray tracing.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Cronos: The New Dawn 4K PC Gameplay - DLSS Balanced, Ray Tracing, Frame Generation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cubXYGJWR1Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Disabling ray tracing greatly improves performance, as the game ran at close to the 100 FPS mark in the same scenario without it. Sadly, there aren't a lot of graphics settings to tweak outside of a comprehensive Quality Preset and a few others that have minimal impact on performance, like motion blur, so upscalers (TSR, DLSS, FSR 3.1, and XeSS) and frame generation are the only features that can help the user achieve the desired level of performance in the game. Though lacking in graphics options, Cronos: The New Dawn comes with others that should be the standard for PC games but often aren't, including rebindable controls, ultrawide resolution support, and a wealth of accessibility features such as multiple Color Blind modes, quick-time event settings, and more.</p>

<p>Although its first hours do a frankly bad job of getting players involved from a gameplay perspective, Cronos: The New Dawn is ultimately a very engaging game, and one of Bloober Team's best games alongside the Silent Hill 2 remake. While its flaws remain evident throughout the adventure, the game's unique setting, engaging mystery-filled story, and gameplay, which starts coming together after the very first boss battle a few hours in, make The Traveler's mission one worthy of embarking on for all survival horror fans, especially those who love the Dead Space series.</p>
