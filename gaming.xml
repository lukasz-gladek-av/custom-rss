            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Well, here's an unexpected bit of news! After launching on PC earlier this year, Strange Scaffold has announced that its turn-based take on TMNT will be flipping onto Switch on <strong>14th August</strong> — wait, that's next week!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_tactical_takedown">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a> is all about turn-based action. You'll play as Leo, Raph, Donnie, or Mikey, as you flip, punch, and dash your way through a campaign that sees both Shredder and Master Splinter dead and gone, leaving the heroes in a half-shell to find their own way in the world.</p>
<p>It's a different, more strategic approach to the Turtles than we've seen from the IP before, but the developer promises an "innovative turn-based beat-em-up combat", so there should be just enough combo-focused Cowabunga-ing to keep the old and new Shell Heads happy.</p>
<p>All of this is presented in an almost tabletop visual style, which sees the Turtles moving across the grid on stands as if they are cardboard cutouts. In short, it looks awesome.</p>
<p>As if that wasn't enough, the Switch version will launch with the all-new Remix Mode, which throws in more enemy variety, higher difficulty, and an increased importance on your Turtle's loadout. This mode will unlock for each level once you complete it, so you don't even need to wait until the end of the game to get involved.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a couple of screenshots from the Tactical Takedown Steam Page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- 20 action-packed levels, divided into campaigns focusing on individual characters.<br>
- A unique take on the world of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from the minds at Strange Scaffold (Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator, I Am Your Beast).<br>
- Innovative turn-based beat-em-up combat, complete with mutating arenas.<br>
- Gorgeous graphic novel-inspired art style, with paint splatter, figurines, and diorama setpieces.<br>
- Customizable movesets to shape each Turtles' playstyle.<br>
- Thumping multi-genre soundtrack from award-winning composer RJ Lake (Unbeatable, I Am Your Beast).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have been keeping our fingers crossed to see this one on Switch for a good few months now (heck, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/we-really-want-to-see-this-turn-based-tmnt-game-come-to-switch">did we manifest it</a>?), so let's hope it's every bit as <em>totally tubular</em> as it seems.</p>

            <p>I'd love to say that Bloodgrounds plunged me into a crimson mist, but in practice, this arena tactics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with town-building feels as cosy as a pair of soft leather socci on a frosty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saturnalia">Saturnalia</a>. The setup: you are a gladiator from a Roman-themed fantasy world, who has recently won his freedom in the arena. How is he celebrating his freedom? By becoming a gladiator manager himself, as he continues his quest for vengeance upon the Emperor who slaughtered his father.</p>
<p>I guess this is the optimal Russell Crowe career path, but still, imagine if he'd hung up his sword and reinvented himself as a carpet salesman. Instead of continuing the cycle of violence that was so cruelly forced upon you, you'd have to educate clients on pile density and antistatics while politely parrying their requests to hear about the time you ripped that Scandinavian's ears off with your toes.</p>

<p>People would point out that you sure have a lot of <em>blood-red</em> carpets in your carpet shop, har har, and you would smile delicately and consider your wine goblet and say "maroon and rose, actually". For every query like this, another maroon or rose carpet would appear in your shop and another townsperson would mysteriously go on holiday for the rest of their lives. Anyway, I forget why I'm talking about carpets. Oh yeah, that gladiator game.</p>
<p>Gladiators need to win the crowd, and Bloodgrounds is very much playing the hits (5% critical chance). Its tussles take place in handsomely decked pixelart stadiums boasting such ornamental fixtures as flaming torches and crucified bodies. Your characters and enemies move around according to an initiative bar along the top. There's a no-nonsense distinction between movement points and action points, which are used to perform regular attacks and special abilities, while consumables can be played for free.</p>
<p>The character classes seem both familiar and busily outfitted. There are helmeted thuggoes who can rope-dart people and stun them with a pommel; strutting retiarii equipped with throw-net and trident; archers who can set exploding traps from afar. Leering, scarred and eye-patched humans aside, you'll dally with mythical beasties such as spectral reapers and brazen quadrotor automatons. The arenas themselves have terrain fixtures such as mounted crossbows, and yes, the audience may lob in a power-up or two if they like the cut of your gibs. Preferably, your enemy's gibs.</p>
<p>Between clashes, you retire to your landscape-view villa where you can hire fresh meat and send any less than fresh meat to the infirmary. Much as in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Dankest Sturgeon</a>, you'll add and upgrade buildings with your winnings at other arenas, scattered across a world map of escalating difficulty. Each town facility has its talking head, and I find the writing and characters quite charming so far. Your architect, for example, is a sarcastic ghost sheep who probably began life in an Ovid story somewhere. Good for him.</p>
<p>Bloodgrounds launches this year. Developers Exordium Games are them wot did spacey shmup Last Encounter and horror comedy mystery <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bear-with-me">Bear With Me</a>. It's published by Daedalic, who seem to have a thing for Romans lately - this January, they launched 4X strategy game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1561960/Yield_Fall_of_Rome/">Yield! Fall of Rome</a> from Billionworlds into early access.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/come-win-the-crowd-in-bloodgrounds-a-gladiator-tactics-rpg-with-darkest-dungeon-style-town-management]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175"><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em></a> is singlehandedly saving August 2025 from being a sleeper month for Game Pass. The stealth blockbuster arrives alongside some smaller games in a surprisingly good month for the Xbox subscription service’s cheaper tier. If you’ve only been subscribed to Game Pass Standard, some of the year’s best games are about to fall into your lap.</p> <p>Here’s the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/05/xbox-game-pass-august-2025-wave-1/">full schedule</a> for Game Pass games arriving in the first half of August 2025:</p> <blockquote><p><em><strong>Rain World</strong></em>&nbsp;(Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard) – August 5<br> <em><strong>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</strong></em> (Game Pass Standard) – August 6<br> <em><strong>Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders</strong></em> (Game Pass Standard)&nbsp;– August 6<br> <em><strong>MechWarrior 5: Clans</strong></em> (Game Pass Standard)&nbsp;– August 6<br> <em><strong>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap</strong></em>&nbsp;(Game Pass Standard) – August 6<br> <em><strong>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</strong></em>&nbsp;(Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass) – August 7<br> <em><strong>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</strong></em>&nbsp;(Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass) – August 12<br> <em><strong>9 Kings</strong></em>&nbsp;(Game Preview, PC-only) (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass) – August 14</p></blockquote> <p><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> is a decent return to more old-school stealthing with a bit less of the modern-day RPG bloat that’s come to define the recent open-world entries in the series like <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>. Meanwhile, <em>9 Kings</em> is a neat, top-down strategy roguelike that came to Steam Early Access back in May. Then there’s <em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em>, a good-enough co-op shooter that arrives back on Game Pass after leaving the service years ago.</p>

 <p>The real winners this month, however, are Game Pass Standard subscribers. <em>MechWarrior 5: Clans</em> is one of 2024’s more overlooked gems, nailing the in-universe mood and storytelling and backing it up with solid action and mech customization. <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em> and <em>Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders</em>, both out earlier this year, are strong GOTY runnerups. Folks on the cheaper Game Pass tier should be eating well for a bit, even as August is a quieter month overall for paying Ultimate customers on console. The arrival of <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> later in the month should offset the current doldrums for them, though.</p> <p>Sadly, August 15 is also when <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> finally leaves Game Pass. Good luck finishing it by then if you haven’t already!</p>

The size of the map isn't going to be much larger than the houses that are already in the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4543956-phasmophobiadiner.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4543956" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4543956-phasmophobiadiner.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4543956"></a><figcaption>Phasmophobia's new map is giving us some Twin Peaks vibes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4543956-phasmophobiadiner.jpg"></figure><p>While Kinetic Games won't release Nell's Diner until later this year, the studio has revealed that the much-anticipated reworking of the Grafton Farmhouse map will be coming to Phasmophobia on August 12.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4543959-phasmophobiagraftonfarmhouse.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4543959" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4543959-phasmophobiagraftonfarmhouse.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4543959"></a><figcaption>You may not want to enter the Grafton Farmhouse map alone.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4543959-phasmophobiagraftonfarmhouse.jpg"></figure><p>The new version of Grafton Farmhouse has been "totally overhauled" with "newly themed rooms" including an attic and a seamstress room.

Although Knight has been deliberately vague about the details, he's noted, "We're basically going to be reworking the entire horror in the game. So everything is going to be changing."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-phasmophobia-map-nells-diner-revealed-grafton-farmhouse-rework-coming-next-week.1262409/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>map in the form of Nell's Diner, and the long-awaited Grafton Farmhouse rework now has a release date too.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Nell's Diner will be arriving later this year. Described by the developer as a "run-down, retro restaurant", the new map will be roughly equivalent in size to&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s houses. You'll be able to explore "a classic diner counter, comfy booths, and a kitchen" as you hunt whatever specter happens to be haunting the place.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for Nell's Diner yet, but when it arrives, creative director Daniel Knight says the new map will be "one of the most unique" he and his team have created for the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-nells-diner-grafton-farmhouse-rework-interior.jpg?itok=L8E5ahb2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-nells-diner-grafton-farmhouse-rework-interior.jpg?itok=NBGJJxB8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nell's Diner may be small, but there's plenty of opportunity to get spooked here.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as revealing Nell's Diner, Kinetic Games has also announced when you can expect to play&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s reworked Grafton Farmhouse map, and it won't be too long before you can get your hands on the revamped stage.</p>

<p>Arriving on August 12th, the rework will apparently bring a "totally overhauled" Grafton Farmhouse in which you can expect to find "faulty electrics, caved-in ceilings and layers of dust" as well as an "eerie attic" and a "harrowing seamstress room". Sounds about right for&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>.</p>

<p>Along with Nell's Diner, Knight says the new version of Grafton Farmhouse is "central to [the studio's] efforts in amplifying the horror in <em>Phasmophobia</em>", so if you're looking to experience the best the ghost-hunting horror game has to offer, it sounds like these new maps will be right up your street.</p>

Back in April, Kinetic announced that the game had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">sell three million copies on consoles alone</a>&nbsp;after launching on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S last October.</p>

<p>Not only that, but there's also a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse" rel="nofollow">movie adaptation of the game</a> in the works at horror production studio Blumhouse, although details on that project are somewhat scarce at the moment.</p>

<p>We'll likely learn more in the coming months, but until then, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/phasmophobia/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/phasmophobia-game-preview/9N6D60SBZN05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The Grafton Farmhouse rework launches on August 12th, and Nell's Diner arrives later this year.</p>

                <p>Following hot off the heels of last week's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, the gaming giant has announced an Indie World Showcase that's set to take place on August 7, later this week. According to the <a href="https://x.com/IndieWorldNA/status/1952716474440724634" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announcement post</a>, there'll be "roughly 15 minutes of new announcements and updates on indie games coming to Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch." The showcase is set to premiere at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET, and you'll be able to check it out on any of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mTv0HmKoUqw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Nintendo YouTube channels</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">This marks the first Indie World Showcase following the launch of the Switch 2 in June, but it's not exactly clear what might show up. Just don't go expecting Hollow Knight: Silksong--that game, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-again-missing-from-nintendo-direct/1100-6533604/">absent from last week's Partner Showcase</a>, could appear in a traditional Nintendo Direct rather than the more low-key Indie events, as it's widely anticipated. The first Switch 2 Direct even featured it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-releasing-this-year-according-to-nintendo-switch-2-direct/1100-6530562/">as part of a sizzle reel back in April</a>.</p>

            <p>
Silksong fans, prepare to ride the rollercoaster of delirious anticipation and potential crushing disappointment once more: Nintendo has announced another indie-focused showcase is happening this week, so could this finally be the day for that release date news?
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Nintendo's Indie World showcase - as these things are officially known - airs this Thursday, 7th August, at 2pm in the UK. If you're over in yonder US, it's a considerably earlier start, with things kicking off at 6am PT or 9am ET.
</p>
<p>
As to what we can expect this time around, Nintendo's being as coy as always. However, it <em>is</em> promising "roughly 15 minutes of new announcements and updates" regarding indie titles for both Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>. And if that appeals, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mTv0HmKoUqw">watch the whole thing on YouTube</a>.
</p>

<p>
A release date for Silksong - developer Team Cherry's massively anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> sequel - is, of course, the great hope this time around, especially given the excitement generated by its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-both-switch-consoles">reappearance in Nintendo's Switch 2 showcase back in April</a>.
</p>
<p>
Anticipation for the title - and frustration over the continuing lack of a release date - has now reached such a fever pitch other developers are savvily starting to get in on the action. Earlier this month, indie developer Pere Albacar promised social media followers a free Steam code for his upcoming release Sands of Hope if Silksong made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">last week's third-party focused Nintendo showcase</a>. In the end it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-silksong-social-media-joke-could-be-game-changing-for-this-indie-developer-despite-direct-no-show">didn't show up</a>, but there's always next time - which just happens to be this Thursday.
</p>
<p>If you're curious about what else is coming to Nintendo Switch consoles, you may also like to know that there'll be a separate Showcase in Japan, where the Indie presentation will be an extra five minutes long - these bonus minutes are usually home to some pretty cool stuff, so we will make sure to watch this, too, and bring you any extra information you need. </p><figure>

<p>This time, it's an Indie World, and will be taking place on <strong>7th August at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST / 3pm CEST</strong>. The showcase will be roughly 15 minutes long and will be show in all of the usual spots.</p>

<p>Folks, we've <em>just</em> had a Partner Showcase — which some found disappointing. There might be some rather lovely surprises in store here, though. Let's wait and see!</p>

			<p>THQ Nordic <a href="https://x.com/TitanQuestGame/status/1952717544046915624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> today that <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-delays-early-access-debut-to-summer-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Titan Quest II</a> has already sold more than 300K units in less than three days since its early access debut on PC, where the game is available via Steam or the Epic Games Store. So far, user reviews submitted on Steam are positive, with 84% of the nearly 6K reviews entered so far giving the game a thumbs up. </p>



<p>According to Grimlore Games, this version of Titan Quest II includes around 15 hours of content. The full version is expected to be available in around a year; however, once the game gets to version 1.0, the price will be raised to $49.99 / €49.99. Those who wish to join the early access can do so at a discounted price of $29.99 / €29.99, and from now through August 8, there is another 20% discount to bring the price down to $23.99 / €23.99.</p>



<p>Grimlore plans to add new masteries, new content, and new world segments, stories, and quests, as well as new features to enhance the game’s longevity, such as crafting. These new features and content will be released through early access as soon as they are ready. Smaller updates, such as bug fixes, balancing, and minor polish updates, are expected to go live monthly, though they can be skipped if nothing major is needed. Major updates, adding significant new features, mechanics, and/or content, will be released roughly every three months. The studio will also introduce translations to the game during the early access period, as currently, there's only English.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As usual with early access games, Titan Quest II will only launch on consoles like PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X once that phase is over and version 1.0 is ready to deploy on PC.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-indie-world-august-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-direct-indie-world-showcase-announced-for-thursday.1262361/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that a new Nintendo Direct Indie World show will be airing later this week, bringing new information about indie games heading to both of the Japanese gaming giant's currently-active platforms.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1952716473656385840" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, the Indie World showcase will air on Thursday at 6am Pacific (that's 9am Eastern and around 2pm BST). It's set to bring "roughly 15 minutes of new announcements and updates" regarding indie games coming to Switch 2 and Switch.</p>

<p>The Indie World Direct follows <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">last week's Partner Showcase</a>, during which new projects from the likes of Bandai Namco, Square Enix, and Capcom were announced for Switch 2 and Switch (as well as other platforms).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-3-nintendo-direct-indie-world.jpg?itok=VK437OZy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-3-nintendo-direct-indie-world.jpg?itok=VRGuSIfM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Stories 3&nbsp;</em>was just one of many games announced during last week's Partner Showcase.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what kind of games can we expect to see at this week's Indie World show? Nintendo is keeping its cards close to its chest, as is customary for the company, so we don't know exactly what we're going to get.</p>

<p>Of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't bring up the elephant (or perhaps that should be the bug) in the room. Could this show finally, blessedly deliver us from our wait when it comes to a&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>release date?</p>

<p>There's still reason to hope, even if&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>has been absent from many a show in recent months. The game is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo" rel="nofollow">getting a demo at this year's Gamescom</a> (albeit at Xbox's booth), so a release date could well be just around the corner.</p>

<p>On the other hand, since Team Cherry does seem to have hitched its wagon to Xbox's procession, it's equally possible that we'll be left bereft once again. Still, hopefully, there will be plenty of other great indies to tide us over.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-indie-world-showcase.jpg?itok=5xb7lgoB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-indie-world-showcase.jpg?itok=9Zw-DU7A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm getting tired of asking, Nintendo. Come on. Please.</figcaption></figure><p>Whatever the case may be, Nintendo's Indie World show will air this Thursday at 6am Pacific/9am Eastern/2pm BST. We'll bring you all the news and announcements from that show as they happen, so check back in with us then for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nobody-knows-what-a-soulslike-is-%E2%80%94-silent-hill-f-sparks-heated-debate-within-the-fandom.1262349/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f"><u>Silent Hill f</u></a> fans pore over the slew of previews that went live recently (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-we-played-it-for-5-hours"><u>you can read ours right here</u></a>), two questions are consistently popping up on social media and fan communities: is the latest mainline Silent Hill <em>really</em> a 'Soulslike' game? And if it is, what does the term 'Soulslike' even mean anyway?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we described in IGN's Silent Hill f hands-on preview, combat itself has a similar feel to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake"><u>Silent Hill 2 Remake</u></a>’s close-range combat. You can dodge enemy attacks with the DualSense’s circle button and activate a light and heavy attack with R1 and R2, respectively. Your limited reach and lengthy attack motions give a realistic, weighty feel to combat. Heavy attacks, especially, feel slow and need to be timed well, "contributing to the feeling that Hinako is just a teenager with limited strength."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, however, Silent Hill f’s combat also features timed dodges and counterattacks, with the latter particularly important in combat sequences. Enemies briefly show a sign when a counterattack can be utilized, but we suggested that "unless you have trained your reflex skills by playing games like of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice"><u>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</u></a>, you will likely have a hard time reacting." That’s where the Focus mode comes in, which can be triggered by holding L2. It allows counterattacks to last longer, while also charging up a power attack that staggers an enemy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While series producer Motoi Okamoto hasn't specifically mentioned the Soulslike genre, and by our estimation, Silent Hill f is "by no means a Soulslike," talk of parries and counterattacks come as quite the surprise to Silent Hill fans. The franchise has never been famous for its clunky combat — story and atmosphere have almost always come first — but Okatomo's suggestion that f's combat sequences had been ratcheted up because "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-is-combat-heavy-because-challenging-action-games-are-gaining-popularity-among-younger-players-nowadays"><u>challenging action games are gaining popularity among younger players nowadays</u></a>" has pretty much split the fandom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The legacy of FromSoftware’s Souls series isn’t just defined by the amazing games in its back-catalog, but also the subgenre that’s been given life thanks to its very existence: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-soulslike-games">The Soulslike</a>. While defining one is kinda tricky, there are core elements that tend to apply to Souls games, such as punishing consequences for death, Souls — or a similar currency — gained by defeating enemies that is integral to character progression and can be lost upon death, methodical combat, typically tied to a stamina meter, and checkpoints that reset the world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some, however, Soulslike can simply mean tough melee combat that involves learning to predict an enemy's attack pattern.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a thread entitled, "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mhvpsr/silent_hill_f_is_not_soulslike_and_no_one_here/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Silent Hill f is not 'souls-like' and no one here seems to know what that means</u></a>," a Redditor said: "Genuinely baffling. This is link [sic] second graders being told to name an object and call a toaster a blender. Like, I don't think you even know what a Soulslike is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Having a dodge roll and hard bosses applies to like 90% of third-person games that exist lol. Like you people cannot be serious. Souls games have heavy and light attack, tight-nit dodge intensive combat. You have frame-perfect dodges [...] huge emphasis on stamina management, with shields, break meters, and focus on killing enemies to get c[urrency].</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Silent hill f has like 1.5 of those. This blatant lie needs to stop. Anyone with eyes who isn't full of sh*t can see this is nothing like a Soulslike."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the broader confusion between what and what is not indicative of a "Soulslike" game that's frustrating players, though. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To be fair, nobody knows what a Soulslike is," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mhvpsr/comment/n6zgeh4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>admitted</u></a> a respondent. "This is clearly demonstrated on the Soulslike sub by daily arguments about whether or not a game is a Soulslike."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've sunk hundreds of hours into FromSoftware's games and Soulslikes like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nioh"><u>Nioh</u></a>," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mhvpsr/comment/n6z9t9x/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a> someone else. "Nothing about Silent Hill f looks like a Soulslike other than there's a target lock-on system and a stamina meter. Which is in, you know: a million other games that are not goddamn Soulslikes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Confusingly, others who have also played Souls-inspired games don't concur, however, leading to considerable disagreement to what does, and does not, make a Soulslike game. Is it the melee combat? The need to parry? Or does any game that requires players to learn an enemy's attack pattern count? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I’m still excited for the game, but the comparisons to Souls combat are really clear guys, like come on…" posited <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mhvpsr/comment/n70id3x/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one</u></a>. "Invincible dodge, lock on system, light and heavy attacks, multiple attempt boss fights testing your combat prowess… Even the combat UI is clearly inspired by action games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"People complain about the combat becoming melee-focused like they don't remember <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/09/23/silent-hill-4-the-room"><u>Silent Hill 4</u></a>. Breakable weapons are essential without the firearms if we still want the game to stay a survival horror," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mi55z5/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_see_anything_wrong/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>explained</u></a> another fan. "This whole situation feels like Silent Hill 2 Remake all over again with almost the same talking points."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-combat-has-a-heavier-focus-on-melee-and-is-more-action-oriented-than-silent-hill-2-remakes-producer-says"><u>Okamoto said that tougher combat</u></a>, with the visuals and music's "juxtaposition between beauty and terror," along with the "terrible beauty of the game’s monster design," makes for a terrifying adventure. Even the puzzles are apparently "grounded in psychological anguish and suffering." Quite how players react to all that when Silent Hill f finally releases next month, of course, remains to be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f takes us to 1960s Japan, where we'll follow Hinako Shimizu, a teenager struggling under the pressure of expectations from her friends, family, and society. As displayed at the beginning of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/silent-hill-f-official-japanese-trailer"><u>Japanese-language reveal trailer</u></a> back in March, it is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-the-first-in-konamis-horror-series-to-get-an-18-rating-in-japan"><u>the first Silent Hill game to get an 18+ rating certification in Japan</u></a>. It's out for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series on September 25.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you're wondering, no, Silent Hill f is not a sequel to any of the existing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/silent-hill"><u>Silent Hill games</u></a>, so you can play it even if you've never jumped into a Silent Hill game before. Instead, it will offer a standalone story "independent from the series." That came from publisher Konami itself, which finally confirmed on X/Twitter that the latest instalment of the horror series — which is usually, if not always, set in a sleepy resort town on east-coast America — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-a-completely-new-title-that-people-who-have-never-played-the-series-can-enjoy-konami-says"><u>will be "a completely new title" that "people who have never played the Silent Hill series can enjoy</u></a>."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have suggested <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> contains another card design that looks similar to unofficial artwork, just days after the game was forced to scrub the illustrations from several cards within its new expansion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-suddenly-pulls-card-design-embroiled-in-plagiarism-controversy-as-company-admits-production-issue-and-launches-wider-investigation">The Pokémon Company confessed it had used fan art as a close reference for Pokémon TCG Pocket's new Ho-Oh EX card</a>, found in the hit smartphone game's new Wisdom of Sea and Sky expansion. The matter came to light after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-claims-pokmon-tcg-pocket-features-a-design-traced-from-fan-art-creators-point-out-that-pokmons-legal-terms-likely-allow-the-company-to-monetise-any-fan-made-content-it-wants">fans alleged that the Ho-Oh card's design had been traced from unofficial artwork</a> previously published online. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, fans have pointed to yet another card that may have been closely inspired by fan art: Buzzwole EX's Immersive Rare card, which sees the insectoid Ultra Beast flying through space with one arm raised aloft, in a Superman-esque pose. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While not an identical copy, the concept, framing and pose is very similar in appearance to a piece of fan art published online back in 2017, some fans have now said. But others aren't so sure, and pointed out that Buzzwole holding its arm up, flexing its swole muscles, is at least something the creature is often seen doing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was scrolling through my old camera roll when I thought I saw the immersive Buzzwole but then upon further inspection, it was fanart I saved of him from 2017," Ricky_chimmerton wrote on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTGCP/comments/1metn1y/found_very_old_buzzwole_fanart_from_2017_that" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>. "I know it ain’t an exact copy but this image was definitely referenced for the card we have."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Similar pose, but not the same. It could have been an inspiration, but it was clearly not traced," countered fellow fan Aestrasz. "The issue is not them taking inspiration from a fan art, and doing a similar pose. The problem was tracing the fan art."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Similar is an understatement but yeah at least in this case you can see it wasn’t just a complete copy," wrote Plane_pea5434.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, The Pokémon Company said it would now begin an audit of all Pokémon TCG Pocket cards to ensure it had not provided fan artwork as a reference for any other previous cards. By highlighting the similar design of Buzzwole now, fans hope that The Pokémon Company will take note sooner — and either replace the artwork or credit the original creator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After internal review, we discovered that the card production team provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards," The Pokémon Company wrote in a statement.

<p>According to the blurb, Cliff players will find themselves "trapped on a mysterious island", and the only way to escape from said island is to reach the top of the "towering" cliff. "Do you have the skill and courage to make it to the summit?" Cliff asks. The creator - PewStudio - does credit Peak as Cliff's inspiration, but this seems to be veering much closer towards imitation territory.</p>
<p>Not only does Roblox's Cliff sound pretty much identical to Peak, but its artwork is also alarmingly similar. You can check out the artwork for Cliff below.</p>

<p>Now compare that with the artwork for Peak, and you can see how this homage is not an homage, but basically a copy and paste effort.</p>

<p>Then, we get to the gameplay itself. I've just watched some Cliff videos on YouTube, and again we are well into blatant copying. Both games have an airport as its lobby area (see images below), both games have first person views for climbing, both games have a stamina bar that works in the exact same way…</p>
<p>To quote our own video whizz Alix Attenborough, who I have been chatting with as I write this story up: "If you showed someone this [Cliff] and Peak, they would think they are the same game."</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the Peak team isn't flattered by the arrival of Cliff, and has asked its players not to even entertain the Roblox "ripoff", branding it "microtransaction-riddled… slop". Writing on <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1952475157433549083">social media platform X</a>, the Peak team said it would frankly rather people "pirate our game" than even touch Cliff.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair, there are many titles which have appeared on Roblox over the years that have been inspired by others that came before. The platform holds a plethora of horror games, which clearly take a lot of their ideas from the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> or similar. However, in the case of Cliff, it really does seem like the creator has lifted everything from Peak, and ported it onto the platform, adding none of its own ideas or originality.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked the developers behind Peak for further comment on Cliff, and reaction to its presence on Roblox.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Peak news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/being-able-to-cook-and-eat-your-friends-thats-peak-gameplay">last month the developers added cannibalism as a feature</a>. Yes, cannibalism. You can now eat your friends…</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/peak-developers-would-rather-you-pirate-its-game-than-play-roblox-microtransaction-riddled-ripoff-slop]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Many of us have probably been in the situation where you have forgotten where you parked your car, which leads to pacing up and down the rows in the general vicinity of where you think you parked, while wracking your brain for what level and area you pulled up in. It is a situation that can be panic inducing as thoughts go through your mind, like maybe the car was stolen? Then that panic subsides when you see your car and life goes on. A Dream About Parking Lots takes that situation and turns it into a half hour therapy session.</p>
<p><iframe title="A Dream About Parking Lots — Out Now on Consoles" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sP2EGhbyqwE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A Dream About Parking Lots is a dreamy maze-like experience in which all you have to do is find the right car. You are armed with a key fob which you can keep pressing in the hope of hearing the car’s horn, which sounds simple enough. However, you must navigate mazes of other cars to find the right one, all the while talking to a therapist. The dialogue has multiple choices that steer the conversation based on your decisions. For the majority of the game, it does genuinely feel like you are having a therapy session, trying to figure out why you are dreaming about parking lots and what it signifies in your own life.</p>


<p>Across the 30 minutes of game time, A Dream About Parking Lots will transport you to different parking lot locations, each with cars parked in a generally neat formation, though there are obstacles that will make you look for the correct path. As you move through the dreams each area gets a bit more off putting. Most scenes still look normal, but they can also be a little disconcerting with things that are not quite right, just like dreams. It’s lent a further surreal element by the retro aesthetic, with blocky, simplistic environments .</p>


<p>The conversation between you and the therapist is the main strength of A Dream About Parking Lots. There is no voice dialogue so you have to read and take in what is being said. There are some poignant life lessons peppered through the dialogue with the responses dependant on the dialogue choices. Like I mentioned earlier, this does feel like a therapy session, even if it does not delve as deep as a real one would.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		A Dream About Parking Lots is an interesting little experience that uses a real life situation many of us would have found ourselves in, and uses it to create a therapy session. It is a short and succinct experience that has quite a lot of depth to it, though it isn’t the best looking title.	</p></div>
