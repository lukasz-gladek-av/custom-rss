<p>Get your very own Diancie</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>While today's headline news might be the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension</a> DLC getting a release date, there's another neat announcement tucked in all of the Mega madness.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company has announced a brand new Mystery Gift event, which is available in-game now in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. Accessing this will unlock a brand new Side Mission in-game — <strong>Shine Bright like a Gemstone</strong> — which will reward you with your very own Diancie and Diancite, a Mega Stone that unlocks a brand new Mega Evolution for the Rock/Fairy-type.</p>
<p>All you need to do to access this gift is roll credits. You don't need to buy the DLC either! Easy, right? And from the looks of things, the event will be live... forever? No end date has been revealed, at least, so you've got time!</p>

<p>Diancie was introduced in Generation VI, first appearing in Pokémon X &amp; Y as part of a special event. It's a Mythical Pokémon, and pretty powerful as a result.</p>

<p><em>Will you be grabbing your own Diancie for your team? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate, the 2D-action platformer from developer Bitmap Bureau Ltd. and publisher Reef Entertainment, has been delayed for a third time, though thankfully, players who've been anticipating this old-school take on Terminator will still be able to play it on PC and console platforms before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>It was initially set to arrive on September 5, 2025, though ahead of that launch, it was pushed to October. After that, it was pushed to November 26, 2025, and twenty days ahead of that release date, it was pushed again to its current, and hopefully final release date, December 12, 2025.</p>



<p>"<em>First of all, we want to start by saying thank you</em>," publisher Reef Entertainment began <a href="https://x.com/Reef_Games/status/1986003116022493467">in a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> announcing the third (and hopefully final) delay for Terminator 2D: No Fate. "<em>We know you've waited longer than expected for the release of Terminator 2D: No Fate, and we truly appreciate your patience and support throughout this journey</em>."</p>



<p>This delay is, unfortunately, once again caused by issues Reef Entertainment has had with regard to the physical editions of the game. Before, the issue was tariff and trade-based, with the different components needed for the physical editions. Now that it has all that sorted, it needs to put the physical editions together.</p>



<p>"<em>The physical components for all editions have now finally arrived, following the ongoing delays that pushed us off our previous schedules. However, we now have to assemble the physical editions,</em> <em>which we need some time to do. Because of this, we are moving the launch date of Terminator 2D: No Fate to December 12, 2025, for all physical and digital versions of the game.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We are sincerely sorry for the repeated delays. We don't take your patience for granted, and we never want to disappoint our community. Our goal has always been to deliver the game that you deserve, and we're almost there</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>First of all, we want to start by saying thank you. We know you’ve waited longer than expected for the release of Terminator 2D: NO FATE, and we truly appreciate your patience and support throughout this journey.</p><p>The physical components for all editions have now…</p></div>— Reef Entertainment (@Reef_Games) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reef_Games/status/1986003116022493467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It's unfortunate that players are left waiting a little longer, but delaying the game not for issues with the game itself, but for issues with the physical release, is commendable because it speaks to the publisher wanting everyone who is going to grab Terminator 2D: No Fate at launch, whether they're buying the physical edition or digital version, the same day-one experience. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>At least it's still arriving before the end of the year, and Termiantor fans will have something to play while they wait for Terminator: Survivors, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/terminator-survivors-has-been-delayed-to-2025/">still has no release date despite being given a 2025 release window in August 2024</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Square Enix Sales Fall After Quiet Six Months]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-financials-q1-2-2025-26</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/square-enix-sales-fall-after-quiet-six-months.1345624/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has released its financial statement for the first half of the 2025-26 fiscal year, and sales and profits are down, driven largely by a fairly quiet six-month period with very few major releases.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/26q2release.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> outlining its latest financial results, Square Enix reveals that sales are down by 15% when compared to the same six-month period last year, while operating income has fallen by 28.8%.</p>

<p>The company puts this disparity down to new games generating "lower sales than releases such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-steam" rel="nofollow">three&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>catalog titles on Steam</a>...the previous year". Despite that, Square Enix says its video games business "returned to profitability" this year, largely thanks to expense-related technicalities.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-hearts-square-enix-financials-q1-2-2025-26.jpg?itok=Zda3A23j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-hearts-square-enix-financials-q1-2-2025-26.jpg?itok=LSikqHw6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Hearts</em>' Steam debut means the first six months of last year were better for Square Enix than this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Square Enix's MMORPG segment also declined, again largely due to the release of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>last year. It might <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-inconsistent-vacation" rel="nofollow">not have offered the game's best story</a>, but it sure did boost Square Enix's business.</p>

<p>In fairness to Square Enix, it has been a pretty quiet six months for the publisher. In the six-month period ending on September 30th, Square Enix's catalog consists entirely of ports, including&nbsp;a Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Bravely Default&nbsp;</em>and the Xbox Series X|S release of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>.</p>

<p>As we know,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-sales-3-5m" rel="nofollow">wasn't exactly a major money-spinner</a> for Square Enix the first time around, so its arrival on a console that's struggling to keep up with its peers probably wasn't going to set the publisher's coffers alight.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, however, things look a touch rosier for Square Enix.&nbsp;Remakes of the first two&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>games arrived in late October, and that's a series that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-financials-2024-25" rel="nofollow">tends to do pretty well</a> for the company. A remake of the seventh game in the series is also due to arrive in February.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NetEase Shuts Down Ex-Ubisoft Producer's Bad Brain Studios]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bad-brain-game-studios-netease-shut-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netease-shuts-down-ex-ubisoft-producers-bad-brain-studios.1345621/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has closed down yet another of its studios before its first release, and this time, it's the turn of Bad Brain Game Studios, which was helmed by ex-Ubisoft producer Sean Crooks.</p>

<p>Announcing the shutdown on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bad-brain-game-studios_midnight-riders-sizzle-reel-activity-7391949948268834817-2Wyf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, Bad Brain, which was first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-netease-studio-bad-brain" rel="nofollow">established back in 2023</a>, says that its last day of operation will be November 17th, and that while the studio is trying to find a new partner for its debut project, it has not yet managed to do so.</p>

<p>Bad Brain says that its game and the associated IP are both "still available for acquisition or partnership", and that the studio, as well as parent NetEase, is "open to discussions with publishers or studios who see potential in continuing its development".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bad-brain-game-studios-netease-shutdown-project.jpg?itok=VAGB9xzb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bad-brain-game-studios-netease-shutdown-project.jpg?itok=k9ZNdMvt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bad Brain Game Studios was working on its debut project when it was shut down by NetEase.</figcaption></figure><p>To the end of helping former Bad Brain staffers find work, the studio also posted a sizzle reel of its in-development project alongside the LinkedIn post announcing its closure. The game, according to Bad Brain, was met with an "enthusiastic response" by peers and industry insiders.</p>

<p>From the looks of the sizzle reel,&nbsp;the untitled game would have been a third-person action-adventure game inspired by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things&nbsp;</em>and Rockstar's&nbsp;<em>Bully</em>, juxtaposing ordinary 80s life with delving into spooky locations to do battle with creepy-crawlies.</p>

<p>Bad Brain is the latest in a string of NetEase-backed studios to lose their funding or close down in recent months. Others include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rich-vogel-t-minus-zero-entertainment-netease-shut-down" rel="nofollow">T-Minus Zero Entertainment</a>, which was founded by ex-BioWare vet Rich Vogel, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">Worlds Untold</a>, another ex-BioWare staffer's studio.</p>

<p>It's not just studios that haven't released games, either. In February, NetEase <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">closed down the development outfit</a> responsible for the hugely successful&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, so it seems that nobody is safe.</p>




<p>These shutdowns are taking place against the backdrop of an industry riven with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/massive-entertainment-ubisoft-layoffs" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a>, project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-development-ending-amazon-layoffs" rel="nofollow">cancellations</a>, and studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avalanche-studios-layoffs-uk-closure" rel="nofollow">closures</a>, and there's no sign of the deluge ending anytime soon. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>' first proper patch, assuming you're a member of the honourable sect who don't count <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1808500/view/776434170343719695?l=english">hotfixes</a> as patches, has arrived. It's relatively small, but it does set up three new map conditions that'll be unleashed in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> this weekend, as well as fixing some pesky bugs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delving into the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1808500/view/590661232047948062?l=english">notes</a>, the three new map conditions set to unlock this weekend are what looks to be a night raid variant of Blue Gate, as well as the more mysterious "hidden bunker" and "electromagnetic storm". Here's hoping the last two might be on the same map, given the former sounds like useful shelter from the latter.</p>
<p>Beyond that, it's bug fix city. The integrated shield recharger only recharging when it's equipped, Augment skills not working all, and health regen skills not working if activated while you're down but not out have all been dealt with. Perhaps the most fun mole that's been whacked is an exploit that was seeing deployables push players through walls.</p>
<p>Embark have also made zipline exit points barricade-free zones and ensured the Well-Travelled achievement triggers as planned. Finally, they've added both "a charge progress for integrated shield repair" and the punch hands pre-order bonus emote.</p>
<p>Edwin's been writing a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-is-out-now-and-the-best-thing-about-it-so-far-is-bumsliding-through-a-buried-desert-city">bunch</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-could-get-map-conditions-that-alter-the-friction-for-truly-tribes-esque-sliding">stuff</a> about Arc raiders and you can find <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-review">our review</a> from Samuel Horti here.</p>
<p>"Arc Raiders wants to be one of your 'forever' games: it already has a roadmap for the rest of the year that includes a new map as well as new Arc enemies, items, and quests," reads the latter's verdict. "Its long-term strength will rely on the quality of those updates. I'm not yet deep enough to know whether Arc Raiders will feel this compelling at hour 100 or whether, in two months' time, I'll still be dreaming about it. For now, all I know is that its metallic hooks are in me, and I cannot stop playing."</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="175">You really can never have too much storage space on your PC — especially a gaming PC. Luckily, Samsung’s making it easy to seriously upgrade your setup with this killer deal on its premium gaming SSD. The Samsung 990 EVO Plus comes in three sizes — 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB — and almost all of them are on sale right now: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5372/">1TB model is down 19%, dropping from $104 to just $84</a>. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5372/">2TB version is discounted 15%, now $149 instead of $177</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5372/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="175">This SSD has both space and speed. The Samsung 990 EVO Plus delivers read speeds up to 7,250 MB/s and write speeds up to 6,300 MB/s, so your games and apps will load faster than you can Google, “What’s taking so long?” Whether you’re gaming, editing videos, or working with high-res photos in Photoshop, this drive keeps things running with smooth performance.</p>

<p data-start="1604" data-end="1801">Samsung also makes it easy to keep your drive in top shape. With the free Magician Software, you can monitor your SSD’s health, install updates, and make sure it’s always running at its best.</p>
<h2>PlayStation 5 Compatible</h2>
<p data-start="1125" data-end="1602">And if you’re a PlayStation 5 owner, this SSD can give your console a big storage boost too. The PS5 only has 1TB of internal space, but you actually get just over 800GB of usable storage since the system software need to take its share. With games ballooning in size year after year, we’ve got AAA title well into the triple digits of gigabytes needed. If you limit yourself to the base internal storage, you can really only limit yourself to a handful of games before you need to cleanup your storage and delete the old stuff.</p>


<p data-start="1125" data-end="1602">To expand your PS5 storage, you’ll need an SSD with at least 5,500 MB/s read speed, and the 990 EVO Plus fits the bill. Just remember though you’ll need a heatsink to go with it. This is just a small metal casing that helps keep the SSD cool while gaming. You can pick them one up for roughly $10 to $20.</p>
<p data-start="1604" data-end="1801">For a limited time, you can upgrade your PC or console storage by 1TB, 2TB, or 4TB, and save up to 19% on the Samsung 990 EVO Plus — starting at just $84. That’s a small price to pay to never need to worry about managing your PC or PS5 game storage again.</p>

              <p>Early next year, the 21-year-old MMO&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft</em> is releasing its 11th expansion, <em>Midnight</em>. Alongside new zones in the Blood Elf homelands, player housing, and a wealth of new content, the expansion is also going to see yet another revision of the game’s UI, focused on implementing the features most players currently have to mod in. And this has caused people to suggest such streamlining could be part of preparing <em>WoW</em> for its debut on consoles. However, according to director Ion Hazzikostas, that’s absolutely not happening.</p> <p>“If we were actively working towards bringing <em>WoW</em> to consoles or a bunch of other platforms,” says the game’s current lead, “we’d be saying, ‘We’re actively working towards it, we know we have a lot of work to do but it’s a place where we want to land.'” Speaking to t<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDhK0_vuoJ4">he Unshackled Fury podcast</a> (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-isnt-coming-to-consoles-game-director-says-no-reason-for-us-to-hide-anything-about-this/1100-6535952/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f"><em>GameSpot</em></a>), Hazzikostas said if it were really in the works, Blizzard would just say so. “To be fully transparent, there’s no reason for us to hide anything about this,” he said.</p>

  <p>There was once a time where the MMO’s only feasible home was the PC. While there were exceptions, like the Dreamcast-only <em>Phantasy Star Online</em>, for the majority of massively multiplayer online RPGs lived on home computers. But not any more. However, that’s now all changed. As consoles have become PCs in boxes, and controllers now offer eighty-million buttons, it’s the norm for any new MMO to appear on Xbox and PlayStation alongside PC. Titles like&nbsp;<em>Fallout 76</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Throne and Liberty&nbsp;</em>thrive on consoles, and while the genre is certainly not even a fraction as popular as it once was, it’d be a foolish developer not to release a new one cross-platform. Which all makes it so extraordinary that Blizzard is still not even considering porting <em>World of Warcraft</em> outside of the PC.</p>

 <p>It’s even more peculiar when you remember that the consolidation of so much of the games industry in recent years means that Microsoft now owns Blizzard (a fact that’s weirdly easy to forget, given how Blizzard has always operated so independently, for good and for ill). You would think that the megacorp would rather appreciate&nbsp;<em>WoW</em> on Xbox, especially with the potential for a Game Pass version that’s provocatively lacking the very many paid-for expansions.</p> <p>Still, while Hazzikostas’ frank words seem very final, it’s impossible to believe that the conversation isn’t happening. It would be frankly weird if the follow-up to the Xbox Series couldn’t just directly hook up to Battle.net, and it certainly wouldn’t do any harm of the MMO already had a controller-friendly UI in place. However, what we appear to know for sure is that this isn’t something that’s happening imminently, no matter how much it would appear to make sense.</p> <p>For PC players, however, <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24245100">the beta test for&nbsp;<em>Midnight</em> begins November 11</a>.</p>

In a new trailer released today, developer Game Freak has revealed Mega Dimension will launch on December 10, and it will feature a new Hyperspace Lumiose to explore, Pokémon exceeding Level 100, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>In the Mega Dimension DLC, trainers will revisit Lumiose as spatial distortions begin to form around the city, according to a press release from Nintendo. "Donut chef Ansha and her companion, the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa, will guide players as they explore the mysterious dimension known as Hyperspace Lumiose," the press release continues. "This not-quite Lumiose City is home to newly discovered Mega-Evolved Pokémon and other Pokémon not usually found in Lumiose, some of which can exceed the normal limit of Level 100 with hyperspace levels."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_DHozr0ZBcE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_DHozr0ZBcE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Nintendo says Hoopa's powers are awakened after it receives one of Ansha's donuts (must be an amazing donut), transforming the distortions around Lumiose into portals to Hyperspace Lumiose. Those portals are how trainers will reach this new area, and once there, Ansha can use berries to create new kinds of donuts that grant unique effects in Hyperspace. She can even use Hyperspace Berries needed for taking on the high-level Pokémon of Hyperspace.&nbsp;</p><p>"Trainers will be joined by new allies such as Korrina, a successor to a line of Mega Evolution gurus determined to encounter every Mega-Evolved Pokémon," according to the press release. "Together with Team MZ, players will explore Hyperspace Lumiose, uncover its secrets, and tackle the strange events befalling Lumiose City."&nbsp;</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> wants 70% of its QA work to be handled by generative AI by the end of 2027, in partnership with the University of Tokyo's Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory.</p>
<p>Announced <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">in a progress report for last year's Mid-Term Business Plan</a>, the company notes its reason for doing so, the hope that: "through the use of automation technology, aim to improve the efficiency of QA operations and establish a competitive advantage in game development."</p>
<p>This collaboration between Square Enix and the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory comes in the form of a research team with more than ten members, filled with both researchers from the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory, as well as engineers from Square Enix.</p>

<p>The Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory is a dedicated department of the University of Tokyo which focuses on new technology. It states<a href="https://weblab.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/"> on its official website</a> a desire to "create an ecosystem that is equivalent to Silicon Valley".</p>
<p>Square Enix has stated that within a year since the initiation of its Mid-Term Business Plan, the company has been "promoting AI utilization in Japan", as part of its goal to "Roll out initiatives to create additional foundational stability".</p>
<p>Back in February, Square Enix already announced it was using AI during game development, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/21034-square-enix-co-ltd-azure-ai-search">specifically Azure Open AI</a>. Its CEO stated at the start of 2024 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-intends-to-be-aggressive-in-applying-ai-says-ceo">that the company would be "aggressive in applying AI"</a>.</p>
<p>The company has also expressed interest in Metaverse and blockchain games. <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/2022/html/a_new_years_letter_from_the_president_2.html">The president of Square Enix Yosuke Matsuda wrote in 2022</a> that the Metaverse would play a role in the company's future. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-details-on-square-enixs-blockchain-experience-symbiogenesis-revealed">Square Enix also launched a blockchain game Symbogenesis in 2023</a>, <a href="https://insidebitcoins.com/news/square-enix-nft-game-symbiogenesis-enters-the-final-season">which entered its final season eight months ago</a>.</p><p>Only early this week, Square Enix and other Japanese publishers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japanese-publishers-like-bandai-namco-and-square-enix-are-requesting-sora-2-is-no-longer-trained-on-their-creative-works">asked Open AI to cease training it's Sora 2 model on their creative works</a>. As for as the fruits of Square Enix's AI-assisted labour, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-dabbled-with-ai-technology-for-foamstars">the publisher "dabbled" with the technology when making Foamstars</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/foamstars-season-pass-ends-with-ironically-titled-party-goes-on">Updates for Foamstars ceased at the start of this year</a>.</p>

		<p>Permafrost will be coming to Steam Early Access in 2026, SpaceRocket Games has announced today, but a playtest will be taking place ahead of the early access release. You can register for the Permafrost playtest now via the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2254990/Permafrost/">Steam page</a>. Along with the early access announcement, a new trailer for Permafrost has been released showing various elements of gameplay including base building, hunting, and co-operative play.</p>
<p><iframe title="Permafrost | &quot;Until The World Ends&quot; Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SCZgnFDj44s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a blog post, the development team said, <em>“First of all, thank you for your support and patience throughout the last year. Your dedication to providing critical feedback, suggestions, bug reports and technical troubleshooting during our demo was a literal game changer. With your help, we have been able to lock in the vision for our Early Access release – we have been in the icy trenches since – focusing on improving the core elements of the game, including stability, performance, and key gameplay foundations. So, this brings us to the release date. Permafrost will release into Early Access in 2026. We want to bring the best possible Early Access release build to you – one that’s not rushed, but rather polished and with a solid foundation, built with your feedback, reports, and requests. In other words, it’s for the best. We know it sucks to wait, but hang in there and let the devs cook, it will be worth it.”</em></p>
<p>Permafrost takes place in a world where the moon shattered and Earth plunged into a never-ending ice age. Among this icy world, players will need to find scarce resources, hunt for food, and work with each other to survive the wintry landscape. The game supports four player co-op but there may be clashes with groups that are not your own. The cold will be an ever present danger to all players, so building shelters will be necessary to survive. The development team will be releasing a deep dive on Permafrost next week to delve more into the game’s systems.</p>

<p>As revealed in today's trailer drop, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension</a> DLC will arrive on Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>10th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The story DLC sees you and Team MZ investigating mysterious distortions that have been cropping up across Lumiose City, connected to the strange land of 'Hyperspace Lumiose'.</p>
<p>Here's the official summary from the new trailer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just when Team MZ’s efforts seem to have restored peace to Lumiose City, something strange begins to happen—mysterious distortions start forming all around town. You’ll also meet a mysterious young girl named Ansha, who is accompanied by the Mischief Pokémon, Hoopa.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We can expect new Mega Evolutions (Mega Raichu X and Mega Raichu Y take pride of place on the key art), plenty of Hoopa content, and more than a little eerily-silent dialogue from you and your MZ pals. Hey, at least the dimension-hopping looks interesting enough.</p>
<p>Here's a look at some of those new Mega forms for Baxcalibur, Chimecho, Diancie and Meganium:</p>

<p>As a reminder, the DLC will set you back <strong>£24.99 / $29.99</strong>, and it is now available to buy on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Pokemon-Legends-Z-A-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2827849.html#DLC">Switch eShop</a>.</p>

<p>We've got 4k 60fps gameplay in docked mode, we've got camera integration so everyone's screaming faces can appear on screen, we've got GameShare for playing with pals on one copy of the game, heck, there's even a new chef: The Pristine Platinum Platypus.</p>
<p>A pretty balanced meal, no? Well, it won't arrive for free. Those with the Switch 1 version of the game will be able to upgrade for <strong>£7.99 / €9.99 / $9.99</strong>, or you can pick up the full Switch 2 Edition for <strong>£24.99 / €29.99 / $29.99</strong> on the eShop.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-last-caretaker-out-now-early-access-on-pc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/craft-and-build-your-way-to-saving-the-world-in-the-last-caretaker-out-now-in-early-access-on-pc.1345570/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Former <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">Trials developers</a> in Finland came together to form a new studio called Channel37 back in 2021. Four years later, as of today, that studio has released its debut project, The Last Caretaker, in early access on PC on Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>



<p>It's a survival building and crafting game where you step into the circuitry of a care-taking robot who wakes up to a world that is, quite literally, underwater. You go about waking up the ship you're on, and once your ship's engine is back up and running, the journey towards saving humanity begins, as you explore the vast ocean and hunt for the resources you need to improve your ship, and complete your ultimate goal: saving humanity.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Last Caretaker - Early Access Launch trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xZgDWk0xFNU?start=84&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Along with this early access launch, Channel37 revealed its roadmap for the game, which seems to hint towards the studio looking to get the 1.0 version of The Last Caretaker out sometime next year. Its first major update is coming before the end of this year, which will add new modules, night vision, a new node questline, warehouses, caves, and a basketball game. </p>



<p>Then in 2026, Channel37 has four major updates planned, one to start the year, two in the spring, and one in the summer. Assuming none of those updates get delayed, we could be looking at a release date for the 1.0 version of the game, aligning with its early access release date today.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Last Caretaker roadmap. Image credit: Channel37</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>We're delighted to share our vision with players, and are committed to the long-term future for The Last Caretaker</em>," said co-founder of Channel37, Antti Ilvesuo. "<em>We wanted to make a world that feels like it could exist; it's survival that makes sense. Sharing this roadmap now shows our intention, and we'll deliver all of this and more as we head toward full launch in 2026</em>."</p>



<p>Whether you grab The Last Caretaker on Steam or the Epic Games Store, make sure you have the latest graphics drivers, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-launches-game-ready-driver-black-ops-7-ffvii-rebirth-adds-frame-generation/">NVIDIA confirmed it will support DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation and Super Resolution</a>. You can also play it through <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-add-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-anno-117-pax-romana-in-november-2025/">NVIDIA's GeForce NOW</a>, if you prefer.</p>

			<p>On the first GeForce NOW media blast of the month, NVIDIA has outlined the planned roadmap of PC games that will be added to the cloud gaming service throughout November 2025.</p>



<p>Chief among them is, without a doubt, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The game developed by Treyarch Software will be available from day one via GeForce NOW. Granted, its PC specifications <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch-trailer-pc-specs-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are definitely not too demanding</a>, and playing a competitive first-person shooter isn't something I would advise even with the latest upgrades brought by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-rtx-blackwell-upgrade-cloud-experience-closer-ever-local/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new RTX 5080-class servers</a>, but having the option is always nice.</p>



<p>Other highlights include Anno 117: Pax Romana, Assetto Corsa Rally, Where Winds Meet, and Project Motor Racing. Here's the full list of PC games due to be added throughout November:</p>



<ul>
<li>INAZUMA ELEVEN: Victory Road (New release on Steam, Nov. 10)</li>

<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-rally-revealed-launches-early-access-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assetto Corsa Rally</a> (New release on Steam, Nov. 13)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-final-test-qa-everstone-unveils-its-living-world-wuxia-action-rpg-offering-single-player-and-mmo-like-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Where Winds Meet</a> (New release on Epic Games Store, Nov. 14)</li>



<li>SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide (New release on Steam, Nov. 18)</li>



<li>Long Drive North (New release on Steam, Nov. 18)</li>



<li>Demonschool (New release on Steam, Nov. 19)</li>

<li>GODBREAKERS (Steam)</li>



<li>Megabonk (Steam)</li>



<li>R.E.P.O. (Steam)</li>

<li>7 Days Blood Moons (New release on Steam, Nov 4)</li>



<li>Whiskerwood (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, Nov. 6)</li>



<li>The Last Caretaker (New release on Steam, Nov. 6)</li>



<li>Voidtrain (New release on Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, Nov. 7)</li>



<li>Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage (Steam)</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, NVIDIA confirmed that the Montréal and Amsterdam server regions will go live with brand-new GeForce RTX 5080-class servers this week. The Phoenix server is slated to be the next in line for the upgrade.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>‘s</a>&nbsp;<em>Mega Dimension&nbsp;</em>DLC was a <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-raichu-ranked-2000625708">contentious announcement</a> when Game Freak and Nintendo confirmed its existence before the RPG launched last month because of the price tag. But whether you’re thrilled about paying an extra $30 on top of the base game or not, the expansion is coming and it’s sooner than expected. Game Freak announced on Thursday that <em>Mega Dimension </em>will go live on Switch and Switch 2 on December 10.</p> <p>The studio released a ton of new footage alongside the news showing some returning characters, new Mega Evolutions, and what looks like a pretty sizable post-game story. Here’s the trailer:</p>  <p>As we knew from the original announcement,&nbsp;<em>Mega Dimension&nbsp;</em>will include Hoopa, the dimension-jumping legendary Pokémon, opening rifts to what looks like a different version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431">Lumiose City</a> that includes new wild Pokémon. The trailer shows a few monsters not native to the Kalos region, including Chimecho, Baxcalibur, and Corviknight, the latter two of which are getting new Mega Evolutions as part of the expansion. The DLC also has some new and returning characters, like <em>Pokémon</em> <em>X </em>and <em>Y </em>gym leader Korrina, who is referenced in the main game but never shown.</p>

 <p>Apparently, Pokémon will also be able to exceed level 100 in this alternate dimension, so if you’re going to play the expansion, make sure you’ve got a maxed out team ready to take on whatever challenges await. That said, it does look like one of the new characters, Ansha, will be able to help upgrade your team, so you won’t be completely washed if you’re using some weaker ‘mons.</p>  <p>While the full expansion is a month away, if you log in to&nbsp;<em>Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>now, you can take part in a new, free side quest that will add the legendary Pokémon Diancie to your party, which comes with its Mega Evolution stone. You’ll just need to use the online Mystery Gift function to claim the stone and then complete the quest alongside Emma, Lumiose’s Naruto-running detective.</p>

<p>Square Enix is fully aboard the generative AI train. As part of its latest earnings report on November 6, the company says that it wants AI to handle at least 70% of its QA and debugging on projects by the end of 2027.</p>



<p>They said that a joint research project with the Matsuo Laboratory at the University of Tokyo that is <strong>“aimed at improving the efficiency of game development processes through AI technologies.”</strong> Square Enix even held a company-wide idea contest with a theme of AI that has seen <strong>“several selected ideas developed into projects and currently being promoted internally.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as how the research is being done, Square <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">says that it’s a team</a> of more than 10 people. This team includes researchers from the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory as well is engineers from Square Enix. The overall goal, the company says, is to give them a “competitive advantage” in game development.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time Square Enix has brough tup its ambitions for AI. Back in early 2024, president <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/square-enix-aggressive-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Takashi Kiryu said that the company</a> plans to be “aggressive in applying AI and other cutting-edge technologies to both our content development and our publishing functions.” </p>



<p>There were even plans to invest in “blockchain entertainment” in the future.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Square Enix for comment on if this plan would ultimately lead to layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

Donut chef Ansha and her companion, the Mythical Pokemon Hoopa, will guide players as they explore the mysterious dimension known as Hyperspace Lumiose. This not-quite Lumiose City is home to newly discovered Mega-Evolved Pokemon and other Pokemon not usually found in Lumiose, some of which can exceed the normal limit of Lv. 100 with hyperspace levels.</p><p>Hoopa’s powers are awakened when it receives one of Ansha’s donuts, transforming the distortions into portals to hyperspace. Ansha uses Berries to create various kinds of donuts that grant different effects in hyperspace, such as powering up your Pokemon. She can also use more potent Hyperspace Berries, which are useful for taking on the high-level Pokemon in Hyperspace Lumiose.</p><p>Trainers will be joined by new allies such as Korrina, a successor to a line of Mega Evolution gurus determined to encounter every Mega-Evolved Pokemon. Together with Team MZ, players will explore Hyperspace Lumiose, uncover its secrets, and tackle the strange events befalling Lumiose City.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

With the sheer weight of this blade, it can cleave or smash nearly anything in its path. Players can obtain the Mega Stone needed to evolve Baxcalibur from the Z-A Battle Club as a reward for advancing in online Ranked Battles.</p><p><strong>Extra Side Mission Now Available to Get Mythical Pokemon Diancie in <em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em></strong></p><p>Beginning Thursday, November 6, players can claim a Diancite Stone through the Mystery Gift feature[4] in the Pokemon Legends: Z-A base game. This Diancite stone unlocks an opportunity to encounter and catch the Jewel Pokemon Diancie through an extra side mission titled “Shine Bright like a Gemstone.”</p><p>Once Trainers have claimed their Diancite via Mystery Gift, they can visit the Looker Bureau, where Mimi the Espurr—Emma’s partner Pokemon—will take a special interest in the Mega Stone, setting an extra side mission in motion.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Another year, another batch of 'World of Warcraft could be coming to console' speculation. The instigator this time: the upcoming World of Warcraft expansion Midnight, which seems to be providing Blizzard with a time-and-place to snip away game add-ons and simplify the combat experience. Speculation says this is being done to prepare the game for a long-awaited console release.</p>
<p>Weight has been added to this argument by a couple of things. One, that Blizzard is owned by Microsoft, which of course makes Xbox and is now actively engaged in spreading its games to as many other platforms as it can, including PlayStation 5. And two, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-comes-after-the-xbox-series-consoles-well-its-pretty-much-just-a-pc-even-the-microsoft-ceo-has-said-so">Microsoft came out recently and suggested the next Xbox will work a lot like a PC</a>. Given that, WoW on console seems to make sense.</p>
<p>But Blizzard has poured cold water on the speculation. WoW game director Ion Hazzikostas told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDhK0_vuoJ4">the Unshackled Fury podcast</a> that, "There's no reason for us to hide anything about this. If we were actively working towards bringing WoW to consoles, or a bunch of other platforms, we'd be saying, 'We're actively working towards it; we know we have a lot of work to do but it's a place where we want to land.'</p>
<p>"Our focus remains right now on the PC-based experience," Hazzikostas said.</p>
<p>It's a strong reply but WoW on console remains a perennial debate surrounding the 20-year-old game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/could-world-of-warcraft-on-console-finally-be-happening">I recall asking WoW executive producer Holly Langdale</a> a year ago whether a console release could finally be happening, following the Microsoft acquisition, and her answer was intriguingly cagey.</p><p>"I will say nothing's impossible," Langdale told me at the time, smiling. "I can't say anything more than that." Then, she laughed and started to say something but stopped herself and instead said: "No, that's all I'll say." Then she laughed again.</p>
<p>Consoles are in a completely different place to where they were in 2004/5 when World of Warcraft launched. Not only are they technically more capable but their internet infrastructure and network services have improved dramatically. Plus, Blizzard already runs services like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> across multiple platforms. However, in terms of size, World of Warcraft is many orders of magnitude bigger.</p>
<p>But putting MMOs on consoles is not impossible. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> managed it, to great success, and The Elder Scrolls Online has long been playable there too. What will it take, I wonder, for Blizzard and Microsoft to make the move? Or rather: what's the hold-up?</p>
<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight, the second expansion in the Worldsoul Saga trilogy, is due sometime next year. More excitingly, player housing is being added to the game after all these years, in December, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-kind-of-a-sociological-experiment-for-blizzard-world-of-warcraft-neighbourhoods-azeroth-nimbys-and-curtain-twitching-drama-is-all-part-of-the-plan">an ambitious system Blizzard is describing as "a sociological experiment"</a>.</p>

<p>The production studio was founded by Okabe back in 2004, and has since provided tunes for games and anime alike, even picking up the coveted 'Best Score/Music' award at the Game Awards 2017 for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata</a>.</p>
<p>The team has long served on the NieR series, though you'll also find their works in PS5 titles like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/foamstars">Foamstars</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/stellar_blade">Stellar Blade</a>, the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a>, and they even assisted on a handful of songs in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros.

<p>This is the first time they've had a Nintendo joint to themselves, mind you, and we are big fans of it.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/football-manager-26-cracks-steam%E2%80%99s-all-time-top-10-worst-games-list.1345510/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Steam’s user review system can sometimes be overloaded with user bombing and other unfair measures and tactics. However, the writing has been on the wall for Football Manager 26 since its early access beta, and Steam’s all-time worst games list has sadly welcomed it with open arms.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-26-open-beta-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Manager 26 Open Beta</a> was supposed to signal the welcome return of FM. Anticipation quickly turned to agony after it was found that the game was a bug-ridden mess with an unintuitive UI. Problems quickly piled on problems, and the comeback turned into a nightmare. The full release arrived, and as expected, players weren’t happy with the final product.</p>







<figure><figcaption>It wasn’t worth the wait. Credit to Sports Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Developer Sports Interactive said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-26-was-helped-by-last-years-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Manager 26 Was Helped By Last Year’s Cancellation</a>. FM 25 was infamously delayed and canceled, putting a huge gap in the calendars of Football Manager fans.</p>



<p>Football Manager 26 launched to better-than-expected critical reviews. The FM community wasn’t as kind, and the game’s Steam store page was quickly filled with bad reviews, giving the game a ‘<strong>Mostly Negative</strong>‘ review reception.</p>



<p>This isn’t the end of the world, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-launches-to-mostly-negative-reviews-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 REDSEC launched to Mostly Negative reviews</a>. Yet, it’s still being enjoyed by countless users. For Football Manager 26, it went from bad to worse to <em>abysmal </em>very quickly.</p>



<p><a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/football-manager-26-is-one-of-the-worst-games-ever-rated-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FootballGamingZone</a> (through Steam250) found that <strong>Football Manager has moved to number seven on the all-time worst games list</strong> already. It’s better than Command &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight and FlatOut 3: Chaos &amp; Destruction at least, but it’s a sight for sore FM fans’ eyes.</p>



<p>Strangely, there was no major day-one patch for FM 26 either. Even though it’s <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/football-manager-26-riddled-with-performance-issues-on-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">riddled with performance issues on console</a>, it seems like fixes will be a slow rollout. This will surely risk the ire and patience of those who’ve committed to the game early doors.</p>



<p>This is no doubt a huge disappointment for you who’ve had to wait two years for Football Manager 26. Have you bought FM 26 in any way? More importantly, have you played it? Let us know what you think of it, what needs fixing, and if Sports Interactive has any hope of salvaging this mess through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> community has asked for bigger Conquest maps for months, so someone made their own – and they're actually pretty popular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have spent the time since launch asking EA and Battlefield Studios for everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-to-revert-aim-assist-settings-as-pc-players-edit-files-to-turn-off-crossplay">aim assist tweaks</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-won-battlefield-6-fans-rejoice-as-ea-tones-down-bright-colors-on-monster-energy-skin">realistic skins</a>, but few conversations have stolen the spotlight quite like the discussion around map sizes. While some players <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-map-debate-reaches-new-level-as-players-meticulously-measure-70-maps-from-bf3-bf2042-and-more">went to great lengths to determine if Battlefield 6 maps are as small as they look</a> and others <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-launches-to-mostly-negative-steam-reviews-as-battlefield-6-players-push-for-battle-pass-changes-and-bigger-maps">took to review-bombing</a>, the more creative individuals are using Battlefield Portal and REDSEC to make larger maps of their own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to work from Reddit users kurtinthegrind and andy_6170 (a.k.a. ViperAndyStudios), the Battlefield 6 community now has Club House, a large-scale Conquest play area that pulls elements from REDSEC’s Southern California-set Fort Lyndon map for an (unofficial) version of the kind of wide-open spaces they’ve been asking for. There are also Tech Center and Operation Tech Center map options, with the former set up as a large-scale, infantry-focused Conquest map, while the latter offers linear gameplay centered around one main building.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The credit to the original version of Tech Center and the Conquest Script belongs to Andy,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1on9ras/two_new_br_maps_with_three_conquest_gamemodes/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kurtinthegrind says</a>, “though I've made a few modifications to them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Club House and the smaller version of Tech Center are my creations, and honestly, I'm not too proud of them. But until Ripple Effect/Battlefield Studios provides improved Portal support and releases ALL parts of Battle Royale map, these will have to suffice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both bot and bot-less versions of the Club House and Tech Center maps are currently available for players to create servers, but it’s Club House that’s attracting the most attention online. In the middle of a Wednesday, the map, also known as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oovku6/golf_course_is_the_best_bf6_map/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golf Course</a>, boasts a few hundred active players across different server browsers in Battlefield 6, with some 64-player servers populated almost entirely with real people.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/img-4639-1762378638374.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield 6 Portal Club House Conquest Map Page. Image captured in-game by IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We played a few matches on Club House and noticed that, even with around 30 players on each team, combat encounters feel spread out, with infantry required to sprint long distances to reach each Conquest objective without redeploying. Everything from small vehicles like golf carts to attack helicopters and tanks can help with travel, too, with above-average ticket sizes and a relatively large play area resulting in more room for vehicle warfare and lengthy matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is brilliant," one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1on9ras/comment/nmv6sa1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">popular comment</a> says. "Fingers crossed they actually put these on the official map rotation. For now, I’ll just mess around with my squad."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s certainly a change of pace when compared to other, standard Conquest maps, and it’s an experience those playing on Club House seem to enjoy. Our short time with real-world players saw the in-game chat filled with comments praising the map for its long, clear sightlines and vehicular combat potential.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fingers crossed they actually put these on the official map rotation. For now, I’ll just mess around with my squad.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Portal game modes – Club House Conquest included – have dedicated fans, even if a modified XP rate means significantly slower progression for all. One Battlefield 6 player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ooadm9/for_the_first_time_i_felt_like_i_could_breathe_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>took to Reddit</u></a> after trying the mode for themselves, saying, “for the first time, I felt like I could breathe in this game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are too many small, cramped, and poorly designed maps in this game, and I never had much opportunity to play normally without constantly confronting opponents in narrow alleys or buildings,” the popular post says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think there should be maps like in BF3/4, small, medium, but also large - I know I haven't discovered anything new, everyone has been saying this since the game's release, but we need to keep talking about it until we finally get some comment on the matter.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some have already begun calling for these fan-made maps to join official Battlefield 6 playlists, others argue the emergeance of Club House and other similarly large Conquest maps only serve as proof that Portal is working just as the developers intended. For now, it's unclear if Portal experiences like this could get a bigger spotlight from BF Studios.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although BF Studios has yet to confirm just how big future Battlefield 6 maps will be, we do know that much, much more is on the way. The first post-launch map, Blackwell Fields, was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-map-blackwell-fields-in-the-firing-line-as-players-report-being-killed-from-as-far-away-as-enemy-hq-spawn-points">met with criticism from fans</a>, but another new map called Eastwood is just weeks away. Both locations are included as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-trailer-highlights-blackwell-fields-and-eastwood-maps-ahead-of-next-weeks-launch">Season 1</a>, with more content set to follow in the months ahead as future seasons roll out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Battlefield 6 and REDSEC, you can read IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-review">REDSEC review in progress</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has discussed last year's intense backlash to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and said the unexpected conversation shift "from gameplay to ideology" led directly to its high-profile delay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking during a recent event at Paris Games Week, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameFile</a>, Guillemot screened a short internal video Ubisoft had created to narrate its response to the backlash surrounding Shadows' Black samurai co-protagonist Yasuke — <a href="https://in.ign.com/assassins-creed-shadows/208502/news/assassins-creed-shadows-dev-addresses-musks-tweet-on-yasuke" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which even saw Tesla and X boss Elon Musk getting involved</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Guillemot has now stated that the level of vitriol required Ubisoft to rethink its plans for Shadows — back then, set for launch in November 2024. Ultimately, the company elected to delay the game until March 2025, a decision explained last year as necessary to "polish" the game further. But, behind the scenes, Guillemot says the firm understood it needed to bolster fan sentiment to ensure the game launched to a more positive response.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With more time to improve the game, Ubisoft gave itself the opportunity to share more with fans pre-launch, Guillemot said, something the company hoped would both impress long-term Assassin's Creed aficionados, and move the conversation around Shadows on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What we saw is that, by allowing our fans to see in the game — everything they were going to be able to rediscover — of what they love about Assassin's Creed, [that] ultimately helped to combat this aggression, which is linked to the fact that video games have a very strong impact on the people who play them," Guillemot said. "They’re kind of caught between 'I want to play, and what interests me is self-expression within a game' and 'there is a cultural message that comes with the video game.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So our goal is really to be able to ensure that our fans discover and defend what they expect from our games," Guillemot continued. "It very quickly eliminated the fights, which were just fake fights."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an internal video, also shown last week, Ubisoft described its response as a successful turnaround of public opinion on a game featuring a pre-launch crisis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What happens when a legendary franchise reveals one of its most anticipated experiences," the video begins, "only to become the game everyone loves to hate? When conversation shifts from gameplay to ideology? When everything you say only adds fuel to the fire?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In September 2024, we had our backs against the wall, and that's when it clicked," the video continues. "To get out of the corner, we had to stop focusing on those who hated us. We had to start firing up our allies. So we stopped trying to win the argument, and leaned on what had carried us for 18 years: The Assassin's Creed brand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We started by doing the last thing anyone would have advised. We delayed the game. The extra time allowed the devs to polish, optimize, and reach the high standards fans expect from an Assassin's Creed game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It also gave us time to rebuild the Assassin’s Creed brand pact, putting the markers of the franchise back at the center. More hood, more stealth, more leap of faith, more lore. So we could show that the spirit of Assassin’s Creed lives on in Shadows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Instead of fearing leaks, we showed the game," Ubisoft concluded. "Fans came back, conversations started shifting, and everyone who built, played, and loved this game could be proud again."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows - Art and Concept Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The framing of the delay as a positive response to the game's backlash is an interesting one, though one which feels limited considering what we already know from other reports detailing events at the time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-context-around-the-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider Gaming</a> reported that the game's delay had been widely expected within the company "and desperately needed" to address feedback from playtests and mock reviews (a standard industry practice where external consultants size-up projects before copies are given to press).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking in December last year</a>, former Assassin's Creed franchise boss Marc-Alexis Coté suggested similar, saying that the game's delay was necessary to change the "narrative" of Ubisoft's "inconsistency in quality" (just months after the company's fellow blockbuster Star Wars Outlaws underperformed).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, perhaps most notably, there's no mention here by Guillemot of the fact that Ubisoft's plans to delay Shadows came alongside a decision to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-set-during-post-civil-war-period-canceled-last-year-due-to-increasing-concerns-over-us-political-climate-report">reportedly cancel a separate Assassin's Creed game set in post-Civil War America</a> — a project that would have featured a former slave as its main character. While still in pre-production, the game's fate was apparently sealed after Ubisoft judged the idea too risky to continue amid the current U.S. political landscape — and, to a lesser extent, after having seen the Yasuke backlash.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin's Creed Shadows has gone on to sell "in line with expectations," Ubisoft said in July, with 5 million copies sold so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Shroud has called on his fans to vote for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> as Game of the Year 2025 over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, calling multiplayer gamers “the minority.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Canadian Michael ‘Shroud’ Grzesiek, who specializes in competitive multiplayer first-person shooters, is a former professional Counter-Strike player who has built an enormous online audience. With 6.8 million subscribers on YouTube and 11.3 million followers on Twitch, his call to action has significant weight behind it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shroud has thrown himself into Embark Studios’ Arc Raiders ever since its explosive launch, and in a recent <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2610645158" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch stream</a> mobilized his community to vote for the game when it comes to The Game Awards 2025.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/gettyimages-1054359868-1762430155403.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Shroud wants Arc Raiders to win Game of the Year 2025. Photo by Robert Reiners/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We gotta make sure that this game wins game of the year, by the way,” he said. “Do not let that Expedition game win game of the year. Do not let it. Absolutely do not. We all have to band together to make this game win. Us multiplayer gamers are the minority, okay. We are the minority being multiplayer gamers, but I believe we can win. I believe. You just need to tell everybody. I’ve never voted for anything ever, but I think I’m going to vote this year for this game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the end of 2025 in sight, Sandfall's single-player role-playing game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has emerged as a frontrunner for Game of the Year, but Arc Raiders is being touted by some as a strong contender. Other candidates include Hades 2, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Blue Prince, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, among others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Does Shroud’s comment about multiplayer gamers being in the “minority” ring true? Research from last year indicated that most gamers prefer single-player games, but there's a significant difference in preference depending on the age bracket. <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/most-gamers-prefer-single-player-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Midia Research</a> found that under 25s preferred multiplayer to single-player, with younger generations emphasising social play. But as you get older and it becomes harder to arrange time to play with friends, this preference shifts towards single-player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Younger players prefer PVP, which captures a large swathe of consumer attention and engagement and is enjoyed by all generations,” Midia Research’s Rhys Elliott said in the report. “Convincing players — and their friends — to leave for new titles is a huge barrier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Live-service games are the homes of many highly engaged players. Getting them (and their friends) to relocate permanently to another live-service game is a big ask.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When people talk about the most popular video games in the world, multiplayer games tend to dominate. Roblox games that blow up, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden">Grow a Garden</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/steal-a-brainrot">Steal a Brainrot</a>, typically have a strong community element to them despite not being traditional competitive multiplayer. Fortnite is a multiplayer game through and through. Minecraft can be played either way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The dominant games on Steam, meanwhile, are competitive multiplayer: Counter-Strike, Dota 2, PUBG, Battlefield 6, and Apex Legends are, at the time of this article's publication, the top five most-played games on Valve's platform. And let’s not forget the likes of World of Warcraft and League of Legends, both of which are multiplayer games. There are huge single-player games, of course, but when it comes to sheer popularity, or monthly active users, free-to-play multiplayer games dominate the industry.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In any case, Shroud went on to claim that voting in The Game Awards doesn’t matter. “All the f***ing awards are rigged anyway, who cares?” he said in the same stream. “When have you ever seen an award that’s actually legit?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Geoff Keighley’s The Game Awards uses a combination of votes from the games media and influencers and public fan voting. The voting jury has in the past had more of an influence on the outcome. Keighley has said he’s considered going all in on public voting for The Game Awards, but expressed concerns about “social engineering.” It’s worth noting that The Game Awards has a purely fan-voted category called Players’ Voice. The Game Awards 2025 nominees are expected mid-November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Robert Reiners/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Rockstar Games has pushed back against the claims that a group of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862">recently laid-off developers were removed for trying to unionize</a>. Instead, these people were leaking company secrets, Rockstar said.</p><p>A spokesperson for Rockstar told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> that the staffers were "distributing and discussing confidential information in a public form." This violated Rockstar's policies, the company said. "This was in no way related to people's right to join a union or engage in union activities."</p><p>Between 30 and 40 people were fired from Rockstar's offices in Canada and the UK related to what the developer labeled "gross misconduct." A spokesperson for the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said the affected staffers were involved in unionizing efforts and said Rockstar is guilty of "one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union-busting in the history of the games industry."</p><p>The union said the affected staffers sent messages within a "private trade union chat group" on Discord. The union acknowledged that outsiders were in the chat, too, but they were labor organizers.</p><p>IWGB president Alex Marshall said Rockstar's management are "showing they don't care about delays to GTA 6, and that they're prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game."</p><p>In 2022, Rockstar suffered a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-leak-was-really-frustrating-and-upsetting-take-two-says/1100-6511236/" data-ref-id="1100-6511236">massive leak that revealed the first footage and details about GTA 6</a>. When Rockstar ordered staff back to the office in 2024, the company cited security concerns as one of the reasons for calling staff back. The union <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-reportedly-now-in-final-stages-of-development-as-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-plans/1100-6521477/" data-ref-id="1100-6521477">opposed this directive at the time.</a></p><p>GTA 6 is Rockstar's next big release, and it's set to launch in May 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Rockstar's owner, Take-Two, will release its next earnings report today, November 6, at which time the company is expected to communicate more about GTA 6, or at least re-confirm the release date.</p><p>In addition to GTA 6, it's rumored that Rockstar is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-still-planned-for-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-switch-2-report/1100-6535240/" data-ref-id="1100-6535240">developing PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2 versions of Red Dead Redemption 2</a>.

            <p>Marks and Spencer has released its new Christmas-flavoured food ad for the year, with Dawn French taking a starring role as one of many stuck in a traffic jam on their way home for some festive fun.</p>
<p>Ok, that's very nice and all Victoria, but what has this to do with Pokémon? Eurogamer is a site about video games, after all (I mean, the clue's in the name). Well, it is because I was watching the M&amp;S trailer this morning with my coffee, and when I popped on the subtitles, I got a rather amusing surprise.</p>

<p>At one point during the trailer, Dawn holds a plate of food above the masses gathered in the back of M&amp;S's very plush food lorry, but she is a little unsure what she actually has in her hands. A fairy companion then whispers in her ear, before Dawn proclaims this is, in fact, a plate of pork and mushroom pâté by Tom Kerridge. How jolly!</p>

<p>Except, the subtitles on YouTube can't quite hear her properly, and instead proclaim the Vicar of Dibley actor is presenting a plate of Pokémon food pâté. I checked on another site with a video embedded, and again the subtitles got a little confused, this time instead suggesting Dawn was holding up a delicious Pokémon Shoe. Mmm… yummy…</p>
<p>Anyway, this all amused me, so I wanted to spread some silly kind of Christmas joy your way on this rather overcast Thursday afternoon, and decided to share it with you.</p>

<p>As for Pokémon when they are not being plated up in the back of a lorry by hungry and stressed travelers, the latest video game release made its debut just a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>"Lumiose City could do with work, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is a much more tightly focused - and delightfully goofy - return to better form," our Chris wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">Eurogamer's three star Pokémon Legends: Z-A review</a>. "At least by modern Pokémon's standards."</p>
