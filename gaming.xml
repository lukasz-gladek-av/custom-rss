            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dragami Games and Nada Holdings have announced that they're working together on a new&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>game, as well as an anime adaptation that will presumably focus on the events of the original game.</p>

<p>Following the announcement of the two companies' partnership <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-lollipop-chainsaw-projects-coming" rel="nofollow">last week</a>, a new <a href="https://nadaholdings.com/new-lollipop-chainsaw-ip-development-to-feature-brand-new-game-and-anime-adaptation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the Nada Holdings website confirms that a brand new game is in development. The team includes "key staff members who were involved in the previous title", according to Nada.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the new&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>game will be developed "with close attention to fan feedback", and Nada says it will be free of "excessive creative restrictions in the name of DEI". To that, I can only say "hmm".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-new-game-anime-juliet.jpg?itok=9RkKZHDi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-new-game-anime-juliet.jpg?itok=-kcT7BV5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>game is in development.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't yet know whether the new <i>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</i>game will serve as a full sequel to the original or whether it'll be more of a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/travis-strikes-again-no-more-heroes-launching-this-january" rel="nofollow"><em>Travis Strikes Again</em>-style spinoff</a>, but it looks like original co-creators Suda51 and James Gunn will once again not be involved with this project.</p>

<p>As well as the new game, Dragami and Nada also confirmed that an anime adaptation of&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>is in the works. The announcement doesn't contain any more details about that adaptation, though, so we don't know which studio is working on it or what the story will be.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>, it's a hack-and-slash action game developed by Grasshopper Manufacture and originally released back in 2012. The game revolves around Juliet Starling, a cheerleader who must battle a horde of zombies alongside the disembodied head of her boyfriend Nick.</p>




<p><em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-remaster-remake" rel="nofollow">remastered last year</a>&nbsp;and released for modern systems complete with upgraded visuals and performance. According to Nada and Dragami, the game has surpassed 1.5 million sales so far, which explains why they're eager to create a followup.</p>

Nintendo has put out a couple of big exclusives, sure, but by and large, the draw of the system largely lies in the ability to play games on the go that used to demand you be tethered to a TV. So if you’re thinking of buying the thing in these early post-launch months, you might be wondering what the must-have games it has to offer are. The pickings are slim, but we put together a list of the best games currently available on the Switch 2.</p></div><div><p>CD Projekt Red’s open-world RPG is one of the most impressive technical showcases for the Switch 2 thus far. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> once broke PlayStation 4s and Xbox Ones across the globe, but it runs well on Nintendo’s system. Driving around Night City is still a dream, and the Switch 2’s optional mouse controls are pretty intuitive in the game’s shooting segments. There are certainly better ways to play <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, but seeing it running on a Switch 2 is a reminder that while the system might seem like a pretty lowkey upgrade from the original, playing console-quality games on the go is still a novel experience eight years later. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>Story-driven RPG fans<br><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>People with a weak stomach for some tough subject matter</p></div><div><p>A divine maiden must be escorted across a corrupted mountain so she can purge its towns, caves, and forests of gruesome demonic spirits. There are lots of ways a game could ask you to do this, but <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> settles on a unique hybrid of tower defense and excellent third-person arcade action. Japanese folklore permeates the meticulous, hand-crafted art direction, and Capcom’s in-house expertise when it comes to tight combat and beautiful animations is on full display. The Switch 2 version doesn’t look quite as polished and pristine as <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> does on other platforms, but it’s still one of the most underrated real-time strategy adventures around, made better by the recent addition of new game plus and endless roguelike modes. —Ethan</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>People who love collecting orbs</p><p><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>Anyone afraid of big, long demon tongues </p></div><div><p><em>World of Assassination</em> is a treasure trove of stealth challenges, each one ending in a satisfying execution of a person you won’t feel too bad about removing from a shadowy world of conspiracy and dark secrets. With three full campaigns, side missions, countless arcade challenges, regular updates featuring celebrity targets such as the recently added Le Chiffre from <em>Casino Royale</em> (played by Mads Mikkelsen), and the endless roguelike Freelancer mode, <em>Hitman</em> <em>WoA</em> is a perfect forever game for those of us who like to sneak around places we’re not supposed to be. True, performance on the Switch 2 isn’t as great as it can be on more powerful hardware, and you do need to be online to access Freelancer mode and many other challenges. But <em>Hitman</em> presents such a rich buffet of unique and memorable stealth sequences, each full of opportunities to come up with an endless variety of clever solutions, that you could easily spend an entire console generation playing it before you feel like you’ve mastered everything the game can throw at you. — Claire Jackson</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>People who love sneaking around</p><p><strong>Not a good match for:</strong> People who <em>don’t</em></p></div><div><p>It’s no surprise that the two best games on the original Switch are vastly improved in their Switch 2 incarnations. <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>run at a smooth 60fps on the Switch 2, and if seeing these games running on a device that doesn’t feel like it’s struggling to keep them afloat isn’t enough, the Switch 2 editions come with new content thanks to the Zelda Notes app that adds new challenges and lore to two already dense games. If you played them before, they’re worth revisiting. If you never touched Link’s open-world adventures, they’re even more essential on the Switch 2. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>People who want peak<br><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>People who get overwhelmed with dense systems</p></div><div><p>Nintendo’s biggest launch title for the Switch 2 is still arguably the best game the system has to offer. <em>Mario Kart World </em>is a sublime addition to the kart racer series’ long line of quality party game staples. Though it’s not without its frustrations, <em>World </em>is the chaotic, rollicking fun of throwing a blue shell down a track or barreling through your enemies as a Bullet Bill at its best. The open world is kind of empty, but it’s a fun playground to practice all the cool stunts you can do now, like riding on the wall and grinding on rails. <em>Mario Kart World </em>is all about giving you the freedom to race how you want, and that means giving you more tools, more players on the track at once, and more bothersome items to chuck at your foes. This is only the beginning, and Nintendo will likely be updating the game for years to come. <em>Mario Kart World </em>will undoubtedly be a staple of the Switch 2’s lifetime. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>Everyone, really<br><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>Anyone looking for something chill</p></div><div><p>Y’all, it’s a damn galaxy in your pocket. Do I even need to say anything else? Over the years, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> has continued to improve, expanding the potential of what you can do in its virtually endless playground of procedurally generated planets and ecosystems. Being able to jump into your ship and fly directly to a planet you can see off in the distance hasn’t gotten old since 2016. Though there are many quests and neat challenges you can take on, you don’t have to; <em>NMS</em> is the game you want to make out of it. Want a hardcore survival experience across the vastness of a simulated galaxy? It’s here. Want to set up an oxygen farm on a remote moon somewhere? Time to get digging. Want to catalog all of the lifeforms on a planet that’ll take you hours upon hours to walk across? Lace up your boots. Hello Games’ massive space sim works really well in portable format, whether you’re playing online or off. Dogfights in space. Finding planets no one’s seen before. Seeing a gorgeous vista where you can seamlessly travel to virtually anything you can see. When you’ve an appetite for galactic expeditions, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is here to deliver multiple courses. — Claire Jackson</p><p><strong>A good match for:</strong> Digital space explorers who aren’t afraid to find their own fun</p><p><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>Folks who find survival mechanics overbearing or want a more traditional, guided gaming experience</p></div><div><p>Hazelight’s co-op platformer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470"><em>Split Fiction</em></a></span> doesn’t feel built for the Switch 2. Its split-screen format makes it a pain to play in tabletop mode, so it’s really best played on a TV like you would on your PS5 or Xbox. But once you’ve got it running on a big screen, the game is still a hoot. Though its cheesy writing leaves much to be desired, as a cooperative platformer with a ton of mechanical and environmental variety, it’s easily the best in Hazelight’s long history of co-op games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-final-level-mio-zoe-rader-ending-1851768868&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-final-level-mio-zoe-rader-ending-1851768868">That final level still whips ass, too</a></span>. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>Someone with a friend to play with<br><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>Someone who doesn’t have a friend to play with</p></div><div><p>Fighting games were always going to be one of the biggest tests of the Switch 2's technical capabilities, and Capcom thankfully managed to bring one of the best genre entries in recent years to the system without much compromise in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a></span>. Some of its Switch 2 features, like amiibo support and motion controls with the Joy-Cons, feel like cute nods to the system’s original features rather than something that fundamentally changes the game, so you’ll most likely go right back to standard play before long. Once you do, though, you’ll find a really great version of an already stellar game running at a smooth 60fps. Sure, it’s probably not going to be the version people are playing at EVO, but it’s more than good enough to break out at the function and play with friends. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>The fighting game sickos<br><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>People who don’t like to memorize combos</p></div><div><p>Donkey Kong and Pauline’s latest adventure is one of the Switch 2’s most impressive technical achievements.

Is it the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352">cultural moment the system needs to bring people in out of the gate</a></span>? Maybe not. But it’s still an absolute delight worth booting up if you’ve got the system in its first few months. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>People who wanted <em>King Kong </em>to have a happier ending<br><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>People who can’t move on without finding every collectable in a level</p></div><div><p>Shin’en Multimedia is back, filling another <em>F-Zero</em>-sized hole in another Nintendo console launch. <em>Fast Fusion </em>is a simple but slick racer in which you zip through crisp, hyper-realistic sci-fi courses snagging speed boosts and avoiding crashes. There’s a jump button because it’s fun to jump when it feels like you’re about to break the sound barrier, and a new mechanic that lets you combine two vehicles together to take advantage of their combined stats. It’s better than it has any right to be and a fun, flashy exclusive to show off Nintendo’s new console. — Ethan</p><p><strong>A good match for:</strong> Unreal Engine sickos who love <em>WipeOut</em></p><p><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>Those who get easily carsick</p></div><div><p>The life sim RPGs that helped define the modern Nintendo handheld landscape are alive and well on Switch 2, and <em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em> is the best of them when it comes to rewarding grinding loops that give you a fair bit of freedom. It’s a city builder, survival crafting sim, and simple action-RPG all rolled up into one, with a pleasant art style and music by longtime<em> Final Fantasy </em>composer Nobuo Uematsu. There are so, so many parts, and the sum of each of them offers a progression loop that’s rewarding and compelling enough to make up for its flaws. —Ethan</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>Those who wish <em>Final Fantasy V</em> was more like<em> Animal Crossing</em></p><p><strong>Not a good match for:</strong> People who hate experiencing life through menus </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-best-games-mario-kart-donkey-kong-1851786840]]></content:encoded>

Yes, <em>that </em>James Gunn — long before his days making <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/superman-2025">Superman</a> and running the DCU, and still a couple of years before the first Guardians of the Galaxy.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's press release states that the franchise has so far shifted 1.5 million units, though the vast majority of these — at least 1.24 million — are sales for the original game, rather than its recent remaster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That remaster drew something of a mixed response, as it lacked the original game's licensed music soundtrack and arrived later than expected — after Dragami switched from its original plans to fully remake the game. This initial idea was ditched, purportedly after fans said they were keen to play a remastered version of Lollipop Chainsaw as close to the original as possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's announcement of a sequel again makes mention of a desire to develop a second game that was in line with fan wishes. There's also mention that "key staff members" who worked on the original game were back for the sequel, though no mention, as expected, of any involvement by Suda51. Or James Gunn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Under the strong partnership between Nada Holdings and Dragami Games, development is already underway on a brand-new Lollipop Chainsaw title that both preserves and builds upon the appeal of the original," today's announcement reads. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With a firm commitment to honoring the spirit of the original work, the development team includes key staff members who were involved in the previous title. The new project is also being developed with close attention to fan feedback."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement then concludes with this — an oddly-worded affirmation that the sequel will continue the "distinctive tone" of the original and not tone it down due to "DEI". Is this a reference to Suda51's most recent No More Heroes letting Travis Touchdown wear a "F**k Racism" hoodie, or something to do with James Gunn's Superman, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-gunns-superman-immigrant-comment-was-a-mistake-that-could-hurt-the-films-box-office-former-superman-actor-dean-cain-says">which seems to have upset Fox News</a>? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or, perhaps, it's simply a suggestion that fans of the original's skimpy cheerleader costumes won't leave empty-handed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As with the original, the new title aims to recreate a world rich in dark humor," the announcement concludes. "The development process will prioritize staying true to the distinctive tone and spirit of the original work, without imposing excessive creative restrictions in the name of DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no word yet on when Lollipop Chainsaw 2 will launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/even-85-switch-2-controllers-just" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a> reports that an estimated 512,000 Pro Controllers were sold in the US in the first month of the Switch 2's release, which is a huge number considering the luxury controller isn't necessary for playing the console or any of its launch games, and the original Switch's Pro Controller is also compatible. It's also worth noting that the Pro Controller saw a $5 price hike after its announcement, likely due to concerns around Trump's import tariffs.</p><p>Of course, the kind of consumer who is buying a console at launch is likely to be the same kind of consumer who splurges on extra accessories, so the Pro Controller's adoption rate is unlikely to stay this high for long, but it's still an impressive sales stat for the brand-new console.</p><p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-the-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-in-us-history" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Piscatella gave the caveat that it's difficult to predict how well a console will do throughout its lifespan from its early sales, as early sales usually just reflect how much supply the company has made available. That's not to say the Switch 2's numbers aren't still impressive, with Piscatella calling the console's launch month sales a "helluva good start" towards long-lasting success.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>You can’t talk about Wild Hearts S without understanding what’s gone before. This Switch 2 port comes some two years after Koei Tecmo’s ambitious hunting game appeared on other platforms, taking the monster hunting formula that Capcom originated, and building something that retained enough of the familiar framework, while creating new gameplay experiences within it.</p>
<p>It did an excellent job of it too, with Wild Hearts right up there as the best non-Capcom hunting game we’ve ever had. Here, Wild Hearts S brings the game to Nintendo’s brand-new portable, retaining all of the game’s previous updates and improvements, expanding the original’s three-player parties to four, while shrinking and compressing everything down for the portable platform. In doing so, it’s not necessarily the best place to play, but in a post-Monster Hunter Wilds world, Wild Hearts S sets out its stall as a compelling alternative.</p>
<p><iframe title="WILD HEARTS S: Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gGflRQNZk-I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The original Wild Hearts pushed its platforms to the limit. I’ve played on PC and PlayStation 5, and while my PC brute-forced its way through many of the more challenging sections, the PlayStation 5 version looked decidedly less polished than you’d expect. Some of that was due to the scale and detail that Koei Tecmo pumped into each area, as well as the incredible monster design, while some of it was poor optimisation. It’s fair to say that these issues persist in the Switch 2 version.</p>
<p>As a game that’s been out for a couple of years, and which has received a steady stream of updates, I was expecting a flawless experience on Switch 2. That has, however, not been the case. The frame rate drops below 30fps, stuttering through heavily detailed, larger areas, while there’s visible pop-in as assets stream into place. That’s on top of lacklustre snow effects, flat or reduced textures and a visual grain that makes everything look that bit less detailed. It’s not a great look on the new Nintendo hardware.</p>

<p>That said, it runs well enough the rest of the time, the majority of the central action feeling quick, challenging and enveloping, particularly when playing on handheld, which smooths out some of the issues.</p>

<p>This is a hunting game. The central loop sees you take your character into a large, distinct area, seeking out one of the insanely large, naturalistic monsters known as Kemono, and then whittling down its health with a series of sword, hammer, or spiky umbrella strikes. Killing them grants you a bevy of monster bits that you can then use to make new weapons and armour. So far, so Monster Hunter.</p>
<p>The added wrinkle here is the Karakuri. You can conjure up hunting tools to aid you in battle, and while these start off as a series of crates that you can clamber up and leap off of, they soon expand into barriers, weaponry and traversal tools, with an exciting and interesting combo system that gives hunts a new, more frantic and freeform feel, clearly differentiating Wild Hearts from its inspiration.</p>
<p>Wild Hearts S’ Japanese-style setting still makes it feel like a companion to Monster Hunter Rise, both exploring the mythology and potential of that setting, while playing with the core hunting mechanics. Wild Hearts S is less bombastic, and manages to make its characters that little bit more compelling, a touch more human, than Capcom’s, though it lacks the solidity and assurance of Rise’s well-established monster roster and mythology.</p>

<p>It’s Monster Hunter Wilds, though, that is currently on the minds of hunting fans. The clear advantage that Hearts S has over it is its difficulty level. While it streamlines some of the aspects of Monster Hunter, giving you options to help locate your prey, and doing away with crafting for health potions and other items, Wild Hearts S boasts a series of creatures that will decimate your health if you’re not incredibly tuned in and aware. You need to grind for parts, upgrade your equipment, then snatch the correct moment to attack, bring the Karakuri to bear at just the right time, and it feels, for all intents and purposes, like an older Monster Hunter game. Wilds is brilliant, but, it’s not hard enough. Wild Hearts S is.</p>
<p>While Koei Tecmo have expanded the hunting party size to four for Wild Hearts S, there’s no crossplay available with the other platforms, making it feel strangely lonely for a multiplayer title. I’m sure that new Switch 2 owners looking for a Monster Hunter kick will find a lot to like in Wild Hearts S, but sticking with three players or updating the other consoles to match the new four player count and having crossplay would have helped Koei Tecmo establish a wider community for the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this week, Sucker Punch <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-similar-length-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Ghost of Yotei would last roughly as long as Ghost of Tsushima. Now, in another pre-release interview, the Seattle-based development studio has discussed the map size.</p>



<p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ghost-of-yoteis-map-is-about-the-same-size-as-ghost-of-tsushimas-the-devs-didnt-want-to-compromise-on-density-for-a-larger-map/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking with Automaton Media</a>, Sucker Punch revealed to have adopted the same vision. They didn't want to have to produce filler content for a much larger map. However, they did make sure to make the map feel grander, which is appropriate since this setting is much larger in real life than that of the previous game. </p>



<p>Jason Connell, Co-Director of Ghost of Yotei, explained:</p>



<p><em>Even though the map is roughly the same size, Hokkaido is obviously much larger than Tsushima in real life, so we concentrated our efforts on making the world appear larger than it actually is. You’ll see vast plains and massive mountain ranges towering in the background. This is all scenery that wasn’t as present in Tsushima, and it’s designed to help players feel the scale of things.</em></p>



<p><em>If we did that [doubled the size of the map], we’d have to fill the map with twice the content, and that content would need to be meaningful so as to not tire the player. Ghost of Tsushima was already a big enough game, so rather than upscaling just for the sake of it, we chose to focus on delivering more variety and higher quality while maintaining a similar scale.</em></p>



<p>The development team also improved exploration gameplay in various ways:</p>



<p><em>Ghost of Yotei includes various systems and details aimed at making exploration feel free and rewarding. For example, running through flowers increases your movement speed, and if you follow these flower trails, you might discover hidden secrets. We’ve also added new items like telescopes and binoculars to allow players to enjoy the scenery. All these details work together to ensure that players won’t get bored even on a large map</em>.</p>



<p>Ghost of Yotei launches on October 2 for Sony's PlayStation 5 console.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Itch.io has announced that it's deindexing all of its adult-oriented NSFW pages from search engines and browsing due to "scrutiny from [its] payment processors".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the Itch.io website, Itch.io says it understands this is a "sudden and disruptive" action, and that creators weren't provided with advance notice beforehand, which it acknowledges is "not ideal".</p>

<p>However, the site says it recently came under "scrutiny" from its payment processor partners regarding "some content hosted on Itch.io", pointing specifically to a campaign started by Collective Shout earlier this month that drew payment processors' attention to a game by the name of&nbsp;<em>No Mercy</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/itch.io-deindexing-adult-content-main-page.jpg?itok=Xdbp_IWq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/itch.io-deindexing-adult-content-main-page.jpg?itok=2t9gwK3d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Itch.io is deindexing all of its adult content pages due to controversy surrounding a game called&nbsp;<em>No Mercy</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Collective Shout released an <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">open letter</a> to payment processors like PayPal, Mastercard, and Discover, outlining the (admittedly rather disturbing) ways in which&nbsp;<em>No Mercy "</em>fl[ies] in the face of efforts to address violence against women".</p>

<p>In the letter, the group says the fact that Itch.io and Steam hosted the game effectively means payment processors are "facilitating and profiting from rape, incest and child sexual abuse game sales", which led to Itch.io's decision to deindex adult pages.</p>

<p>Itch.io says it's in the process of "conducting a comprehensive audit of content" to ensure it meets payment processors' requirements, and that pages will stay deindexed while the review is conducted.</p>

<p>Once the review is complete, new compliance measures will be introduced, including a checkbox creators must tick in order to "confirm that their content is allowable under the policies of the respective payment processors linked to their account". Some pages may also be permanently removed.</p>

Last week, Valve <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-pulls-adult-only-games-from-steam-as-it-tightens-rules-to-appease-payment-partners" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">began the process</a> of pulling dozens of sexually explicit games from Steam, citing concerns from its payment processors regarding the nature of said games.</p>

<p>It's been a weird twelve months for Itch.io; back in December, the site was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itchio-offline-funko-phishing-brandshield" rel="nofollow">taken offline for several hours</a> following a phishing claim from the toy brand Funko, which site founder Leaf Corcoran called "bogus" (the claim, not Funko itself). Funko and its partner BrandShield <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/funko-brandshield-itch-io-denial" rel="nofollow">denied causing the shutdown</a>.</p>

<p>It doesn't seem like this situation is going to be resolved quite as quickly as that one was, unfortunately. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Say what you like about Valve, they make the trains run on time. Eventually. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> got a small surprise update yesterday which changed the speed of a train in the 2004 shooter's driving sequence (the level called "Highway 17"). This change will let you once again beat said train in a game of chicken that it has been winning against most players for nearly two decades.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Restored speed of the train near the end of Highway 17 to better match the original shipped difficulty," the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/220/announcements/detail/507335122931941415?snr=2___">somewhat belated patch notes read</a>, alongside a couple of other fixes. 

</p><p>The train in question approaches the player head-on during a tense moment in the dune buggy level, and you hear its whistle through the fog before you even see it coming. In the original release, you could easily boost on towards the train, and nip out of its way just in time, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pXGl-exT8o">you can see here</a>. </p>
<p>But when the driving physics were updated alongside the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2-episode-two">Half-Life 2: Episode Two</a> back in 2007, that feat became <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/220/discussions/0/4629232489537269257/">much, much harder</a> (though not impossible). The strategy then became <a href="https://youtu.be/HU6duSquajs?feature=shared&amp;t=3998">reversing and waiting until the train passed</a>. It's likely if you've only played the shooter since then, you'll think of this as the only way to progress. But now we know: you were always meant to beat that train. </p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>There were a couple of other corrections to the beloved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>. "Fixed missing collision that was allowing NPCs to shoot through some walls in Entanglement," the patch notes continue. "Fixed issue where Alyx could obstruct the player's path when boarding the teleporter near the end of Entanglement."</p>
<p>I don't know about wallhacking Combine soldiers, but the latter bug regarding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYlHX9-IxVY">a stubbornly unmoving Alyx</a> is not a long-standing bug, but a trickling hangover from Half-Life 2's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-life-2-is-20-years-old-and-has-been-updated-with-steam-workshop-support-and-developer-commentary">big 20th anniversary re-jig</a> last year. While I like to imagine there is a lone caretaker employed solely to give the venerable manshoot laughably nitpicky tweaks and bugfixes long after its debut, it's more likely that these are just the last few tidy-up jobs following the anniversary update.</p>
<p>After all, it isn't the first time we've seen the game get re-tweaked because of its birthday makeover. We previously reported how one invisible wall in a sewer pipe was removed because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-added-an-invisible-wall-to-this-sewer-pipe-in-half-life-2-in-their-anniversary-update-but-it-only-annoyed-speedrunners">it annoyed speed runners</a>. I wonder how these latest fixes help or hinder such sprinters.</p>
<p>Still, it is fun to imagine that one dedicated person at Valve, whether they exist or not, who goes to work every day frustrated and disgusted at the missing collision walls of the tenth level in a shooter from 20 years ago, who daily boots up the Radiant level editor to fiddle with its Windows XP-era interface just to fix a problem few other souls care about. Godspeed the invisible Half-Life 2 caretaker.</p>

			<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-switch-2-hands-on/">Nintendo Switch 2 upgrades</a> bring a slew of improvements that vastly enhance the experience, but the latter's upgrade also misses an important opportunity.</p>



<p>In a new in-depth analysis by Digital Foundry of the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrades for the two open-world entries in the series, it's confirmed that Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom still uses AMD FSR 1 in the upgraded version. AMD's upscaler is mentioned in the game's Intellectual Properties page, and a deep look at the game's image quality confirms that it is still being used, leaving a lot of distracting flicker in view during gameplay. This is most definitely a missed opportunity, considering the Nintendo Switch 2 supports the superior NVIDIA DLSS upscaling solution that has already delivered impressive results in several launch titles.</p>



<p>Despite the above and a few other issues, such as issues with shadows not being completely fixed on Nintendo Switch 2, and a draw distance that's mostly identical to that of the original system, both Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are very solid upgrades. The higher dynamic resolution range in both docked and handheld mode returns a sharper image, which improves gameplay by making it easier to spot items on the ground from a distance, for example, and the new higher-quality environmental textures make both games more pleasing as a whole. The rock solid 60 FPS in both games, the faster load times and the implementation of the Zelda Notes round up two upgrades that are among the best we have seen to date.</p>

<p>Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are hardly the only games to have received significant improvements on Nintendo Switch 2. Splatoon 3, for example, sees an <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-increases-resolution-six-times-splatoon-3/">enormous resolution boost</a> on the system, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-backward-compatibility-better-original-system/">unpatched games</a> running at unlocked framerates often hit 60 FPS with no trouble.</p>

            <p>The director of the upcoming Resident Evil film has assured fans of the series this adaptation will "rip", and admits to not actually seeing any of the previous movie attempts as "the games are [his] thing".</p>
<p>Zach Cregger - whose previous work includes 2022's Barbarian, which our Matt describes as "wonderfully unpredictable" - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-movie-reboot-snapped-up-by-sony-and-it-already-has-a-release-date">was first announced to be helming the next Resident Evil movie in March of this year</a>. Since then, the director has assured fans that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-resident-evil-film-will-be-unlike-any-of-the-previous-adaptations-says-director-as-euphoria-actor-eyed-for-starring-role">his adaptation will be "unlike any of the previous films" in the franchise</a>, which may not exactly be a bad thing.</p>

<p>Now, Cregger has shared a little bit more about what moviegoers can expect on the film's release, and it sounds like the director will be working with a deep knowledge of the source material.  "I love the games," Cregger told <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/resident-evil-reboot-movie-zach-cregger-tease-games/">Comic Book</a>. "I played all of the games. I played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> a hundred times through. I'm obsessed with it. And so, I just want to tell a story that feels like it's honouring the experience you get when you play the games."</p>
<p>Cregger added he hasn't "seen the movies", because "that's just not my thing". The game series, though, well "that's just a playground I just love," the director said. "I think the movie is going to rip. I think it's going to rip".</p>
<p>Cregger's latest comments on the Resident Evil film, which is set to star Euphoria actor Austin Abrams (pictured below), come as some plot points have leaked. <strong>This is your cue to head elsewhere if you want to keep your next Resident Evil cinema trip as spoiler-free as possible</strong>.</p>

</figure>
<p>According to internet tipster <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/residnet-evil-134395521">Daniel RPK</a>, Cregger is working from the following synopsis: "Bryan, a laid-back organ courier, is sent on a late-night delivery to Raccoon City General Hospital. En route through a snowy mountain road, he accidentally hits a strange woman with his car</p>
<p>"She survives - but something is very wrong. As he tries to help, Bryan stumbles into a full-blown outbreak involving horrifying tentacle-based mutations and bio-engineered monstrosities" (thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/resident-evil-movie-plot-leak-zach-cregger-3229632/">Dexerto</a>).</p>
<p>Bryan is reportedly the character Abrams will play. In terms of the game series, the only Brian that comes to mind is corrupt RPD Chief Brian Irons (pictured below), who is an antagonist in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a>, but it doesn't sound like this is the same character. Unless this film will serve as some kind of prequel, backstory type set up for future adaptations, and change the spelling of Bryan's name.</p>
<p>Cregger's Resident Evil film is expected to be released on 18th September, 2026.</p>

<p>As for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>, we recently got news of the next mainline installment, known as Requiem. Anticipation for this release is already pretty high, as in June Capcom announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-already-looks-set-for-massive-success-as-it-hits-significant-wishlist-milestone">over a million of us had already added Resident Evil Requiem to our wishlists</a>.</p>
<p>We got our first look at Resident Evil Requiem last month, when Capcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-officially-unveiled-coming-february">introduced us all to Grace Ashcroft and a destroyed Raccoon City</a>. The developer once considered having Leon Kennedy take on the protagonist role for Requiem, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leon-kennedy-actually-quite-a-bad-match-for-horror-says-resident-evil-9s-director">in the end decided he was "actually quite a bad match for horror"</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/new-resident-evil-film-will-rip-director-says-as-plot-spoilers-leak]]></content:encoded>

"We understand this action is sudden and disruptive, and we are truly sorry for the frustration and confusion caused by this change."</p><p>"Recently, we came under scrutiny from our payment processors regarding the nature of some content hosted on itch.io", they go on to explain.

To ensure that we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers, we must prioritize our relationship with our payment partners and take immediate steps towards compliance.</p><p>This is a time critical moment for itch.io.

		<p>The universe is, once again, at risk. In Out of Time, a brand new multiplayer roguelike from Manticore Games, it’s not a massive purple alien with a glowing golden gauntlet, or a black hole that’s threatening to suck everything in, but The Shattering, a catastrophic event that’s destroying all time. Since time is, well, relatively important, it’s up to you and your plucky band of friends to try to set things right. Seemingly, you do that by smashing loads of bad guys in the face. Sounds good, right?</p>
<p><iframe title="Official Out of Time Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epUf3v8GnUk?start=64&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Thanks to The Shattering, all of space and time has been mashed together, meaning that there’s really no reason you can’t have a knight, a robot and a dinosaur all meeting up in a medieval castle, and, frankly, that sounds pretty cool.</p>
<p>Talking about the game, Jordan Maynard, the Chief Creative Officer at Manticore says, “With&nbsp;<em>Out of Time</em>, we wanted to create a wholly unique and original experience that combines my favourite gameplay mechanics: the best aspects of roguelike, real time multiplayer, and MMO raids”, he continues, “The result is an explosive cocktail of epic combat, infinite replayability, and deep social features, set in the unique context of a universe where time itself has shattered, and past, present, and future collide!”</p>


<p>In terms of setting, Manticore might well be onto something here, and time travel remains one of sci-fi and fantasy’s most compelling devices for some serious shenanigans. As a roguelike, you have to assume that death will be on the cards repeatedly, but that you’ll be upgrading your character’s skills while grabbing as much loot from each time period as humanly possible. The trailer sees the action hopping from a medieval setting with a fire-breathing dragon to a present-day 2025 one, before ending in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, with a clear focus on teamwork to fend off the badniks. All in all, it looks like plenty of fun!</p>
<p>Out of Time will launch for PC exclusively via the Epic Game Store this Autumn, with a very reasonable pricepoint of $24.99.</p>

A few months back, Paul Rudd reprised his pre-fame role in a SNES commercial for the Switch 2, and now we have a modern reimagining of a 1989 Game Boy ad for the fantastic-looking Lego Game Boy that releases later this year.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The Lego Game Boy <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lego-game-boy-price-release-date-tetris-nintendo-1851736436&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lego-game-boy-price-release-date-tetris-nintendo-1851736436">was announced by Nintendo back in January</a></span>. At the time it was all very coy about how it would look, and there was no mention of a price. Well, now we have both, and...it’s all incredibly good news! And it’s out October 1.</p><p>The new Lego build looks incredible. It’s a “near 1:1” model, and Lego appears to have conceded to multiple bespoke new blocks to achieve a perfect look. The A and B buttons have what look like unique fuchsia caps, along with a vented curved piece to recreate the bottom right corner of the incredibly familiar handheld. That’s then contrasted by the unabashedly Lego cross-shaped d-pad, to ensure it still has a bricky style. Then there are what appear to be printed pieces depicting the all-important “DOT MATRIX WITH STEREO SOUND” across the top, headphones label down the bottom, and of course the words “Nintendo GAME BOY tm” across the middle. Printed, and not fiddly stickers.</p><figure id="" data-id="6f51fcde1b8cdd32b30bdb4dcc7ec1d4" data-recommend-id="image://6f51fcde1b8cdd32b30bdb4dcc7ec1d4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A human is putting the Lego Game Boy onto its stand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A human is putting the Lego Game Boy onto its stand." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lego / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6f51fcde1b8cdd32b30bdb4dcc7ec1d4" data-recommend-id="image://6f51fcde1b8cdd32b30bdb4dcc7ec1d4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A human is putting the Lego Game Boy onto its stand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Perfectly finishing it off is the screen, behind which you can place lenticular lenses that mean the image changes as you move the block around. It doesn’t actually play games, what with being made of molded plastic bricks, but comes with pretend paks for <em>Zelda</em> and <em>Super Mario Land</em> that you can slot into the back, with the matching lenticular cards to create a moving image of that game.</p><p>It’s 421 pieces, and given the quality and the nostalgic hit, could easily have cost ludicrous amounts. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/game-boy-72046&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/game-boy-72046" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s up for pre-order—ahead of October 1 shipping—for $60</a></span>.</p><p>Right, now for those commercials. In 1989, when the Game Boy was arriving in the United States, the most wonderfully corny ad was launched in which a teenage boy and a robot, seemingly stood on an alien planet, took part in some sort of laser-shooting battle while also playing <em>Tetris</em>. You know, perfect.</p><p>This has been lovingly reproduced, with tongue firmly in cheek, for the Lego build:</p><p>While we’re here, we may as well enjoy those Paul Rudd commercials too.</p><p>Here’s the 1991 original, featuring baby Rudd:</p><p>And here’s the Switch 2 version:</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/lego-game-boy-pre-order-commercial-nintendo-1851786845]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, from Chinese developer Leenzee, has got off to a great start on Steam, following in the footsteps of the extraordinarily popular <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>.</p>
<p>The soulslike game has been out for a day, but has already racked up a peak concurrent player count of 114,132 (thanks <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2277560/charts/">SteamDB</a>). That's vastly more than the majority of the genre on Steam, including FromSoftware's own Dark Souls and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-ii">Dark Souls 2</a>.</p>
<p>The top soulslikes remain FromSoftware's work, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> peaking at 953k, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> peaking at almost 130k, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sekiro-tips-and-tricks-6009">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> peaking at 125k. Elden Ring multiplayer spin-off Nightreign released in May and has peaked at almost 314k.</p>

<p>Wuchang remains far behind Black Myth: Wukong, which has a huge peak concurrent player count of 2.4m as the second most played game ever on the platform.</p>
<p>Still, Wuchang is off to a great start as another successful action-RPG from a Chinese developer, though unlike Wukong it's firmly in soulslike territory.</p>
<p>However, despite the concurrent player count, Wuchang currently has a Mostly Negative rating, with players criticising its poor performance. Its use of Unreal Engine 5 is considered the cause of this.</p>
<p>"Another unstable UE5 title," reads one review, while others call the performance "abysmal" and "god-awful". I've been playing on PS5 and performance isn't optimal on that console either.</p>
<p>So far, the developer has yet to acknowledge any performance issues, or issue a patch.</p>
<p>From this launch, though, Wuchang is yet another Chinese-made action game to find success on Steam. Indeed, Valve released its Steam Hardware and Software Survey back in March which revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/50-of-all-steam-users-in-february-were-chinese-speaking">Chinese-speaking users accounted for 50 percent of Steam's playerbase</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">Black Myth: Wukong has certainly proven big success is possible for Chinese developers</a>, and Wuchang is just one of many action-RPGs following in its wake.</p>
<p>"Familiarity stalks you at every turn in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, a competent, cool and pretty soulslike with a nice twist on death but few true surprises," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review">Wuchang review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The original Silent Hill remake announced last month may release sooner than most anticipated, as it reportedly has been in the works for a few years already.</p>



<p>Speaking on X, known leaker Dusk Golem revealed that the remake of the classic survival horror game in development by Bloober Team has been in the works for three years already, before the remake of the second entry in the series developed by the studio even launched. Considering the current pipeline of games geared towards yearly releases of Silent Hill games, the leaker speculates the remake could be released in 2027, following Silent Hill F, which launches this September, and the mysterious Townfall in 2026.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(2/2) places as an example, &amp; honestly good on Konami not just rushing them out &amp; giving them time to cook), but right now if I had to guess based on the current situation it'd be;<br>2025: Silent Hill f (obviously)<br>2026: Townfall<br>2027: Silent Hill 1 Remake<br>2028: Internal SH Game</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1948196203050782847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>As already mentioned, the Silent Hill remake was announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/">last month</a> with a brief teaser trailer that sadly did not show the game. However, the music used in the trailer left no doubt that the project was indeed a remake of the first entry in the series, which was later officially confirmed by Konami itself. Nothing else is known about the game, but by looking at how the Silent Hill 2 remake turned out, there's no doubt that the game in in very good hands, as the Polish team developed a faithful reimagining of the original, and its best game to date, as highlighted by Chris in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/"> review.</a></p>



<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>



<p>The Silent Hill remake is currently in development. Platforms and release date have yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <p>Ahead of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s reveal trailer later today, July 24th, the camo-clad shooter's release date appears to have been shot out into the universe by a leaker.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time EA's latest instalment of putting bullets in faces while someone shouts orders in your ear has been subject to some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-rumoured-to-get-a-battle-royale-mode-as-leaker-finds-footage-of-an-exploding-dam">leaks</a>. This time it's Dealabs' Billbil-kun, who'se got a strong track record when it comes to pulling back the covers on details about games and hardware prior to official reveals.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/battlefield-6-date-de-sortie-editions-prix-precommande-on-vous-devoile-toutes-nos-infos-inedites-60267">the report</a>, an October 10th release date previously dug up by a group of folks on Telegram going by 1BF is accurate. Billbil-kun claims that there'll be no paid early access bollocks happening around that date, either, writing that both the standard and swankier 'Phantom' editions of the game will both debut on the 10th.</p>
<p>The report cites the open beta that EA cheekily mentioned in a tweet about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-let-battlefield-6-players-lock-weapons-to-classes-in-latest-scuffle-over-how-much-battlefield-should-enforce-teamwork">how weapons and classes will work</a> the other day as being set to take place in August. It also claims pre-order will kick off at the end of this month.</p>

<p>As for pricing, Dealabs being French means that all of Billbil-kun's reported figures are in Euros. They've got the standard edition pegged at €69.99 on PC, with the 'Phantom' deluxe version at the more lofty €99.99 and an upgrade you can buy to bump your standard up to swanky ghost status being €29.99.</p>
<p>Converting storefront prices is always a bit of crapshoot, so we'll just have to wait and see what these look like in his maj's finest pounds and US double dollars with extra cheese.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6's reveal is set to take place this afternoon, so make sure you're suited, booted, and have put on your finest urban camo underpants in time for 4PM BST / 11AM ET / 8AM PT / 5PM CEST. According to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late">reports</a>, EA execs are hoping that whatever's shown will help attract 100 million people to sign up to be shipped off to do some virtual killing. Likely involving a lot of shuffling about with an assault rifle and a walkie talkie. Got all that? Ok, over and out.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-release-date-appears-to-have-leaked-jumping-the-gun-ahead-of-its-reveal-trailer]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza is making us go bananas. From the developers behind Super Mario Odyssey comes the Nintendo Switch 2’s first, major 3D platformer, and we just can’t get enough of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the excellent platforming goodness and stunning visuals, Donkey Kong: Bananza is full of little details and easter eggs. This isn’t a huge surprise considering Nintendo is great at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/60-things-we-love-in-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom"><u>adding little flourishes that bring its games to life</u></a>. And thanks to everyone on staff currently playing Donkey Kong Bananza, we compiled a list of 21 lovely details we found in the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">1. There are dozens of bonus Challenge Courses hidden throughout Donkey Kong Bananza. Each Challenge Course features a different objective, but they all contain bonus Banandium Gems for DK to earn to unlock more power-ups. One Challenge Course found early on in the Hilltop Layer is called Nostalgia Country, which sends DK straight into a side-scrolling level reminiscent of the Jungle Hijinx level from the original Donkey Kong Country. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are four throwback challenge courses in total, each taking Donkey Kong away from his 3D platforming adventure and throwing him into a 2D Donkey Kong Country-style side-scroller. Can you find them all?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2. If you miss the old Donkey Kong Country games, or are someone who wants to maximize your platforming skills, then good news, because the roll jump is also back. This classic move utilizes the momentum of DK’s rolls to extend the distance of his jumps. This helpful skill returns in Donkey Kong Bananza and works identically to the original games. Roll off an edge by pressing ZL and then use the forward momentum to jump and increase the distance you’re able to cross.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">3. While DK can punch most anything in the game, trying to throw a punch at a friendly ape or NPC will instead lead him to give them a friendly high-five or a thumbs-up instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">4. The Freezer Layer is occupied by a bunch of friendly Zebras who end their sentences in “brah.” Because they’re<em> Ze-brahs</em>, get it?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/dkpromo3-1752740852728.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">5. You can unlock a spin move for DK if you collect enough Banandium Gems, which lets DK spin in place before a long jump. Rather than spin with him, Pauline will jump onto the twirling DK and run around him as if on a treadmill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">6. Not only can DK bust through solid objects, but he can also pick up chunks of the ground to use as makeshift weapons that he can either swing like a club or throw. But DK can also throw these chunks directly into barrels to launch them high into the air, in case you need to transport some ground chunks with you where you’re going.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">7. Also, if there’s an enemy in the barrel’s path, the chunk will launch straight at them and take them out.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">8. If you happen to be near a chair while idling, DK’s animation will change, and he’ll sit on the chair to rest. This is just a fun bonus animation and won’t heal DK’s health, however.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">9. Just like Link in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, DK shivers when he’s too cold and sweats when he’s too hot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">10. Music is integral to Donkey Kong, and Bananza includes a lot of remixes of David Wise’s songs from Donkey Kong Country. Sleeping in a shelter, for example, will play a remix of the Donkey Kong Country main menu music.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/2025071617050500-c-1753089846712.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">11. Throughout Donkey Kong Bananza, there are hidden fossils that DK can collect and exchange for various clothing items and cosmetics. While the fossils might just seem like a fun collectible at first, they are, in fact, references to past Donkey Kong games. For example, one of the fossils DK can collect is a pig fossil, which is a reference to the checkpoint pigs from Retro Studio’s Donkey Kong Country Returns and Tropical Freeze.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">12. DK can purchase new clothes for himself and Pauline that offer additional bonuses, like reducing burn damage or doubling the amount of gold you earn. Towards the end of the game, Pauline will even unlock the Diva Dress. While the dress’s ability makes it so collectible music discs are twice as likely to appear after defeating an enemy, its design is identical to the red dress that an older Pauline wears in Super Mario Odyssey.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/14/donkey-kong-and-pauline-amiibo-photo-1752488456414.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">13. DK can also unlock a specially designed piece of clothing later on, called the Girded Britches. They not only reduce damage from thorns and spikes, but the design features the beams and ladders from the original Donkey Kong arcade game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">14. There are many different biomes in Donkey Kong Bananza, including some with large bodies of water, like in the Lagoon Layer. If you decide to hop into the water for a quick swim before getting out, DK will shake off the excess water from his fur. It’s very cute.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/03/dk-blog-1751550138869.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">15. Sometimes a biome’s ground is made of soil, but other times it can be made up of wood or even metal. While DK should be able to tear through most of these materials, each type of terrain has its own unique sound effect. Wood will chip away, while metal will have a specific “clang” to it when DK busts through.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/16/screenshot-4130-1752643380227.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">16. Early in the game, DK will meet a mysterious figure known only as Odd Rock. In order to free Odd Rock from her predicament, DK will whistle for her, and the tune he chooses is a perfect countermelody to the original Donkey Kong Country theme!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">17. Donkey Kong Bananza includes amiibo functionality as well, but in order to redeem your reward from scanning an amiibo onto your Switch 2, you’ll need to find a specific NPC. This NPC is named Collectone, whom you can find in the Resort Layer. You’ll recognize him because he’s standing on an amiibo base!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">18. While moving between the different layers in Donkey Kong Bananza is mostly seamless, there are still some loading screens you’ll encounter. Luckily, the loading screens feature cute illustrations of the different characters in the game, and different illustrations of new characters will begin to appear the further you get.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">19. A variety of shopkeepers appear in various layers throughout Donkey Kong Bananza. You’ll know who sells what because these gem-like shopkeepers will appear in the shape of whatever they’re selling. The clothes sellers, for instance, will take on the shape of a shirt.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/dkbananza-finalprev-blogroll-1751307467703.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">20. Aside from Cranky Kong, DK’s nephew Diddy Kong and his girlfriend Dixie Kong also appear in Donkey Kong Bananza as the managers of an underground race track, appropriately in the Racing Layer. When you first encounter them, Dixie Kong will tell DK how Candy Kong, DK’s girlfriend who first appeared in Donkey Kong Country, will be jealous that the three of them are hanging out without her.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">21. Speaking of the original game, Cranky Kong, the original Donkey Kong from the arcade game that was first released in 1981, even makes a reference to Mario. If you find Cranky in the Lagoon Layer, he’ll tell DK, “Back in my day, rivals had charisma. And overalls.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the little details we loved in Donkey Kong Bananza.

In <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content">a blog post on Thursday</a>, Itch.io creator Leaf Corcoran said that the update was due to concerns that the website’s payment processors had “about the nature of certain content” hosted on the platform, following similar scrutiny against Steam.</p><p>“Our ability to process payments is critical for every creator on our platform,” said Corcoran. “To ensure that we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers, we must prioritize our relationship with our payment partners and take immediate steps towards compliance.”</p><p>While Itch.io hosts a variety of gaming content, adult and pornographic titles are often among the top-sellers on the platform. Content creators who host their work on Itch.io were given no warning ahead of the decision. “We know this is not ideal, and we apologize for the abruptness of this change,” said Corcoran. It’s unclear if customers are currently <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knybgc4siigl22kc5t4new4w/post/3luoizccnzx2y">able to access</a> games and visual novels that they had paid for prior to the update. We’ve reached out to Itch.io for clarification.</p><div><p>Credit card companies like Visa and Mastercard have rules that restrict some kinds of illegal and NSFW content. Steam <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-pulls-adult-only-games-from-steam-as-it-tightens-rules-to-appease-payment-partners">similarly purged some adult titles</a> last week after quietly changing its policy guidelines to ban any content that might violate rules set by the platform’s payment providers and card networks. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/itch.io/post/3luovbe444k2h">Backlash against</a> <a href="https://x.com/basterbinez/status/1948198319471415683">both gaming</a> <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/itch-follows-in-steams-footsteps-and-nukes-adult-games-you-cant-even-download-them-anymore-if-you-paid-for-them.1251720/">platforms online</a> has likened the situation to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18129532/tumblr-nsfw-porn-ban-fallout-storystream-updates-news">Tumblr banning pornographic content</a> in 2018, a decision that Matt Mullenweg, CEO of Tumblr’s parent company, Automattic, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23377446/tumblr-matt-mullenweg-post-nsfw-porn-internet-service-moderation-policies">attributed to pressure from credit card companies</a>, and is widely believed to have driven many users away from the platform.</p></div><p>Itch.io has yet to provide full guidance for creators that outlines the content that will be permitted on the platform following this change, but notes that creators will be required to confirm that their NSFW content abides by any rules set by their account’s payment processors.

<p>Things do start off firmly in Mos Eisley territory though. You recycle industrial trash heaps to clear space for dining rooms, where the shanky lookin' clientele sit on rusted barrels and order a soup made from canonically repulsive beans. The advisor informs me the beans taste so awful that they used to be illegal. This implies the existence of some sort of rough-edged intergalactic bean squad. See if you can spot them in the trailer below. </p>

<p>Aside from spacebux and ingredients, the main resource you'll be hunting after here is fame. Make customers happy with exciting new recipes and slightly less awful chairs to sit on, and they'll go tell their space mates how great you are. I do like it when a management game tangibly rewards you for spiffing up the joint. You can also send a ship off to explore space for treasure.

            <p>Thousands of creators today found their Itch.io projects missing from the online storefront - effectively delisted to anyone searching or browsing the site.

<p>Going by one image posted on the Itch Discord and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/daff.space/post/3luounfexf22c">shared on Bluesky</a> by game developer Daffodil, filtering by the site's 'NSFW' category previously showed 28,114 results. It now shows 7,008.</p>

<p>After creators were left in limbo for several hours, Itch.io posted <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content">a statement</a> clarifying that they'd "deindexed" all NSFW work content from their browse and search pages, following "a campaign" against them and Steam by the Collective Shout organisation, that targeted payment providers "due to a game titled No Mercy, which was temporarily available on itch.io before being banned back in April".</p>
<p>Collective Shout describe themselves as a "grassroots campaigns movement against the objectification of women and the sexualisation of girls", but are associated with outspokenly homophobic and anti-abortion Christian conservative groups, according to a <a href="https://archive.ph/x5cGQ#selection-1137.55-1137.118">now-deleted Vice article</a>. They recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">claimed credit for the campaign</a> that saw payment providers pressuring the online storefronts to remove content the group deemed unacceptable.</p>
<p>"Our ability to process payments is critical for every creator on our platform," reads Itch's statement. "To ensure that we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers, we must prioritize our relationship with our payment partners and take immediate steps towards compliance."</p>
<p>"This is a time critical moment for itch.io," the statement continues. "The situation developed rapidly, and we had to act urgently to protect the platform’s core payment infrastructure. Unfortunately, this meant it was not realistic to provide creators with advance notice before making this change. We know this is not ideal, and we apologize for the abruptness of this change."</p>
<p>It's not hard to empathise with the folks behind Itch for being placed in an impossible position, but their lack of forewarning has left creators blindsided and in some cases, seemingly without income. "I wish we had gotten some warning from Steam and Itch," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/radiatoryang.bsky.social/post/3luokzr44d22p">wrote game developer Robert Yang</a> on Bluesky, "but we already know it's Collective Shout + payment processors waging culture war against LGBTQ people and sexual expression. I guess there's nothing else for Steam and Itch to say".</p>
<p>Itch say they're currently "conducting a comprehensive audit" to meet their payment processor's requirements, and that affected pages will remain "deindexed" in the meantime. New compliance measures will follow. "For NSFW pages, this will include a new step where creators must confirm that their content is allowable under the policies of the respective payment processors linked to their account".</p>
<p>"Part of this will see some pages being permanently removed from itch.io," the statement concludes. We can get an idea of the parameters here from Itch's own notices sent to some creators. These include "sexualised images or videos of real-life humans", "AI generated imagery that is designed to resemble photographic content of real people", "content glorifying sexual violence", and that depicting "minors, minor-presenting, or suggested minors". Which, taken in good faith, are all in line with what you'd expect and hope for.</p>
<p>Personally speaking, I'd be willing to extend that good faith to Itch.io themselves, but they aren't the one holding the gun to their own heads here. That'd be financial companies, pressured by Collective Shout, who themselves have ties to an organisation whose CEO once described gay marriage as an "unspeakable offence to God". It's not difficult to imagine what kind of expression these groups might decide to deem as unacceptable next.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects]]></content:encoded>

Following the brief hosting of a game called <em>No Mercy</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/no-mercy-sexual-assault-incest-sim-steam-removed-uk-pc-1851775725?_gl=1*khhomg*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTMxODIyODckbzE3JGcxJHQxNzUzMzQ0ODYxJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/no-mercy-sexual-assault-incest-sim-steam-removed-uk-pc-1851775725?_gl=1*khhomg*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTMxODIyODckbzE3JGcxJHQxNzUzMzQ0ODYxJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">both Steam and Itch became the target of a great deal of media attention</a></span>, with the game eventually pulled from sale by both its hosts and its creators.</p><p>At the time, Valve were removing only extreme porn titles, almost all related to rape and incest, leading many to find the move difficult to oppose. However, it was also pointed out that such moves, when carried out as haphazardly and unclearly as this—with responsibility for content guidelines handed to external financial corporations—inevitably lead to overreach, and LGBTQ+ games and those that explore controversial topics will always be the first to be unfairly affected. As we wrote last week,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> One of the real positives of Valve’s incredibly liberal approach to what it will sell is that it allows incredibly complex and difficult topics to be explored by brave developers. People regularly interrogate their own traumas through visual novels and interactive fiction, while others explore their sexual kinks via similar mediums. Victims of incest might want to create incredibly challenging games that process such experiences in healthy and productive ways—what happens here if it’s to turn out that “certain kinds” of adult themes includes such topics?</p></blockquote><p>On July 23, far more extreme moves were made by Itch.io, the colossal indie game store <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/itch-io-bundle-no-ice-in-california-table-top-rpg-1851786085&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/itch-io-bundle-no-ice-in-california-table-top-rpg-1851786085">best known for its massive fundraising drives for various causes</a></span>. It “shadow banned” every game marked “NSFW” (“not safe for work”) on the store, meaning they would not appear on the store’s main pages, nor in indexed search results. Without a direct link, any such game is now impossible to find. In this process, swathes of LGBTQ+ games have vanished from the online store, including titles from high profile LGBTQ+ developers like Robert Yang. (You can still find all of Yang’s games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://radiatoryang.itch.io/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://radiatoryang.itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via his direct link</a></span> if you’re logged in.)</p><p>Even more extraordinarily, this year’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://igf.com/entry/2025/consume-me&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://igf.com/entry/2025/consume-me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seumas McNally Grand Prize award winner at the prestigious IGF Awards</a></span>, <em>Consume Me</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>is no longer appearing on Itch. (You <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2359120/Consume_Me/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2359120/Consume_Me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can still find it on Steam</a></span>.) The game, a piece about disordered eating during teenage years, is a semi-autobiographical work that bravely explores a complex and difficult topic. Its developer, Jenny Jiao Hsia, responsibly marked the game as “adult” on Itch due to the sensitive topic and occasional semi-nudity, and as such her game is now delisted.</p><p>Collective Shout is an anti-porn Australian pressure group that has learned by applying pressure to payment providers, it can indirectly control the content of sites that depend on online payments. In response to their recent actions, carried out in the name of “challenging the objectification of women and sexualization of girls in media, advertising and popular culture,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.collectiveshout.org/gamers-threats-and-abuse&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/gamers-threats-and-abuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they have been inundated with wretched online misogyny</a></span>. Obviously many will be very receptive to their stated goals of protecting children from porn and objecting to games that simulate rape. Others will point out that the blunt tools of censorship do little to educate audiences, and inevitably lead to vast amounts of collateral damage.</p><p>It seems reasonably likely that <em>Consume Me</em> will return to Itch after the site’s “comprehensive audit of content,” given how egregious it is that it should be removed in any situation. But what about the games exploring topics related to gay sex by Yang? Or the thousands and thousands of other sex- and kink-based games that are now missing? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Itch’s statement</a></span> says it plans to “introduce new compliance measures,” where NSFW games will be required to “confirm their content is allowable under the policies of the respective payment processors linked to their account.”</p><p>“This is a time critical moment for itch.io,” the statement reads. “The situation developed rapidly, and we had to act urgently to protect the platform’s core payment infrastructure. Unfortunately, this meant it was not realistic to provide creators with advance notice before making this change. We know this is not ideal, and we apologize for the abruptness of this change.”</p><p>Again, what is “allowable” according to payment processors is the most extraordinary deferment of responsibility, and of course an ever-shifting goalpost that developers can never be in a position to discern. Mastercard and Visa’s moral objections seem like the most bewildering standard to adhere to, and are already being wielded without any notion of nuance. What is the difference in the eyes of a behemothic financial corporation between a porn game about incestuous rape, and an introspective game in which a developer interrogates their own childhood experiences of incestuous rape?</p><p>“We ask for your patience and understanding as we navigate this challenging period,” says Itch of its sudden and sweeping move. “I’m sorry we can not share more at this time as we are still getting a full understanding of the situation ourselves.”</p><p>We’ve reached out to Itch to ask when the store will resume sales of games that clearly aren’t in violation of any standards issues, and to see if we can get any clarity regarding how developers are supposed to know what is “allowable” in the eyes of payment processors.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/itch-io-nsfw-porn-games-delisted-collective-shout-1851786841]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to Epic, the CMA has "deprioritized store competition entirely, to be considered sometime in 2026." It references the EU's Digital Markets Act as a benchmark for allowing alternative app stores on mobile devices, citing a number of alternative stores that have sprung up in Europe including AltStore, Aptoide, and its own Epic Games Store.</p><p>"The CMA also made a vague announcement about allowing developers to steer customers to payment service outside of apps, without referencing the kinds of restrictions, obstructions and junk fees that Apple introduced in Europe to make a mockery of the Digital Markets Act," Epic's statement continues. "Unless Apple and Google are completely blocked from imposing fees and discriminating against apps using out-of-app payment, we can expect years of malicious compliance ahead."</p><p>Epic again references one of its previous legal battles here, saying that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-asks-court-to-force-apple-to-return-fortnite-to-us-app-store/1100-6531659/" data-ref-id="1100-6531659">recent US court order against Apple</a> has set the standard by outlawing all fees and obstructions on apps that choose to direct customers to external payment services.</p><p>"Today's bleak news from the United Kingdom contrasts to the stronger pro-competition actions of other regions," Epic concludes, though the company will no doubt continue to put pressure on the CMA to introduce stronger antitrust laws targeting Apple and Google. Outside of its victories in Europe and the US, Epic says that the Epic Games Store will also be launched in Brazil and Japan later this year.</p>

Companies hire up in the midst of development, when there's lots to do—character dialogue to write, bodies to animate, and systems to code. Then come the cuts: Once a video game is released, people are laid off. Not everyone, of course; enough workers are kept on to update and maintain the game, and, eventually, start on a new project. Development happens in cycles, and those cycles have consistently left developers on edge. Layoffs were a constant hum long before the pandemic, but over the past several years, that hum has become a deafening roar.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2022, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">a crowd-sourced layoff tracker</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from developer Farhan Noor recorded 8,500 layoffs. That number jumped to an unsettling 10,500 in 2023, and 14,600 in 2024. Now, in 2025, Noor's layoff tracker lists this year's layoffs at 4,000. While 2024 was almost certainly the peak of the grim years-long trend, layoffs are still an issue. Seven months into 2025, the 4,000 people estimated to have been laid off is likely a conservative number. (The tracker hasn't been updated since July 9, and several totals are unlisted, as those numbers haven't been released or published.) But to compare the years, by June 2024, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.polygon.com/24177290/video-game-industry-layoffs-studio-closures-record">more than 10,000 people had been laid off</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/mobile-dev-sandsoft-is-laying-off-around-65-employees-and-closing-two-studios" target="_self" data-discover="true">Update: Mobile developer Sandsoft is laying off 21 internal developers to 'double down' on publishing</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, it still feels like layoffs are as constant and looming as ever. Hundreds of people were laid off in July across more than a dozen studios, led by massive cuts at Microsoft, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-xbox-begins-latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-with-cuts-at-king-and-zenimax">which laid off 9,000 tech workers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, including at least hundreds at its video game companies. Game Developer wrote about layoffs at four different studios on Tuesday alone. Support studio Virtuos, Wardogs developer Bulkhead, Myst maker Cyan Worlds, MindsEye creator Build a Rocket Boy, and many others are among the studios recently making cuts, while Riot Games recently canceled its long-gestating </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hytale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> project from Hypixel Studios. Even if the numbers show slowing layoff rates, it certainly doesn't feel like it when multiple studios are cutting staff in a single day. The industry and its people will still be feeling the impacts of it for years to come.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What goes up must come down—but thousands of workers are still being laid off">What goes up must come down—but thousands of workers are still being laid off</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Amir Satvat, a Tencent business developer who runs an online community that helps laid off&nbsp;game workers find jobs, wrote in February that hiring has started to match the rate at which people are getting laid off.

People spent a lot of money on video games when they were stuck at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Games were both a thing to do and a place for socialization. Investors saw that number going up—way up—and injected the industry with more cash. Companies hired more people to keep up with the growth. But the massive growth was never sustainable, and when that line plateaued, companies realized they'd overinvested and overextended. Companies started to make cuts—lots of them. The video game industry has returned to growth in 2025 following a plateau in 2024, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/into-the-data-pc-console-gaming-report-2025">according to a Newzoo report from June</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

It means consumers don't have as much money to spend on video games—especially young people, who are spending 25 percent less on video games, according to data analysis from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/young-american-consumer-spending-cut-f2b482e5">the Wall Street Journal</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It's something that is sure to impact revenue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One big change that sets 2025 apart from the past several years, though, is that hiring is beginning to match the rate at which people are being laid off. Headcounts are up across several studios (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wait-a-minute-eas-headcount-rose">as Game File reported earlier this year</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) despite several of those companies making layoffs. Hiring isn't typically publicized in the same way as layoffs, so it often happens in the background. Similarly, companies like Electronic Arts, when they make layoffs, might attempt to place laid off employees elsewhere in the business, which could account for at least some of the headcount differentials. North American workers appear to be impacted the most, perhaps because it’s one of the more expensive labor markets. Some of that growth in headcount could be a result of expansion in lower-cost areas.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Game companies are hiring, but the job market is saturated and knowledge is scattered">Game companies are hiring, but the job market is saturated and knowledge is scattered</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though hiring has increased—and now remains stable—it would be foolish to believe it's easy for a laid off worker to find a job. It's not. The sheer number of people looking for work in the video game industry means there is now a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>ton</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of competition. Nearly 40,000 people have been laid off, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">according to community trackers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. That's a lot of people attempting to navigate the job market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's also vital to acknowledge the impact layoffs have on developers and the projects they're working on. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/709144/microsoft-layoffs-2025-ai-notepad">As The Verge reported in July</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the layoffs at Microsoft are creating a culture of fear at the company.

Video games are complicated, expensive endeavours. A successful studio is one that pulls the collective knowledge and experience of its team </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>through</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> development cycles. If you lose that, you might lose the key to success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This carcass of workers that remains is somehow supposed to keep shipping award-winning games," ZeniMax Media senior QA tester and ZWU-CWA member Autumn Mitchell told Game Developer, explaining the difficult reality facing those developers left behind at The Elder Scrolls maker after Microsoft kicked some employees with decades of knowledge to the curb. "I don't really know [how that works]. It looks like a lot of people moving between projects to fill in the position of someone who was laid off—and it probably took them a good six months to figure out [how to do that role effectively]."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One company that’s often cited as an example of what happens when you keep teams together and resist sweeping layoffs is Nintendo. Indeed, newly-published data reflects Nintendo's ability to keep employees on board. Just yesterday, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-employee-data-indicates-the-company-excels-at-retaining-workers">Game Developer printed numbers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from a newly-updated investor relations page that showed Nintendo Japan employees stay at the company for an average of 14.4 years. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/24191650/nintendo-sega-from-software-japan-video-game-layoffs">Japan has more labor protections for employees</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which certainly plays a part in why employees stick around, too. The turnover rate is a stunning 1.9 percent in Japan and 5.1 percent at Nintendo of America. You can see the way Nintendo builds upon its past in its games; </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a perfect example of how institutional knowledge leads to massive success. That game could not have been made without the learnings of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and, before that, what developers had learned from their time working together on systems.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's nothing about a culture of fear of being laid off that’s going to be good for people making games and the games they're making.

            <p>Nintendo is getting us all reminiscing about a time when mixtapes were the best way to share music, fluorescent pinks and greens were standard fashion choices, ET had a breakfast cereal and leotards were the ultimate workout attire. Yes, Nintendo has taken us back to the 80s this morning, with a trailer for its upcoming Lego Game Boy that recreates its famous 'Robot' commercial of 1989.</p>
<p>36 years ago, Nintendo released a trailer for its handheld gaming device, the Game Boy, which came complete with a sci-fi robot alien type chap and a denim clad youngster playing their consoles together on a dusty planet who knows where. It all came packaged with a wonderfully dramatic voiceover proclaiming we could now enjoy "all the power and excitement of Nintendo" in the palm of our hands. You can check it out below.</p>

<p>Anyway, fast forward to today, and we once again have a robot and young chap starring trailer complete with dramatic voice over and far off dusty planet, but this time for Nintendo's upcoming Lego Game Boy collaboration.</p>
<p>"They said, it wasn't possible," the trailer's voiceover begins, "but now, you can have all the power of the brick in your hand." Ah, it is glorious, as you can see for youself below. </p>

<p>As for the Lego model itself, it's a near 1:1 scale replica of the original Game Boy, with a D-pad, as well as A, B, Start, and Select buttons. The set also includes buildable Game Boy cartridges for two classic games - Super Mario Land and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-links-awakening">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a> (they missed a trick not having Tetris, but hey ho).</p>
<p>Builders then have three options for what they choose to display on the Game Boy's screen. They can plump for either a Nintendo start screen, or gameplay images from the two included games.</p>
<p>The set comes with a total of 421 pieces. "Relive the thrill you felt when you first played on the Game Boy," Nintendo and Lego proclaim.</p>
<p>If you are interested in getting your hands on the Lego Game Boy, you can pre-order now. The <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/game-boy-72046">model costs £54.99 for those of us in the UK</a>, and will start shipping on 1st October.</p>
