		<p>2022’s bizarre indie hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/trombone-champ/">Trombone Champ</a> is being all its slidey trombone shenanigans to VR later this year, with Trombone Champ: Unflattened set to launch across Meta Quest, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR 2</a> and Steam VR this autumn.</p>
<p><iframe title="Trombone Champ: Unflattened | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NCtd5i_qchk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Trombone Champ: Unflattened comes from Flat2VR Studios, a studio that is all about translating flat screen games into virtual reality.</p>
<p>In this case it’s a pretty big reimagining that, instead of having your toot happy Mii-alike character on screen and notes moving from right to left, you will pick up a virtual trombone and actually move the slide around yourself. It is… well, it’s an awful lot closer to playing an actual trombone than you might expect.</p>
<p>The game will feature a playful narrative involving baboons and absurd, laugh-out-loud moments”, while also featuring a slew of weird trombones (including one with a fish replacing the bell), and customisation options to recolour your instrument.</p>

Now, it seems like we may never see it at all. Meta and Rockstar didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The management game progression chart is supposed to go: zoo, then theme park, then hospital, then school. Apparently no one told Springloaded Software, who are following up their 2021 tycoon 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lets-build-a-zoo">Let's Build A Zoo</a> with a game about building an MMO. 
</p>
<p>Let's Build A Dungeon marries the business aspects of Game Dev Tycoon with a more hands-on approach to constructing your company's game, and there's a first trailer below.

<p>Players will need to hire designers, coders and testers to staff their development studio, but also place buildings and trees to populate the fantasy game-within-a-game, as well as filling dungeons with traps and chests to keep virtual players busy and happy and paying their monthly subscription.
</p>
<p>I feel like the quintessential management game anecdote is making the chips more salty in Theme Park so that customers would buy more soda - whether or not that was actually possible in the game - and I hope something similar is true of Let's Build A Dungeon. I want to make the final dungeon boss incredibly difficult to defeat so that players never feel as if they've truly finished the game, until we've added a new dungeon with a new hard boss, and then we can go back and nerf the old one.
</p>
<p>Apparently you can playtest your RPG to experience it as an actual player would, and there's enough of an toolset here that you can also create your own story, dialogue and cutscenes, then share your creation with other real players to try. Wild.

<p>You'll find more screenshots of Let's Build A Dungeon <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2365790/Lets_Build_a_Dungeon/">over on Steam</a>, and there's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2365790/view/4272313336331689035">coming beta that you can sign up for</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/luma-island-is-a-cozy-adventure-game-for-gamers-of-all-experience-levels<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Different professions offer a different level of challenge.</h2></div><section><p>Luma Island is a cozy adventure game with a unique goal: providing experiences that are enjoyable for lifelong gamers, casual gamers, and first-time gamers. If you’re less experienced or simply want to relax as you build your perfect homestead, you can do that. If you want to take on the challenge of exploring caves and temples, you can do that too. You can play solo or with up to four players in co-op. It’s all up to you.</p><p>That freedom of choice starts right at the beginning of the game. Once you’ve designed your character, you’ll start a new life on Luma Island with nothing but some tools and a small trailer to sleep in. After a quick tutorial, your first major task will be to visit the nearby town to pick your profession. You’ll have seven options to choose from: cook, brewer, treasure hunter, blacksmith, fisherman, jewelrycrafter, and archeologist.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/07/town-at-night-1723060244991.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>This choice is more than just some flavor for your character, it’s an important decision that will determine your character’s goals, some of which are tougher than others. Each profession is clearly labeled with a difficulty level, so you won’t be choosing blindly. Picking a starting profession also doesn’t lock you out of the others. You can be all seven professions if you’d like. Your first choice is free, but from that point on, adding new professions will cost in-game money. If you’re playing co-op, everyone can choose their own separate profession; you’re not locked into following the same path as your friends.</p><p>The easiest professions — such as cook and brewer — are focused on gathering materials on your homestead. You’ll use an axe to gather wood and a pickaxe to gather stone, then use those materials to build craft benches like a sawmill or kiln. You’ll then use these craft benches to turn your wood and stone into more complicated materials, which will then be used to create more advanced recipes.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/07/beginning-farm-1723060244988.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Upgrading your tools will make it easier to gather rare materials, which open up even more things you can make. And using a hoe, you can turn patches of grass into farmable land, where you can plant and water seeds to grow crops. That gives you full control over how far your homestead expands.</p><p>This gameplay loop means you’ll consistently have new goals to work toward to master your profession and expand your homestead. If you focus on farming and gathering, you won’t find yourself in dangerous situations very often, making these professions the ideal choice for new gamers or people who want a simple, relaxing experience. You’ll be spending your time gathering, building, planting, and enjoying the game’s vibrant environments and soothing soundtrack.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/07/heavily-built-farm-during-day-1723060244990.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>If you’re a more experienced player or are looking for more of a challenge, the hardest professions — such as jewelrycrafter and archeologist — will be more your speed. These professions require searching for loot in Luma Island’s dangerous caves and temples, which have traps and wild animals that will attack on sight. So you’ll need to have a whip at the ready.</p><p>Temples and caves have different rewards and provide different challenges. For example, temples might be full of traps that require you to pay attention to your surroundings. Caves are pitch black and require you to craft torches and strategically place them so you can see where you’re going and where you might get attacked. They each have a different way of keeping you on your toes, but they also hold unique rewards like new blueprints and particularly valuable loot. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/07/spike-trap-in-a-temple-1723060244990.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>If you die while in a cave or temple, you’ll lose some of the resources you gathered during that trip. When you enter them, a new section of the HUD will be added that says “lost on death.” As you might expect, you’ll lose the items displayed in that section if you die. Luckily, if you ever get to a point where you want to evacuate a dungeon, each room provides a way for you to escape without having to backtrack all the way to the beginning.</p><p>This temple exploration can also lead you to solve the big mystery of the island. In town, there’s a sealed temple that you need ancient keys to open. Completing temples in each zone will reward you with tablets that will open that zone’s final sanctuary. There, you can find the ancient keys needed to open the sealed temple. What lies within? You’ll just have to figure that out for yourself.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/07/snow-area-1723060244990.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Regardless of what profession you choose, you’ll need some help from magical creatures called Lumas. You get them by finding and hatching Luma Eggs, and there are 15 unique Lumas in the game. Once they’ve hatched, they’ll help you find treasure and provide you with Luma Energy, a resource that is needed for recipes of all professions.</p><p>Ultimately, Luma Island is all about giving you options and letting you choose how you want to play it. Alone, with friends, as one profession, as all of them, or anywhere in between. It’s developed and self-published by indie studio Feel Free Games, will be available on PC, and is planned to release later this year. You can wishlist the game on <u>Steam</u> or join the community on <u>Discord</u>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Absolutely, and now you can right this injustice by giving the orange tabby the love he deserves.</p><p>For mystery fans, you can experience a tale of obsession and manipulation, inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece Vertigo. This is a faithful narrative thriller that pays tribute to the legendary filmmaker, and it has a fascinating story that'll keep you on your toes.

<p>A fan-made mod that would’ve added Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 content — the 2009 version of the game — to Modern Warfare Remastered on PC has been shut down. And it’s all thanks to Activision.</p>



<p>The H2M mod for Modern Warfare Remastered was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiplayer-mod-mw2-h2m-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set to launch</a> on Friday, August 16. However, just a day before the launch, the developers were hit with a Cease &amp; Desist from lawyers representing Activision.</p>

<p>“Today, our team members received a Cease &amp; Desist order on behalf of Activision Publishing in relation to the H2M-Mod project,” they <a href="https://x.com/H2Multiplayer/status/1824167247436542167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said on Twitter</a>. We are complying with this order and shutting down all operations immediately and permanently.</p>



<p>The H2M mod was going to add 50 maps to the game along with new attachments and camos for the guns. The mod also included an updated progression system and even Killstreaks from the original Modern Warfare 2.</p>



<p>Modern Warfare Remastered even saw a massive spike in players on Steam thanks to the pending release of the mod. The game had an over 300% increase in daily max players over the last few days compared to a month ago. It <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mw-remastered-top-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even found its way on Steam’s Top Sellers</a> in recent days due to the hype.</p>



<p>Now, it’s likely those players once again turn away from the game with no mod coming.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Activision for clarification on the reasons for sending the Cease &amp; Desist. Should a response be received, this article will be updated accordingly.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft: The War Within | "Alleria: Light and Shadow" Animated Short Film</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"Alleria: Light and Shadow is a groundbreaking addition to World of Warcraft's lore, bringing a new level of storytelling to the game's universe," Blizzard says. "Whether you're a long-time fan or new to the lore, this short film offers a captivating glimpse into the character that will play a pivotal role in the upcoming expansion, The War Within."</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard's focus on Alleria for this expansion, which releases just a few months ahead of WoW's 20th anniversary, is hardly an accident. She's been one of the Warcraft franchise's lead characters almost from the beginning, even if her sister, Sylvanas, became increasingly important over the course of WoW's history. Alleria made her big comeback as part of 2016's Legion expansion, where it was revealed she and Turalyon had joined an intergalactic army of holy warriors dedicated to stamping out the Burning Legion. She's been in the background of WoW ever since, but The War Within will see her once again take the spotlight as she looks to stop the new villain Xal'atath from fulfilling her dark designs.</p><p dir="ltr">While this fully animated short focuses on Alleria, Blizzard also recently released an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brOSi_rpGj4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">animated motion comic</a> highlighting another important character in The War Within, Anusrek, the ruler of the Nerubian kingdom of Azj-Kahet.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-release-date-announced-during-xbox-showcase/1100-6524083/" data-ref-id="1100-6524083">WoW: The War Within releases on August 26</a>, and is slated to be the first expansion in a three-expansion trilogy called The Worldsoul Saga. The expansion's pre-patch has already introduced a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-warbands-were-born-out-of-a-desire-to-keep-pushing-for-an-account-wide-future/1100-6525203/" data-ref-id="1100-6525203">account-wide progression feature called Warbands</a> to the long-running MMORPG, with other new features, like Delves and Hero Talents, coming in the expansion proper. Those who buy The War Within's epic or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-collectors-edition-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6522721/" data-ref-id="1100-6522721">20th anniversary collector's edition</a> will be able to play four days early starting on August 22.</p>

                <p>Bethesda Game Studios has announced the official release date for The Elder Scrolls: Castles. The latest installment in the Elder Scrolls series will launch globally on September 10 on mobile devices.</p><p dir="ltr">Bethesda Game Studios shared a post on its <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1824098856260235507" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official X/Twitter account</a> announcing the release date alongside a video of the director of mobile games, Craig Lafferty, and production director Veronique Bruneau explaining the game. Lafferty describes The Elder Scrolls: Castles as the "spiritual successor to Fallout Shelter." Castles has the same premise as Shelter in the sense that players create their castle, ensuring it runs smoothly and assigning the proper people to the right jobs.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1824098856260235507" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We're thrilled to announce that <a href="https://twitter.com/tescastles?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TESCastles</a>, our newest mobile game from the team behind Fallout Shelter, will be launching globally on Sept. 10th!<br>We hope you all enjoy this game as much as we've enjoyed working on it.

As time passes, players will see their castle evolve alongside their ruler. How they customize their castle will directly affect how successful they are. Castles will also feature a roguelite mode where players will send their subjects to fight off endless waves of enemies in exchange for rewards. Players can equip enchantments that'll give their people buffs in hopes of them surviving longer.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth pointing out that The Elder Scrolls: Castles has been playable for some time now. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-elder-scrolls-game-just-released-out-of-nowhere/1100-6518059/">It was originally shadow-dropped last year</a>.

            <p>
Back in June, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-3-heads-to-vr-with-series-first-dual-wielding">revealed</a> it was resurrecting and reworking Hitman 3's VR mode, first released for PSVR in 2021, exclusively for Meta Quest 3 - and the studio has now shared first gameplay, showcasing this Reloaded edition's various enhancements.
</p>
<p>
On a basic level, Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded is the same game that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-3-review-a-satisfying-end-to-a-beautiful-stealth-trilogy">earned itself a Eurogamer Recommended badge</a> back in the day, meaning players can don goggles and immersively sneak through likes of Dubai, Dartmoor, Berlin, Chongqing, and Mendoza.
</p>
<p>
However, Reloaded - which is being developed with XR Games - is more than just a straight port of Hitman 3 VR's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-3-vr-is-more-of-a-hit-than-a-miss-on-psvr">scrappy but enjoyable</a> previous release. It also introduces a new flat-shaded artstyle, more "fluid and natural" movement options, an overhauled UI, and - perhaps most notably - dual-wielding, so players can use a different weapon or item in each hand.

<p>
Some of that can be seen in Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded's first gameplay trailer above, which also showcases some its visually refreshed locations, weapons, and characters.
</p>
<p>
Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded doesn't have a release date yet, but it'll cost £24.99/$29.99 USD when it eventually shows up for Meta Quest 3 later this year. And for those that can't resist the allure of a pre-order bonus, there's 10 percent off that price if you're willing to <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/8012387035448196/">pay up</a> right now.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hunt-showdown-1896-out-now-on-pc-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-x-s.954456/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-out-now-on-pc-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-xs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hunt: Showdown 1896 is officially out for players on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. This version of the game will replace Hunt: Showdown, with those who originally owned Hunt: Showdown being eligible for a free upgrade to Hunt: Showdown 1896. With this update comes many new features that Crytek has implemented to keep the game fresh, including their CRYENGINE 5.11, a new engine dedicated to making this game as visually stunning and immersive as possible.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hunt: Showdown 1896 I Official Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/16vBsmpcxh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Along with the use of the CRYENGINE 5.11, players can expect to see a new Wild Target for them to hunt and the addition of the Scorched Earth Event, all taking place in the brand-new Colorado biome. In this new update, the story takes the player forward in time and takes everyone west of the bayou. Players will get to find new weapons and get to use Pacts that can help or hinder them.</p>
<p>Those curious about Hunt: Showdown 1896 can jump into the brand-new action for free on PC, with Steam's Free Weekend running from August 15 through August 19. Players can visit the new Colorado map, Mammon's Gulch, where there are 16 unique compounds for players to explore, spread across the peaks of the mountains and down in the mines.</p>
<p>As previously announced, players will get to take on the latest Wild Target: The Hellborn. It's an amalgam of fire and flesh and can be tracked audibly by listening in Dark Sight. The new Wild Target is highly aggressive and moves frantically while throwing slag at nearby Hunters, scorching everything within its grasp.</p>
<p>However, there comes a huge risk with the Hellborn, as its screeches will draw the attention of the other Hunters, adding another level of threat.</p>
<p>Staying on trend with the Hellborn is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-introduces-hellborn-in-scorched-earth-event/">Scorched Earth event</a>, from August 15 through October 7. Players can explore more of the Mammon's Gulch story by participating in the event to earn new equipment, ammo, and weapons. This includes the 1865 Carbine, the Infantry 73L base rifle with a sniper variant, Bear Traps, and many more.</p>
<p>In addition, Crytek has also added a Weekly Challenge system to Hunt: Showdown 1896 to support players joining mid-event, as well as a Battle Pass with a free and premium track, allowing players to unlock rewards throughout the event.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/594650/announcements/detail/4326355263804047483" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam community page</a>, you can read all about the changes made in Hunt: Showdown, including the full stats list of the new weapon variants made available in the event.</p>

			<p>ARK series <a href="https://wccftech.com/myth-of-empires-to-be-re-released-in-early-2024-as-snail-games-becomes-its-publisher-following-legal-dispute/">publisher Snail Games</a> has announced their latest project, a new "open universe" AAA title named For The Stars. This space-themed sandbox survival game implores you to explore several diverse worlds and research technologies while using a customizable spacecraft. Not only that, but players will get to battle space pirates and other creatures across the planets.</p>
<p>Off the bat, the game sounds very similar to No Man's Sky, as there will be plenty of planet-hopping as an explorer and scientist, uncovering secrets of alien civilizations and finding rare creatures that inhabit the planets. While you uncover these secrets, they will help you survive the deadly biomes you encounter.</p>
<p>In For The Stars, you can play in a persistent multiplayer universe, where you must establish a base and expand your outposts across the cosmos while working to survive and conquer the hostile biomes surrounding you. To make your journey easier, you can forge alliances with others you come across in multiplayer.</p>
<p>With your spacecraft, you can design it and build it to your specifications, with each ship being able to be tailored to your specific needs by using the resources you salvage across planets and the technology you research. You can have ships dedicated to combat, resource gathering, or simply exploring uncharted territories.</p>
<p>Whether you want to play passively and dedicate yourself to research and exploring uncharted lands or be aggressive and engage in fast-paced combat using futuristic weapons and abilities, there is a play style for everyone.</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to finally officially announce For The Stars after three years of development," says Primus Majda, Game Director of For The Stars. "We are gamers first and foremost. We love survival games and Snail has a lot of experience with them. We have an ambitious game in mind, and we are taking what we've learned from other projects to make it happen. Our goal is to create a game that's played like a sandbox survival game but has the impact of a 4x galaxy civilization game."</p>

<p>Snail Games USA is an independent global developer and publisher of digital entertainment. It has been successfully growing and creating great projects since 2009, leveraging technology and innovation in every step.</p>
<p>At the moment, For The Stars doesn't have a definitive release date<span>; the&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1415230/For_The_Stars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a> only says</span> "coming soon." However, when this ambitious space-themed sandbox game emerges, it will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

Since then the franchise has expanded with the actually-pretty-good movie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/if-youre-excited-about-the-godzilla-vs-kong-trailer-w-1846127466&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/if-youre-excited-about-the-godzilla-vs-kong-trailer-w-1846127466"><em>Kong: Skull Island</em></a></span>, a few more fun sequels featuring multiple monsters, and even a TV show on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmS8umhWKGl&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmS8umhWKGl" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Apple+</a></span>. And now the Monsterverse is expanding once more, this time into the interactive wonderland that is video games. </p><p>On August 15, Legendary Pictures announced that it plans to launch three different games based on the <em>Godzilla/Kong</em> universe. Now, before you get too excited, know that one of these games is a mobile thing that looks...fine. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmS8vGjuyKD&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmS8vGjuyKD" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">It’s now available to pre-order</a></span> on Android and iOS. </p><p>Another game will exist in <em>Roblox </em>and will, Legendary states in a press release, let fans “experience” a “unique virtual world where players can engage with the Monsterverse in innovative ways.” So expect to run around completing crappy mini-games while collecting a currency to unlock some in-game cosmetics and maybe watch a trailer. This <em>Roblox </em>game is coming out later this year. </p><h2 id="h843"><a id=""></a>A new King Kong game is set to launch later this year</h2><p>The big news from today’s announcement is the third game, <em>Kong: Survivor Instinct</em>. According to Legendary and developer 7Levels, this new Kong game is a “2.5D action-adventure game for PC and consoles.” It’s set shortly after the events of <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em> and sees players taking on the role of a father looking for his missing daughter while exploring a “shattered city.”</p><p>All three of these Monsterverse games are planned to arrive before the end of the year. No trailer or screenshots were released for <em>Kong: Survivor Instinct</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/7lvls/status/1824133304334876673&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/7lvls/status/1824133304334876673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but the devs did post a teaser image on Twitter</a></span>.<br></p><p> “The opportunity to work on the hugely popular Monsterverse IP has been an exciting and formative experience for all of us at 7Levels,”  said Paweł Biela, a co-founder of the studio. “Not only did we have a chance to show some of the fan-favorite Titans from a unique perspective, but we also found committed and supportive partners in the exceptional people at Legendary.”</p><p>So it sounds like this game won’t have you running around as King Kong or Godzilla, but will instead focus on a human trying to survive a monster attack. That sounds interesting! It certainly sounds like it could be better than that last King Kong game. </p><p><em>Skull Island: Rise of Kong </em>was released last year to horrible reviews from players. It was a disaster with awful visuals, bad gameplay, and ugly cutscenes. </p><p>It should be noted that the folks who worked on that game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/king-kong-skull-island-bad-game-worst-2023-1850946332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/king-kong-skull-island-bad-game-worst-2023-1850946332">reportedly got little support from publisher Game Mill</a></span> and had to crunch for months to get <em>Rise of Kong</em> out the door on time. The end result: A very, very bad game. Hopefully, Legendary gives 7Levels the time and resources they need to make something much better.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“To give players more control over what they’re downloading, we are decoupling the download of&nbsp;Call of Duty: Warzone&nbsp;from other titles,” Activision said. “When you purchase an annual title, you will only download the files for that game by default.”</p>



<p>That means if you want to download Warzone, you will have to do it as a separate download. This will not only decrease the time it takes to download Call of Duty before you can play, but will also free up prime real estate on your storage devices.</p>







<p>“Flexibility and choice matter,” they said. “We want to give players the choice to download each Call of Duty, including&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, when and how they wish.”</p>



<p>This separation will happen starting Wednesday, August 21. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-vault-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on October 25</a>, and will be the first game in the franchise to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-for-game-pass-on-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release Day One on Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/8-large-us-universities-create-new-collegiate-esports-conference/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Collegiate esports is voluntarily becoming incredibly popular amongst the younger generation, as many schools are beginning to offer full-ride scholarships in exchange for a student’s gaming abilities. Many schools already operate in their own esports league, competing for massive prize pools. Now, though, eight of the nation’s leading universities have established a new conference, bringing collegiate esports to a new level.</p>



<h2 id="h-8-leading-universities-establish-new-esports-conference">8 Leading Universities Establish New Esports Conference</h2>



<p>Eight leading universities in the US have banded together to establish a new esports conference titled, the <strong>Power Esports Conference (PEC)</strong>. The league will consist of eight Division 1 schools competing against each other across four separate game titles.</p>



<h4 id="h-all-universities-in-the-power-esports-conference">All Universities In The Power Esports Conference:</h4>



<ul>
<li>Boise State University</li>



<li>Michigan State University</li>



<li>Syracuse University</li>



<li>Ohio State University</li>



<li>University of Kansas</li>



<li>University of Missouri</li>



<li>University of Nebraska</li>



<li>University of Southern California</li>
</ul>



<p>“We are proud to help form the Power Esports Conference, a first-of-its-kind collaboration to create memorable and meaningful competitive opportunities for our students, alumni, and partners,” said Christopher Bilski, Director of Esports at Michigan State University. “This conference brings together like-minded institutions to highlight some of the best and brightest in collegiate esports and is a positive step forward in continuing to grow esports opportunities at Michigan State University.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>So many storylines already resonate so heavily within the collegiate esports world. Now, adding such a big conference into the mix, the stakes will be even higher.</p>



<p>“We are elated to help establish this conference and play peer institutions in a fixed season schedule that expands upon our traditional athletic rivalries. The PEC will be a great addition to the other leagues and publisher tournaments that make for a great student experience,” said Dr. Chris Haskell, Head Coach of Esports at Boise State University.</p>



<p>So, when will the season start? And what games will students be competing in?</p>







<h2 id="h-season-start-date-and-all-games-involved-in-the-conference">Season Start Date And All Games Involved In The Conference</h2>



<p>The beginning of the PEC season is September 23, 2024, giving gamers just enough time to prepare for quite the historical first competitive season. With some of the biggest games in esports involved, students should prepare for some intense action.</p>



<h4 id="h-all-games-in-the-power-esports-conference">All Games In The Power Esports Conference:</h4>



<ul>
<li>Valorant</li>



<li>Overwatch 2</li>



<li>Rocket League</li>



<li>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</li>
</ul>



<p>While there are only four games in the PEC, we could easily see more added to the list if the first season or two shows to be successful.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-working-on-custom-call-of-duty-download-options-ahead-of-black-ops-6-to-tackle-colossal-file-sizes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Promising "a new streamlined interface."</h2></div><section><p>Activision will soon let players install different parts of Call of Duty games separately to combat colossal file sizes ahead of the release of Black Ops 6.</p><p>Call of Duty, with its various evolving modes like Multiplayer and Zombies alongside yearly releases on top of separate games like Warzone, has gotten a bit messy and, dare we say, chunky in recent years. Black Ops 6 gained attention when players thought it required around 300GB of download space to install, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-isnt-300-gb-after-all">and while this turned out not to be true</a>, it created such a reaction because it was somewhat believable.</p><p>File sizes for the various games can reach well above 100GB, a significant portion of some consoles' hard drives, but Activision is now determined to quell this issue.</p><p>Changes will be rolled out in a number of updates in the coming months, in anticipation of Black Ops 6's launch on October 25, 2024. They aim to offer a streamlined interface, direct access to games, more control of downloads, and expanded streaming technology to reduce file sizes.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/15/cod-1723739696024.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>"These changes will be rolled out in phases as a series of downloads," Activision said. "After these larger initial updates, future Call of Duty downloads will decrease in size and existing files will take up less space on your device. As a thanks for your patience, we're gifting all players with in-game consumables, which will be delivered when you first log into Call of Duty after the Season 5 Reloaded update."</p><p>Activision confirmed the immediate effect of these changes: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be a smaller download than Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III at launch.</p><p>The first big update arrives August 21 and will pave the way for these larger changes, headlined by the separation of Call of Duty: Warzone and the mainline games. "To give players more control over what they’re downloading, we are decoupling the download of Call of Duty: Warzone from other titles," Activision said.</p><p>"When you purchase an annual title, you will only download the files for that game by default. On the free to play side, players can opt-in to get Call of Duty: Warzone when they’re downloading a new annual title or simply download it separately at any point in time."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Subsequent updates will arrive August 30, in mid October, on October 25 when Black Ops 6 launches, and alongside that game's Season 1 update, whenever it may be.</p><p>Not trying to hide that this will be an awkward, somewhat confusing, and perhaps tedious time for players, Activision is giving away a pack of Battle Token Tier Skips and 2XP tokens from the beginning of Season 5 Reloaded.</p><p>Full details can be found on the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Call of Duty</a> blog.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-and-more-leaked-via-xboxs-own-website">Black Ops 6 launches on October 25, 2024</a>. Other multiplayer mode will be available to try a bit earlier though, thanks to an early access period beginning in late August. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-confirmed">An invite only trial takes place</a> on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, and PC from August 30 to September 4, while an open beta takes place September 6 to September 9.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

		<p>Following<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/27/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remastered-leaked-by-merch/"> leaks</a> of some sort of release for Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver I &amp; II we now have official confirmation that Raziel is back… on the Evercade handheld console. Hands up who has one of those?</p>
<p><iframe title="Evercade - Legacy of Kain Collection - Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zlSBRNk2fVY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As you can see they seem to be ports of the original titles, not remasters, and it’s also Soul Reaver and Blood Omen, not Soul Reaver I and II – more on that later.</p>
<p>Fans have been clamouring for something from the Soul Reaver franchise for many years but there really has not been any hint of anything until now. However, Embracer did say that they saw “great potential, not only in sequels, but also in remakes, remasters, spinoffs, as well as transmedia projects” when they spent vast amounts of cash buying up loads of IPs. As they don’t have any cash left now it seems they just want to make a quick buck shoving the original games on a new platform.</p>
<p>The two games are sequels to The Legacy of Kain, both featuring the vampire wraith Raziel in a quest to kill Kain, the star of the first game.&nbsp; Both titles picked up excellent reviews when they were released between 1991 and 2001, not surprising when they were directed by Uncharted’s Amy Hennig. However they do look very dated now, but hey, if retro arcade action is your thing then go grab and Evercade.</p>

<p>The Evercade console launched in Winter 2022 with a 4.3″ IPS screen, USB-C charging port, a 1.5Ghz processor and 4GB of built in RAM, so you probably wil have some RAM to spare when playing Legacy of Kain.</p>
<p>A new version of the console launches at the end of this month, the Evercade VS-R, and you can<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Evercade-VS-R-Console-Tomb-Raider/dp/B0D1VYPWLH/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2TZ52VU5R0PUW&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.3ZxKPe-Y-GV6g4h27z8Ehhz0OgpcpjeSvASDzyaJLNxfpIkF9HiHJ9RUg5tdtKpS90Pu7y8Cel2NMXhTFy_nV9fFUco64u6s6vfqHL3JNjxcjHVWUJtypq_OEXg1rs589E79e60JxaqfXbfqZJoWWMEZjPO4yZXGvsbbSmj_GK4ukftH_B0S9cFG1SlGslKPBjHCiiT8Pd0FkklkALbM0HkYHPP-CjsKY_z7iUrie9s.LnzgpGc1zBH5lXNbabRjj5RNd7lkaxEGuhKzxarLXBA&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=evercade&amp;qid=1723747516&amp;sprefix=evercade%2Caps%2C90&amp;sr=8-2"> grab it from Amazon along with Tomb Raider for £100.&nbsp;</a> There are currently around 50 titles available for the console.</p>
<p>So, not quite the Remaster everyone was hoping for but the leaks clearly state Legacy of Kain: <em>Soul Reaver I &amp; II Remastered</em>. So maybe they are also on the way?</p>

<p>As a reminder, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is powered by the Frostbite engine. BioWare will shine a spotlight on the PC platform next week, likely to announce a partnership with NVIDIA, Intel, or AMD. Here's an updated overview of the game shared today by the developers:</p>
<p><em>Enter the world of Thedas, a vibrant land of harsh wilderness, treacherous mazes, and glittering cities - steeped in conflict and secret magic. Now, a pair of corrupt ancient gods have emerged from centuries of darkness and are hell-bent on destroying the world. </em><em>Nations are at war, and factions are splintering. Who will you trust? From the Arlathan Forest to the back alleys of Minrathous, this is a broken world. Your actions will forever shape the fate of Thedas.</em></p>
<p><em>Unite a team of seven companions, each with rich lives and deep backstories. These are characters to befriend and even fall in love with. They include an assassin, a necromancer, and a detective, each bringing their own expertise and unique abilities to the fight. You are never alone as you decide who to take into battle and face off against demons, dragons, and corrupt gods.</em></p>
<p><em>Choose from different races and combat classes, customize your appearance, choose your character's backstory, and begin your journey as Rook, the newest hero of Dragon Age. The choice is yours. Throughout your adventures, you'll gain new skills and discover unique, powerful artifacts to enhance your own fighting style. Prepare for tough decisions to be made, allies to be inspired, and a battle that will require every sword, staff, and bow you can muster.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is out on October 31.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/startup-exists-announces-new-genai-gaming-platform/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/startup-exists-announces-new-genai-gaming-platform.954378/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/startup-exists-announces-new-genai-gaming-platform/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>An artificial intelligence startup, Exists, has unveiled a new generative AI-powered text-to-game platform that will allow anyone to <a href="https://exists.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create high-quality games in minutes</a>. The platform doesn't require coding skills; it only needs text prompts from the person using it.</p>
<p>This new, fully automated process will run from Exists' cloud-based creation platform. The platform already has proprietary Generative AI models, allowing users to create environments and characters and play mechanics using the intuitive cloud-based ecosystem.</p>
<p>For those who are concerned that the platform may be difficult to use, Exists has made it as user-friendly as possible to break through the traditional barriers of making a game and allowing people to make a game just by typing in a concept, no matter how vague or detailed they want to be with it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Exists - Games from Text, Just Like That" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pou46iBNZHw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Exists has a novel neural network architecture that integrates Generative AI with advanced gaming engine capabilities to power all of this. This neural network allows them to combine the creative potential of AI with the strengths and performance of modern gaming engines to create complex games with visually stunning graphics. This takes minimal effort and is user-friendly for those who want to take the GenAI gaming platform for a test drive.</p>
<p>At the moment, Exists is in the Beta testing phase and is inviting users to sign up for early access to experience what Exists has to offer. Additionally, those attending Gamescom can see the brand-new technology and its offerings. Attendees will be able to see live demonstrations of the generative AI and have the opportunity to have a hands-on experience to test the platform's features.</p>
<p>"Our goal is to enable a paradigm shift in the gaming world that Generative AI has brought to text, image, video, and audio creation," says Dr Yotam Hechtlinger, the founder and CEO of Exists. "Providing the public with a powerful technology to create unique and personalized games sees us democratizing game creation and revolutionizing the gaming industry."</p>
<p>The use of AI in creative industries is highly controversial, with SAG-AFTRA frequently trying to get companies to stop using AI in their works. At the moment, SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://wccftech.com/electronic-arts-seo-in-talks-with-sag-aftra-to-reach-deal/">is on strike in the gaming industry</a> and is attempting to get game companies to rethink their use of AI and use voice actors to train their AI models.</p>
<p>In addition, the games industry is incredibly volatile, with companies being closed worldwide, even if they make highly successful games. There have also been many layoffs, from the most senior to the junior roles.</p>
<p>What impact software like Exists will have on the gaming industry remains to be seen.</p>

It’s got some stiff competition, but my mind just comes back to FromSoftware’s deeply gothic (and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-motherhood-roe-v-wade-supreme-court-opinion-1848899579&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-motherhood-roe-v-wade-supreme-court-opinion-1848899579">maternal</a></span>) nightmare more often than it does anything else. It’s also one of the studio’s most accessible games and—in keeping with that sentiment—the first one that I ever finished. It’s a game I’ve shared with loved ones, and the guy who helped me beat it the first time around is now my roommate all these years later. I love that I share <em>Bloodborne</em> with so many people in my life, and now I’m sharing it with you all because it’s on sale.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196742" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>PlayStation has extended its summer sale into the entirety of the month of August, and as part of the deals on offer, <em>Bloodborne Complete Edition </em>is just $17.49. </strong>Considering the base game (which lacks the critically lauded <em>Old Hunters </em>expansion) is just a few dollars more than that, you’re getting more out of this cheaper bundle than you would just picking <em>Bloodborne </em>up on a whim.</p><p>You might know <em>Bloodborne </em>because people on the internet have been constantly clamoring for a remake, remaster, or a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-pc-port-ps5-fromsoftware-elden-ring-miyazaki-1851539098&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-pc-port-ps5-fromsoftware-elden-ring-miyazaki-1851539098">port to PC</a></span> for years. This might give the wrong impression of the game, which is totally playable and doesn’t explicitly need to be remade or remastered, though a PC port would be nice. The PS4 version that can be played via backwards compatibility is a perfect version of a perfect game, and you should get to know that firsthand rather than through the stories about it.<br></p><p><em>Bloodborne </em>marked FromSoft’s first non-<em>Souls </em>soulsike and bears the lessons that the studio learned from their tenure developing the <em>Dark Souls </em>trilogy. Whereas the former series always approached combat as this trepidatious back-and-forth, <em>Bloodborne </em>encouraged aggression. The serrated Saw Cleaver—the now iconic weapon that sits on the game’s cover art— was the perfect tool for drawing the tainted blood of the diseased population of Yharnam, man and beast alike. And god, does <em>Bloodborne </em>feature some of FromSoft’s best and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-fromsoftware-horror-amygdala-lore-remake-ps4-1849630972&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-fromsoftware-horror-amygdala-lore-remake-ps4-1849630972">most memorable beasts</a></span>, like Mergo’s Wet Nurse and Rom The Vacuous Spider, as well as the <em>Old Hunters</em>’ Ludwig and Orphan of Kos. I’d go toe-to-toe with these bosses any day of the week, and it’d still be a thrill.<br></p><p>Due to its emphasis on action, which bled into mechanics such as health recovery, <em>Bloodborne </em>was an immediately gratifying experience. When I first played it as a high schooler, it was exactly the speed of game I wanted, paired with the difficulty and atmosphere of the <em>Souls </em>games that I just couldn’t penetrate at the time. It was gorgeous and haunting, and playing it felt like being seized by the very same fever that ripped through Yharnam. I tore that game a new one, and have repeatedly done so every few years for a while now. You all don’t know me, but I don’t replay games that often. I don’t know man, <em>Bloodborne</em> just clicked in a way that very little ever has.<br></p><p>I didn’t just conquer the nightmares of <em>Bloodborne </em>(of which there are many), I unlocked some piece of myself and my interests playing this game. I think I discovered that I love art that confuses me and asks questions more than it provides answers. I like things that enjoy a certain degree of inscrutability. I love things that are kind of uncomfortable and transgressive. Yes, you slay cosmic horrors left and right, but I also got to cleave my way through the patriarchal institutions that enabled Yharnam’s descent into madness, and that’s a rather liberating feeling at times. Some few games muse on these things, but even fewer let you literally take them to task.<br></p><p>I think <em>Bloodborne </em>is masterful at communicating these tenets in a packaging that could meet me halfway, and because of it I’ve been able to more fully appreciate a catalog of games that have become like treasured belongings to me. It’s the perfect entry point into FromSoft’s oeuvre, and as far as I’m concerned, its crowning jewel <em>still</em>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The announcement was accompanied by a dense trailer that gave us a lot to chew on. So we decided to scrub through it and break down everything we saw. Let’s go scene by scene and unpack everything BioWare’s put before us.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="03bae47d03d3d82d20f3affd78af5fb5" data-recommend-id="image://03bae47d03d3d82d20f3affd78af5fb5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Solas speaks to Rook while remembering his botched ritual." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Solas speaks to Rook while remembering his botched ritual." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="03bae47d03d3d82d20f3affd78af5fb5" data-recommend-id="image://03bae47d03d3d82d20f3affd78af5fb5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Solas speaks to Rook while remembering his botched ritual." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Solas, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-inquisition-best-characters-dorian-solas-1851559486&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-inquisition-best-characters-dorian-solas-1851559486"><em>Inquisition</em>-party-member-turned-antagonist</a></span> of <em>The Veilguard</em>, shares a mental connection with Rook, the hero of the next game. This is due to their blood being mixed in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-dreadwolf-rook-1851532144&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-dreadwolf-rook-1851532144">botched ritual shown at the beginning of the game</a></span>. As a result, Solas and Rook will communicate with each other throughout <em>The Veilguard</em>. We see a clip of one of their conversations in which Solas berates Rook for their meddling, as it has resulted in the long-imprisoned elven gods running rampant around the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe once more.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0bd83bd5dc635f24a8d595bb2cc26de0" data-recommend-id="image://0bd83bd5dc635f24a8d595bb2cc26de0" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shots of demons overrunning the Dragon Age universe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shots of demons overrunning the Dragon Age universe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0bd83bd5dc635f24a8d595bb2cc26de0" data-recommend-id="image://0bd83bd5dc635f24a8d595bb2cc26de0" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shots of demons overrunning the Dragon Age universe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now that Solas’ plan to tear down the Veil that separates the physical realm from the magical one has been disrupted, the <em>Dragon Age</em> world (known as Thedas) seems to once again be dealing with an onslaught of demons and other monsters entering the physical plane. We see what looks like some tentacle-sporting demons infesting the city of Minrathous, along with other powerful magic-using enemies we’ll learn more about in October. There’s also a scene of someone trapped in something that looks similar to the Darkspawn or Broodmother lair seen in <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>. We don’t see the source of this root-like binding in the trailer, however, so it could also be coming from a demon or a spell from a malicious mage.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fae09f216d1e4826f03051f9ad4b417e" data-recommend-id="image://fae09f216d1e4826f03051f9ad4b417e" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A dragon perches on the side of a tower." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A dragon perches on the side of a tower." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fae09f216d1e4826f03051f9ad4b417e" data-recommend-id="image://fae09f216d1e4826f03051f9ad4b417e" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A dragon perches on the side of a tower." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It looks like <em>The Veilguard </em>will be bringing back dragon fights. Dragons were often bosses you could seek out in <em>Dragon Age</em> but were typically used sparingly in the main plot. It gave those fights some weight, as you knew each one was going to be a huge undertaking, and naturally, they’re back in <em>The Veilguard</em>. We see a few shots of dragons throughout the trailer, so it stands to reason there will be multiple dragons to slay throughout the full game.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="69a8cd4006c8134ee2da15ccd41e40dd" data-recommend-id="image://69a8cd4006c8134ee2da15ccd41e40dd" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The city of Minrathous." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The city of Minrathous." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="69a8cd4006c8134ee2da15ccd41e40dd" data-recommend-id="image://69a8cd4006c8134ee2da15ccd41e40dd" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The city of Minrathous." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Much of <em>The Veilguard </em>will take place in Minrathous, the magic-driven capital city of the Tevinter Imperium. When <em>Inquisition</em> party member Dorian Pavus remarked about the southern countryside of the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe feeling quaint, it signaled that his home in Tevinter would be much more impressive. But even that didn’t sell just how imposing the city actually is; it feels almost like a magical cyberpunk city, with the mages who run the place using magic the same way a real-world metropolis uses electricity. We can see a ring-like structure that floats above the city, which was shown to act as a surveillance hub in the gameplay reveal trailer in June.

This is through the elven Eluvian network. Its mirrors act as portals that connect different areas of the world, and this is how Rook and friends will go to different locations with ease. We can see Rook and their team passing through the network and entering a whole new space. Seems like a good way for <em>Veilguard</em>’s story and action to have you crossing large distances and incorporating more of the world.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ba1cc8505c0c6ce52f5b77e89a585988" data-recommend-id="image://ba1cc8505c0c6ce52f5b77e89a585988" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Davrin and his griffon kick ass." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Davrin and his griffon kick ass." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ba1cc8505c0c6ce52f5b77e89a585988" data-recommend-id="image://ba1cc8505c0c6ce52f5b77e89a585988" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Davrin and his griffon kick ass." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The trailer takes some time to spotlight each of the companions that will make up your party in <em>The Veilguard</em>. First up we have Davrin, the Grey Warden elf who is accompanied by a griffon named Assan. This is significant because griffons are largely considered extinct in the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe, and Grey Wardens used to ride them into battle. So maybe Assan is a sign that these winged creatures will return to Thedas soon.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="aea23ff5ccd8e19aa3577b11262c8f4e" data-recommend-id="image://aea23ff5ccd8e19aa3577b11262c8f4e" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucanis takes out foes while flying around with his crow-like wings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lucanis takes out foes while flying around with his crow-like wings." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aea23ff5ccd8e19aa3577b11262c8f4e" data-recommend-id="image://aea23ff5ccd8e19aa3577b11262c8f4e" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucanis takes out foes while flying around with his crow-like wings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lucanis is one of the rogues in your team, and he’s proficient with daggers as you might expect.

She’s making a return in <em>The Veilguard</em>, and she’s got a new look to go with it. We see her shapeshift from a bird into her human form, and her outfit resembles her mother Flemeth’s, complete with a crown-like headpiece and spiked armor. It’s nice to see her get an updated look, as it was odd seeing her default back to the same outfit she wore in <em>Origins</em> when she appeared in <em>Inquisition</em>. Given the choices you can make in <em>Inquisition</em>, I imagine Morrigan’s role might differ slightly depending on whether you let her drink from the Well of Sorrows, as doing so might give her ties to the elven gods Rook will face.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="afd436ad312f15e939c1572b16728d59" data-recommend-id="image://afd436ad312f15e939c1572b16728d59" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucanis faces off against a mage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lucanis faces off against a mage." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="afd436ad312f15e939c1572b16728d59" data-recommend-id="image://afd436ad312f15e939c1572b16728d59" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucanis faces off against a mage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We see some tone-setting clips of Rook and friends fighting various foes.

Games</a> and developer NetherRealms have released the gameplay trailer for <em><a title="Games > Mortal Kombat 1 [20 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a></em> expansion “Khaos Reigns” and “Kombat Pack 2” character Cyrax. <span id="more-906297"></span></p><p>“Khaos Reigns” is due out on September 24 includes new story chapters and “Kombat Pack 2.” A bundle containing “Khaos Reigns” and the existing “Kombat Pack 1” will also be available. “Kombat Pack 2” will not be available as a standalone character pack outside of the expansion.</p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>In Fire God Liu Kang’s New Era, Cyrax is a young Lin Kuei warrior from the Zaki clan whose prodigious skills earned her an invitation to serve directly under Sektor. She seized the opportunity with her trademark vigor, but while her skills impressed, her independent streak created rifts between her and her mentor. It has become clear that Cyrax remains untamed and will serve the Lin Kuei on her terms, or not at all. Cyrax’s high-octane moveset is on full display in the new trailer, including her ability to leverage cybernetic technology to perform impressive aerial attacks and evasive maneuvers, complemented by her utilization of energy nets to pin down opponents, explosives to extend combos, and sawblades for devastating strikes.</p><p>The new video also teases Cyrax’s Animality, the brutal finishing move allowing her to morph into a hornet to annihilate her defeated opponents. The fan favorite Animalities will be available as a free content update for all Mortal Kombat 1 owners in conjunction with the Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns release on September 24.</p></blockquote><p><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,661 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,834 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,781 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,896 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/mortal-kombat-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
