However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/naetoru60/status/1836743459262116136&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/naetoru60/status/1836743459262116136" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">copyright info points to Grezzo</a></span> and if that’s the case then that’s pretty cool. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer-seemingly-confirmed&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer-seemingly-confirmed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by <em>Eurogamer</em></a></span>, people who pre-ordered <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> have spotted Grezzo’s name in the game’s trademarks section on Switch. This seemingly confirms what many players suspected when<em> Echoes of Wisdom</em> was first revealed in June. </p><p>The game’s art style looked a lot like Grezzo’s wonderful <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-the-kotaku-review-1838233611&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-the-kotaku-review-1838233611"><em>Link’s Awakening</em> remake from 2019</a></span>. The studio has previously worked on other <em>Zelda </em>remasters and ports, like <em>Four Swords</em> to DSI and <em>Ocarina of Time 3D, </em>as well as  <em>Majora’s Mask 3D,</em> to 3DS. The Japanese studio also ported <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/luigis-mansion-remake-announced-for-3ds-in-nintend/1100-6457275/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/luigis-mansion-remake-announced-for-3ds-in-nintend/1100-6457275/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> to 3DS, too</a></span>.

A similar thing happened with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/23860180/mario-new-voice-actor-super-bros-wonder-nintendo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/23860180/mario-new-voice-actor-super-bros-wonder-nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mario’s new voice actor last year</a></span>. It’s very odd, especially in an already overly secretive game industry. </p><p>It’s really nice to see the team being given a chance to make something new like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-leak-nintendo-rom-1851648804&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-leak-nintendo-rom-1851648804"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a></span>. Nintendo management must have a lot of confidence in the studio. Hopefully, that means Echoes of Wisdom ends up being a fantastic new entry in the series. </p><p> . <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>With the unveiling of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/" data-ref-id="1100-6526357">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> and rumors that the long-anticipated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-images-have-allegedly-leaked-suggesting-powerful-leap-forward-for-nintendo/1100-6526551/#:~:text=The%20Switch%202%20is%20claimed,a%20different%20layout%20for%20LEDs." data-ref-id="1100-6526551">Nintendo Switch successor</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reaffirms-a-next-gen-xbox-is-on-the-way/1100-6524094/" data-ref-id="1100-6524094">Xbox Series S | X follow-up</a> are just around the corner, now seems like the perfect time to take a closer look at the future of these companies and console gaming as a whole.</p><p>In this week's episode of Spot On, Tam and Lucy sit down to do precisely that, discussing not only their thoughts on the companies current trajectories, but what public opinion seems to be as well. Is the PlayStation 5's $700 price tag an indication of what consoles will soon cost? Are the ROG Ally and Steam Deck reasons for Nintendo to be concerned about the success of its next console? And which company is more likely to release a console with a new "gimmick" if the Switch 2 forgoes introducing a new feature? The pair tackle all these questions and more as they speculate what the future of console gaming looks like.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIUwcEEgVmE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SIUwcEEgVmE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Spot On is a weekly news show airing Fridays in which GameSpot's managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest news in games. Given the highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle of the massive video game industry, there's always something to talk about but, unlike most other news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic as opposed to recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.</p>

                <p>Amazon's recent Fallout TV series has boosted the video game franchise's popularity, and along with that newfound interest from wider audiences has come to a bunch of new Fallout-themed merch, including a new Fallout Mega Bloks building kit. The upcoming set is based on the iconic <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fmega-fallout-red-rocket%2F-%2FA-92357170&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnew-fallout-mega-set-based-on-the-iconic-red-rocket-gas-station-up-for-preorder%2F1100-6526618%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Red Rocket truck stops</a> seen dotting the ruined landscapes of the video games and TV series, and comes with a Vault Dweller figure, T-60 Power Armor suit, and everyone's favorite wasteland companion, Dog Meat. Mega's Fallout Red Rocket set will cost $80 and launches November 10. Preorders are available now at Target.</p><h2>Preorder Mega Fallout Red Rocket set</h2><p><strong>$80</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4370433-redrocketthumb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4370433" data-ratio="0.56328125" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4370433-redrocketthumb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4370433"></a><figcaption>Mega Fallout Red Rocket Truck Stop set.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4370433-redrocketthumb.jpg"></figure><p>This 824-piece kit packs a ton of detail and numerous fun references Fallout fans will enjoy. Those include a Nuka Cola vending machine stocked with Nuka Cola bottles, a Vault-Tec bobblehead, and a laser rifle. The designs of the Vault Dweller and Dog Meat figures are also based on the appearances of the characters from various Fallout video games. The interior of the set is modular, making it easy to access, and you can deck it out with a few additional elements like wall hangings, a power armor repair station, and a work bench--just like in Fallout 4.</p><p>The Red Rocket truck stop is the second official Fallout set from Mega.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/kobold-press-ceo-says-no-to-generative-ai<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A tabletop publisher has said no to generative AI. It is a highly contentious topic within the business. Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks-expresses-support-of-ai-in-dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank">praising the technology</a>. Games Workshop has <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-imposes-golden-demon-ai-ban-preventing-its-use-in-miniature-painting" rel="noopener" target="_blank">banned its use</a> in Golden Demon. Kobold Press's CEO has said no AI art will appear in any of their products.</p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://koboldpress.com/state-of-play-kobold-press-issues-the-no-ai-pledge/">official blog post</a> on Kobold Press' website, CEO Wolfgang Baur made a statement on the trend of generative AI content and the company's stance on its use.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-valiant-dragon-artwork.jpg?itok=QDLK5ffH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-valiant-dragon-artwork.jpg?itok=AXvVTr_T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Baur states that AI is popping up everywhere. It has been a point of controversy with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. It's being used in various institutions, such as health insurance claims in the United States. In fact it's being used as a marketing feature with the latest smartphones.</p>
<p>While Baur doesn't discount the applications of AI in various fields, he does state that there are areas where it shouldn't belong specifically, at TTRPG tables among friends telling shared stories.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The staff at Kobold Press doesn’t think AI belongs in generating art, roleplaying, or storytelling. Making your game your own is the heart of the RPG hobby: creating your world, your character, and your story with friends. Frankly, we’ve seen LLM text prompts work ok for chatbots. But we play RPGs to play with our friends, not software.</p>
<p>The Kobold policy against AI has been in place since the rise of Midjourney and similar tools in 2022. We looked at them, learned that they were trained on images that ripped off working artists and violated their copyrights, and rejected them as unethical tools that require theft from creatives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Baur's statement continues to give credit to Kobold Press' team of writers and artists. Alongside this praise, he emphasizes that none of their books will include any AI-generated art, maps, or game design elements, and elects to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Kobold Press is not alone in its anti-AI stance. It is joined by other TTRPG publishers in the industry such as <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si91?Paizo-and-Artificial-Intelligence">Paizo</a> and <a href="https://www.chaosium.com/blogai-art-and-chaosium-16-dec-2022/">Chaosium</a>.</p>
<p>The post ends with a sign-up sheet. If you support Kobold Press' stance against generative AI, you can add your name to the list.</p>
<p>Kobold Press has a strong reputation within the TTRPG community. They have produced multiple <em>D&amp;D</em> 5e third-party materials such as the <em>Tome of Beasts</em> and their own fantasy TTRPG, <em>Tales of the Valiant</em>.</p>

		<p><em>The muted reaction to Sony’s PlayStation 5 Pro presentation left the impression that whatever people want, it’s not what Sony was leading with in their unveiling of their newest gaming hardware.</em></p><p><em>So what do they want? What do we want from a new piece of games hardware? That’s hard to say, and it’s not a surprise that the inherently incremental nature of a PS5 Pro felt like a misreading of the room. Rob and Patrick will probably take “the same, but better” if it’s offered, but if you ask them what would excite them, they have some very different answers along very different lines than a getting a slightly better video card.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob: </strong>So Patrick, it seems safe to say that the general reaction to the PS5 Pro was indifferent. Even in quarters where you might expect a bit more excitement around a $700 console with a better graphics card, Sony’s presentation didn’t effectively sell people on the idea that the Pro would deliver widespread, meaningful improvements and it doesn’t seem like anyone is really thirsting to buy an even more expensive video games console.</p><p>We’ve talked extensively about the fact that we are in an era of marginal gains for graphical performance in video games. It’s been a problem since the start of this generation, and was a problem with the latest generation of PC graphics cards as well (the fact that NVIDIA apparently left a chasm between its top-end 4090 card and the rest of the 40XX line did not help). Part of it is that there’s simply not a ton that really serves a dedicated showcase to the latest tech because most things are built to straddle a wide range of hardware specs, so you end up with the kinds of underwhelming examples that Sony used, where they were reduced to showing how marginal details in a game that already looked good are suddenly a bit sharper. The fact that poor old Joel and Ellie are dragged out of retirement for “one last job” every time Sony has a new hardware spec doesn’t do much to assuage that <em>Groundhog Day </em>feeling around these reveals.</p><p>I’m pretty sympathetic to the “make it look better just because you can” point-of-view, but while I can enjoy a flight of fancy where I spend $20,000 on a new setup to enjoy <em>Gran Turismo 7 </em>in 8K (but not with HDR, apparently!), there’s a difference between enjoying better graphics and actually <em>wanting </em>them.</p><p>I freely acknowledge that one reason we end up foregrounding graphics so much is because you can show screenshots and videos as part of a sales pitch, while just about any other improvement is something that has to be experienced firsthand to fully appreciate. But it seems clear that “more graphics” aren’t moving the needle anymore, and the industry is struggling to figure out what will.</p><p>Personally, I keep thinking about the wasted potential of the PS5 controller. This isn’t Sony’s fault: their first-party stuff makes good-to-great use of its adaptive triggers, if not necessarily the touchpad. But it’s one of the few things to come along in the last ten years that can make a profound difference in how it feels to play a game, and how much information the controller itself can impart to the player. There should be a slew of games making use of it, especially given how well that console sold, but outside of Sony it mostly gets treated like a clone of the Xbox controller. Think of how lively <em>Astro’s Playroom </em>feels in your hand, the way it underscored every game mechanic and let you literally feel like you had a better grasp of their controls. I tell you without a shred of exaggeration that adaptive triggers were transformative for <em>GT7</em>.&nbsp; This should have been a bigger deal, if only to Sony. When you’re talking about how game controls feel, how good their feedback is, that’s a huge part of the equation. But we’re frequently stuck playing games with frankly numb-feeling controls because neither controller nor keyboard-and-mouse support is particularly well-implemented, a lowest-common denominator situation where at best we get passable, somewhat inoffensive controls. I think you could argue we have some of the best controller tech games have ever had, and games have rarely done a worse job of making players feel connected to the games they are controlling. The general shrug that greeted the PS5 controller’s unique features hints at an underlying problem: games are a tactile medium, but that tactility is treated as a minimum target developers have to hit rather than an opportunity to make a game feel better and more engaging. Frankly, you could keep the ray-tracing and maybe even the HDR if more games gave me the immediate sense of involvement that I got from that initial slate of PS5 games.</p><p>In a word, I’m a lot less moved by level of detail than I am by attention to detail, and I think that’s the stuff I want from games a hell of a lot more than I want a GPU that’s 67% bigger delivering 45% better performance.</p><p>What about you? What’s the stuff you want from a new piece of games hardware now? Not “what do you think would be commercially successful” but what is the thing that they could do that would meaningfully enrich your experience of the hardware or address a problem that sticks in your craw?</p><figure><figcaption><span>The future Patrick still wants.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>What I want from video games these days is the ability to play them wherever, whenever at an acceptable quality. It’s the reason the Steam Deck is so central to my life, it’s the reason the Switch, before the Steam Deck, was my most played piece of gaming hardware. It’s why I’ve jumped through hoops to make my PC stream wirelessly to my TV in the family room. It’s why I wish my Apple TV had a native GeForce NOW app. Increasingly, I’m just asking for my games to meet me where I am, and allow me to play them when I have time for them.</p><p>In a way, you could argue this helps explain why things like the DualSense have been a flop, outside of a few experiments. One of Microsoft’s big pitches has been turning “every screen into an Xbox” through cloud gaming. Video game hardware has not just plateaued—it’s flattened. A game is a game is a game, and even Nintendo has ended up in a place where its central gimmick is not about a second screen, it’s about letting one screen <em>meet you where you are</em>.</p><p>In that sense, why would any developer put meaningful work into something that wasn’t portable? You can’t be sure where your game might be played, and that could be as simple as knowing you’re likely to have a PC port where you can’t guarantee what controller they’re using.&nbsp;</p><p>I suspect the PlayStation 5 Pro is more impressive than Sony’s presentation revealed. Not because Sony was holding back, but because it was a piss poor event. It wasn’t able to appeal to normies or sickos, and yet, each time a clip trickles out of Digital Foundry, it has me going “hey, that looks pretty good.” Some of this is caught up in something we’ve been talking about for a minute now, the idea that gaming hardware has entered a phone phase where upgrades are incremental and largely unnecessary, but I think it also speaks to Sony being unsure where to hang their hat on. It’s a bit like the dance EA does with its sports games every year, where they have to quietly convince you their last game was ass without actually saying it. But you’re trying to instill FOMO. The question with the PlayStation 5 Pro is who you’re instilling fomo in.&nbsp;</p>

The Steam user review score is less than stellar, however, as players use the metric to once again boycott Sony’s PSN login requirement.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-steam-pc-release-date-trailer-1851509963&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-steam-pc-release-date-trailer-1851509963"><em>God Of War Ragnarök</em></a></span> requires one despite being an offline single-player game. That means that anyone who wants to play the meaty, brooding sequel to the 2018 GOTY needs to make a PlayStation account and sign in before playing, even if they don’t own a PS5 and never plan to. That hurdle is part of Sony’s larger attempt to move its PlayStation user experience onto PC without using its own game launcher.<br></p><p>And a bunch of Steam users still really hate it. <em>God Of War Ragnarök </em>is currently sitting at a 65 percent on Steam with over 2,000 reviews in so far, giving it a rating of “mixed” in the dreaded yellowish-orange font usually reserved for games with serious bugs or gameplay shortcomings. “I really wanted to give this game a thumbs up because it IS actually a good game, but the PSN requirement is stupid as hell and Sony needs to know that gamers will not stand for this,” reads one of the reviews.</p><figure id="" data-id="bccf610d2485e5904c2b2d9771f30a0a" data-recommend-id="image://bccf610d2485e5904c2b2d9771f30a0a" data-format="png" data-width="1389" data-height="827" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows negative God of War Ragnarok reviews" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows negative God of War Ragnarok reviews" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bccf610d2485e5904c2b2d9771f30a0a" data-recommend-id="image://bccf610d2485e5904c2b2d9771f30a0a" data-format="png" data-width="1389" data-height="827" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows negative God of War Ragnarok reviews" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sony’s PSN login requirement for Steam has been controversial since it was first foisted onto <em>Helldivers 2 </em>players earlier this year. Intended for launch, its implementation was delayed among all of the game’s other online issues and server crashes. Once it was finally brought back online, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-operation-clean-up-positive-review-steam-1851461173&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-operation-clean-up-positive-review-steam-1851461173">it ignited a days-long review-bombing campaign</a></span> that eventually resulted in the PlayStation maker backing off on the requirement, but only for <em>Helldivers 2</em>.<br></p><p>When <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> arrived on Steam in May, it also had a login requirement, but only to use its online mode, Legends, and its PlayStation overlay feature. <em>God Of War Ragnarök</em>, on the other hand, requires it to play the game at all. As a result, its Steam rating is currently sitting nearly 30 points below <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>’s, which was the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1dyg2pu/ghost_of_tsushima_was_the_bestselling_game_of_may/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1dyg2pu/ghost_of_tsushima_was_the_bestselling_game_of_may/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best-selling game</a></span> the month it came out. </p><p>  <em>God Of War Ragnarök</em>’s PSN login boycott might not end up impacting its PC sales too much, but the game hasn’t gotten off to nearly the roaring start on Steam that its predecessor did. So far it’s peaked at around 25,000 concurrent players on Steam, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/god-of-war-pc-attracted-50000-concurrent-steam-players-on-its-release-day/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/god-of-war-pc-attracted-50000-concurrent-steam-players-on-its-release-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about half</a></span> of what 2018's <em>God of War </em>did on its launch day.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-optic-dynasty-show-match/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a Call of Duty showmatch like no other, the current OpTic Texas roster will face off against the OpTic Dynasty live on October 12. It was just weeks ago that OpTic Texas won the Call of Duty League Championship, securing the most coveted trophy in COD esports and nabbing a $1 million grand prize.</p>



<p>The OpTic Dynasty, however, represents the pinnacle of Call of Duty esports for many fans. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-for-the-bragging-rights">For The Bragging Rights</h2>



<p>In front of a live audience at the Esports Stadium in Texas, OpTic Texas will attempt to take down the OpTic Dynasty, cementing their status as a true power squad in the Call of Duty space. </p>



<p>This match will pit Kenny, Pred, Shotzzy, and Dashy against Crimsix, FormaL, Karma, and Scump.</p>



<p>Of the entire OpTic Dynasty roster, only one member is still actively competing in the esports scene, and that’s Matt ‘FormaL’ Piper – but he plays Halo under the OpTic Gaming banner. Crimsix is a race car driver, Scump is primarily a streamer, and Karma is a coach for the OpTic Texas team, which could give him the upper hand in this contest.</p>



<p>During the past CDL season, OpTic Texas secured the top spot at Major 3 <strong>and </strong>COD Champs, proving that the team has the talent required to win both chips and rings – a concept that the Dynasty is certainly familiar with. </p>



<p>If you’re interested in watching the action unfold – assumedly on Modern Warfare 3 – you’ll be able to check out the gameplay on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/OpTicGaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OpTic Gaming’s YouTube channel</a>.`</p>

                <p>EA Sports has released the launch trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-25/" data-ref-id="5000-635887">FC 25</a>, which is out now in early access for people who buy premium edition, ahead of its rollout for everyone on September 27. The launch trailer is intense. The trailer shows legendary footballer David Beckham receiving a phone call but choosing to ignore it and instead turn up his TV's volume and lean forward to truly focus.</p><p>The trailer bounces between footage of the game and live-action scenes showing the dedication people have to the real-world sport with intense, close-up shots of gnarly blisters, a ball-bruised stomach, and x-rays depicting an injured ankle. There is even a quick shot of a player doubling over in exhaustion and throwing up their lunch. Take a look for yourself in the launch trailer below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/20/24249913/twitch-depreciating-strike-twitchcon-trust-and-safety<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Twitch is changing the way it enforces its community guidelines. In <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2024/09/20/everything-we-announced-at-twitchcon-san-diego/">an announcement posted on its website</a>, Twitch said that it will introduce a new enforcement strategy in which strikes for certain offenses will depreciate over time, users will receive more information regarding their strikes, and users will be able to take educational courses to reduce the severity of enforcement actions. In an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Rob Lewington, Twitch’s VP of safety operations, and Kristen Murdock, the director of safety risk and response, spoke about the new program and what it means for moderating communities on Twitch.</p><p>According to Lewington, safety is Twitch’s highest priority. He said Twitch hosts over 105 million users per month with 1.3 trillion minutes of content viewed. But such enormous numbers, combined with Twitch’s age and popularity as a livestream destination, have created unique challenges in how the platform punishes people who violate its rules.</p><p>Currently, when a streamer violates one of Twitch’s community guidelines, they receive some kind of enforcement action like a warning or a suspension, which then counts against them in the form of a strike. After a certain number of strikes, that streamer’s account can be suspended indefinitely. “We’ve had people on Twitch for a long time that have had enforcements in the past, but they don’t expire over time,” Lewington said. “[This current system] is punitive for folks who’ve been on Twitch for longer and that’s not what we want to do.”</p><p>In this new system, strikes for “low severity” offenses will expire after a certain amount of time. Though accidental nudity was given as one example, Twitch did not offer a comprehensive list of what the “low severity” offenses are nor how long it would take for them to expire. “That’s still a work in progress,” Lewington said. “We’re still figuring out the exact timelines.” He did, however, say that strikes for high-severity offenses — incidents relating to child safety, terrorism, or hateful conduct — will never depreciate.</p><p>In addition to expiring strikes, Twitch will now offer more information to users when a violation occurs. Starting next year, Twitch will provide the relevant chat message or clip to give context on why an enforcement action was taken. According to Lewington, providing this information will help people better understand what they did wrong while also giving them the tools they might need if they want to file an appeal.</p><p>The final part of Twitch’s new enforcement strategy involves offering users educational courses when a violation occurs. As an example, Murdock described a situation in which a person who received a hateful conduct strike was able to reduce the length of their suspension because they took a relevant educational course and quiz.</p><p>Murdock said Twitch worked with the Anti-Defamation League and other outside experts to develop these courses and quizzes around subjects like hateful conduct, sexual content, and gambling. Their goal is to create consistent messaging for both streamers and moderators on what actions will constitute a violation.</p><p>Taken together, this new strategy represents a desire at Twitch to ensure its communities remain safe while allowing members who have made mistakes to learn and grow from their experience. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/uk-game-sales-august-digital/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/last-month-75-of-all-games-sold-in-the-uk-were-digital.987444/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/uk-game-sales-august-digital/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent report, it was revealed that a whopping 75% of all games sold through August in the United Kingdom were <strong>digital purchases</strong>. It was documented that 1.74 million games were sold during the four weeks, and only 25% of them were hard copies, representing a 10% <strong>drop </strong>in physical game sales year-on-year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-no-alternatives">No Alternatives</h2>



<p>The report, which was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/75-of-games-sold-in-august-were-downloaded-uk-monthly-charts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">covered by GamesIndustry.biz</a>, confirmed that in August 2023, 65% of sales in the UK were digital. Over time, consumers in the United Kingdom have given up on physical media, and there are several reasons for that.</p>



<p>Firstly, digital gaming is becoming much easier and more accessible over time, with consoles shipping with larger storage drives and price parity stabilising across the board. Also, internet speeds are getting faster all the time, which means downloading or streaming games is also improving from an experience perspective.</p>



<p>Second, it’s important to stress that physical storefronts are dying out, and only GAME in the United Kingdom represents a ‘high street presence’ for the games industry across the entire region. In recent months, the decades-old retailer has faced severe struggles that have left many doubting the long-term prospects for the company.</p>



<p>With supermarkets boasting slim-to-nil catalogues of games and online storefronts often having some of the highest price points on the market, many gamers are turning to pre-ordering their treasured titles digitally, pre-loading them so they can start playing from the second the game goes live.</p>



<p>GamesIndustry.biz’s report also mentioned that Grand Theft Auto 5 sits atop the digital sales charts in the United Kingdom, which shows how the region is eagerly anticipating the arrival of Grand Theft Auto 6. </p>

<p>In a monumental report covering the state of play for Microsoft and Xbox, Bloomberg dove deep into the impact of the Game Pass subscription service. It’s not everybody’s cup of tea and it has garnered a mixed response from developers over the years, but one staggering statistic in Bloomberg’s write-up reveals just how invested Microsoft is in the platform.</p>



<p>It was said that the tech titan spends $1 billion annually to pull third-party games onto Game Pass, often parting ways with millions of dollars just to put pen to paper and get the deals signed. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-promise-of-exposure">‘The Promise of Exposure’</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-09-20/xbox-president-sarah-bond-predicts-the-future-of-microsoft-s-next-game-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the gargantuan report</a> written by Bloomberg’s Dina Bass and Cecilia D’Anastasio, everything from the recent clash between Microsoft and the CMA to the potential of a handheld Xbox device was explored. </p>



<p>At one point, the conversation, which was focused majorly on Sarah Bond’s Xbox presidency, turned to Game Pass. In a retrospective, we got a glimpse of how the subscription service surfaced with a humble library and a low price point before becoming a massive effort that weighed heavily on Microsoft’s coffers.</p>



<p>It was a paradigm shift for Microsoft, standing up something that would see value trickle in over time rather than relying on that one supersized launch to rake in a substantial payday. That’s what Sarah Bond alluded to, touching on the alteration in the operating model:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There’s a difference between managing a network effect and maximizing the value of a single game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bloomberg then mentioned that Microsoft spends a whopping $1 billion a year bringing third-party games into the Game Pass ecosystem, which has been modelled recently as a ‘Play Anywhere’ system that transcends simple home consoles.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Game Pass was also a major adjustment for publishers. To sweeten the deal, Microsoft now spends $1 billion a year getting third-party games on the subscription service. </p>



<p>The largesse has been more than enough to win over small publishers, to whom it offers flat fees of millions of dollars upfront to include their titles, along with a portion of subscription revenue and <strong>the promise of exposure they couldn’t count on getting otherwise</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Owing to inflation, Game Pass has recently increased in price, and the games that take pole position in the library chop and change, but there’s no doubting the power it has as a subscription-based product. That notion is set to improve, too – next month, the first Call of Duty game will grace the service in the form of Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>It already incorporates titles from the Ubisoft Connect and EA Play services, making it a seriously stacked offering for gamers worldwide, and it’s getting better all the time. </p>



<p>Sarah Bond and the rest of the crew at Xbox have immense faith in the product, and with a seeming desire to move away from console gaming, it’s only a matter of time before a seamlessly connected Game Pass experience is the firm’s foremost focus.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ps5-palworld-version-has-been-removed-from-tgs-exhibitor-list/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-palworld-version-has-been-removed-from-tgs-exhibitor-list.987423/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-palworld-version-has-been-removed-from-tgs-exhibitor-list/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Palworld was set to be on the exhibitors list at the Tokyo Games Show, but it seems that they have now been removed from the list entirely. This choice possibly comes after Nintendo issued a lawsuit, saying that Palworld was infringing on multiple of Nintendo's patents. On the day that the lawsuit was issued, one of the developers tweeted out an emoji while they were at TGS (as stated in their name on X). Still, an <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/news16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official statement</a> has been released on the Palworld social media and the Pocketpair website.</p>
<p>According to Pocketpair, they are unaware of what patents they are currently infringing on and are now beginning legal proceedings and investigations into <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/">Nintendo's claims</a>. In their statement, they claim, "We have not been notified of such details."</p>
<p>Pocketpair is an indie game company based in Tokyo, and Palworld had a lot of hype before and after its release. The game has over 275,000 reviews on Steam, with a Very Positive review status on the title. Although most people assumed that the lawsuit would be copyright-related, with many of the Pals looking strikingly similar to the designs of Pokemon, their patents are causing the issue.</p>
<p>CESA released the exhibitors list from Tokyo Games Show 2024 on September 11, which was way before the lawsuit was publicly issued to Pocketpair. It was said that there was going to be a PS5 showcase of Palworld, but it was removed the same day it was announced. Pocketpair may still be showcasing Palworld regardless, and the list revealed by CESA was just incorrectly updated, or they were given the wrong details.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It's likely that as a result of this lawsuit, either Pocketpair has made the conscious decision to remove themselves from the exhibitor list at TGS or the officials at TGS have removed them due to fear of unwanted attention or controversy by 'supporting' them. It's possible that Pocketpair will make a statement as to why they have been removed from the exhibitor list, but for now, it remains unknown.</p>
<p>If it were true that it was just a factual error, it's possible that their appearance or lack thereof at TGS has nothing to do with Nintendo's lawsuit. They could be there as visitors and nothing more.</p>

			<p>Concord is one of Sony's biggest mistakes in game development, with the game being pulled offline and refunded just two weeks after it launched. Concord aimed to be the premium in a sea of free-to-play hero shooters. However, the numbers weren't there, and it received a 1.8 Metacritic User score. In a recent <a href="https://x.com/longislandviper/status/1837157796137030141" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sacred Symbols podcast episode</a>, Colin Moriarty mentioned that they had spoken to one of the staff members who worked on Concord at Firewalk Studios and spoke "extensively for a long time" about Concord and its situation.</p>
<p>The whole situation was doomed from the start, with the game being overhyped internally and referred to as "the future of PlayStation." That statement could be correct to some degree, but would more so imply the future of PlayStation is going downhill along with Concord. The game was so hyped up within the studio and at PlayStation, that there was a dev culture of "toxic positivity," which didn't allow for any negative feedback to be given at any point.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>While it was estimated at a much lower number, Concord cost about $400 million to make, leaving Sony a pretty hefty void after the game failed to perform as expected. Concord was in development for a couple of years, reaching an Alpha state in late 2023. At that point, Sony didn't even own <a href="https://wccftech.com/concords-director-has-reportedly-stepped-down/">Firewalk Studios</a>, but they had been working alongside them to create this title since 2020 or 2021. Moriarty mentions that before it had even reached the Alpha state, they had already spent at least $200 million on developing the game, which is a huge amount of money to sink into something that isn't even close to being released to the public. Moriarty mentions that it's uncertain how much of that money came from the original studio that was developing Concord and how much of it came from Sony.</p>
<p>Between the Alpha period and the game's release, Sony spent another $200 million on Concord. According to the employee who spoke to Moriarty, by the time the game was showcased to a public audience, it was in a "laughable state," and it looked so terrible that Sony felt they had to spend more money to make the product viable. By the end of the first quarter of 2023, the game was still incredibly unfinished, so Sony paid a significant sum of money and outsourced the game to other studios to try and put the product together.</p>
<p>Once the game was released, Sony made just about $1 million in gross revenue but then refunded everything. This is one of Sony's biggest losses on the market, with games such as The Last of Us Part 2 and Spider-Man costing less than Concord but being significantly more successful.</p>
<p>Sony so heavily championed Concord that it was considered a "Star Wars-like" project for them and would be successful on a grand scale. It was also seen as Hermen Hulst's "baby."</p>

<p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, from developer Capcom, is a full-blown remaster of the original game, with modern graphics, quality-of-life tweaks, updated controls, additional voice acting, auto-save features, and so much more. Despite the many changes to the gameplay, both content and technical, the core experience remains very much the same.</p>



<p>As Frank West, you infiltrate the Willamette Mall in search of the story of a lifetime—the zombie apocalypse in America’s backyard. What unfolds is a story of survival and government conspiracy the likes of which the public may never see…unless you can escape the mall within the time limit.</p>

<!-- cache hit 130:single/related:bd366776280c9d99fc764e953edae99c --><!-- empty -->
<p>I can't remember every interaction I had with the advisers in <em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>games, but I don't believe I ever had to send my guards to put down a protest one of them staged in a new settlement.</p>

<p>Nor could I ask any of them for "Favours" to scrape a few more heat stamps necessary for a new food district, indebting me to them at some future point when they decide they've had enough of some other faction's people and ideas. In&nbsp;<em><a href="https://frostpunk2.com/">Frostpunk 2</a> (</em>out today), the people who pop up to tell you how they're feeling aren't just helpful indicators, they're a vital part of the strategy. To keep these people going, you've got to make some of them mad, some of them happy, and balance a ledger of all you've gained and demanded from them.</p>
<p>That's the biggest difference you'll notice in&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em> if you're coming from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/04/frostpunk-review-ice-burg/">the original</a>. The original had you making choices that affected people, but you were the Captain, in full control of your people, at least until you angered them enough to revolt. In&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, you manage factions and communities rather than groups of survivors. You place districts, not hospitals. Time moves in days and weeks, not hours. You play multiple chapters across a landscape in a world that is 30 years removed from its initial peril.
</p><p>The challenge of <em>Frostpunk 2 </em>is no longer simply getting everyone through this winter. There is now some thought of what kind of people you want to be once you have enough fuel, food, and children. Are you in managed decline, or can you build something better, despite the world trying to kill you?</p>

<h2>A beautiful grid with brutal choices</h2>
<p>Those are the big-picture changes to <em>Frostpunk 2</em>. At the ground level, the general feeling is quite familiar. It's cold, it sometimes gets colder, and there's a furnace to feed. This time, you need to do "Icebreaking" to unlock tiles for development, but you don't have to worry so much about the exact placement of individual bits. Your colony or city will link itself up and look beautiful in the game's grim Victorian cryo-future style. You have to figure out how to scrimp the resources to put an extraction district on the oil reserves, making enough heat for the residents to stop getting sick so you can then send them out to recover goods from a decimated wagon and then icebreak some more toward a food source, all while planning to build a research center and council building.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>The research and political trees you climb are more varied and even harder to choose in this sequel. Early in&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, your explorers find a body in the ice with the insignia of the first game's city on his jacket, and they ask you if it stands for Order or Faith. However you answer, you will have more than just two ideas to choose from. At the base level are two communities, Progress-focused New Londoners and Adaptation-minded Frostlanders. Then you get Order-obsessed Stalwarts, Faithkeepers, and their respective opposition, Pilgrims and Evolvers. Playing the game's "Utopia Builder" mode after the chapter-based story mode brings in a <em>lot</em> more communities and factions. You know, for this fun thing you do in your spare time.</p>
<p>At the Council Hall, you will need to negotiate with these factions to get votes out of the 100 members, divided up by faction influence. Most votes need 51, but votes that change your power require 66. If a faction is on the fence, you can promise them something, like future research projects or other law changes. Break that promise, and they will work against you in the future. Radicals will show up inside each faction, requiring you to either appease them or find support elsewhere. You can look at all the players and "Cornerstones" (ideologies) at play in one of the game's beautifully informative screens. You can ponder this while, all around you, the basic needs like fuel, materials, food, and shelter keep needing to be managed.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Lately, Nintendo seems to act like it's a secret to everybody about who is actually making a game. In fact, there is still no official confirmation for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom's developer, even though it comes out next week. But, a new report points to a familiar name working on the game.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer-seemingly-confirmed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Grezzo is apparently the studio behind The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. This was reportedly spotted by people who have preordered the Switch exclusive, like <a href="https://x.com/naetoru60/status/1836743459262116136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1836743459262116136%7Ctwgr%5Ec16b8303c8f3d94e9b584a129c1e164461ea1a50%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer-seemingly-confirmed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Naruki on X</a>. Previously, the developer worked on The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D, and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D. <a href="https://www.grezzo.co.jp/en/game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Grezzo also has created games</a> outside the Zelda franchise, such as Ever Oasis on 3DS and Jet
