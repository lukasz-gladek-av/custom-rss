            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Acclaimed indie developer Simogo is celebrating its 15th birthday today, but it feels like we're the one getting presents. Fans of the Swedish studio are going to be thrilled with the projects the team has revealed, so buckle up.</p>
<p>First up (thanks, <a href="https://vgc.news/news/simogo-reveals-7-game-collection-for-switch-and-pc-confirms-sayonara-wild-hearts-for-switch-2/">VGC</a>!) are Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sayonara-wild-hearts-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a>, two of our favourite games on the Switch. Sharper visuals and frames are likely part of these packages, and we only have to wait until <strong>early next year</strong> to try them out. No upgrade path has been revealed just yet.</p>
<p>Second, we have the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/simogo-legacy-collection">Simogo Legacy Collection</a> coming to both Switch 1 and Switch 2 on <strong>2nd December 2025</strong>. This is a compilation of the studio's first seven titles <em>and</em> a whole host of bonus content which, as <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/simogo-legacy-collection-announced-for-switch-2-switch-and-pc">Gematsu</a> highlights, including an E-book, an audio drama podcast, unreleased music and art, and a handful of playable prototypes.</p>
<p>All the games in this collection were originally released on iOS, and while some did come to Wii U, most of these have never seen a console release. Simogo actually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-dev-teases-switch-port-of-critically-acclaimed-text-adventure">teased one of these earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>The titles are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kosmo Spin</strong> (2010) - a circular arcade game where you're trying to save a planet full of breakfast cereal</li>
<li><strong>Bumpy Road</strong> (2011) - a road trip adventure where you control the road and not the car</li>
<li><strong>Beat Sneak Bandit</strong> (2012) - a rhythmic-based puzzler where you need to sneak inside the mansion to win</li>
<li><strong>Year Walk</strong> (2013) - a first-person adventure based on the Swedish tradition of årsgång, "year walking"</li>
<li><strong>DEVICE 6</strong> (2013) - a text-based puzzler where you guide a woman through an island who doesn't remember getting there</li>
<li><strong>The Sailor's Dream</strong> (2014) - a narrative adventure that changes based on the real-world clock</li>
<li><strong>SPL-T</strong> (2015) <em>-</em> a block-splitting puzzler</li>
</ul>
<p>Last, but by no means least, Simogo has teamed up with the lovely folks at Lost in Cult for <strong><a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/simogo?mc_cid=574d33de01&amp;mc_eid=a503eeac91">Heartbeats, Dreams and Laser Eyes: 15 Years of Simogo</a></strong>, a stunning book covering the studio's history, philosophy, and inspirations.</p>

<p>Essays from writers Holly Nielsen, Christian Donlan, Nadia Oxford and Aaron Riccio will dive deep into the studio's projects and games, and the book as a whole promises to "provide readers with a deeper understanding of one of the most consistently inventive studios in the business."</p>
<p>The Deluxe Edition will be available for a limited time and it'll cost <strong>£69.99</strong> (the standard edition is much cheaper at <strong>£39.99</strong>) — the first 300 copies will come with a signed bookplate from co-founders Simon Flesser and Magnus 'Gordon' Gardebäck. Check out the <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/simogo?mc_cid=574d33de01&amp;mc_eid=a503eeac91">website for more details</a>.</p>

<p>Well, that's a darn good slate; every single game Simogo has released will be on Switch 1 <em>and</em> Switch 2 come early next year. Plus that book is tasty.</p>
<p>If you haven't played either Lorelei or Sayonara Wild Hearts, what are you <em>doing?</em> Okay, we get it, lots of games — check out our reviews for both (below) if you're curious.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amazon is laying off more than 14,000 corporate jobs today, and per a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTY2Nzc5MywiZXhwIjoxNzYyMjcyNTkzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNFVOSThHUTdMSEIwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.gpW2CyZmAypCDjxGr-gBHrW6EnUxZkFspCrjiLV-dwc">Bloomberg</a>, the video games division, Amazon Game Studios, is not immune to the cuts.</p>



<p>While Amazon doesn't specify exactly how many people from its video games division will be laid off, a statement from Steve Boom, Amazon's head of audio, Twitch, and games, does call the cut "<em>significant</em>," and says that the cuts are happening despite Amazon being "<em>proud</em>" of the success it has had. While the studio's MMO, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-horror-themed-nighthaven-looks-good-players-eager-dive-back/">New World</a>, isn't mentioned by name, the statement does say that Amazon is halting its game development work "<em>specifically around MMOs</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>While we're proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing</em>," the statement reads, "<em>we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work - specifically around MMOs - within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in or studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team</em>."</p>







<p>A report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/807825/amazon-job-layoffs-2025-ai">The Verge</a> adds that the driving force behind these cuts comes from Amazon pushing further into AI, with senior executive Beth Galetti writing in a memo to staff, "<em>The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers’ current and future needs</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well</em>. <em>This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly</em>."</p>



<p>While Amazon calls out MMOs as the genre it is specifically halting work in, it's unclear if the company will move forward in other areas of game development and publishing. Or, this could be the first major sign that Amazon is getting out of games entirely, and will stick to producing TV and film adaptations of video game properties, like its highly popular <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/">Fallout series</a> and upcoming series adaptations of <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/">Wolfenstein</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mass-effect-tv-show-same-production-team-behind-fallout-tv-show/">Mass Effect</a>.</p>

              <p>Amazon is pulling back from blockbuster games. The company is laying off 14,000 people, including some across its gaming division. According to an internal memo reviewed by <em>Bloomberg</em>, those cuts include halting a “significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work–specifically around MMOs–within Amazon Game Studios.” The company had previously announced an ambitious<em> Lord of the Rings</em> MMORPG.</p> <p>“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work–specifically around MMOs–within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,” Amazon head of games, Twitch, and audio Steve Boom wrote in an email to staff, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division">reports<em> Bloomberg</em></a>.</p>

 <p>Amazon has mostly struggled in the world of game development outside of 2021’s MMO <em>New World</em>. It’s only other hits like <em>Lost Ark</em> and <em>Throne and Liberty</em> were developed by external partners. It’s currently set to publish the next <em>Tomb Raider</em> game as well as several other unannounced projects, including an internally developed <em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO and an online AAA action-RPG. It’s now unclear if those projects will move on or be canceled.</p>

 <p>The latest cuts come amid a recent overhaul of Amazon’s cloud gaming service Luna, with an emphasis on party games including one <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=snoop+kotaku&amp;sca_esv=f60ecab60e0aa489&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifOXDxq2ETzQl4cY3e3JzPgqEeaJrw%3A1761669797715&amp;ei=pfIAaaqvK-Ot5NoP87KVmQ0&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqlYS0q8eQAxXjFlkFHXNZJdMQ4dUDCBE&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=snoop+kotaku&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiDHNub29wIGtvdGFrdTIFECEYoAEyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigATIFECEYoAEyBRAhGJ8FMgUQIRifBTIFECEYnwUyBRAhGJ8FMgUQIRifBTIFECEYnwVIrglQAFjGCHAAeACQAQCYAY0CoAHYCaoBBTkuMi4xuAEDyAEA-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&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">powered by an AI Snoop Dogg avatar</a>.

<p>Amazon is laying off more than 14,000 corporate employees. Within those layoffs, Amazon Games and Twitch will be hit in some capacity.</p>



<p>Bloomberg says, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTY2Nzc5MywiZXhwIjoxNzYyMjcyNTkzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNFVOSThHUTdMSEIwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.gpW2CyZmAypCDjxGr-gBHrW6EnUxZkFspCrjiLV-dwc&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">without going into</a> specifics, that both video games and the cloud-computing area of the company will be affected. Insider Gaming has reached out to Amazon to ask how many people were set to be let go from the gaming division and Twitch. As of publishing, a response has not been received.</p>



<p>According to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, the cuts “would largely fall on its offices in Irvine and San Diego, as well as its central publishing division.”</p>



<p><strong>“The company will reduce the amount of work it does on big-budget titles, particularly surrounding massively multiplayer online games or MMOs,”</strong> the report reads.</p>



<p><strong>“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,”</strong> an email sent by vice president of audio, Twitch, and games Steve Boom to employees said.</p>



<p>Included in the layoffs was Tarfu, who had been with Twitch for 11 years.</p>



<p><strong>“I started off working in trust &amp; safety, then moved to customer experience,” </strong><a href="https://x.com/Tarfu/status/1983196834698015164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he shared.</a> <strong>“I was the person who built the entire fraud program at Twitch. One of the reasons I never told people what I did for work.</strong></p>



<p>“<strong>I was the one keeping bad actors off Twitch who steal and abuse revenue on the platform. I guess I did my job too well since they let me go. But do I have some great stories of being there over a decade.”</strong></p>



<p>News of the mass layoffs was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/amazon-targets-many-30000-corporate-job-cuts-sources-say-2025-10-27/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first reported</a> by Reuters. The cuts would be, according to the outlet, the largest cut since 2022, when Amazon let go of roughly 27,000 people. This new set of layoffs would be the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/27/amazon-to-announce-sweeping-corporate-job-cuts-starting-tuesday.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">largest in company history</a>, with impacted employees to be notified via email.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will have more coverage of the layoffs, including what happens to Amazon Games, as it becomes available.</p>

<p>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2’s Future Saga Chapter 3 DLC arrives on October 30, 2025, with new characters, missions, and more content. </p>



<p>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 is one of those games that has been receiving post-launch content for almost a decade now. Earlier this year, the developers introduced the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zeros-daima-character-pack-2-releases-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daima Pack</a>, which brought Goku Super Saiyan 4 to the title. We are now receiving Future Saga Chapter 3, which introduces Broly from Dragon Ball Super and Golden Frieza (Ultra Supervillain). </p>



<h2 id="h-xenoverse-2-future-saga-chapter-3-will-introduce-broly-and-golden-frieza">Xenoverse 2 Future Saga Chapter 3 Will Introduce Broly and Golden Frieza</h2>



<p>The new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtxSegpS7TI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> provides plot details for Xenoverse 2 Future Saga Chapter 3. Frieza has joined hands with Fu, and now he aims to master time itself, which is why they are trying to infiltrate the Time Next. Frieza has unlocked another form that draws power from the crystals, making the character more powerful than ever. The design of this character and some of the plot points seem inspired by Black Frieza’s origins in the Dragon Ball Super manga. </p>



<p>Along with the new playable characters, Golden Frieza (Ultra Supervillain) and Broly (DB Super), the developers have introduced tons of new content for players to try out. A brand new mission, three new parallel quests, six additional moves, five costumes/accessories, three Super Souls, 23 Illustrations, a new stage: Conton City ruins, and an extra scenario: Cheelai &amp; Broly All Out! Conton City Patrol. Towards the end of the trailer, the devs also teased that Future Saga will receive a fourth and final chapter. </p>

<hr>
<p>Okay, so, look, I wasn't <em>trying</em> to do a heist. This is all a big misunderstanding.</p>
<p>See, the Louvre is mostly known for its paintings, statues, stealing art from other countries, and being hard to pronounce for anyone who doesn't have a French tongue. (<em>Loov. Looooov-ruh. Loovuhrrr. Loovurhrh.</em> Never mind.) Also, that one really famous, wildly underwhelming picture of the lady with the mystic smile.</p>
<p>But that's not what I care about when it comes to the Louvre. The Parisian pyramid is the only museum in the world that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/12/hands_on_nintendo_3ds_guide_louvre">used 3DSes as their audio guides</a>, and I've never had the chance to try them! And then, tragically, when the museum <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/louvre-says-au-revoir-to-nintendo-3ds-audio-guides">discontinued them earlier this year</a>, I thought to myself, 'Well, what are they going to do with all those 3DSes? Put them into the archive, like all the rejected paintings that don't draw a big enough crowd? I won't stand for it.'</p>
<figure data-uuid="e729831c85fd3"><a title="Louvre Guide on 3DS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e729831c85fd3/louvre-guide-on-3ds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>I was going to nab a copy of the game, too — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, I went to visit the museum. Just a normal visit, you understand! And yes, I went in through a first-floor window via a ladder, but that wasn't because I was planning to steal things! I just wanted to beat the crowds. And avoid the entry cost. I mean, €25 to walk very slowly through a crowd taking selfies with the Mona Lisa? That's the real robbery here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>€25 to walk very slowly through a crowd taking selfies with the Mona Lisa? That's the real robbery here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was fully my intention to walk over to the information desk, politely ask about the 3DSes, and whether a caring patron of the arts such as myself could make a donation to the museum in order to take one home, and then once they'd handed me a big box of 3DSes, I would leave down my special museum ladder.</p>
<p>But once I was in, well, the crown jewels were just <em>sitting there</em>. I thought to myself, 'You can buy a <em>lot</em> of 3DSes with crown jewels money. Maybe you could even afford a single secondhand copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_heartgold_and_soulsilver">Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver</a> from <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/playing-the-cex-retro-lottery">CeX</a>!'</p>
<p>Besides, I had a very capacious tote bag with me.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I was slowly trundling down the ladder back to the streets of Paris that I even realised that I'd done a heist, or that no sane person on eBay is going to buy <em>obviously stolen</em> crown jewels.</p>
<p>So, here I am, with no 3DSes and too many crown jewels, and people keep writing articles about how cool I am, despite the fact that crown jewels can't play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/hotel_dusk_room_215">Hotel Dusk</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/kid_icarus_uprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a>.</p>
<p>Look, I wrote up a comparison:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>3DS</th>
<th>Crown Jewels</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>✅ Comes in many colours</td>
<td>❌ Comes in factory colours only</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅ Take it anywhere</td>
<td>❌ Can only be taken to state occasions or maybe a fancy party</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅ Customisable home menu themes</td>
<td>❌ No home menu themes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅ StreetPass!</td>
<td>❌ No StreetPass</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅ Playable in 2D and 3D</td>
<td>❌ No 2D option</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅ Can play cult classic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/zero_escape_virtues_last_reward">Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward</a></td>
<td>❌ Cannot play cult classic Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As you can see, the obvious winner is the 3DS. It's not even close. And sure, the Crown Jewels make for some very nice hats, but I don't even <em>want</em> hats. I want to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/pullblox">Pullblox</a>, on a commuter train, with the option to make my eyes feel like they're being peeled from the inside!</p>
<p>Crown Jewels don't even have expandable SD card storage, so even if I <em>wanted</em> to take them to fancy parties or state occasions, I'd have to bring a separate external hard drive with me for all my games. Who wants to bring an external hard drive to a masquerade ball, or the coronation of the new monarch? Not me. It's very unfashionable.</p>

<p>But all is not lost. I have, in fact, started to melt down a couple of the pieces, because I have an amazing idea. I may not have a Louvre 3DS, but I do have a <em>normal</em> 3DS, and it's one of the 'New' ones with swappable faceplates. I've had mine protected by an understated Triforce-pattern plate for a long, long time, so I think I've earned a little glitz and glamour, haven't I?</p>
<p>It turns out that gluing 10-carat emeralds to a bit of plastic is a <em>little</em> difficult, but it's worth it. I feel like a queen, if queens knew what autostereoscopic handheld video game consoles were. It does make the thing bloody heavy, though.</p>
<p>Oh, and hopefully it goes without saying, but please don't tell anyone that I did the heist, okay? I really, really don't want to go to French prison. Or any kind of prison, really. I don't think they let you keep your 3DSes when you're incarcerated. Thanks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Zack Fair's gameplay in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is set to be significantly expanded by a new mod introducing new mechanics and skill for an overhauled combat experience.</p>



<p>This Zack gameplay overhaul mod is being developed by NSK, the modder behind the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/658">Zack and Sephiroth Combat Fix mod</a> whichaddressed some issues for the two characters and expanded their possibilities when added to the regular combat party outside their small playable segments. </p>



<p>Judging from the video showcase shared a few days ago on YouTube, the changes being made to Zack's gameplay are going to be significant, leveraging his unique Charge mechanics in some very interesting ways while adding some new skills, which include offensive skills that change depending on the Charge level, new Limit Break extensions, changes to existing abilities like High Braver, new combo routes and more. </p>



<p>As the character felt somewhat basic to use, despite some of his unique mechanics, these changes are set to be extremely welcome, providing PC players with one more reason to return to the game and experience it with some new features, although some of the changes could potentially break the game balance in some ways, especially if Zack is fighting with a full party, and not by himself as shown in the video below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy has expanded Zack's role beyond the original, it will be very interesting to see whether the character will return in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's sequel, and how his gameplay will evolve past the foundation set in the second episode of the trilogy if he does. Thankfully, it should take much longer to learn more about a game that is <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-coming-along-well-says-director-very-confident/">coming along really wel</a>l, and <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-ending-satisfy-old-time-fans-newcomers/">that should satisfy old and new fans alike.</a></p>



<p>Before the third part of the trilogy launches, Xbox and Nintendo Switch 2 owners will finally get to experience both Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth in the future. <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/">The first entry in the trilogy will hit both systems on January 22, 2026.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's a big day for <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a>, with both its Season 1 update now live for players to jump into, and its new free-to-play battle royale mode, Battlefield REDSEC, also now available. EA and Battlefield Studios confirmed yesterday what was already rumored, that REDSEC would be revealed and launched today, and now it's here for all players on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Once the gameplay trailer that was teased yesterday was over, the mode and the new season was officially live for all players to jump into, and we got our first major question of the day answered. Battlefield REDSEC can be accessed as an added DLC through Battlefield 6 and will be available in the menu for players who already own the game and have it downloaded. </p>



<p>If you don't already own Battlefield 6, then when you go to download REDSEC, you'll have to access it through Battlefield 6. At least for now, EA and Battlefield Studios have not broken it off into a separate app.</p>



<p>We also learned that the roadmap shared earlier this year was not at all the complete roadmap, which has now been shared along with the release of REDSEC and Season 1.</p>

<p>On top of the new game modes and the new Conquest map, Blackwell Ridge, that arrives in Battlefield 6 with Season 1 today (<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">which you can learn more about in our Season 1 preview</a>), REDSEC arrives with two different game modes: a core battle royale mode and a multiplayer-inspired mode, Gauntlet.</p>



<p>Both modes are set on one map called Fort Lyndon, a government testing ground that is basically your own personal battlefield for REDSEC and its two modes. The battle royale mode is your bog-standard battle royale of 100 players entering a map that continuously gets smaller with a toxic circle pushing everyone to one area, and the last squad standing wins. Squads can be either two or four players, with no solo queue available at launch.</p>



<p>You'll decide on your class and sidearm before dropping in, and acquire the rest of your loadout during the match, including primary weapons, gadgets, etc. It's even possible to find keycards that'll grant access to vehicles like tanks, though they come with limited fuel and ammo.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield REDSEC Official Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rn8k1g3vMDU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The new Gauntlet mode is a "<em>knockout-style</em>" mode with eight squads entering the fray, each trying to complete a set of missions to end up on top.</p>



<p>"<em>Every Gauntlet 'round' is a different mode or 'missions,' such as Deadlock, a multi-team variant of King of the</em> <em>Hill, or Wreckage, which is similar to Rush,</em>" the Battlefield 6 <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/season-1-full-roadmap">website reads in its explanation of Gauntlet</a>. "<em>With eight mission types and numerous Combat Zones, it is incredibly rare to have the exact same Gauntlet mission sequence in back-to-back matches.</em>"</p>



<p>You'll also be able to create your own versions of REDSEC through Portal, which can let you really up the ante and adjust REDSEC to create whatever crazed and chaotic version of REDSEC you want for both the core battle royale mode and Gauntlet.</p>



<p>It's also worth mentioning that the first battle pass for Battlefield 6 is now live for players to start working their way through. Of course, you can mostly ignore the battle pass if you're not a fan of the weapon and character skins it is mostly filled with, but you will have to work through them if you want to unlock the new weapons like the SOR-300SC carbine or the new Mini-Scout sniper rifle.</p>



<p>Beyond that, it's exciting to see REDSEC now live for players to try out, and it'll be interesting to see what players think of it as we get ever closer to a new year of Call of Duty and Warzone. We'll have a better idea by the end of the year if REDSEC can stand up to Warzone and keep players interested.</p>



<p>And for EA and Battlefield Studios sake, hopefully today's launch doesn't also come with a slew of technical issues.</p>

<p>Microsoft has announced that it’s increasing its investment in AI. On Tuesday, it was announced that the company purchased a 27% stake in OpenAI for $135 billion. </p>



<p>Microsoft has had a partnership with OpenAI for years, but Tuesday’s announcement increases that commitment to the AI-based company behind ChatGPT, Sora, Whisper, and more. </p>



<p><strong>“What began as an investment in a research organization has grown into one of the most successful partnerships in our industry,”</strong> the joint press announcement says. <strong>“As we enter the next phase of this partnership, we’ve signed a new definitive agreement that builds on our foundation, strengthens our partnership, and sets the stage for long-term success for both organizations.”</strong></p>



<p>With the added push towards AI within Microsoft, players and employees are likely to be concerned about more AI being used to develop upcoming games. On this front, Xbox’s Phil Spencer has gone on record saying that they won’t force its use on staff. </p>



<p>He said that AI use is left to individual teams and that he’s <strong>“found that creative teams will use tools that make their job easier when it makes their job easier, and any top-down mandate that ‘Thou must use a certain tool’…is not really a path to success.”</strong></p>



<p>What do you think the future holds for AI within Microsoft and Xbox? Leave your thoughts down in the comments, and join the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The free-to-play <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> battle royale game mode has officially arrived in the form of Battlefield REDSEC – but it’s probably not exactly what you think it is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-shadow-drop-imminent-as-ea-schedules-redsec-gameplay-reveal-for-tomorrow">surprise launched</a> their Battlefield battle royale experience across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S just moments ago, bringing months of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-official-name-and-release-date-reportedly-leak-online"><u>rumors</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-gameplay-highlights-multiplayer-combat-in-latest-bf-labs-leak"><u>leaks</u></a> to an end with a standalone offering that’s free for both those who do and do not own Battlefield 6. Its name, shorthand for “Redacted Sector,” teases an updated take on a popular multiplayer pastime that’s been bundled in with two additional modes: Gauntlet and Portal. There’s more to REDSEC than fans may have expected, and it’s all tied in with the Battlefield 6 experience under one unified umbrella.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield Battle Royale</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle royale is no doubt the headline here, offering access to 100-player matches where classic battle royale gameplay is mixed with the Battlefield 6 formula. Infantry can be seen parachuting over and into explosive firefights in its first trailer, which reveals how BF Studios translated familiar elements into the Battlefield universe, all while 2Pac and Dr. Dre’s California Love plays in the background.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finding rare loot, hoarding armor plates, mastering small and large points of interest, and completing missions with friends are core parts of many battle royale experiences, and each is necessary to survive in Battlefield, too. It's more Warzone than Fortnite, but REDSEC has some features that help it stand apart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fort Lyndon, a Southern California location that EA and BF Studios call the “biggest Battlefield map ever,” serves as the backdrop for each match. As the trailer highlights crumbling buildings, REDSEC aims to convince players it can build on battle royale without sacrificing what so many love about the franchise: tactical destruction.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield REDSEC Launch Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Map-altering vehicles are a mainstay for any true Battlefield experience, and that remains the case for Battlefield 6 battle royale, which features everything from tanks to attack boats to golf carts to find. As the ever-present, ever-shrinking ring of fire (fans may remember it from Battlefield V: Firestorm) forces teams out of the frying pan, discovering an M1 Abrams could mean the difference between victory and succumbing to the flames. There will be plenty of less-threatening vehicles to discover around the new battle royale map, but those looking to drive a heavily armored tank will first need to complete missions, nab a keycard reward, and then use it to unlock specific garages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 and REDSEC will coexist, so those who have already enjoyed the former can expect to find familiar vehicles, guns, and gadgets in the latter – save for a few tweaks. Class upgrades are just one element to consider and give Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon players upgrades to work toward. Earn enough XP as the Recon class, for example, and you'll gain access to an enhancement that powers up drones with bomb-dropping capabilities. Custom loadouts can also be built and used, with players able to earn them by completing missions or by betting on the slightly riskier option of waiting for limited global drop events.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/fort-lyndon-1761661117488.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield REDSEC: Fort Lyndon. Image courtesy of EA.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 players have not-so-patiently waited for battle royale updates for months. Now that REDSEC is finally here to toss Battlefield into a battle royale blender, fans should know that it's not the only new experience dropping today.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gauntlet</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you need a break from battle royale, Gauntlet is a separate mode that is also offered as part of today’s new standalone free-to-play experience. While Battlefield battle royale may see squads prowling for loot in between shootouts throughout longer matches, Gauntlet is propped up as a relatively short, elimination-driven gameplay experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead of 100-player matches, just 32 players (eight squads with four players each) are spread across Fort Lyndon. BF Studios says Gauntlet is structured as a tournament, with teams tasked with fighting through fast-paced, round-based missions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have five minutes to complete the objective for each round, with Gauntlet keeping everyone on their toes with rotating missions and locations. As objectives and settings shift, it’s teamwork that will determine which squad emerges victorious.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Portal</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield fans have been familiar with Portal since its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-portal-custom-game-mode-announced">inception in Battlefield 2042</a>. Although the community has already taken to Battlefield 6 Portal to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-launched-just-hours-ago-and-players-have-already-recreated-call-of-duty-map-shipment-in-portal">create bizarre game modes and recreate fan-favorite maps</a>, REDSEC Portal opens a new door of possibilities.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/rs-screenshot-5-1761624880681.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield REDSEC brings Portal to Fort Lyndon. Image courtesy of EA.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">REDSEC takes the promise of limitless game-creation tools and brings them over to Fort Lyndon’s massive play area. It’s more room for fans to let their imaginations run wild, with one example we’ve seen including a midair obstacle course that features golf carts, colorful shipping containers, and narrow paths.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">REDSEC Portal looks more Grand Theft Auto Online than Battlefield, but that also seems to be what EA and BF Studios are going for. Two official Portal maps will be available at launch, with more set to follow in the future.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Does Battlefield 6 Work With REDSEC?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The base Battlefield 6 experience takes after Call of Duty, bundling in REDSEC so that players can access it from one main menu. Those who don’t own the recently released Battlefield game can still download REDSEC without issue and at no extra charge, but there are a few differences for those who own the full, premium experience and those who don’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coinciding with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-trailer-highlights-blackwell-fields-and-eastwood-maps-ahead-of-next-weeks-launch"><u>the launch of Season 1 today</u></a> is Battlefield 6’s battle pass system, which shares unlocked rewards and XP progress between both the base game and its REDSEC counterpart. Though some unique challenges and events will be tied to each experience, and some Battlefield 6 vehicle skins won’t appear in certain REDSEC experiences, EA says “there are no plans” for REDSEC-exclusive unlocks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Portal is where things get slightly complicated. Creative fans who own Battlefield 6 can enjoy the new Portal tools introduced with REDSEC completely unrestricted, gaining access to all the new standalone experience and Fort Lyndon have to offer. Those without the base game, however, won’t have access to any Battlefield 6-exclusive content, such as maps, when making Portal creations. These restrictions don’t stop at the creation side of the user-generated community content hub, either, as EA clarifies that REDSEC-exclusive players won’t be able to create or play any content using Battlefield 6 materials.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield REDSEC Fort Lyndon Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield REDSEC isn’t just battle royale – it’s a completely different beast. This three-pillar standalone experience will change as seasonal updates continue to roll out, and if the weeks following the launch of Battlefield 6 are anything to go by, it will also likely rapidly change as community feedback pours in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The October 10 release of Battlefield 6 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S proved to be quite the moment for the series, but the true test of its potential begins with REDSEC and Season 1. While we wait to see how EA and BF Studios plan to maintain yet another major addition to the Battlefield universe, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-community-update-reveals-long-list-of-gameplay-changes-ahead-of-season-1-and-battle-royale-launch">all of the changes introduced with Season 1</a>.

But if you've ever wondered what became of all-American couple Brad Majors and Janet Weiss after their fateful night in the mansion, you're about to get an answer. That's where the official graphic novel sequel Bride of Rocky Horror comes in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bitbotmedia/rocky-horror-show-bride-of-rocky-horror?ref=73z702" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Kickstarter campaign for The Rocky Horror Show: Bride of Rocky Horror</a> live now, IGN can exclusively debut a new preview of the book. Check it out in the slideshow gallery below, along with a look at some of the exclusive merch tied to the campaign:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Bride of Rocky Horror Preview Art Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bride of Rocky Horror is a 95-page book set seven years after the events of the musical. The book is published by Bit Bot Media, and the creative team includes writer Magdalene Visaggio (Girlmode), artist Noemi Vettori (X-Men Unlimited), colorist Josh Rodriguez (The Brooding Muse), letterer Jeremiah Lambert (Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver – The Dead Shall Rise), and cover artist Soo Lee (Carmilla). Here's the official logline for the book:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Bride of Rocky Horror, Janet Weiss has embraced a life of decadence and debauchery. But when a mysterious invitation draws her back into the orbit of her ex-fiancé Brad Majors, a new mystery unfolds. Who is the enigmatic Bridget Von Frankenstein? What secrets is Brad hiding? And is it, once again, time for the Time Warp?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Rocky Horror is one of my favorite stories of all time,” said Visaggio in a statement. “It was the safest queer art I had access to when I was young because my parents were both huge fans. So to get the chance to look beyond it and see how it could have played out once that fateful night ended was a dream come true. I tried to make something as personal and idiosyncratic as O'Brien's original, riffing off the themes that stood out to me the same way O'Brien was riffing on his childhood influences. I think me and Noemi have made something really unique."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As an artist, and even more so as a Rocky Horror Show fan, it meant a lot to me to pay tribute to our beloved characters, striving to stay as true as possible to their original appearance and personalities,” said Vettori. “I hope I succeeded in representing what Rocky Horror embodies: chaos, passion, and rebellion. Working on Bride of Rocky Horror wasn’t just about illustration, it was about channeling all the energy of an eccentric and mesmerizing musical onto paper!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bitbotmedia/rocky-horror-show-bride-of-rocky-horror?ref=73z702" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Kickstarter campaign for The Rocky Horror Show: Bride of Rocky</a> is live now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other comics news, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dcs-batmandeadpool-1-to-feature-crossovers-between-nightwing-and-wolverine-harley-quinn-and-hulk-and-more">the other superhero crossovers featured in Batman/Deadpool #1</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wiccan-walks-the-witches-road-in-first-ever-solo-marvel-series">learn more about Marvel's Wiccan: The Witches' Road</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Masters of Albion Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"I think that line in Fable--'For every choice, a consequence'--wasn't delivered on well enough," Molyneux explained. "I think the possession mechanic that we had in Dungeon Keeper wasn't delivered on enough. The open-world freedom that we had in Black &amp; White, I think it was good at the start, but it didn't deliver enough at the end. And Masters of Albion is an opportunity to mix all those together. Even though one is an RTS, one is a god game, and one is a role-playing game, why the f**k can't we mix them all together?"</p><p>He went on to say that, because Masters of Albion is his last game (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peter-molyneux-says-masters-of-albion-could-be-his-last-game-due-to-his-smoking-drinking/1100-6526010/" data-ref-id="1100-6526010">primarily due to his drinking and smoking habits</a>), the city-building God game is all about course-correcting for his decades of misleading fans.</p><p>"And I don't know if it's going to work," Molyneux continued. "It's so important to me, this game, because to a certain extent it's about redemption. I admit now that I did overpromise on things, and said things that I shouldn't have said about Curiosity. But I only ever did that because I thought it was the right thing to do at the time. And so Masters Of Albion is a redemption title for me. But also, it's my last game. It just is."</p><p>With it being his last game, Molyneux kind of dipped back into his familiar bag again. Although he didn't explicitly say that Masters of Albion will do A, B, and/or C as he's done with his previous games, he did claim that the forthcoming strategy sim is "nothing you've ever played before." Not necessarily a promise, but an indication that Masters of Albion is something special. He went long, calling the game" significant" for him:</p><p>“For me, it's the most significant title that I've ever done, for sure. And I'll tell you the amazing thing--it’s going to f**king work. It really is. It's like nothing you've ever played before, but it's still unbelievably familiar. It is Black &amp; White, it is Dungeon Keeper, and it is Fable, but it's a completely new genre. And it shouldn't really work, but it does. I can't call this a great game. That's the wrong thing for me to say, because if I say in the press, 'Masters Of Albion is going to be a great game,' that's a promise. So I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is, it's a unique experience, which is unbelievably intimate and familiar to any person who played Fable, Black &amp; White, and Dungeon Keeper. If I turn around and say, 'This is going to be my greatest game,' that's when I get in trouble."</p><p>Speaking of getting in trouble, do you remember Bryan Henderson? It's OK if you don't, but the name should ring a bell because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/curiosity-winner-once-promised-a-life-changing-pri/1100-6425241/" data-ref-id="1100-6425241">he won and never received a "life-changing" prize</a> for conquering Molyneux's experimental iOS game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/curiosity-the-concept/" data-ref-id="5000-244859">Curiosity</a> in 2013. </p><p>In development for at least three years, Masters of Albion was revealed at Gamescom Opening Night Live in August 2024. You build up a town by day with money and resources, and you defend your settlement at night from all manner of creatures, from ghouls to zombies. It doesn't have a release date yet, but it's coming to PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Here at <em>Game Informer</em>, we get pitches for games all day long, and unfortunately, we only have so many hours in the day to research and cover games. Every day, I get pitches for games I'd love to share with our audience that I just simply can't find the time to cover – there are so many games, y'all. But when I am able to bring attention to something people probably haven't heard of, it's always exciting, which is why I'm stoked to bring to your attention an upcoming horror game called The Florist.&nbsp;</p><p>It comes from Wellington, New Zealand-based developer Unclear Games, and when The Florist launches next year on consoles and PC, it will be the studio's first release. If what I've seen from the reveal trailer, which you can view below, and learned from talking with Unclear Games founder and CEO Phil Larsen is any indication, The Florist is a game fans of horror – particularly classic Resident Evil – should keep an eye on.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out The Florist reveal trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sbvgu1hnQkQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sbvgu1hnQkQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"The Florist tells the story of Jessica Park, who arrives in the lakeside town of Joycliffe to make a last-minute delivery," a press release reads. "Her timing sparks disaster as the town quickly descends into a deadly game of survival against omnipresent floral overgrowth. Players must solve ingenious puzzles, defeat horrifying enemies, and uncover a mysterious plan to create new life in the most inhuman way imaginable."&nbsp;</p><p>Larsen tells me Unclear Games is inspired by all types of horror, but especially the 2002 Resident Evil Remake, and The Florist makes that very clear with a fixed camera, a terrifying locale to explore, plenty of puzzles that require creativity and deduction skills, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>"I started off thinking about the game I would most like to play, mostly by sitting down with a coffee and sketchpad, drawing maps and thinking about cool locations, puzzles, and routes between areas," Larsen tells me over email. "I still replay the classics constantly, so settling on an experience taking inspiration from those felt like a good direction. Not to mention, fixed cameras solve a lot of production hurdles from the outset, which is always a huge benefit."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Larsen says when he thinks about the horror genre in games he loves so much, games like Sweet Home, Alone in the Dark, and the original Resident Evil trilogy of games (RE1 through RE3 on PlayStation) come to mind. But for him, the 2002 Resident Evil remake changed how he thinks about games. "It just fired on all cylinders and hit every mark," he says. "[Remake] launched, crushed it, dropped the mic. To this day, it's considered the gold standard. So The Florist team is working hard to deliver an experience that does justice to that standard."&nbsp;</p><p>It's one thing to be inspired by your favorite games, and the fixed camera work in The Florist looks great so far, but it's important for games to stand on their own as well. Larsen says the game's floral theme should provide something fresh in horror.&nbsp;</p><p>"The floral theme lets us experiment with color and growth, which is rare in horror," he says. "The game takes place in the very early stages of a catastrophic event, rather than days or weeks later. So flowers, enemies, and the levels themselves grow and change throughout the course of the game, which we're very excited to continue exploring. As a benefit of these environmental changes, that's how we can design fresh gameplay moments."</p>

<p>On the topic of the fixed camera, Larsen says it allows the team to really control what is included in a scene, what can be shown and hidden, and that ultimately, "it leads to a natural feeling world without extra markers or guides required in more open spaces." There are entire levels designed around a single camera idea, he adds.&nbsp;</p><p>Visually, Unclear Games is aware that flowers aren't particularly scary in the grand scheme of what terrifies, but Larsen says lighting and a desire to create something unsettling within an otherwise natural space, like a garden, have pushed the team to explore fresh ideas. "The types of flowers, how they move, their size, and placement are all designed by hand," he tells me. "A lot of work, and still plenty to go with feedback and testing, but we're having so much fun putting it all together."&nbsp;</p><p>The final piece of any horror package is the sound, and I really enjoyed the soundscape that the first look at The Florist Unclear Games offered. Larsen says the team is focusing on using "a lot of earthy tones from woodwind and brass, and coupling them with occasional surprising elements from synth and electronic music." He adds that Unclear Games isn't consciously avoiding strings and piano, but notes those are instruments more attuned to supernatural or undead horror themes, "which The Florist is not."&nbsp;</p><p>Closing out our quick email chat about The Florist, Larsen tells me that before working on this game, he'd never met a florist in his life, except when buying flowers. By pure coincidence, two developers at Unclear Games have worked as florists before, giving The Florist some real-life edge and inspiration with what it's trying to accomplish.&nbsp;</p><p>"My entire team is immensely talented among their many other surprising abilities, and I'm very grateful to be working with them," Larsen says.&nbsp;</p><p>The Florist is due out sometime in 2026 on unspecified consoles and PC. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3152440/The_Florist/">wishlist it on Steam here</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you think of this first look at The Florist?

            <p>If you're booting up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> right now, you may notice the return of login queues for EA's latest AAA military shooter. The reason? Well, it's the release of Battlefield 6 Season One and the sudden release of the Redsec battle royale.</p>
<p>The moment the new season and Redsec mode went live, players took to the internet to share their place in the queue. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oibtv4/oh_lawd/">One player managed to snap a 50,000 large line to access the game</a>, not nearly as bad as the queues on launch but a significant number nonetheless.</p>
<p>The battle royale mode, which went live mere minutes ago, is a free-to-play additional game mode. It was officially announced only yesterday, making today something of a surprise shadow drop for the vast majority of the playerbase.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-is-coming-out-tomorrow-and-it-finally-has-a-proper-name">This battle royale mode</a> comes with a giant new map as you'd expect. It's called Fort Lyndon, and it can be experienced as a squad game mode, with no solo queue option as of its launch. There's also the Gauntlet mode for Redsec, which is a knockout style alternative where squads race each other to complete various objectives.</p><p>Finally, players can use Battlefield Portal to create their own custom versions of the Redsec mode, much like they can alter and innovate in Battlefield 6 proper. The Redsec launch trailer (which you can watch above) has added a golf cart that you can drive about, so one can only imagine how many cart-focused creations will flood the Portal in the coming days.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-next-patch-will-address-the-games-most-frustrating-problem-ahead-of-season-ones-release">As for Battlefield 6 Season One</a>, it's coming with a large new map, a new game mode, several new weapons, and gadgets too. So there's plenty to enjoy for those still diving deep into Battlefield 6 some time after its release.</p>

The newest version of Razer’s top-end wired keyboard supports 8,000Hz polling (both upstream and downstream), and it’s got new analog optical switches designed to minimize interference and prioritize speed. Razer claims it put a big emphasis on typing feel and sound this time, using dense foam layers and pre-lubed switches like in its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/17/23836326/razer-blackwidow-v4-75-mechanical-keyboard-hot-swappable-switches">BlackWidow V4</a>.</p><p>While foam and lube are staples of the enthusiast mechanical keyboard community, the new Huntsman is not hot-swappable.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Everyone should own a quality Bluetooth speaker. They’re wonderful for so many situations whether you’re heading to a park with some friends or just getting some chores done around the house by yourself. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5060/">The JBL Clip 5 is perfect for any time you’d find yourself reaching for a Bluetooth speaker plus, right now, Amazon has it on sale for 25% off.</a> That brings the price down by $20 from $80. You’ll only have to pay $60 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5060/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Loud and Powerful Sound</h2>
<p>This JBL portable speaker has been made to produce clear sound with a booming bass wherever you bring it with you — and you can bring it anywhere. It’s IP67 waterproof and dustproof meaning you can take it to the pool or even the beach without worrying about it getting damaged. Heck, that’s where this thing shines. It’s engineered with an exterior combining fabric and rubber to make it durable. It will have no issue withstanding the elements or getting banged up a bit.</p>
<p>The JBL Clip 5 gets its name from having a carabiner clip integrated into its design (and being the fifth generation version of the model). the speaker is already portable because of its size, but the clip makes it even easier to take along with you. Just clip int onto your bag or belt loop. Then once you’re where you need to be, the clip comes in handy to adhere it in place like to the back of you beach charge or onto a kayak.</p>



<p>Any potable speaker worth its weight in gold is going to need solid battery life. It’s not much use if the thing dies just a few songs in. The JBL Clip 5 is able to provide you with up to 12 hours of listening time on just a single charge. If still proves to not be enough, you can turn on Playtime Boost which can prioritize power, getting you up to three additional hours out of it for a total of 15. That should hopefully be enough for you to take on the day and then some.</p>
<p>What’s fun about JBL speakers are they generally are available in a ton of cool colors and patterns. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5060/">The JBL Clip 5 is no exception on that part. You can still with the more traditional options such as the all black or all white, or you can choose to go a bit funkier.</a> Along with black and white, you also have a choice of black with orange, pink with blue, sand with green, pink, blue, purple, red, as well as “squad” which is a camouflage pattern.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-bf-pro-battle-pass-worth-it-battlefield-6-rewards/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-the-battlefield-6-bf-pro-battle-pass-worth-it-rewards-and-bonuses-explained.1336939/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 Season 1 is here, and that means the arrival of new maps, modes, weapons, and the battle royale platform known as REDSEC. It also means that the game’s first Battle Pass is here, and as you probably predicted, it’s split into <strong>two tiers</strong>. In this guide, I’ll help you figure out if the Battlefield 6 <strong>BF Pro </strong>Battle Pass is worth your money.</p>



<p>The Battlefield Pro Battle Pass will set you back £21.99 (or your local equivalent), and the content found within will last for <strong>12 weeks</strong>. Let’s figure out if it’s worth your time, effort, and money to invest in the rewards found in the BF Pro Battle Pass in Battlefield 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-comes-with-the-battlefield-pro-battle-pass">What Comes With the Battlefield Pro Battle Pass?</h2>



<p>REDSEC might be free to access, but if you want to get the most from <a href="https://amzn.to/47BLy9s">Battlefield 6</a>, you’ll need to get a Battle Pass. There are two variants: Standard and Battlefield Pro. The former costs 1,100 Battlefield Coins (£8.99 or your local equivalent), but the BF Pro Battle Pass can only be bought with cold, hard cash.</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter how many BF Coins you have; you can’t use them to buy the BF Pro Battle Pass, but the rewards in the Pro Pass are <strong>much greater</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s everything you get for investing in the Battlefield Pro Battle Pass:</p>



<ul>
<li>Free Rewards</li>



<li>Battle Pass Rewards</li>



<li>Battle Pass Instant Unlock Rewards</li>



<li>Battle Pass 15% Progression Boost</li>



<li>100 Max Portal Persistent Server Hosts</li>



<li>BF Pro Instant Unlock Rewards</li>



<li>25 Battle Pass Tier Skips</li>



<li>In-Game Vehicle Radio Station</li>



<li>BF Pro Battle Pass Path</li>



<li>BF Pro Assignments</li>
</ul>



<p>It all begins with five instant unlocks, including the new GGH-22 pistol (modelled on the Glock 22). Your 25 free tier skips will enable you to power through almost the entire first section of the Battle Pass – ‘Rogue Operators’. This puts you <strong>one step away </strong>from the new SOR-300SC carbine.</p>



<p>In the Instant Unlock section (for both Battle Pass and BF Pro users), you’ll get <strong>twelve items </strong>immediately, including four new operators, two weapon packages, a knife skin, a parachute skin, calling cards, and XP boosters.</p>



<p>Before you get too far, be sure to check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-update-1-1-1-0-patch-notes-full/">patch notes for Battlefield 6’s 1.1.1.0 update</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-battle-pass-max-rewards">Battlefield 6 Battle Pass Max Rewards</h2>



<p>There’s a tasty reward at the end of each section in the Battle Pass:</p>



<ul>
<li>Rogue Operators</li>



<li>Deniable Ops</li>



<li>Soldiers of Fortune</li>



<li>Pacific Ghosts</li>
</ul>



<p>And then you hit the <strong>Ultimate </strong>tiers, and finally the <strong>Prestige </strong>tiers.</p>



<p>Here’s the final reward in each portion of the Battlefield 6 Battle Pass.</p>



<h3 id="h-rogue-operators-forest-sentry">Rogue Operators – Forest Sentry</h3>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-deniable-ops-mackenzie">Deniable Ops – Mackenzie</h3>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-soldiers-of-fortune-health-is-wealth">Soldiers of Fortune – Health is Wealth</h3>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-pacific-ghosts-divided-patterns">Pacific Ghosts – Divided Patterns</h3>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-can-you-skip-sections-in-the-battle-pass-in-battlefield-6">Can You Skip Sections in the Battle Pass in Battlefield 6?</h2>



<p>If you don’t like the current path you’re on or want to target different rewards, you can switch paths at any time, making headway towards other rewards in different channels.</p>



<p>Only once you’ve unlocked everything can you access Ultimate and Prestige rewards. Here are the final rewards in those channels:</p>



<h3 id="h-ultimate-spiteful-mirage">Ultimate – Spiteful Mirage</h3>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-prestige-battlefield-coins">Prestige – Battlefield Coins</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>With stacks of exclusive rewards, challenges, unlocks, and the chunky experience boost being set aside for BF Pro subscribers, I think it’s more than worth the money. However, if you’re not going to invest a lot of time in Battlefield 6, then perhaps the standard edition is for you.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that you can unlock enough BF Coins in one full Battle Pass to purchase <strong>the next </strong>Battle Pass, so bear that in mind.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>From Star Trek’s endless stream of inexplicable anomalies, to the eye-gouging horrors of Event Horizon and Warhammer 40,000’s Warp, and even relatively well-meaning beings that are utterly incomprehensible to the human mind, I’m honestly quite happy not going to space. It just seems like quite a bad time, all around, but in What The Stars Forgot, it’s utterly necessary for a research vessel filled with brave souls to explore and face countless unknowable mysteries.</p>
<p><iframe title="WHAT THE STARS FORGOT REVEAL  - Developer Interview and Airlock Games Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/spNBJ3Eaw_k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Humankind has become a space-faring race, but it seems we’re utterly alone in the galaxy, until an anomalous signal was detected at the Legasov Nebula, leading to Earth’s governments to sanction a scientific expedition to explore. A cutting edge ship was created with fold-drive technology powering its space flight, and a crew of our very best (and a bunch of more OK support staff as well). And then there’s you, the quantum AI dubbed as SNPAI – geddit? –&nbsp;who gets to play a bit of an all-seeing HAL 9000 role, just hopefully less evil.</p>


<p>What awaits in the furthest reaches of space aren’t pleasure planets and friendly life form discoveries, but an endless string of sci-fi horrors and anomalies that need to be investigated and resolved. Your job is to oversee the ship’s operations, assign shift patterns as efficiently as possible, divert staff to tackle crises and dynamic events, and find the path to the next sector of space.</p>


<p>What’s immediately striking is the retro aesthetic, with this game feeling every bit the SNES JRPG thanks to the blue gradients behind so much of the UI, and pixel art characters running around. The ship is arrayed out in front of you, like someone cut off the outer hull of the Red Dwarf, with the command bridge at one end, and all the expected med bay, brig, science, shuttle bay and more. But there’s a nice self-sustaining element as well, as there’s a chicken coop, grain growing, and a Silent Running-like park for crew to go and relax in.</p>
<p>But the running of this ship is constantly upended by those anomalies, with the demo taking a scripted path through a bunch of what could happen in the full game. To start off, a maintenance panel has caught fire and needs immediate attention, grabbing a pair of available crew members, they’re seriously unqualified for the job and…. well, they blow up. Let’s remember to try and assign well-qualified crew in future, OK?</p>
<p>Then the seriously odd things start to happen. The chickens start exploding, leaving bloody messes throughout the coop, so you race to send agriculture experts to diagnose the issue, before Science can take over to cook up a vaccine, and then to manufacturing to produce the cure. And just when you think that was resolved, half the crew just ups and disappears!</p>

<p>It’s a good thing you brought a few spares along with you, because you’ve got three shifts of staffing to fill the available slots. All your crew has a five star rating in 11 categories, making them suited to comms, engineering, cooking, leadership, manufacturing and more. Shuffling them around to fill vacant slots is fairly easy, but when you want to have the most competent crew as possible, it’s could be the case that you sacrifice a four star rating in one category just to get a two or a three slot filled elsewhere. I’d love to see the UI for this overhauled a bit, giving a bit more of a spreadsheet feel for a wider overview of the crew or more than a single category filter, because you can easily get stuck in the weeds bouncing back and forth between rooms and shifts.</p>
<p>All of the procedurally generated crew will have hidden talents as well, potentially making them better or worse suited to certain tasks, and having potential to grow and level up over time. Maybe they’re secret wannabe cultists, or cannibalism curious, though? I guess that’s what the airlock is for –&nbsp;this room’s cell design being especially dark, with just a sandwich of force fields between the interior and the vacuum of space.</p>

<p>The final anomaly for the demo comes as a mysterious energy being appears in the shuttle bay and starts to feed off the shuttles. Rushing to send scientists to investigate, it quickly becomes clear that this is a direct existential threat as the creature is drawn to the energy of the Fold Drive itself. The quick reaction chance is to manufacture a fake Fold Drive and vent it into outer space. This, however, doesn’t exactly go to plan, and ends up not mattering as more of these beings appear and blow up the ship.</p>
<p>I’m fascinated to see how this game comes together, being created by a industry veterans Justin Fischer and Brock Feldman, who founded Airlock Games to escape the abstracted roles that upper management lead them to. That’s putting them very hands on in a lot of areas of the game –&nbsp;Justin is composing the music, making sound effects and writing dialogue, for example. There’s great potential and adaptability from this small scale, of course, and so there’s the possibility that the ship’s design and layout could be put in the hands of players, with synergies between departments and how they’re staffed.</p>
<p>I do really like the tone and overarching direction of What The Stars Forgot, blending more eldritch horrors into its FTL and Star Trek-inspired adventure. With four sectors to navigate in a single playthrough, I’m keen to see just how weird this game can get.</p>
<p>And as <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/airlock-games/what-the-stars-forgot-retro-sci-fi-horror-management-sim?ref=discovery&amp;term=airlock%20games&amp;total_hits=3&amp;category_id=35">the game goes live on Kickstarter today</a>, Airlock Games is looking to move quickly, with an early access build put into the hands of backers in December and a 1.0 launch expected in March. With such an intriguing blend of ideas and inspirations, we’re going to keep our eyes on this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Mere days before the highly anticipated release of </span><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i><span>—a DLC and Kickstarter stretch goal turned mammoth sequel to one of the most impactful games of the 2010s–the lead developers behind the game, William Gibson and Ari Pellen, broke their near-monastic vow of silence and explained the reason for the game’s long absence from the public eye. After years of no communication, during which many assumed the long-delayed game was suffering through development hell, the pair revealed the exact opposite.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk"><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i></a><span>, they explained that </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>only took so long because the team had been </span><i><span>having fun</span></i><span> making the game. There was no behind-the-scenes catastrophe. No drama or rift between the members of the relatively small development team in Adelaide or the dozens of contractors who helped Team Cherry bring </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>across the finish line. There was no meddling from the various publishers that, at one point or another, seemed to vie for the team’s favor and the ability to promote the titanic sequel at one or several showcases. It turned out that </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>was just a really intense, and really prolonged, labor of love, a rarity in an industry that has only grown smaller and colder in the time the game’s taken to gestate.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>A funny thing happened during that self-imposed, years-long radio silence: </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>became </span><i><span>the </span></i><span>most wildly anticipated game of the generation, outside of only the next </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span>. Through little more than effusive word-of-mouth around its predecessor and a </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/21/hollow-knight-silksong-feels-wildly-different-and-incredibly-familiar-e3-2019"><span>few rock-solid previews</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span> came entirely undone from reality and entered the harrowed halls of gaming legend. For years, players would champ at the bit in livestream chats in which they endlessly screamed “</span><i><span>SILKSONG</span></i><span>???” to no avail.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>At last though, on September 4, 2025, </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>arrived, and with its arrival came the teardown of a long-held fantasy. Finally, we were able to see, hear, and feel the game in its entirety for ourselves, as it actually exists. Evaluate it for what it was rather than what we wanted it to be. This cherished thing that so many, across the game’s developers and its many fans, had poured an immense measure of love into for all these years.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>So, is </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>everything that I, a self-professed </span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>sicko, wanted? Does it live up to </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/i-spent-all-weekend-playing-hollow-knight-silksong-and-im-totally-enthralled-but-nothing-could-completely-live-up-to-the-hype-after-so-many-years/"><span>the hype</span></a><span>? Does it reinvent the Metroidvania? Is it a cultural reset? Is it </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/goty-2025-silksong-clair-obscur-difficulty/?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=68c466d11a96e10001d09c87&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky"><span>too hard</span></a><span>? Was it worth the wait? Is it </span><i><span>fun</span></i><span>?</span></p> <h2>Act I</h2> <p><span>Well, what </span><i><span>should </span></i><span>a game of </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s magnitude be? To understand that, I think you first have to get what </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> was.</span></p>

 <p><span>In 2018, </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> came to the Nintendo Switch. I could wax poetic about how much the experience meant to me and how thoroughly it rewired parts of my brain. How much of my own taste clicked into place while combing the depths of Hallownest, the collapsed bug kingdom in which the first game takes place. How in touch it felt with my own anxieties. How beautiful it felt despite the collapse, barbarity, and ruin that it invited players into.</span></p>

 <p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/v5e_ghRxYs8"><span>now thoroughly memed final encounter</span></a><span> against the game’s true villain, a deity-like figure known as the Radiance that at first disguises itself as the sun, has not only given me my desktop wallpaper, but also, in its hero’s resistance and determination, offered me a model of absolute defiance. The weirdos, adventurers, and screwballs tucked away in the darkest corners of Hallownest have time and time again embodied the virtues of diversity and acceptance that I live my life by. Quirrel, one of those very same oddballs, is one of my favorite characters of all time, and his odyssey through Hallownest is one of my very favorite threads of the whole adventure.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639593" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639593"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639593">©Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Of course, it’s hard to talk about that first game without mentioning its spectacular cadre of boss fights either, which goes well beyond that final confrontation I mentioned. While much continues to be made of the series’ difficulty, especially with the release of </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>, I’ve hardly ever seen the games as ones driven by a merciless bloodlust that tests the players at every turn. Don’t get me wrong, many a </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> boss has stumped me, but I’ve rarely thought of these fights as particularly grueling. They’re more…rhythmic. I’ve written before about how I think </span><a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/hollow-knight-silksong/silksong-reminds-us-that-theres-room-for-tough-games"><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s combat can feel balletic</span></a><span> and, well, </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> was my first dance instructor. Through its rigorous gauntlets and tutelage, including the game’s now renowned bouts against the Mantis Lords, Watcher Knights, and Troupe Master Grimm to name a few, I learned my marks and how to hit them with something resembling grace and finesse.</span></p> <p><span>And as a reward for diving in headfirst and drinking so deeply of </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>‘s waters, I was granted the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ITtPPE-pXE"><span>keys to Hallownest</span></a><span>, one of the most thoroughly realized settings any work has ever spirited me away to. It’s a well-worn trope at this point to marvel at its construction and level of detail, but the City of Tears moves me so deeply that I </span><i><span>must </span></i><span>always invoke its quiet majesty. The city’s defining quality, outside of its lavish and stately skyline, is the rain. Despite being underground, a crack in the ceiling above it–a strong but subtle metaphor among </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>‘s numerous elements that echo with greater meaning–invites the pristine waters of an underground lake, casting a pallid blue light over the decaying city and drenching it in a never-ending rainfall as if trying to wash away its sins.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Though it never occurs in the game, I think about the day that crack rips the sky above the City of Tears wide open. In a rapturous moment, the lake it holds up will appear to the city’s precious few survivors like the ocean coming down on their heads, and in an instant, it’ll swallow the city whole.</span></p>

 <p><span>This, and so much more, is the precedent set forth by </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>. It is the legacy of that game, and it only grows with each passing year. Suffice to say, it is a hell of a thing to live up to, and a tough–some might even say impossible–act to follow and build atop. But that’s what </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>sets out to do. And I tell you what, it makes a tremendous attempt, even if some cracks begin to form in the foundation under the sheer weight of it all.</span></p> <h2>Act II</h2> <p><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>largely continues </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>‘s exemplary work. It once again casts players as a diminutive but fearsome warrior critter, though this time as the first game’s deuteragonist–and sometimes rival–Hornet. Much like the Knight of the previous title, Hornet is driven to Pharloom, </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s similarly haunted kingdom, by forces greater than herself. Along her journey, she learns of a similar corruption to the one that threatened Hallownest before–</span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>does make clear it is a successor that follows after</span> <span>the events of the first </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>. And just like the Knight, Hornet befriends many oddball (and adorable) bugs, fells terrible foes left and right, discovers many secret passages, and uncovers the </span><a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/hollow-knight-silksong/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-explained-religious-themes"><span>unflinching cruelty of this doomed, yet beautiful setting</span></a><span> she’s now forced to save. You’d be forgiven for thinking </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>was a “lazy” sequel given these familiar parameters and beats, but the comparisons (outside of the game’s visuals and atmosphere) mostly end there.</span></p>

  <p><span>That’s because </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>knows its playing the hits–which its developers workshopped in </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> and then sharpened here–and then spends much of the rest of its runtime constantly fucking with the foundation in ingenious, and often dastardly, ways. Like </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s inverted narrative–in which Hornet climbs from the depths of the kingdom as opposed to the Knight’s descent into the abyss–the game’s hostile design delights in toying with your expectations. Hunter’s March and Bilewater, two of the new locales nestled in Pharloom’s expanse (a word I do not use lightly in this game’s case), are now infamous for the way that they jostle the player and refuse to allow them the </span><a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/hollow-knight-silksong/theres-no-place-for-serenity-in-hollow-knight-silksong"><span>time and space for complacency</span></a><span>, but could you believe they’re only the tip of the iceberg?</span></p> <p><span>Later sequences, like a rad-as-hell prison escape and an icy climb against the clock, prove out how exciting it is that </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>, as a core principle, kind of fucking hates the player. In </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>, like in most Metroidvania fare, it’s enthralling to grow more powerful and open up doors that you were previously locked out of. </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>recognizes this, but slows that progression to a relative crawl and regularly forces Hornet, and the player, on their backfoot. The result is a tangibly scrappier game that is less and less decided by arbitrary numbers and levels and has more to do with what I can only describe as achieving a level of </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXTKa48-36Q"><span>drift compatibility</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>This antagonism bleeds into several of the pain points and criticisms that have been levied at the game, such as </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-silksong-drags-them-into-the-spotlight-again-have-boss-runbacks-had-their-day"><span>punitive and demoralizing runbacks</span></a><span> to several bosses, especially one to a certain fight in a sandblasted region ripped straight out of Hell. And yes, it also extends to </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s several–and I do mean </span><i><span>several</span></i><span>–wave-based gauntlets, as well as its sometimes oppressive (not to mention optional) third act, both of which feel like exhaustive trials by fire. But I’ve gotta admit, I’ve learned to love this game throwing the whole damn book at me. For the most part. It keeps me on my toes.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639596" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639596"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639596">©Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p><span>If </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>is guilty of anything, it is knowing what the player expects to find at nearly every twist and turn and preempting them, sometimes with a new form of obstacle or gag, and trusting them to overcome these regular tests. This surely must be the mark of well-learned students of the medium and form, and makes the hackneyed turn of phrase “a love letter to the genre” into something resembling a more concrete argument. Since being released, </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>has been accused of being a pretty unforgiving game for many of the above reasons and more. If you ask me, though, what it really is pretty damn playful. Playful and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-plucky-squire-zelda-inspiration-too-on-rails-1851653126"><span>trusting</span></a><span> of your ability to pick up the game and triumph over anything it throws at you, especially with the arsenal of tools and movement abilities bestowed upon you, as well as Hornet’s natural grace.</span></p> <p><span>Reader, I hooted (I never hoot) at the </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/silksong-hunters-march-bench/"><span>fakeout bench trap in Hunter’s March</span></a><span>. I jumped in my seat at my triumph over the gauntlet in High Halls and hardly regretted the hours I spent chipping away at it. The climb up Mount Fay falls </span><i><span>just </span></i><span>shy of </span><i><span>Celeste</span></i><span>-level platforming in my eyes, and the Deep Docks? Well, they’re never boring. And with time, these lessons all taught me to dance through the Blasted Steps unscathed by any of the man-eating sandworms that occupy it. By the time I confronted The Last Judge for the final time, I emerged free of any burns, like only the warrior-princess Hornet could.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Uptown Girl, but make it haunting."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Team Cherry</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Metroidvania</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Gorgeous hand-drawn world filled with thrilling encounters and challenging level design around every corner, and driven by an all-time great platforming heroine.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Less cohesive than its predecessor in narrative and worldbuilding due to excess.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC, PS5, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2 (Played on), Nintendo Switch</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date: </p>                 <p>September 4, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>About 73 hours, completing the entirety of the game's main story (including an optional third act), as well as most sidequests and optional bosses, and acquiring most collectibles in the game. Still only at 86 percent completion.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>relishes in a kind of defiance that I admire. Sequels, especially video game sequels, are often bigger than their predecessors, a sin which </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>is guilty of, but they’re rarely more frictional. And because </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>zigs where others would zag, it has a personality that I think is rare to come across in sequels, which are so often by-the-numbers. It’s got bite and verve, just like its sharp and commanding protagonist. It’s headstrong, and its architects–Team Cherry itself–feel like a friendly rival I’m in competition with, and that back-and-forth has consistently motivated me to push back and push further. Playing </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>feels like being in conversation with it, and with every session–with every talk–I regularly felt like I was learning more than I would playing a game perfectly content with playing it safe.</span></p> <p><span>And the thing is, </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s heights are </span><i><span>largely </span></i><span>worth these long talks and toils, but that steadfast attitude and hardheadedness only get it so far.</span></p>

 <h2>Act III</h2> <p><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>is an exceptionally well-constructed game up to the end of its first act, filled with rousing fights against spectacular bosses that test your mettle early on, as well as locales that tease the imagination while simultaneously sating that thirst for adventure that the first game so thoroughly quenched. But it’s really in the game’s second act, which sees Hornet exploring the intricacies of the Citadel—a brass city and holy place at the very top of Pharloom—that it explodes and starts building the connective tissue that binds the entirety of this enormous kingdom together.</span></p> <p><span>Remember how I invoked the City of Tears from </span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>earlier? How much I loved the depth of it, not only as a setting but because of the simple and powerful metaphor accomplished by linking it to Blue Lake above it? </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>’s vistas enthrall me to no end, and its visuals are no doubt more varied than those of its predecessor, but it fails to tell stories as succinct or as impactful as that first game did.</span></p>

 <p><span>To its credit, there are places where </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>rises to the occasion. Greymoor, a downtrodden village that sits squarely beneath the Citadel (and also boasts a rainy disposition) plays a familiar tune. That and the intended route of the Pilgrimage on which so many bugs find themselves reveal a lot about Pharloom and its people while saying very little. But by and large, I found looser connections between regions, fewer storytelling nuggets and pocket-sized narratives, and less opportunity for my own curiosity to thrive.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span> still yields so much to see, and there are inarguably more nooks and crannies than ever to explore in Pharloom, but Hallownest’s elegant and understated mystique is absent here, and it is instead replaced by a labyrinthine behemoth–complete with </span><i><span>many </span></i><span>proverbial Minotaurs–though one that instills in you the pressure of obligatory completionism rather than the liberating sense of adventure.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639601" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639601"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639601">©Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p><span>At this point in my own experience with it, the sheer excess of </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>began to weigh on the game, my own interest in it, and the world which Team Cherry had so immaculately constructed. Its cast of characters dwarfs that of </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>, but less of them stand out among the rest of the noise here. Shakra, the game’s recurring map maker and traveling warrior, is always a joy to interact with, and following her narrative thread to its end provided an emotionally satisfying resolution I’m grateful to have seen to its end, but she’s one of the game’s exceptions in this regard. By comparison, there are numerous threads I can remember following in </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>, like the stories of Quirrel and Cloth, as well as boss characters like the Traitor Lord and Soul Master, all of which provided narrative bows with which to wrap up and package the small, impactful vignettes across Hallownest.</span></p> <p><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>seems interested in turning some of these interactions and asides into a more concrete facet of the series, but they almost seem lost in the expanded scope of the game. For example, job boards filled with side-quests called “Wishes” seem like they’d provide ample opportunities to expand on characters in explicit ways—</span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>preferred the </span><i><span>Elden Ring </span></i><span>approach of loosely threaded emergent narratives—but they mostly amount to busy work and chores which fortify pockets of community around Pharloom, but rarely dive deeper into the make-up of these towns and their bug denizens.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>What stings is that underneath it all, there are some truly awesome things tucked away in </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>, a game whose depth in places frequently, yes, awed me. Awesome encounters and sequences that continued to test me right up to the very end, threads which tied the two games together, and glimpses at the world outside of the </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> series’ haunted kingdoms that I would love to see explored further down the line. But it does also feel at times like a sequel made for players with an eye towards awe and spectacle rather than profundity.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe that weight I’m referring to, the one that threatens to undo </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>at times, has less to do with literal bloat from the game’s prolonged development (though it has surely manifested in this way) and more to do with the impossible burden placed on </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>to be</span><span> the most incredible game ever. I reckon that when Team Cherry first released </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>, they’d no idea the ripples it would make and the legacy it’d establish. And it’s impossible to separate what </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>wound up being–a fork-tongued middle finger of a game that nobly aims to avoid being a standard, conventional sequel but also feels stretched in places to meet the expectations of a </span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>game–from the reputation it built up in its time outside the limelight.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Love breathed life into </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>all those years ago, transforming a would-be expansion into a sprawling title whose development was cultivated over many years with great care and attention, which makes it all the more ironic that over the course of that development, so much of what made </span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>special to begin with feels diminished here. That very love pushes </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>to be a rich experience, one that makes you work to love it and prefers to shock rather than lull you with awe. At some point though, the former gives way to the latter, and underneath that weight, </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>begins to crack. Its enormity hides these fractures well, but they’re still there. And maybe, just maybe, one day, like the City of Tears, that crushing weight will collapse the foundation and swallow it whole.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review-hornet-team-cherry-2000639568]]></content:encoded>
