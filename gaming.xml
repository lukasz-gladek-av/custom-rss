			<p>If I were to ask you to imagine a well-groomed, moustachioed gentleman from Belgium who constantly comments on his “little grey cells”, you wouldn’t have to be an Agatha Christie super-fan for the famously meticulous detective, Hercule Poirot, to come to mind. Of all Christie’s characters, Poirot still proves to be incredibly popular today, with the Kenneth Branagh movie series, the new Poirot mystery novels written in the Christie style by author Sophie Hannah or, of course, the continuation of the Microids video game mysteries. The latest instalment, Agatha Christie – Death on the Nile, offers a twist on the Christie classic.</p>
<p><iframe title="Agatha Christie – Death on the Nile – Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6M4S0H1NL0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This new take on the well-known story is set against the lively backdrop of the 1970’s. Christie fans may find the 4-decade time jump a little jarring. The luxury and opulence of the late 1930’s are swept away and replaced with, well, brown. When one visualises the style of the 1970’s, you might imagine bold patterns and prints in vibrant golds, mahogany browns, avocado greens, rich reds and burnt oranges. Unfortunately, in Death on the Nile, the 70’s eclectic mix of earthy hues translates as a muddy sepia mush of yellowish browns. The visuals, that at times should be very striking, get lost in a mix of flat, bland tones.</p>



<p>Poirot himself seems to sit a little out of place against the 70’s setting, as well. In the opening scene alone, Poirot visits a trendy nightclub where he meets the main characters featured in the upcoming mystery. Setting Christie’s dignified and meticulously groomed detective in a disco-era club with flashing lights and mirror balls is a bold and risky choice – one that doesn’t really pay off. You’re exposed to Poirot in bellbottoms and a neck scarf. This is accompanied by an awkward shot panning up past Hercule’s bottom that makes you feel like you’re eyeing up your grandad. There was one terrifying moment, walking onto the dance floor, where I thought I might be forced to watch Hercule Poirot break out into the YMCA. #notmyPoirot!</p>

<p>However, the 70’s setting does allow for the introduction of an interesting new aspect to the story with the original character, Jane Royce. In Death on the Nile, the gameplay is split between old-school detective Hercule Poirot and his admirer-come-private-investigator, Jane. The joint protagonist feature adds a fresh perspective to the crime and spruces up the all-too-familiar storyline. The plot promises an additional finale act that introduces something novel to the narrative. Where Poirot’s investigative play-sections feel like going over old ground for Christie fans, Jane Royce’s segments bring the excitement of exploring new territory.</p>

<p>When it comes to solving the mystery itself, the gameplay mechanics utilised here are inventive and well-thought out. The mind-map allows you to do more than just follow hints on who to interview next. It prompts you to make links between clues and draw your own conclusions. It keeps track of your discoveries and helps you decide where to look next. Cleverly, the game also comes with several helpful difficulty settings, from a fully guided mystery through to “throw you in at the deep end”, so gamers can choose their own path. This combination of techniques really immerses you in the mystery and urges you to properly don your detective baker boy hat.</p>
<p>As you near the end of each individual mystery, you’re treated to a run-through of events. First, the game prompts you to scroll through the timeline, placing characters in different locations performing different activities. Along with being enlightening, this activity is immensely satisfying. Particularly when you finally manage to get everyone in place to make the crime make sense. The game then runs through the case step by step and you get to watch the scene play out. Mystery solved. This leaves your investigative urges fully quenched and your face doing that smug expression it does when you feel you’ve just achieved something awesome.</p>

<p>There’s a lot to like about this game, from its immersive mystery-solving tools to its updated plot add-ons. However, it would have needed a more traditional 30’s setting and conventional Poirot character for it to truly spark my little grey cells.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Although the new 1970’s setting and bland, dark visuals leaves Poirot a little out of place, Agatha Christie - Death on the Nile gives video-gaming detectives a fresh perspective on a well-known plot and some fantastic mystery-solving menus and maps to get stuck into.	</p></div>

			<p>Right before the beginning of this year's Tokyo Game Show, PlayStation State of Play returns tomorrow with over 30 minutes of updates on announced games and brand new reveals.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/23/state-of-play-returns-this-wednesday-september-24/">confirmed on the Official PlayStation Blog</a>, the presentation will air tomorrow, September 24, at 2 pm PT / 5 pm ET / 11 pm CEST on &nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playstation">YouTube</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation">Twitch</a>. During its 35 minutes of duration, the presentation will provide updates and reveals from developers around the world with new looks at anticipated third-party titles, indie titles. The presentation will also feature updates from some PlayStation Studios' developers, including an extended look at Saros, <a href="https://wccftech.com/saros-will-be-the-ultimate-evolution-of-housemarques-gameplay-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5/">the new game from Housemarque launching next year</a>.</p>



<p>In the past few years, a PlayStation Showcase or State of Play presentation <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-play-confirmed-to-air-tomorrow-showing-20-games/">took place right before the beginning of the annual Tokyo Game Show</a>, and with <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-september-2025/">rumors suggesting that 2025 wouldn't have been different</a>, today's announcement doesn't come as a surprise. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/">June 2025 PlayStation State of Play presentation was filled with a lot of great reveals</a>, such as Romeo is A Dead Man, the next game from Suda51 and Grasshopper Manufacture which is setting out to be another great action game with some peculiar vibes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-gamescom-hands-on-preview-subspace-emissary/">judging from the time I spent with the game during Gamescom</a>, FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles, whose new features such quality-of-life enhancements and voice acting will <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-gamescom-hands-on-preview-definitive-edition-in-the-making/">elevate an already great tactical role-playing game</a>, and MARVEL TOKON: Fighting Souls, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-soul-is-a-new-4-vs-4-fighting-game-by-arc-system-works-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5-and-pc/">a new fighting game starring Marvel Comics characters from genre masters Arc System Works</a>, so there's a very good chance the new presentation will feature some nice surprise reveals alongside the announced new look at Saros and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-play-insomniac-worlverine-playstation-rumor/">rumored proper first look at Insomianc's Wolverine.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-teaser</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hoyoverse-reveals-first-teaser-for-mysterious-new-game-petit-planet.1305354/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>developer HoYoverse has revealed a teaser for another new game, and this one looks to have a decidedly more cozy bent to it than the studio's previous efforts.</p>

<p>Just a few weeks after unveiling <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-honkai-nexus-anima" rel="nofollow">creature-collecting autochess game&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em></a>, HoYoverse has updated the <a href="https://x.com/petitplanetgame" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media account</a> for something by the name of&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>, and while details are sparse, the art style and general vibe feels very&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>-esque.</p>

<p>For one thing, the new artwork depicts two extremely cuddly-looking creatures with massive smiles on their faces, which means <i>Petit Planet&nbsp;</i>is probably either a cozy game or a deeply disturbing horror experience masquerading as cozy. My money's on the former, but my heart hopes for the latter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hoyoverse-petit-planet-critter.jpg?itok=zmBv3wvb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hoyoverse-petit-planet-critter.jpg?itok=fy4VIS_g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This little guy heralds the announcement of&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>In the new teaser trailer, we can see the cute little fluffball from the new&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>artwork hopping around a grove that looks extremely reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>, complete with rounded trees and a tiered waterfall.</p>

<p>Honestly, that's pretty much all there is right now, but it's likely that HoYoverse is gearing up for a big&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>announcement, so perhaps we'll get more info about the game in the coming weeks. We can certainly hope so.</p>

<p>If&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>is indeed a cozy life sim-style game, then it will mark a further branching out from HoYoverse's typical RPG slant; its three main exports, namely&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-esque&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact" rel="nofollow"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a>, turn-based battler&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail" rel="nofollow"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a>, and character action extravaganza&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zenless-zone-zero" rel="nofollow"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a>, are all various flavors of gacha RPG.</p>

<p>Of course, there's nothing to say&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>won't have gacha mechanics as well, and if I know HoYoverse, it almost certainly will. Still, it looks like it'll offer a completely different gameplay style to prior studio titles, so that's something to look forward to.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hoyoverse-petit-planet-genshin-impact.jpg?itok=Xjhk9ijo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hoyoverse-petit-planet-genshin-impact.jpg?itok=0HR981aE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>could mark a big departure from HoYoverse's usual style.</figcaption></figure><p>We'll have to wait a little while to learn more about&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>, but for now, it looks like it's safe to get excited if you were hoping for a HoYoverse cozy game. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p>Given the endless waterfall of garbage that arrives on Steam, it might seem like you can upload and sell absolutely anything on the storefront. However, there <em>are</em> meant to be some verification checks in place to prevent the most egregious examples of nefarious content from reaching the platform—it’s just it doesn’t always work. Hence <em>BlockBlasters</em>, a Trojan-Horse 2D platformer that released as an innocent game, before being updated such that it could start draining players’ crypto wallets. And tragically, this was discovered during a livestream fundraiser for a streamer with stage-4 cancer.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/verified-steam-game-steals-streamers-cancer-treatment-donations/">reported by&nbsp;<em>Bleeping Computer</em></a>, <em>BlockBlasters</em> went on sale on July 30 as yet another 2D platformer on Valve’s industry-dominating PC store. But a month later, on August 30, <a href="https://steamdb.info/patchnotes/19799326/">the game was updated with a couple of zip files</a>, which appear to have contained malware that allowed the game to empty players’ crypto wallets.</p> <p>The “game” was obviously released as free, to tempt as many people into taking a look as possible. However, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3872350/charts/">according to SteamDB</a> it seems&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters</em> only managed to attract a very small number of players. Estimates show it as having had under 7,000 downloads, while concurrent player counts never exceeded a desultory eight. That would have sucked if you’d poured your heart into a platformer, but clearly that wasn’t the plan here from first-time (and presumably last-time) developers Genesis Interactive.</p>

 <p>It was only when streamer Raivo Plavnieks (RastalandTV) was <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/57p5a-help-me-beat-stage-4-cancer">running a fundraiser</a> to help raise money to treat his stage-4 sarcoma that the cruel nature of the malware became apparent. Someone tuned in and encouraged crypto enthusiast Plavnieks to download <em>BlockBlasters</em>, when the extremely sick man watched $32,000 drain from his funds. “My life was saved for whole 24 hours,” the streamer <a href="https://x.com/rastalandTV/status/1969629808788181258">wrote on X</a>, “untill someone tuned in my stream and got me to download verified game on @Steam.” (Please be warned that the video clip embedded in the post is particularly upsetting.)</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">For anybody wondering what is going on with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CANCER&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$CANCER</a> live stream… my life was saved for whole 24 hours untill someone tuned in my stream and got me to download verified game on <a href="https://twitter.com/Steam?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Steam</a> <br>After this I was drained for over 32,000$ USD of my creator fees earned on <a href="https://twitter.com/pumpdotfun?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@pumpdotfun</a> and… <a href="https://t.co/8YH4njd46E">pic.twitter.com/8YH4njd46E</a></p> <p>— rastaland.TV (@rastalandTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/rastalandTV/status/1969629808788181258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“I can’t breathe, I can’t think,” the Latvian gamer added. “im completely lost on what is going to happen next, can’t shake the feeling that it is my fault that I might end up on street again or not have anything to eat in few days.”</p>

 <p>However, according to&nbsp;<em>Bleeping Computer</em>, what happened next is a rallying from other crypto types, with crypto influencer Alex Becker posting to X to say he’d sent Plavnieks $32,500 to cover the losses.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have sent $32,500 to cover this to your new safe wallet.   Best of luck to you my friend. &lt;3.<a href="https://twitter.com/rastalandTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@rastalandTV</a> </p> <p>Receipt below.</p> <p>— Alex Becker 🍊🏆🥇 (@ZssBecker) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZssBecker/status/1969774353211695441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>BlockBlasters</em> was removed from Steam on September 21, the same day as the stream, presumably after a flood of resulting reports. However, it shows serious weaknesses in Valve’s store that malware can so easily be added to games. Earlier this year a web3 “game” called&nbsp;<a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/security/156674/did-you-download-this-steam-game-sorry-its-windows-malware"><em>PirateFi&nbsp;</em>was stealing Steam accounts</a>, and it’s just another of many examples.</p> <p>As a rule, the safest option is to take no part in the entire crypto scam in the first place. Put your money in a bank, or hide it under your mattress, but not in the criminal underworld that is cryptocurrency. And if anything is marked as “web3,” avoid it like the plague it is.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Hideo Kojima's studio, Kojima Productions, has released a new teaser trailer for its in-development horror game, OD. It features Sophia Lillis (<em>It, Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em>) lighting some strange, seemingly ritualistic candles while an ominous knock sound echoes throughout the mostly empty apartment.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/hideo-kojima-is-making-a-new-game-called-od-with-jordan-peele">Kojima first revealed OD way back in 2023</a> by bringing out acclaimed <em>Get Out</em>, <em>Us</em>, and <em>Nope </em>director Jordan Peele on stage during The Game Awards that year. The two indicated that they were working on a cloud-based horror project called OD for Xbox Game Studios, which would feature Lillis and Hunter Schafer (<em>Euphoria</em>). However, this game, which Kojima has confirmed is called OD – Knock, might differ from whatever Peele is working on.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out the OD – Knock teaser trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHCqxLtwy5g"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHCqxLtwy5g" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, OD – Knock appears to be the game teased during The Game Awards in 2023 as both feature Lillis. However, during today's <a href="https://youtu.be/P6CaAu3T7l0?si=ToMsuM-lUa86Xjp-">Kojima Productions: Beyond The Strand event</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-reveals-first-trailer-for-xbox-game-studios-title-od"><em>IGN</em></a>, Kojima said, "There is a different kind of fear [Peele] will do. Mine is the knock."&nbsp;</p><p>This suggests that OD will be a series of projects focused on different fears. Kojima said during the livestream that he is afraid of large knocking sounds, and perhaps that's why his OD project is subtitled "Knock." We'll have to wait to see what fear Peele's OD project tackles.&nbsp;</p><p>Kojima Productions is developing OD – Knock in collaboration with Xbox Game Studios, though it's unclear if Xbox is publishing the game as an exclusive or just lending a hand with the cloud technology the game(s) will use.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/hideo-kojima-is-making-a-new-game-called-od-with-jordan-peele">check out the first OD teaser</a>, and then read <em>Game Informer's </em>reviews of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/boundless-sincerity-aside-flaws">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/death-stranding/death-stranding-review-the-wanderer">Death Stranding</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What fear do you want Jordan Peele's OD project to tackle?

            <link>https://wccftech.com/kojima-productions-and-niantic-spatial-are-partnering-to-push-the-boundaries-of-storytelling-with-a-new-ar-experience/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kojima-productions-and-niantic-spatial-are-partnering-to-%E2%80%9Cpush-the-boundaries%E2%80%9D-of-storytelling-with-a-new-ar-experience.1305303/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Niantic Spatial is the geospatial AI tech company that spun off from Niantic after it <a href="https://wccftech.com/niantic-games-gets-acquired-by-scopely-for-3-5-billion/">sold its games business and portfolio of titles</a>, including Pokémon GO, Monster Hunter Now, and Pikmin Bloom, to Scopley. Niantic Spatial seemed to be out of the videogames industry, until last night, during the Kojima Productions Beyond the Strand anniversary presentation, Niantic Spatial chief executive officer and Niantic founder John Hanke joined Hideo Kojima on stage to announce a partnership between the two entities to create what seems to be a Pokémon GO-like AR Death Stranding game.</p>



<p>The Beyond the Strand presentation <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-unveils-trailers-od-death-stranding-mosquito-physint/">featured several major announcements</a> from Hideo Kojima and Kojima Productions, like a teaser trailer for OD, which we now know is fully titled 'OD: Knock.' We got an update on PHYSINT with a look at the game's key art and heard from some of the actors included in the project. We heard a bit more from the team working on A24's Death Stranding film, and we got to see a trailer for Death Stranding Mosquito, the animated film based on the series, also in the works.</p>



<p>None of those were the things that closed out the show. This partnership with Niantic Spatial closed out the over two-hour presentation, as it seemed to embody the theme of the whole show, which was to look ahead into the future of entertainment and storytelling from Kojima Productions.</p>



<p>Essentially, Kojima Productions will leverage Niantic Spatial's geospatial AI tech to create an AR experience that works with your phone, and also, it seems, your <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-is-developing-dual-display-smart-glasses-to-put-messages-maps-and-more-right-in-front-of-your-eyes/">smart glasses</a>, to enable an entertainment experience wherever you go.</p>



<p>"<em>The collaboration marks a significant moment for both companies and a shared vision to push the boundaries of what's possible in interactive storytelling,</em>" a press release for the announcement reads. "<em>For Kojima Productions, it's a bold expansion into new forms of media beyond traditional gaming. For Niantic Spatial, it underlines the potential of geospatial AI technology to transform how people and machines understand and interact with the physical world</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS and Niantic Spatial: A New Dawn" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oKyj6CDUH64?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Niantic Spatial boss John Hanke added, "<em>At Niantic Spatial, we're building a living model of the world that people and machines can talk to, creating a new canvas for real-world storytelling and interaction. We are delighted to be working with Kojima Productions to explore what our combined creativity and innovation can accomplish for new and existing fans</em>."</p>



<p>Overall it seems like an interesting idea for sure, and definitely not out of bounds for the kind of thing Hideo Kojima could envision and conceptualize. Whether it'll actually work as a game or as a software product that people will use and spend money on is a different matter, since we've currently no idea on how this experience is meant to come together.</p>



<p>"<em>To give just a wild example, it's like the real Death Stranding in the real world</em>," Hideo Kojima said on stage via a translator. "<em>And you could connect with people, or you could connect with the actual environment there in your city. Previously, it was like, virtual reality, but this time I'm thinking more about connecting with the real environment.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-franchise-rewards-program</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonys-new-franchise-rewards-program-isnt-quite-what-it-sounds-like.1305300/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a brand new rewards program by the name of Franchise Rewards, and while it pledges to reward you for your in-game achievements with real goodies, things are a little more complicated than that.</p>

<p>The new program was revealed in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/23/ghost-of-tsushima-players-can-now-unlock-special-ghost-rewards-merchandise-for-purchase/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, in which director Katie Lennox describes it as "a new merchandise program that celebrates your in-game achievements with special collectibles". Franchise Rewards kicks off with the&nbsp;<em>Ghost&nbsp;</em>games, starting with&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>.</p>

<p>To qualify for the program, you'll need to have earned one or both of two trophies: the Gold trophy Mono no Aware and the Platinum trophy Living Legend. Having these trophies gets you "access to a selection of limited-edition merchandise".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-franchise-rewards-t-shirt.jpg?itok=XyNHrTBY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-franchise-rewards-t-shirt.jpg?itok=1aXcua6i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>How would you like the opportunity to buy exclusive Sony merchandise?</figcaption></figure><p>A quiet alarm bell might be ringing in your head as you read those words, and you're right to heed it: this program only allows you the right to buy certain new merchandise, not to get it for free if you earn these trophies.</p>

<p>Obtaining the Mono no Aware trophy, which you can get just for completing&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>'s main story, will get you "access" to the corresponding Mono no Aware T-shirt, for which you'll have to cough up an additional $30, plus shipping.</p>

<p>Achieving the Living Legend trophy, meanwhile, which requires you to have obtained all other&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>trophies (and that's no mean feat), will allow you to buy a special commemorative pin for $25. Again, that's without shipping factored in.</p>

<p>Of course, if you have both trophies, then Sony will gracefully allow you to give the company more of your money for both pieces of merchandise. Hey, don't say Sony never does anything nice for you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-franchise-rewards-pin.jpg?itok=CWk1Gi2X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-franchise-rewards-pin.jpg?itok=17V4Oyqs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to earn the right to buy this pin? You'll have to spend a heck of a lot of time with&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you do want to grab either of these items, you'll need to earn their corresponding trophies by December 31st this year. If you're playing on PC, you'll need to have linked your PlayStation account for Sony to recognize your achievements.</p>

<p>Sony says that these&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>goodies are "just the start", which sounds vaguely threatening. The Franchise Rewards program will continue with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date" rel="nofollow">October's&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em></a>, for which more "unique merchandise" will apparently be released.</p>

<p>The announcement of Sony's Franchise Rewards initiative comes after the company announced it would shut down the PlayStation Stars loyalty program <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shutting-down-playstation-stars" rel="nofollow">back in May</a>, although I'm not sure too many people will see this as a worthy replacement. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p><span>One of the many consequences of the incredibly dystopian descent into fascism America is experiencing right now is that these motherfuckers have access to the internet and think their heinous acts of terrorism are memeable capital-C Content. Someone particularly evil over at the Department of Homeland Security posted a pretty vile video showing ICE, cops, border patrol officers, and military agents arresting dozens of people…and they set it to the original </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>theme song from the ‘90s.</span></p> <p><span>The video was posted to the Department of Homeland Security’s social media channels on September 22 and shows multiple arrests and searches, including clips of armed squads using explosives to get into closed buildings and groups of people being rounded up, all while either blurring or obscuring the faces of both the people being arrested and the officers themselves.

			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation is being added to a bunch of existing and upcoming PC games, including ANANTA, the free-to-play anime GTA-like open world game we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ananta-really-looks-like-anime-gta-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered</a> earlier today with the latest TGS 205 gameplay trailer. Naked Rain's ANANTA will launch with built-in support for DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation and ray traced reflections to augment the visual quality. NVIDIA also shared a video previewing its technologies in action in the game.</p>



<p>Taking a step back, Reikon's sci-fi first-person shooter game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990380/METAL_EDEN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">METAL EDEN</a> (the new game from the makers of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ruiner-you-played-yourself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RUINER</a>) launched earlier this month with NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. Now, the NVIDIA app lets you override Super Resolution to use NVIDIA DLSS 4's latest transformer model, and you can also bump Frame Generation to Multi Frame Generation (x3 or x4). </p>



<p>Last week, the cooperative survival horror game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2141730/Backrooms_Escape_Together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Backrooms: Escape Together</a> (currently in early access) was updated with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and Ray Reconstruction. The game already supported  DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLAA.</p>



<p>Though the game's official launch date is set for Thursday, September 25, Silent Hill f launches today for users who pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition. The game includes NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution support.

<p><em>At 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality mode and the settings above, the game ran at an average of 116 FPS, 59 1% Low on my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) in a benchmarking session held in Ebisugaoka at the start of the game, right after the first attack of one of the Fog Monsters, which are, all around, pretty decent results, considering the performance cost Lumen generally has. With the game running as expected on my system, tweaking the settings, especially the lighting setting, the rendering resolution, and the upscaler setting (TSR and FSR are available besides DLSS) should be more than enough for most users with a relatively modern machine to run the game smoothly.</em></p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater also launched with just NVIDIA DLSS SR, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-pc-users-add-lumen-rt-dlss-4-frame-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was rather easy to add</a> NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, and Lumen RT. Perhaps the same will happen with Silent Hill f.</p>



<p>Next month, Frontier Development will launch Jurassic World Evolution 3, a new installment in the management and construction simulation game based on the popular movies. Jurassic World Evolution 3 will offer day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and ray traced effects.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>All great and epic adventures begin with a magical yet compelling story that captivates audiences for years to come. This narrative is certainly applicable to Falcom's epic fantasy JRPG,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes VI: Trails in the Sky</em>, which, after a 21-year-long wait, fans and new players alike can experience in this game's remake,&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>.</p>

<p><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> has been remade from scratch on its more advanced game engine for modern audiences and hardware, but it never loses its fantastic story with a few new additions and optimizations for a more complete experience. Suffice to say, revisiting its original game and playing the remake demo before delving into the full game made reviewing&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>&nbsp;a more rewarding and worthwhile experience long after the credits roll.</p>

<h2><em>Trails In The Sky 1st Chapter</em> Review - Starting At The Beginning Again</h2>

<p>Video game remakes and remasters have become quite prominent in recent years as they attract both returning players for yet another magical in-game experience, while welcoming new audiences to their world. While at times, most of the game's remake remains the same from its story, intriguing characters, and gameplay systems, much of its upgrades boil down to updated modern graphics, introducing new quality-of-life improvements to enhance our gaming experiences, fix mistakes that weren't possible, and implement a few new tweaks for a more complete offering.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_461_young_joshua.jpg?itok=tVa9PHuA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_461_young_joshua.jpg?itok=HWJsURqB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>As much as there's plenty of mystery surrounding future events, what do we know about Joshua and his past? (Picture: Falcom / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>This sentiment is quite true for developer Falcom, as they've finally brought a more polished and complete offering of&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>, a remake of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/how-to-get-into-trails-series-nihon-falcom" rel="nofollow">the Trails series</a>' first entry,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes VI: Trails in the Sky</em>, 21 years after its initial release. Admittedly, not having the pleasure nor distinction of being introduced to this legendary JRPG series, the journey and moments experienced with its remake became more profound after first experiencing the original release on PC and then the remake's demo before immersing oneself in what can be viewed as one of the most faithful remakes in quite some time.</p>

<p>Granted, time was not on one's side when experiencing both&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes VI: Trails in the Sky</em> and&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>, but this little side adventure exploring its original release before revisiting the kingdom&nbsp;of Liberl became a good choice to make consciously. The story of&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> remains the same as its original release, albeit with a few new quality-of-life improvements, balance changes, and other new content reimagined for modern hardware.</p>

<h2>Welcome Back Home, Bracers!</h2>

<p>As with all great stories, we start at the beginning with one of our protagonists, Estelle Bright, a doting yet energetic young girl awaiting the arrival of her father, Cassius, and following his return, her father introduced her to a young, injured boy of the same age as Estelle. The game's events officially begin with its Prologue Chapter, now set five years later, and both Estelle and the&nbsp;young, injured boy named Joshua are now 16 years old and training to become bracers, a "peacekeeping guild" tasked with serving all the people across its world by assisting with various jobs, much like their father.</p>

<p>However, Cassius had some news to share with his children as he got called out to a pressing matter to attend to, departing Rolent aboard an orbal ship which mysteriously goes missing along with its passengers some time later. This stressful news prompted Estelle, Joshua, and&nbsp;Scherazard to begin and lead a separate investigation into its disappearance in a neighboring city, where the strings slowly start to unravel.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_536_estelle_shocked_face.jpg?itok=WvuhBOZA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_536_estelle_shocked_face.jpg?itok=5aCAxIF9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We're thinking the exact same thing, Estelle! (Picture: Falcom / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>The siblings learns of a&nbsp;conspiracy that threatens the peace of this kingdom, and the discoveries Estelle and Joshua uncover could ultimately change their lives forever. Through game progression, Estelle and Joshua will have opportunities to explore the remaining regions, and as such, meet new acquaintances, accept more jobs, gain more in-field experience as bracers, acquire recommendations, and unravel mysteries surrounding their father.</p>

<p>New improvements, balance changes, and optimizations were included in&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>; however, one new improvement made was to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xseed-explains-trails-in-sky-localization-changes" rel="nofollow">the localization</a>, an issue many players had with the original game leading up to the remake's release. However, having played through the game with English voiceovers, they will be happy to learn that this isn't an issue, especially having played&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes VI: Trails in the Sky</em> before jumping into the remake and boasting a talented voice cast that provides incredible performances and yes, evoke a myriad of emotions or make you even more annoyed with them.</p>

<p>The game's mini-map also saw some notable tweaks that make it easier for players to track quest markers, pinpoint Treasure Chests, and indicate enemies within their vicinity. The world map also received much-needed changes by adding more Points of Interest, such as city locales, quest events, and side quests, which are clearly displayed in both the mini-map and world map changes, improving navigation as a whole, and not making it an annoyance to bear.</p>

<h2>Combat Is An Orbment Of Time (And Fun)</h2>

<p><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> offers players a more seamless approach to combat as they can opt between&nbsp;turn-based and real-time combat, and can be finetuned by choosing their preferred difficulty on how they wish to engage with the story and combat. Real-time combat&nbsp;is best utilized against single&nbsp;and common enemies, especially while traveling in the overworld, without ever entering into&nbsp;turn-based combat, and regarding the latter, this is more prevalent during the main story and side quests or against larger and imposing enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_574_orbment_setup.jpg?itok=lRCsm79W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_574_orbment_setup.jpg?itok=79Y9GXru 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Orbment system menu where players can slot Sepith and Quartz to empty slots to enhance their character's stats, passive effects and more. (Picture: Falcom / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>As with most turn-based games, once entering the turn-based combat mode, a timeline will appear on-screen which gives information on the turns of each party member and enemy, which can be altered thanks to a myriad of abilities, buffs, and debuffs inflicted. For example, specific attacks that apply the Delay effect prevent enemies from attacking on their turn, which is present in tactical abilities, S-Crafts, and Quartz equipped for certain characters like Joshua and his Flicker ability, thus manipulating the timeline and giving the party an advantage over their enemies.</p>

<p>Now, one key component to the remake's combat is the Orbment system, which was introduced when playing the original game and was somewhat confusing to understand at first, despite the original game doing its best to explain Orbments. Nevertheless, an Orbment is a mechanical device that allows players to equip Sepith and later Quartz to empty slots and imbue them with orbal energy, and once activated, it grants the particular character to utilize unique orbal abilities, acquire bonus stats, and passive effects that can be useful in combat.</p>

<p>As every party member will get their base level increase through progression and gain increased stats, equipment pieces like armor and accessory items also provide this, like increased defense and arts defense. Similarly, weapons and their upgrades increase the equipped character's strength and arts strength stats to deal more physical and non-physical/magical damage, which can contribute to building their party members.</p>

<p>For example, Agate can be built to deal more physical damage and can absorb incoming enemy attacks, so building him with the best synergistic orbments to provide increased physical damage, and adding some defense to make him a tanky character. In comparison, Joshua is very agile in combat, so he'll require orbments and equipment pieces to buff his speed to inflict damage and debuffs onto enemies very quickly.</p>

<h2><em>Trails In The Sky 1st Chapter</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_563_drunk_schera_olivier.jpg?itok=cRqVpEgd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_563_drunk_schera_olivier.jpg?itok=OmF5_IzA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Over two decades is certainly a wait for developer Falcom to finally reimagine one of their most legendary entries in the Trails series. (Picture: Falcom / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>21 years is quite certainly a wait for the first entry in the Trails series to receive a massive update, and&nbsp;during the review process, there was very little to nitpick about&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> aside from the occasional latency bugs in cutscenes, which one that occured was in Chapter 1 before speaking with General Morgan and again in another cutscene when Olivier sang his tune both at the&nbsp;at Haken Gate location. Likewise, as faithfully recreated as&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> is, and adding new voicelines, gameplay improvements, and balance changes, it doesn't add new quests for returning players to explore, which is rather unfortunate.</p>

<p>But regardless of a few things to nitpick about,&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> is significantly longer than the original game, according to <a href="https://www.gamer.ne.jp/news/202508090001/" rel="nofollow">a report from Japanese publication Gamer</a>. In fact, this is due to the addition of more exploration, as players will spend more time exploring areas, completing all the main story, event, and side quests, as well as paying attention to the voiceover lines, which helped eliminate some text bloating from the original game.</p>

<p>However, the time spent with both the original game and its remake was a worthwhile experience, as the remake was well-executed in being a more polished and enjoyable entry in the Trails series and a great choice to introduce new players. It's obvious just how much love went into developing&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>, as there's something for everyone to enjoy, and the end product is a brilliant remake that wears its heart on its sleeve and is truly earnest in its origins in the best way possible.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-spinoff-palfarm</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-spinoff-palfarm-aims-to-provide-a-more-relaxing-and-cozy-adventure.1305264/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair has announced&nbsp;<em>Palfarm</em>, a cozy spinoff of the creature-collecting survival game that promises to offer a more relaxing and cozy spin on the original game's premise.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4031890/view/539991294395549848" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam announcement</a>,&nbsp;<em>Palfarm</em>, or something very much like it, was something that "many players requested" following the initial release of <i>Palworld</i>. That game's fans told Pocketpair they wanted "a more relaxing and cozy adventure" in the&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>...erm, world.</p>

<p>Pocketpair says that after "thinking it over for a few months", the idea for&nbsp;<em>Palfarm&nbsp;</em>was born. It won't be developed by the core&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>team; instead, a new team of developers will be working on the game, although it'll still be a Pocketpair project rather than a third-party endeavor.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palfarm-fishing-palworld-spinoff.jpg?itok=k4zLoqll 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palfarm-fishing-palworld-spinoff.jpg?itok=XJE01kPg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palfarm&nbsp;</em>is the cozy&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>adventure you may have been asking for since the original game's launch.</figcaption></figure><p>If you were somewhat put off by&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s violence, then&nbsp;<em>Palfarm&nbsp;</em>might be the game for you. It promises to show a "more peaceful" side of the game's world, so hopefully, no Pals will be forced into slavery or killed for meat here.</p>

<p>You'll be moving to an idyllic island populated by Pals, and alongside your new friends, you'll till fields, cook delicious recipes, and craft new items, all to "build the farm of your dreams", according to Pocketpair.</p>

<p>Pals all have unique abilities, each of which can help you on your farm in different ways; some Pals might be able to help you with crop harvesting, for instance, while others are dab hands (or flippers, or paws) at watering.</p>

<p>Of course, this being a cozy game, you can also meet up with the local residents and give them gifts to build your relationship with them, and Pocketpair says you "may discover unexpected, special stories unfolding".</p>




<p>It's not all peace and love, though; you will also be called upon to "defend your farm from some nasty Pals that come to wreak havoc", so it seems Pocketpair hasn't completely shaken its bloodlust with&nbsp;<em>Palfarm</em>.</p>

<p><em>Palfarm&nbsp;</em>might not even be the only&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>spinoff currently in development; there's also&nbsp;<em>Palworld: More than Just Pals</em>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-dating-sim-announced-again" rel="nofollow">dating sim that might be an elaborate April Fools' joke</a>. I'm not sure if I'd rather it was or it wasn't.</p>

<p>The announcement of&nbsp;<em>Palfarm&nbsp;</em>also comes just a week or so after Pocketpair announced that&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s 1.0 update <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-10-2026-surprises-2025" rel="nofollow">will launch in 2026</a>, bringing lots of new goodies with it.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Palfarm&nbsp;</em>yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4031890/Palworld_Palfarm/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist the game on Steam right here</a> if you want to. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>-related.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I have too many devices that need charging at night. Between my iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch, there are enough cables circling around by night stand that it’s beginning to look like some sort of cyberpunk bird’s nest. Of course, this is my own fault. I can just get a charging stand such as this MagSafe one from Anker which will eliminate my electronic clutter entirely.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4245/"> It’s normally set at $111, but thanks to a 46% limited time discount, it’s now down to just $60. You save a whole $52 for the duration of the sale.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4245/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Designed for Apple</h2>
<p>This Anker MagSafe charging stand is built from the ground up for modern Apple products. Newer iPhones, AirPod cases, and Apple Watches all support wireless charging and this stand has three wireless chargers built in. Each are specifically made for either phone charging, watch charging, or earbud case charging.</p>
<p>Be sure to check which model iPhone and AirPods you have as earlier versions don’t support wireless charging. So long as you have an iPhone 12 or later model, you’ll be good to go on that front.</p>
<p>Charging is fast enough for what the stand is going for. It’s capable of 15W charging. You can find much faster charging options when going with something wired, even within the Anker family of products. However, this is really an end-of-the-day sort of charging stand. When you turn down for the night, and set up all your devices on it, they’ll be fully charged by morning, no problem. That said, it can still bring an Apple Watch Series 9 to nearly 50% in just 30 minutes.</p>



<p>While you have your iPhone charging on the stand, it can be set to display the charging status of the other devices you have charging as well as a clock display. Perfect for your night stand to catch the time at a glance, head still on your pillow.</p>
<p>Anker’s has a safety-first design philosophy on its products and we have the same story here on the MagSafe multi-device wireless charger. ActiveShield tech monitors temperatures over three million times per day to help ensure your phone and other devices don’t overheat.</p>
<p>There are two color options available. Choose either black or white. Do note that while both are on sale currently, the better deal is on the white version. Get it now for $51 off for a limited time. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4245/">That brings the price down from $111 to just $60. You can get the black for $71 at the moment.</a></p>

The most infamous of these is 'the knife,' <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-says-its-prioritizing-the-first-round-of-buffs-over-patching-out-instakill-knife-builds-but-it-will-eventually-address-unintended-interactions">which Gearbox has said it’s aware of but won’t nerf just yet</a>. Now, there’s another new best boss melting build to add to the list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NickTew" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTuber NickTew</a>, who had led the charge online with his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/abuse-it-while-you-can-borderlands-4-has-an-infinite-damage-build-so-broken-it-kills-bosses-in-seconds">knife build discovery</a>, set out to "nerf proof" their Vex in light of Gearbox’s comments about potentially stamping out knife builds. In doing so, he found a way to cause so much damage from a single clip of a gun's magazine that Borderlands 4 spat out a "total existence failure" message in the boss health bar — something I had no idea even existed in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://youtu.be/b6Ery-UaQHA?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new video</a>, NickTew had to slow down the gameplay just to be able to show this ‘total existence failure’ message in action, so quickly did the boss’ health disappear.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/23/screenshot-2025-09-23-132656-1758630426664.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">YouTuber NickTew managed to cause a Borderlands 4 boss "total existence failure!"</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The interaction requires you have a gun with the Torgue Licensed Sticky Magazine and the Taser alt-fire mode. A Torgue Sticky mag enables the weapon to fire sticky projectiles called "gyrojets" that attach to enemies and explode for massive damage upon reloading or switching modes. In this case, switching to Taser.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NickTew demonstrates how you can load an enemy up with gyrojets via an SMG due to its fast rate of fire and big magazine, then right before reloading, switch to the underbarrel taser, causing the gyrojets to explode and cause much more damage than they would if reloading normally. As NickTew put it, with this build you’re able to “snap the boss out of existence.” This works on every character, and it does not involve using the knife. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only issue here is an SMG with this specific combination (Torgue Sticky and alt-fire) is a relatively rare find, so you’ll need to do a spot of farming to nab one. Or perhaps you have one anyway, sitting in your inventory just waiting to cause havoc.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NickTew isn’t entirely sure why this combination causes so much damage. Is it a bug, or are there calculations going on under the hood that spark this huge uptick? It certainly feels like one of Borderlands 4’s “unintended interactions,” so it’s probably not long for this world.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, Gearbox indicated that in the short-term it plans to buff underperforming gear and skills rather than nerf overpowered builds. That means instakill builds like this one are safe for now. Confirmation came from Borderlands 4 creative director Graeme Timmins, who <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1970315557460398462" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>took to social media</u></a> to acknowledge the debate about what he called “builds that use unintended interactions and/or the knife.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the statement:</p><blockquote>“We’ve seen the discourse about builds that use unintended interactions and/or the knife. We’re not going to act on those immediately, instead, we’re looking at our first round of buffs.

                <p dir="ltr">Since the days of the PlayStation 3, players have been earning Trophies in their PlayStation games by completing challenges and finishing games, but outside of their online profiles, there hasn't been a way for the most loyal PS fans to show off those in-game achievements. Today, Sony has provided a solution in Franchise Rewards, a new program where unlocking certain trophies will give a player access to special physical "rewards."</p><p dir="ltr">The program kicks off today with <a href="https://ghostrewards.playstation.com/" rel="nofollow ">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, and it offers two pieces of unique merch for those who earn certain trophies by December 31. Players who have unlocked the "Mono no Aware" gold trophy can preorder a t-shirt for $30, while those who have unlocked the "Living Legend" platinum trophy can preorder a pin for $25.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4573099-ghost-of-tsushima-living-legend-pin.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573099" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4573099-ghost-of-tsushima-living-legend-pin.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573099"></a><figcaption>The Living Legend pin, available to those who unlock Ghost of Tsushima's platinum trophy.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4573099-ghost-of-tsushima-living-legend-pin.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/23/ghost-of-tsushima-players-can-now-unlock-special-ghost-rewards-merchandise-for-purchase/" rel="nofollow ">new article on the PlayStation Blog</a> goes into further detail about the special merch, saying that both items were "created with close input from Sucker Punch Productions to make sure they authentically capture the game’s atmosphere and artistry." The blog post also confirms that Ghost of Yotei will join the program "later this year," with details on that merch coming "closer to launch."</p><p dir="ltr">While the Franchise Rewards program is new for PlayStation and Ghost of Tsushima fans, the idea of earning physical merch for in-game feats has been used by other games in the past. One notable example is Destiny 2, which allowed players to purchase exclusive apparel and other items when they finished newly added raids.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghost of Tsushima's Ghost Rewards program begins today, while the sequel to Sucker Punch Studios's samurai epic, Ghost of Yotei, is set to launch October 2 exclusively on PlayStation 5.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/87dab74b79173/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Switch 2 has been a huge deal since it launched, and at last night's Japan Game Awards, the console was recognised for its monumental achievements so far.</p>
<p>Nintendo's latest hardware took home the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Award at the 2025 ceremony. It's a long and somewhat confusing title, but the basic gist is that it's an award given to an individual, production team, organisation or project that has notably contributed to the games industry in recent years.</p>
<p>For reference, the award was previously picked up by the likes of the PlayStation in 2024 and FromSoftware's Hidetaka Miyazaki in 2022. Nintendo has also seen its fair share of these awards in the past, with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/09/the-famicom-just-won-an-award-at-the-tokyo-game-awards-2023">Famicom</a> collecting the prize in 2023, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">New Horizons</a> team nabbing it in 2020, and the Switch dev team picking it up in 2018.</p>
<p>Switch 2 producers Kouichi Kawamoto, Takuhiro Dohta, and Tetsuya Sasaki (who you'll recognise from the console's reveal Direct) were on hand to accept the award — not dressed in their <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/random-did-you-notice-this-snazzy-switch-2-reference-in-the-devs-direct-outfits">subtle Switch 2 suits</a> this time, unfortunately. You can find the footage of them collecting the award in the stream below, starting around the 9:30 mark.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the 2025 ceremony, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>'s Kepler Interactive picked up the Breakthrough Award, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> took home the Movement Award, and the likes of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> nabbed Awards for Excellence. Masahiro Sakurai also popped up to present <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/indika">Indika</a> the Game Designers Award, and Metaphor was awarded the Grand Award.</p>
<p>We wonder what Switch 2 games we'll see in the running next year, eh?</p>

              <p>Anti-piracy measures, as a rule, suck. But when they’re funny, they get a pass. <em>Super Smash Bros. </em>for the Nintendo 64 falls into the latter category. As revealed by chronicler of <em>Mario</em>-related oddities Supper Mario Broth (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-smash-bros/if-you-play-a-pirated-super-smash-bros-exactly-69-times-on-n64-nintendos-sneaky-anti-piracy-measure-will-lull-the-illegitimate-user-into-a-false-sense-of-security-and-trap-you-as-mario-forever/"><em>GamesRadar</em></a>), the game&nbsp; will eventually lock you into being able to play only a single character, but only after you’ve played the game 69 times. Dude.</p> <p>I’m so adorably naive that I didn’t even realize pirating N64 games was an option back in the day. Of course, in 1996 when dial-up internet was a newborn baby, this wasn’t a case of downloading ROMs from the internet, but rather buying knock-off N64 cartridges from that dodgy-looking stall at the flea market. As a rule, when the game’s name was written on the cartridge in Sharpie, or it featured a black-and-white version of the sticker but with the writing in German, it probably wasn’t wholly legit. And it seems that if that’s the version of <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> you bought in ’99, it was trapped.</p> <p>As Supper Mario Broth puts it, the anti-piracy measure here was “delayed action,” allowing the player to boot the game an enormous 68 times before anything would happen. Then, on the 69th time of playing, you’d suddenly find yourself locked in to only being able to play as Mario.</p>    <p>Funnily enough, Nintendo’s devilish trick here gets close to one of the very few actually effective anti-piracy measures to have been used: when a game lets you play it for so long before popping up a message saying, “Hey, you pirated this! We hope you enjoyed it so far, and if you want to carry on, buy a copy here.” Treating pirates as potential customers has proven lucrative for many indie projects over the years, while draconian systems based on hardware locks, disc requirements, and game-slowing software used by AAA publishers have only ever punished legitimate purchasers, with all such restrictions inevitably removed from the pirated versions.</p> <p>And yes, it’s very unlikely Nintendo picked 69 for comedy reasons, but I still like to believe.</p>
