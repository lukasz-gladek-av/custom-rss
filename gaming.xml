Remedy have released the first proper in-game trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>'s second expansion, The Lake House. It's billed as even more of a horror experience than the base game, and takes place in a research facility run by the Lynchian ghostbuster organisation you may have encountered in Remedy's paranormal shooter Control. As such, the expansion forms a direct connection between the games, and may - read: definitely will - harbour a few clues about the story of the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a>.

<p>
In The Lake House you play Federal Bureau Of Control agent Kiran Estevez, who appears briefly in the main game. She's travelled to the Lake House to make inquiries about Wake, but arrives to find the place smashed-up, flooded and full of gawky Slender Man-esque munsters, the Painted. You'll be able to access the expansion's missions directly from the main menu, if you've already completed Alan Wake 2. If you haven't, you'll find them woven into the base campaign.
</p>
<p>
Where Alan Wake 2's first expansion was more of a compilation of weird vignettes, The Lake House is all about scares. "When we originally came up with the concepts for [first expansion] Night Springs and The Lake House, we knew that they would be quite different tonally," Kyle Rowley explains in <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-expansion-xbox-partner-preview/">an Xbox Wire post</a>. "Night Springs episodes were all about these kind of crazy 'What If?' scenarios where we could explore some rather unique ideas that were sometimes quite a dramatic tonal shift from the main experience in Alan Wake 2. With The Lake House, we wanted to again lean into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> side of things." The best comparison from Alan Wake 2's main storyline is the Valhalla Nursing Home section, apparently. As for the plot connections to Control, Remedy suggest that Control character Dylan Faden may be involved.
</p><p>
The new Painted monsters have a knack for getting behind you. According to Rowley, they "can move in and out of the supernatural paint on surfaces, hunting the player as they do so and have devastating melee attacks that deal significant amounts of damage." As for what Estevez brings to the party, she doesn't have the same abilities as Saga and Alan, but she does have "a new FBC-specific weapon" which is tailored towards spooks. Her base weapons also deal more damage than Saga's.
</p>
<p>
Where the previous Night Springs was more broken-up, this will play more like a "traditional survival horror game", Rowley says. "There is a large open structure for the player to explore, secrets to discover and dangerous enemies to try and survive against. Narrative obviously plays a large role in the expansion - as it did in the main game - so it is definitely worth exploring and trying to locate the many narrative objects scattered throughout the environment." 
</p>
<p>
So when's it out? 22nd October 2024 - oh hey, that's next week. I still haven't 100% finished Alan Wake 2. Time to get the lead out. As for Control 2, as of August it had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/control-2-condor-and-the-max-payne-remakes-are-shaping-up-just-fine-say-remedy">"progressed to the production readiness stage"</a>, after the development team turned in "a build of the game showcasing several important features in playable form".

The big contamination suits, chunky guns, and welding mask give it a light but undeniable <em>BioShock</em>-vibe in my opinion. There’s no release date just yet, however.</p><p>Take a look:</p><p>Players spent <em>Control</em>’s story campaign navigating the Oldest House, a serpentine homage to brutalist architecture and bureaucracy-infused horror. <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> will bring them back, taking place after the events of the original game, to play what seems to be a clean up crew who need to purge the Hiss—otherworldly evils—from its various office cubicles and underground labyrinths. Players will also get to harness powerful artifacts on their missions. </p><p> “What I can say is that the Firebreak crew has been cleared to carry ‘paranatural augments,’ which are Altered Items engineered into tool attachments,” Remedy communications director Thoma Puha said in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/fbc-firebreak-control-xbox-partner-preview/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/fbc-firebreak-control-xbox-partner-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an announcement</a></span> on the Xbox Wire blog. “Like the Garden Gnome you saw in the trailer. These are more or less our take on ‘ultimates’ and are not to be taken lightly. I like to think of them as a jaguar in a box [laughs]. You carry the box, you point it at something, you open the box, and you just kind of hope the jaguar doesn’t turn around and eat you or your friends instead.”</p><figure id="" data-id="24ae53c6aaca805d19cba9af037ca671" data-recommend-id="image://24ae53c6aaca805d19cba9af037ca671" data-format="jpg" data-width="1900" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A clean up crew prepares to fight horrors.

The goal is to make it easy to hop in and experience new stuff without making it feel like a second job. “It’s a pick-up-and-play experience [about] having fun with your friends when you have the time,” Puha said. “That’s not to say that<em> FBC: Firebreak</em> doesn’t have deep player progression and things to unlock, it does, but this isn’t about logging in every day for some loot or fear of missing out on materials.</p><p>If the spin-off can leverage the haunting environments and beautifully creepy vibes of <em>Control</em> to deliver some fun co-op action, that might be enough. This is Remedy we’re talking about though, so I’d still be shocked if there weren’t plenty of Easter eggs and clues for fans of the original game to geek out about, or even weave into the larger <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-max-payne-control-remedy-entertainment-1850967623&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-max-payne-control-remedy-entertainment-1850967623">“Remedy-verse”</a></span> the company has been building across all of its games. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Be the last person standing when the lights come on and earn your place in the winner’s showcase.</li><li><strong>Danger Lurks in the Dark</strong> – Light is a rarity in close-quarter arenas riddled with traps for intense firefights. Players must decide where and when to fire at the risk of exposing their position. Hone your senses with the room-scanning Echo mechanic to help you navigate the arena and locate your opponents.</li><li><strong>Revenge Under the Blacklights</strong> – When defeated, spectators gain access to the arena’s cutting-edge night vision cameras. Blacklight reveals the vibrant hues of hidden street art and transforms the slick designs of contestants’ outfits. The eliminated spectators can assume control of traps in the arena to influence the outcome of the match and exact revenge.</li><li><strong>Light Them Up</strong> – The pitch-black battlefields of <em>Blindfire</em> turn the first-person shooter genre on its head. Stalk the shadows as the tension builds, then run for cover as the shots start flying in a volley of muzzle flashes. Think you’ve got what it takes to eliminate the competition in <em>Blindfire</em>? Then grab your weapon and LIGHT THEM UP.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>The God of War TV series at Prime Video is undergoing a major change. A new report confirmed that Sony Pictures TV and Amazon MGM Studios are starting over on the show from scratch after a trio of the show's key creative team left the project.</p><p><a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/god-of-war-sony-executive-producers-depart-new-writers-joining-1236118075/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadline </a>reported that showrunner and executive producer Rafe Judkins has left the series, alongside executive producers Hawk Ostby and Mark Fergus. They are said to have submitted multiple scripts for the show, and one source said the scripts were "praised by both Sony and Prime." However, the decision apparently came down to "move in a different creative direction."</p><p>The God of War series was announced in December 2022 but never got any meaningful development updates since then, prompting fans to wonder and worry about its status.</p><p>Going forward, the report said Sony and Prime are now looking to hire a "whole new writers room" for the show, and given that, no one should expect the God of War show to debut anytime soon. However, Deadline said God of War continues to be an "important asset" for Prime.</p><p>As for the god of War game series, 2022's God of War Ragnarok was the latest entry in the series, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-ending-the-norse-saga-after-two-games-is-like-the-lord-of-the-rings-box-set-barlog-says/1100-6496283/" data-ref-id="1100-6496283">wrapped up the Norse saga</a>. It's one of Sony's most popular and beloved franchises, so it's likely not a matter of if but when a new game is announced.</p><p>Beyond a new God of War game, developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-developer-sony-santa-monica-is-reportedly-working-on-a-new-ip/1100-6525531/" data-ref-id="1100-6525531">Sony Santa Monica could be making a new IP.</a></p>

			<p>The Remedy Entertainment's multiplayer game set in the Control universe previously known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-multiplayer-spin-off-condor-infographic-reveals-new-details/">Condor</a> has been officially revealed as FBC Firebreak today.</p>
<p>A new trailer shown during today's Xbox Partner Showcase provided the first look at the very first multiplayer game developed by the Finnish development studio which, in no way, is a Control DLC and not its sequel, according to Game Director Mike Kayatta.</p>
<p><iframe title="FBC: Firebreak – Official Announcement Trailer | Xbox Partner Preview October 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tBO__RWUbKM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>FBC: Firebreak is a 3-player cooperative first-person shooter set within the enigmatic Federal Bureau of Control (FBC). As the Bureau’s headquarters faces a deadly and prolonged siege by otherworldly forces, only Firebreak—its most adaptable response unit—has the skills and courage to restore order.</em></p>
<p>In a new preview posted on&nbsp;<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/fbc-firebreak-control-xbox-partner-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Wire</a>, Remedy Communications Director Thomas Puha provided a quick overview of the game, saying that FBC Firebreak will be a game that will be easy to get into, featuring multiple hectic co-op missions that will showcase Remedy's creativity fans have come to know over the years.&nbsp;While taking on paranormal threats as the responders of the Federal Bureau of Control, players won't fail to notice how the studio's DNA will be evident right from the start, despite the game not looking that different from other modern co-op FPS games.</p>
<p>FBC Firebreak will launch sometime in 2025 on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game will also be available from day one on Xbox Game Pass.</p>

Developers Unknown Worlds and publishers Krafton have given us our first proper look at their next open world exploration sim, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, which will launch on PC via Xbox Game Preview in 2025. It'll support four player co-op, alongside the returning singleplayer survive-o-buildy experience, and it'll take place on a brand new planet. Here's the reveal trailer.

"Whether you're bringing the experience of your previous adventures with you, or are new to the Subnautica games, you'll get to explore lush new environments, encounter fascinating creatures around every corner, and uncover the secrets at the core of this mysterious planet," comments a post on the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/subnautica-2-xbox-partner-preview/">Xbox NewsWire</a>. "But as familiar as things might seem to seasoned players at first glance, Subnautica 2 will offer new and unique experiences that will keep you on your... fins."
</p>
<p>
As for the "hotly requested" co-op multiplayer, it'll come with the initial Xbox Game Preview launch next year. The developers are careful to point out that if you're one of "those who prefer the eerily beautiful solitude of solo play, Subnautica 2 will still provide that familiar experience, and prove equally as challenging."
</p><p>
Beyond that, expect "new and improved tools, vehicles, and base building" and "a whole host of creatures big and small, the likes of which have never been seen before". I imagine that's one of the new critters in the trailer - a leviathan of some kind, by the looks of things, with bioluminescent fittings and tentacles.</p>
<p>Sure sounds like a sequel, doesn't it? It's nice to have this one out in the open, finally - the developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-subnautica-2-developers-are-hiding-teaser-images-in-the-first-games-time-capsules">have been releasing teaser images of Subnautica 2 in the first game's time capsules</a>. To answer the obvious question - I don't know whether this means it's not coming to Steam, Epic Games Store or other PC storefronts, but it sounds like it's a Microsoft-only joint for the minute.

<p>During Tuesday’s Xbox Partner Preview event, Double Eleven revealed its brand new game Blindfire. In addition, the game has launched in early access on Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>



<p>The game is available for $8.99 on Xbox, Steam, and Epic Games Store. A PlayStation version will launch later this year.</p>



<p>Blindfire is a first-person arena shooter where everything is dark and overall visuals are limited. Players have to rely on their abilities and senses in order to find opponents and take them out.</p>

<iframe title="Blindfire | Official Reveal and Early Access Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AQP3AmAVle0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In speaking with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/blindfire-xbox-partner-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>, lead designer Matt Dunthorne explained that the idea for the game came from one of the company’s “Shatterday” exercises where groups within the company come up with hypothetical challenges.</p>



<p>“As soon as I heard the pitch, I knew it was something special – there was electricity in the room when they spoke about it and I couldn’t get it out of my head for days afterwards,” Dunthorne said. “The beautiful thing about the concept in my opinion is how pure the core idea is, there is no fluff or excess and it can be explained in a single sentence.”&nbsp;</p>







<p>The game features a main mode called Bodycount that is played either as a team or Free-For-All. The matches support up to eight players at a time.</p>



<p>Within the game, Blindfire utilizes an echo mechanic that shows the outline of your immediate surroundings to help find enemies and keep your bearings in order. There’s also a “Last Known Position” ability that will show the latest steps of opponents. </p>



<p>Regarding weapons, Double Eleven has every player using the same abilities and weapons at the start of early access. There is a pistol call the Mantis and a shotgun called Abolition. More weapons will be added as the game develops, but the goal is to not have what they call traditional loadouts for players.</p>

At launch, the new interface will include three main hubs: Home, All Games, and Store. Each hub displays all of its content on one page, eliminating the need to scroll.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/17/bo6-codhq-ui-image-tout-1729179540332.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p>From October 25, Black Ops 6 and Warzone will be shown on the Home tab. Other games are accessible via the All Games tab. There’s a Last Played tile, too, which gives players quick access to what they played most recently.</p><p>You’ll need to cycle to the All Games tab to view your full library of Call of Duty games dating back to 2019’s Modern Warfare. You’ll cross-launch into owned titles, buy unowned titles, and manage your installations from there.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/17/bo6-codhq-ui-image-002-1729179598209.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Call of Duty players will actually be able to check out the new Call of Duty UI from October 21 after downloading the pre-launch update. It’ll evolve over time, too. Here’s the plan, per Activision:</p><p><strong>Phase 1: pre-Black Ops 6 Launch (October 21 – October 24)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Initially, there will be a transition period from October 21 through 24 when the new UI goes live before Black Ops 6 launches.</li><li>During these few days, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Warzone will be the primary Game Tiles on the Home tab and players will cross-launch into those games. Modern Warfare III will retain its legacy UI. Call of Duty: Warzone will retain its legacy UI until the Season 01 update.</li><li>The Store tab will direct players into the full Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Warzone in-game stores via cross-launch.</li></ul><p><strong>Phase 2: post-Black Ops 6 launch (October 25 – [Redacted])</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>When Black Ops 6 launches, it will replace Modern Warfare 3, making Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone the primary Game Tiles on the Home tab. Players will be able to instantly access Black Ops 6 and cross-launch into Call of Duty: Warzone.</li><li>Players who wish to continue playing Modern Warfare 3 can access it via cross-launch on the All Games tab or the Last Played Tile if that’s the content you’ve played most recently.</li><li>For players who have purchased Black Ops 6, the Store tab will now direct you to the full Black Ops 6 in-game store.</li><li>Black Ops 6 will have its own individual user interface designed to easily get players into the modes and content they want to play. Players can access Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies from the Black Ops 6 game UI. Look out for new updates to the gunsmith, playlist selection, and social showcase within Black Ops 6!</li></ul><p><strong>Phase 3: Season 01 ([Redacted])</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>When Season 01 begins, the UI will enter its fully realized state. Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone will continue to be the primary Game Tiles on the Home tab and players will be able to instantly access both Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone for a faster, more direct path to gameplay.</li><li>The Store tab will now direct all players to the full Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone in-game stores based on what you have installed.</li><li>A Battle Pass tab will be introduced in Season 01 with similar functionality as the Store tab, directing players to the full Battle Pass within Black Ops 6 or Call of Duty: Warzone.</li><li>With the Season 01 update, Call of Duty: Warzone will also have its own individual user interface with improvements similar to the Black Ops 6 UI.</li></ul><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/17/bo6-codhq-ui-image-005-1729179679562.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Preloading for Black Ops 6 begins for all platforms this Monday, October 21 at 9am PT. Players who have preordered the game or subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass can download Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies so they’re ready to go when Black Ops 6 officially releases on October 25.</p><p>Players who preordered Black Ops 6 and already have Call of Duty installed will get the Black Ops 6 preload as an automatic update to their existing install, similar to previous Call of Duty updates.</p><p>Players who preordered Black Ops 6 but don’t already have Call of Duty installed can initiate the preload from their platform storefront. The download will be larger for players who already have Call of Duty installed as they’re getting the new UI and Black Ops 6 at the same time, Activision said.</p><p>We've also got confirmation of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-multiplayer-maps-modes-and-operators-confirmed"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's launch Multiplayer maps, modes, and Operators</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-preload-and-global-launch-times-pc-system-requirements-and-102-gb-storage-requirement"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's preload and global launch times</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/project-ethos-first-hands-on-impressions-of-2ks-new-roguelike-hero-shooter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Project Ethos is a new free-to-play third-person hero extraction shooter that mixes in roguelike elements. The main game of Project Ethos is an extraction mode. And while I was excited to finally see 31st Union’s first project since its formation in 2019, I couldn’t help but feel that a lot of the mechanics felt like they belonged in games from that year.</p><p>Here’s the thing: Project Ethos is fine as a game. It hits all the right notes as an extraction hero third-person shooter, but my first impression after a few hours of hands-on time is that it seems to fall short of delivering anything that’s truly genre-defying in either the roguelike or extraction shooter departments. In the preview, I was able to play six different heroes, each, as you’d expect, with their own abilities and weapons. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/17/project-ethos-screenshot-1-1729139677756.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>This forces players to really get comfortable with that character’s abilities as a secondary, since abilities in a hero shooter are meant to enhance your playstyle. Your gunplay comes first. And Project Ethos has some fun sets of weapons that I thoroughly enjoyed playing with. The learning curve with characters and abilities was fairly low, so new players won’t feel too out of the water entering Project Ethos.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Project Ethos has some fun sets of weapons that I thoroughly enjoyed playing with.</p></div><p>Trials mode is PvPvE, meaning you’ll be playing against real players as well as NPC enemies that exist in the map. The matches you queue into are persistent, meaning each time you enter a game, other players have been playing in that match for quite some time. You can see how much time is left in the match every time you queue in. </p><p>With persistent matches, this means that when you drop into a game, you may end up landing closer to some enemies who are running throughout the map. This also means you’ll encounter players who are higher level than you. Each Trials match has its own leveling system. You earn XP from collecting XP shards from different loot bins you come across, from killing enemies, and from completing events that randomly trigger throughout the map.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/17/project-ethos-screenshot-2-1729139693166.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The events that could spawn into the map were a bit confusing at first blush. It was hard to see where some of the events were happening just by looking at the overall map. You’d have to really be looking at your immediate vicinity to find the local event, and then go activate it. After a few rounds of play, I got used to this method, but it was frustrating not to see the minor events on the map.</p><p>When you level up in a match, you’ll be able to pick one of three different power-ups for your character. There’s a pool of 27 different power-ups to build your playstyle. And this is where the roguelike element comes into play. You can earn up to nine different power-ups in one extraction run if you choose to stay in the game that long and level.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You can earn up to nine different power-ups in one extraction run if you choose to stay in the game that long and level.</p></div><p>The random events that spawn across the map involve different activities that will unlock a big loot chest with bigger XP boosts, weapon enhancements, and cores. Cores are the big-ticket items you’ll be wanting to collect in each run, since extracting with cores will let you buy augments in the main hub. These boost the ability to get power-ups faster, give you health drops from the NPC bots that you fight in game, and other bonuses.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/17/project-ethos-screenshot-3-1729139706943.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>None of these augments boost your damage towards other players, though, so it’s fairly balanced in that regard. Trials overall felt fairly balanced in gameplay, since you could decide to disengage from fights if things felt too dicey. It felt like a proper survival experience with your typical extraction shooters. While you could feel the imbalance of characters’ weapons, with one having a higher dps than the other, you still had the method of escaping to offset that issue.</p><p>In the second game mode I was able to play, called Gauntlet, there was no escaping. You’re put into a 3v3v3v3 matchup where you’re playing against another team in a small arena. The first team to score 3 victories, wins. You’re in a server full of other teams since who you face will change each time in a dutch round robin format.</p><p>This format pits the bottom half of the teams against the top half of the teams: Team 1 faces Team 5, Team 2 faces Team 6. By the definition of dutch round robin, you shouldn’t be facing a team more than twice. Regardless, this format was the one thing that worked for this game mode. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Project Ethos ultimately plays well, is enjoyable, and utilizes the extraction and roguelike aspects to its advantage, but at first impression, it fails at being a new experience that players will crave to experience over and over again.</p></div><p>Gauntlet really showed the imbalance of the character abilities and weapons, since you’re forced to face your opponents head-on with very little play space. The sniper character, Prism, is incredibly strong, and her primary beam weapon melts opponents quickly in close range, and her sniper rifle allows her to deal devastating damage from a distance. Pairing that with her E ability, where she throws up a prism field that increases the damage output, makes her an incredibly tough character to beat in Gauntlet.</p><p>In Gauntlet, you still have the roguelike element of having to choose from selections of your power-ups. This further displayed the imbalance of character damage and powers. However, I did like the competitive aspect of Gauntlet over Trials. It showed a lot of promise of what competitive play could feel like in Project Ethos.</p><p>The gameplay loop of Trials and Gauntlet are very cookie-cutter and unexciting. They aren’t experiences that you can’t get somewhere else that you’ve already invested your time in. Fortnite came to mind as I played Project Ethos, and I found myself comparing some of the mechanics that exist in Fortnite that Project Ethos could vastly benefit from.</p><p>Overall, I truly did enjoy my time with Project Ethos, but in the end I was left feeling disappointed with the game so far as a whole. Project Ethos ultimately plays well, is enjoyable, and utilizes the extraction and roguelike aspects to its advantage, but at first impression, it fails at being a new experience that players will crave to experience over and over again.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Where's Batman when you really need him? HBO's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-penguin-review-gotham-city-thrives-outside-of-the-batman/1900-6418282/" data-ref-id="1900-6418282">The Penguin</a> is a spin-off from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-batman-review-riddle-me-this/1900-6417835/" data-ref-id="1900-6417835">The Batman</a>, and the Dark Knight is nowhere to be found while there's a gang war underway between the Falcone and Maroni crime families. Oswald "Oz" Cobb (Colin Farrell) engineered the entire conflict to make himself the new kingpin of Gotham City. But as seen in the new mid-season trailer for The Penguin, Oz has a more formidable foe in Sofia Falcone (Cristin Milioti), the rightful heir of the Falcone family's empire.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtWkqWJzmLA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mtWkqWJzmLA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Oz was able to temporarily fool Sofia into thinking he was backing her play to lead the Falcone family. He also hid the important detail that he killed her beloved brother, Alberto Falcone (Michael Zegen), in a fit of rage. Now, Sofia knows the truth and she's out to get revenge on Oz.</p><p>The trailer makes it clear that both Oz and Sofia have or will have their own followers in the remaining four episodes of the miniseries. And those forces are inevitably turning towards each other as the battle for Gotham City heats up. It's the kind of situation that some billionaire with a bat suit should really look into.</p><p>Sofia may have the numbers and the name recognition, but this is Oz's fight to lose. He's already pitted three of the city's major crime figures against each other. Unfortunately for the Penguin, he's made a lot of new enemies in the process as well. That may even lead into some strange alliances against him in the weeks ahead.</p><p>The Penguin airs weekly on HBO and Max, with the Season 1 finale arriving on November 10.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, Bloober Team's remake of the survival horror classic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/" data-ref-id="1900-6418296">Silent Hill 2</a> was met with critical acclaim. But it won't be long before the developer returns with an all-new title. During today's Xbox Partner Preview, Bloober Team unveiled the first teaser trailer for Cronos: The New Dawn, a new sci-fi survival-horror game that's coming next year.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibQP4F8SyeA" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ibQP4F8SyeA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Cronos: The New Dawn will be Bloober Team's first original survival-horror title, according to the studio, and it puts players in control of a Traveler. The player's character works for an "enigmatic Collective," and the Traveler's mission is to find selected individuals who died during an apocalypse and use time travel to extract them from the past.</p><p>Bloober Team didn't share many details about what caused this apocalypse, but "the Change" left the world transformed into a devastated wasteland that's populated by hideous monstrosities that will put Travelers to the ultimate test of survival. Additionally, the developer noted that the post-apocalyptic time period of the game isn't some far-off future. Instead, the game takes place in an alternate version of Poland in the 1980s.</p><p>"Following the success of Silent Hill 2, we are proud to present Cronos, an exciting new IP from Bloober Team," said Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno in a statement. "Our commitment to redefining the horror genre continues with this survival-horror title, which represents a natural progression of our creative vision and our studio’s strategy. By merging the eerie atmosphere of horror with the boundless potential of science fiction, Cronos promises to deliver a fresh survival experience. We can't wait to share it with the world in 2025."</p><p>Cronos: The New Dawn will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in 2025, but a specific release date hasn't been set yet.</p>

Today, during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-partner-preview-october-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-5861/" data-ref-id="2900-5861">Xbox Partner Preview</a> event, Kinetic Games revealed that Phasmophobia--the co-op survival game where teams of ghost-hunters investigate paranormal activity--will launch in early access on consoles October 29.</p><p dir="ltr">Phasmophobia drops four players into a dark and deserted area--houses, campsites, prisons, etc.--and tasks them with identifying an otherworldly intruder from a list of 24 potential types. However, the ghost can become angered at the team's efforts and fly into a rage, hunting the players and sending them into the afterlife to join it.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Each challenge comes with a full set of ghost-hunting tools used to identify the spirit in question, from cameras that can pick up a spooky silhouette, to a ghost-writing book that can be used to communicate with the target. Each tool is stored in a truck outside, and players will travel back and forth between the truck and the house in order to get to the bottom of the supernatural situation.</p><p dir="ltr">Phasmophobia debuted in September 2020 in early access on PC and VR systems, and it quickly became an indie hit. It was the best-selling game on Steam in both October and November 2020--with total sales nearing 20 million copies according to Kinetic Games--and it won Best Debut Game at The Game Awards the following month.</p><p dir="ltr">Phasmophobia launches in early access on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PS VR 2 on October 29. The launch will coincide with a new Halloween event which will feature the game's first-ever community task, where players can work together to unlock a new weather pattern called Blood Moon.</p>
