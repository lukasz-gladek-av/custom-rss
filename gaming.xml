            <link>https://kotaku.com/xreal-1s-ar-virtual-smart-glasses-get-a-surprise-price-drop-right-after-launch-with-switch-2-support-2000662866</link>
            <guid>1416046</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Just when you think that the next big thing is finally going to be flying cars now, the tech world rolls out something new that puts that idea on hold yet again. Virtual and Augmented reality glasses are “that” big thing these days, and if you’ve been curious to try a pair yourself, Amazon is making the upgrade easy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6877/">We just spotted the Xreal 1S AR glasses going for $449 at the retailer, down from $549</a>. That’s after a nice (and rare) $100 discount. All shoppers will enjoy free delivery with their purchase, so you’re saving a bit on that front, too. This is also the lowest we have seen these glasses drop to in a while. The offer, however, won’t be around forever. It’s best to get your orders in before the price shoots back up!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6877/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Viewing Experience</h2>
<p>This smart pair is capable of presenting a breathtaking virtual screen up to 500 inches, anywhere you want. You’ll experience ultra‑smooth viewing with a 120Hz refresh rate in 3DoF mode, plus a 90Hz global refresh that eliminates flicker to keep things sharp. Each unit is carefully colored‑tuned for precise, natural hues, while the optical engine boosts clarity by 9% for incredible detail. Trying to stream a nature documentary in your living room, or playing your favorite game, expect lifelike picture quality with image points that lock perfectly in your eye for a more realistic, immersive experience.</p>
<p>There are multiple viewing modes that support a bunch of needs. The 3 DoF Anchor lets you anchor your screen anywhere with a single press of a button. You can adjust the size and distance using the on-screen display settings. Spatial Anchor makes the screen stay fixed in a single place, even as you walk around or change your position. It offers that TV-like experience where the screen doesn’t flicker or move as you do. The Follow mode, on the other hand, offers real-time spatial anchoring. It keeps the screen fixed directly in front of your field of view by moving it according to your head movements. Basically, content won’t ever be out of sight, as long as you don’t want it to. Getting a stable, centered image also reduces motion sickness, which makes this mode perfect for travel.</p>



<p>Then there’s UltraWide, which expands the viewing area to give you plenty of space to multitask, create, and unwind. Similarly, Side View delivers a mini screen, allowing you to keep an eye on what’s going on around in your surroundings while still being connected to the digital world. What’s more, the sound system has been co-developed with Bose to match the immersive visuals. You’ll enjoy a spacious, balanced soundstage with deeper lows and clear highs, regardless of what you’re viewing.</p>
<p>Getting started with using the thing couldn’t be easier. The pair runs on a self‑developed X1 chip, which is the world’s first spatial computing processor built specifically for AR glasses. It doesn’t require complicated setup processes to get going. You can simply connect it to any USB‑C DP‑enabled device and step straight into expansive spatial content. Once paired, you can adjust brightness, color temperature, tint, distance, and 2D/3D modes with precision using on‑device controls.</p>
<p>Included in the box are the AR glasses, a carrying case, a USB-C cable, and a user manual. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6877/">You can now grab this smart pair for just $449, after Amazon took a nice $100 off its usual price</a>. The offer won’t be around for long, so we highly suggest grabbing it without wasting much time.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director has confirmed that Part 3 is also being built on Unreal Engine 4. </p>



<p>Square Enix’s next big remake project is Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3, and though we haven’t received any gameplay or an announcement video yet, the devs have shared plenty of information. We already know that the game experience is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more or less complete</a>“, and now the title has been decided too, so hopefully an announcement could be right around the corner. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-title-decided-going-to-continue-with-unreal-engine-4">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 Title Decided, Going to Continue with Unreal Engine 4</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-officially-has-a-title/1100-6537603/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameSpot</a>, Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director Naoki Hamaguchi revealed additional details about part 3, including the continuation of Unreal Engine 4. Hamaguchi first stated that creative director Tetsuya Nomura has decided on which title to go ahead with, and he has “locked” one of the two titles the devs were discussing. </p>



<p>Next up, Unreal Engine 4: it seems the dev team discussed transferring the title’s development to Unreal Engine 5; however, they later decided against it. Hamguchi stated that they have made “a lot of modifications to fit our needs” on Unreal Engine 4, which is why it’s beneficial to work on something the team is “already familiar with.”</p>



<p>Hamaguchi also shared his views on AI, confirming that they don’t rely on the tech to “come up with ideas”. Hamaguchi and the team use it as a tool to make their work smoother, or let AI take over menial tasks. However, he added that AI is “becoming more and more necessary” and can create an environment where work is more efficient and more creative options can be explored. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazons-choice-windows-11-pro-mini-pc-at-nearly-40-off-is-surging-as-a-mac-mini-alternative-2000662863</link>
            <guid>1416010</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="107" data-end="536">“Brains like a full-sized PC, body of a Mac Mini, and easier on your checkbook than either” would make a really strong dating site bio for a mini PC, and the Acemagic K1 is well worth swiping right for. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6875/">It’s an Amazon’s Choice mini PC preloaded with Windows 11 Pro that’s on sale for a limited time for just $220, a big 37% break from its usual $349.</a></p>
<p data-start="538" data-end="997">This deal isn’t about some janky plug-and-pray rig that you’ll be trying to return or replace within weeks or months — the Acemagic K1 is a bona fide, space-saving desktop replacement that fits in the palm of your hand. It has an AMD Ryzen 4300 processor that can max out at 3.7GHz and enough onboard memory (16GB) and storage (256GB) to juggle web tabs, creative apps, Discord, and whatever random emulator you’ve got open without the dreaded slowdown that turns productivity into an endless loading screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6875/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="538" data-end="997">Mini Build, Mini Price</h2>
<p data-start="999" data-end="1440">If you’re eyeing a Mac Mini purely because you want a tiny powerhouse combined with the flex that comes with all things Mac, this Acemagic K1 deal at Amazon is your wallet pleading with you to be reasonable. Yes, Apple’s M4-powered Mini is sleek and whisper-quiet, but it’ll set you back significantly more with similar memory — over twice as much, actually. We’ve seen gaming headsets that cost more than the Acemagic K1.</p>
<p data-start="1442" data-end="1860">But this discounted mini PC squeezes an AMD Ryzen-class processor and that generous RAM into a chassis the size of a thick paperback. You can hide it behind a monitor with a VESA mount, plop it next to your console, or shove it into your streaming cabinet without asking your partner for extra desk real estate. Add a monitor — or as many as three monitors — and keyboard you already own — <em>voila</em>, instant command center.</p>


<h2 data-start="1442" data-end="1860">Palm-Sized Powerhouse</h2>
<p data-start="1862" data-end="2277">To answer the inevitable question of <em data-start="1886" data-end="1911">“why not a laptop?”</em> — this isn’t about portability. The Acemagic K1 is a dedicated little beast with outstanding expansion potential and a whispery high-efficiency cooling system that quietly hum along while your laptop’s fan blasts like it’s trying to take off. It’s perfect for anyone who wants to offload background tasks, run servers, handle video encoding, or just give their main rig a break without dropping a pile of cash.</p>
<p data-start="2279" data-end="2649"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6875/">Like all Amazon deals, this $220 price won’t linger forever.</a> Yesterday it was here, tomorrow it might be back at the full price of $349. If you’ve been mentally earmarking that desk corner for a proper PC that doesn’t look like a suitcase and sound like a jet turbine, your patience has just paid off. Whether it ends up as your primary machine, a home server, or the hub of all your nerdy projects, the Acemagic K1 one of the more legitimately great mini PC deals we’ve seen in a while.</p>

The indie developer said it was working with Valve to “resolve” the issue, and pointed to Void War's continued availability on Itch.io.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Void War is often compared to both indie darling FTL and Warhammer 40,000, Games Workshop’s tabletop wargame set in the grim darkness of the far future — and it’s easy to see why.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Void War Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The gameplay looks incredibly similar to Subset Games’ hugely popular 2012 ‘spaceship simulation roguelike-like,’ and the aesthetic is very Warhammer 40,000.

It said that it had received a takedown notice from Valve stating that Games Workshop itself had claimed copyright infringement. But here’s what makes this one odd: the only claiming information Valve provided the developer it said, is Games Workshop’s public-facing infringements inbox and the name “Mal Reynolds.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mal Reynolds is a name that will be instantly familiar to Firefly / Serenity fans, because that’s the name of the main character, played by Nathan Fillion in the beloved but short-lived sci-fi show. It seems unlikely that Games Workshop would have someone on its books named Mal Reynolds, and that it would come after Void War now, half a year after release on Steam. And it’s worth pointing out Void War is still up on Itch.io, where no DMCA takedown appears to have taken place.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Tundra Interactive's comment to IGN in full:</p><blockquote>We received a DMCA takedown notice from Valve stating that Games Workshop is claiming copyright infringement. We have not received any other communication from Games Workshop, and the only claimant information Valve has provided is Games Workshop’s public-facing infringements inbox and the name “Mal Reynolds,” which is unusual since that’s the main character from Firefly. We can’t independently verify who actually submitted the notice, and Games Workshop hasn’t responded yet to our email asking them to confirm or withdraw it. We’re following the standard DMCA process and will share further updates when we have confirmed information.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this may actually be a genuine DMCA takedown by Games Workshop, and there may well be a Mal Reynolds who's doing the dirty work. Perhaps there's an official FTL-style Warhammer 40,000 game in the works, and it's close to a reveal. Neither Games Workshop nor Valve has clarified the matter, and based on both companies' history when it comes to DMCAs, are unlikely to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of which leaves Void War off Steam and Tundra Interactive, like the Imperium Nihilus itself, in the dark. As for Games Workshop, it’s got plenty of official Warhammer 40,000 games in development, including Dawn of War 4, Dark Heresy, and Total War: Warhammer 40,000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Lots, <em>lots</em> more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And no, Re-Logic doesn't even say that this is the last update anywhere — despite insisting Terraria had received its last update for years — but of course, with the team promising that crossplay will be "made available some time after 1.4.5," there's at least one more patch on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When Rockstar learned about the release of Terraria 1.4.5, they postponed GTA 6 in fear," teased one player in the YouTube comments. "I kid you not, I am gonna start on journey mode just to disable corruption spread, Hypeeeeee!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Terraria/comments/1qn8rrp/comment/o1rzjbr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a> another on Reddit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Terraria 1.4.5 releases on January 27 and includes "things that got left out of 1.4.4" plus crossover events with Dead Cells and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-x-terraria-coming-in-2025-december-update-set-to-add-huge-new-island"><u>a second collab</u></a> with Pocketpair's Palworld, this time for Terraria players. The upcoming features were published on the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Upcoming_features" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terraria wiki</a>, and outline what to expect from 1.4.5 when it comes out. Expect official and final patch notes soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Terraria is pretty old at this point; IGN reviewed it 15 years ago(!) in 2011. Even then, though, we thought it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/05/25/terraria-review"><u>amazing, scoring it 9/10</u></a> and writing: "Though on the surface it looks like just another "me too" indie game seeking to ride the coattails of Minecraft's success, Terraria expands on the familiar sandbox gameplay with a greater emphasis on combat and adventure that proves very satisfying. That's rare indeed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

<p>However, we may have to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">wait longer</strong> to see Arthur Morgan ride from New Hanover to New Austin in glorious <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">60 FPS on consoles</strong>, and it could be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6</em>'s fault</strong>, according to a new report.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, Reece "Kiwi Talkz" Reilly commented on this <strong>highly anticipated update</strong>.<em> "I can tell you 100% I know 8 devs that worked on RDR2 next gen,"</em> Kiwi Talkz said on <a href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/2015523023701659724"><strong>X</strong></a>. <em>"It is a thing but Rockstar do whatever they want to do regarding release dates, maybe GTA 6 dev timelines changed the release schedule for everything, who knows, all I know is that I know devs have worked on it and it will come at some point."</em></p>



<p>Asked about a user regarding how long this <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Red Dead Redemption 2 update has been in the works</strong>, Kiwi Talks couldn't talk about specifics, as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Rockstar is heavily compartmentalised,"</em> and thus <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">sharing precise information</strong> could make it easy for Rockstar Games to know where it is coming from, which is a very sensible thing to do with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-rockstar-reaffirms-claims-fired-employees-dismissed-for-distributing-confidential-information/"><strong>company that has shown not to have much tolerance for leakers</strong></a>. However, Kiwi Talkz commented on the matter to let fans know <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"the dream is not dead."</em></p>



<p>Although the reason for this long delay is unknown, Kiwi Talkz speculates it may have been due to the <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> development timeline and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch-2-mobile-ios-netflix/">recent release of the Red Dead Redemption port</a></strong>. "<em>If I had to guess based on the limited info I know, I think they originally planned to release it earlier but because timelines changed with GTA 6 it massively delayed it,</em>" Kiwi Talks said. <em>"I personally don't think you'll see it now till late 2027 primarily because releasing RDR2 now would cut the wind out of RDR1s sales (which hasnt been out too long) and GTA 6 coming out late this year, they want GTA 6 dominating everything at least for a year before even entertaining the idea of RDR2 next gen."</em></p>



<p>If Rockstar Games is indeed waiting to complete development of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Grand Theft Auto 6</em> and letting it dominate gaming, as<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/"> it is poised to do</a></strong>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/although-not-content-complete-yet-fall-2026-is-a-more-real-release-window-than-fall-2025-for-grand-theft-auto-vi/"><strong>the game is not delayed again</strong></a>, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S will only see the light of day from <strong>2027 onward.</strong> </p>



<p><em>"Really excited to play it in the nursing home,"</em> said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qmvsw2/comment/o1p5nym/"><strong>probablyuntrue on Reddit</strong></a>, echoing the <strong>wider community sentiment</strong>. <em>"Next consoles will be out by the time they release it,"</em> said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qmvsw2/comment/o1p1pgx/"><strong>Blayzeman</strong></a>, voicing another concern among the community: will we be talking about a <strong><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> PlayStation 6, next-generation Xbox port</strong> by the time GTA 6 is out and its full dominance established?</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-drops-to-its-black-friday-low-after-multiple-price-cuts-now-priced-like-a-budget-android-smartphone-2000662878</link>
            <guid>1415986</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Google’s Pixel range offers some of the best Android phones on the market. There’s something for everyone, whether you’re after basic features for everyday use or want to enjoy all the latest advancements in the AI world.</p>
<p>The tech giant unveiled its Pixel 10 Series last year, featuring stunning models with a solid build, an impressive camera, a bright display, new AI tools, and a lot more. That said, its previous generation Pixel 9 phones are still an excellent option to consider, and pack many of the features found on the latest models. If you’ve been thinking of treating yourself to one, we’ve got great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6874/">Amazon is offering the 128GB, unlocked Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in Hazel at a 36% discount today, which drops its $1,099 price to just $699</a>. Basically, it’s cheaper than the basic Pixel 9 right now. Those willing to trade their older phone can save up to $600 on their purchase, too, but you might not be able to combine both offers. Trade-in credit is offered in the form of Amazon gift cards that you can use towards other purchases. We highly suggest grabbing the offer as soon as you can, as we’re not expecting it to stick around for longer than a day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6874/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packed With AI Features</h2>
<p>Pixel 9 Pro XL features a stunning 6.8-inch Pixel 9 Pro XL Super Actua display, which is both bright and vivid. It offers excellent picture quality in all lighting conditions, whether you’re using it while soaking up some sun or in a dimmer setting at night. At the back, you’ll find a triple rear camera system that not just lets you take professional-level photos, but also high-quality video up to 20x with Super Res Zoom Video. You will also be able to film clearly in low light with Night Sight Video, as well as enhance your videos up to 8K with Video Boost.</p>
<p>AI integration takes the overall experience even further. For instance, there’s Gemini to make everyday tasks easier. It’s an efficient AI assistant that’s ready to help you with research, summarizing documents, creating content, getting reply suggestions, translations, and more – 24/7. Your purchase also includes a year of Google One AI Premium access, which includes Gemini Advanced and more tools, so you can unlock the full potential of your device. It typically costs $239, but here, it’s included for free.</p>



<p>Other cool smart features include “Add Me”, which makes it easy to add the photographer to group photos so no one is left out. It works by taking two shots (one of the group, and the other when the photographer has swapped places with someone) and merging them together into a single photo. Then there’s “Click to Search”, which lets you circle an image or text to perform a quick Google search.</p>
<p>The 128GB space in this version is roomy enough to house all your photos, videos, applications, and documents comfortably. Battery is another strong selling point, as a single charge offers over 24 hours of usage. What’s more, the Extreme Battery Saver extends that to up to 100 hours, making it perfect for off-road trips and power outages.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6874/">You can now upgrade for just $699, after a massive $400 discount. It’s a rare drop, so it’s best to snap it quickly before it expires.</a></p>

            <guid>1415983</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has revealed its plans for the future of ARC Raiders, and it looks like content will be dropping thick and fast. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The roadmap</a> details plans up until April 2026, but the first batch of updates falls under a mysterious title—Headwinds.</p>



<p>Substantial updates are what keep live-service titles like ARC Raiders alive and fresh, and the rust-belt has been pretty barren since Cold Snap ended. Well, new content is just around the corner, as Headwinds is set to soar into the game pretty soon.</p>







<p>Here’s when you can expect Headwinds to arrive in ARC Raiders, as well as what content has been confirmed for the update. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-headwinds-release-in-arc-raiders">When Does ‘Headwinds’ Release In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s looming on the horizon. Image by Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Headwinds update has been confirmed by Embark Studios to arrive in ARC Raiders on January 27, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>When the roadmap was initially revealed for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-arc-raiders-february-2026-content-map-update-raider-deck-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, it was fairly surprising to see a slate of content listed to arrive in January, as the month was practically over. However, Embark Studios clearly didn’t plan to partake in dry January, as new content is just around the corner. </p>



<p>Headwinds is expected to launch at the usual update times for ARC Raiders, but if you’re unfamiliar with those, Insider Gaming has them listed down below:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">ARC Raiders Headwinds Release Times &amp; Dates</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PST)</td><td data-align="center">1:30 AM—January 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">3:30 AM—January 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (EST)</td><td data-align="center">4:30 AM—January 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">9:30 AM—January 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">8:30 PM—January 27</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-all-headwinds-confirmed-content-for-arc-raiders">All ‘Headwinds’ Confirmed Content For ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Roll on April. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As announced within the roadmap, three new pieces of content can be expected to drop with the Headwinds update for ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>These are the following: </p>



<ul>
<li>New Matchmaking Option Level 40+</li>



<li>New Minor Map Condition</li>



<li>New Player Project</li>
</ul>



<p>As things stand, further details are scarce. The Player Project is bound to be another five-stage project filled with items you’ll need to submit in return for rewards, but the new Minor Map Condition and Matchmaking Option remain a mystery.</p>







<p>Early player theories are that the new Map Condition will be a sandstorm, as alluded to by the background image in the roadmap, as well as the Headwinds title. If this were the case, then the likelihood is that it’ll be exclusive to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-find-guitars-shakers-in-arc-raiders-buried-city-easter-egg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buried City</a>, and maybe <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hidden-bunker-arc-raiders-how-to-open-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spaceport</a>, as a sandstorm sweeping through The Blue Gate might be a bit far-fetched. </p>



<p>As for the new Matchmaking Option, it’s interesting that they highlight it’s for Level 40+ players. It might be in an effort to circumvent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-devs-will-implement-significant-changes-to-crack-down-on-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheaters</a>—who primarily use new, low-level accounts—from ruining the match experience for high-level players with valuable gear.</p>



<p>Should more information be announced before the Headwinds update, Insider Gaming will be sure to update this article with the latest details. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Code Vein 2 On Xbox Game Pass? Code Vein 2 Game Pass Status, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/code-vein-2-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>1415977</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Xbox Game Pass keeps receiving new games. With increased Game Pass costs, it begs the question of whether Code Vein 2 is coming to Xbox Game Pass to justify the cost, and if not, if it will ever happen.</p>



<p>Soulslike fans should be in for a good time with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/code-vein-2-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Vein 2</a>. There was plenty to enjoy from the genre in 2025 with Nightreign, The&nbsp;First&nbsp;Berserker:&nbsp;Khazan, and Wuchang: Fallen Feathers. Code Vein 2 is the first real Soulslike contender of 2026, and if it’s on Game Pass, it’s a win-win.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-code-vein-2-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Code Vein 2 On Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An unsuccessful ride. Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Xbox Game Pass isn’t adding Code Vein 2 as a launch-day game, meaning all players need to buy the game outright to own it and play.</strong></p>



<p>The pro of Xbox Game Pass is that you get a <em>lot</em> of free titles as part of your subscription. The bad news is that you only get a select variety of games. Also, even if you have the more expensive Xbox Game Pass Ultimate tier, your day-one release entitlement is limited, and it depends on any agreements between Microsoft and other publishers.</p>



<p>A quick check of the Xbox store shows that under Code Vein 2’s listing, there is nothing about Xbox Game Pass. There’s no Game Pass icon or mention, nor has it been referenced in any Code Vein 2 trailers. It hasn’t been outed by Bandai Namco, nor Microsoft or Xbox, so we can safely assume that it’s not on Xbox Game Pass, and it probably won’t be in the foreseeable future.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-code-vein-2-ever-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Code Vein 2 Ever Come To Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>This one has to be filed under ‘Unlikely,’ as the first Code Vein hasn’t even debuted on Xbox Game Pass at any point.</strong></p>



<p>Any sort of a sequel is great as it gives plenty of background data on previous entries in a series, and if they’ve ever been on Xbox Game Pass. The original Code Vein doesn’t appear to have been on Game Pass (but we’ll update this if it’s incorrect), making the case for Code Vein 2 on XGP quite bleak.</p>



<p>Like Code Vein 2 itself, it’s not impossible, and a Game Pass addition could be doable in the future. Stay tuned for further updates.</p>



<p>If you’ve heard anything different about Code Vein 2 being on Xbox Game Pass, or think you’ve seen it first on XGP, drop a comment via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Progress on the third chapter of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> trilogy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-are-making-great-progress-confirms-director">has been steady and smooth</a> so far, with the game having already reached a "playable" state <a href="https://www.polygon.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-queens-blood-interview/">according to game director Naoki Hamaguchi</a>. Now, we've received an update on its (still secret) title and what engine the team is using.</p>
<p>The news came via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-officially-has-a-title/1100-6537603/">GameSpot's latest interview</a> with the director, which was shared on 23rd January, right as Final Fantasy 7 Remake <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-still-excellent-on-xbox-and-switch-2-even-if-its-beginning-to-show-its-age">arrived on Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch 2</a> with excellent ports. Without getting into actual spoilers, the "Remake" label of these games goes beyond the traditional use of the word, as there's a meta narrative which has gradually reshaped the direction of the overall trilogy.</p>
<p>As a result, fan expectations since Rebirth's release was that Part 3's title would be in line with the previous two. No word on what the final name is yet, but Hamaguchi has now said "the title has been locked" following creative director (and OG FF7 veteran) Tetsuya Nomura making the final decision recently.</p>
<p>Another interesting tidbit which explains the threequel's fast-moving development comes from Hamaguchi confirming they've ultimately decided to use Unreal Engine 4 over UE5 after making "a lot of modifications to fit our needs." As impressive as UE5 can be when used properly, it's also led to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/unreal-engine-5-has-been-a-disappointment">several high-profile disappointments</a>, so it's not surprising to see one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s key teams playing things safe in the last stretch of this hugely ambitious trilogy. "It’s more beneficial to have something we’re already familiar with and have customized to fit our needs," he added.</p><p>This should also help with getting Rebirth and the as-yet-untitled third chapter running on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> following Remake's remarkable looks and stable performance. At this moment, the team has "gotten [Rebirth] to function" on Nintendo's still-infant hybrid console, but a release date won't be locked until more optimizations are done.</p>
<p>It's all quite impressive considering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Rebirth</a> launched less than two years ago and "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-final-fantasy-7-interview-part-3-hamaguchi">almost no documentation</a>" remains from the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>'s development, but in the age of the average AAA project taking around half a decade to finish (if we're lucky), Hamaguchi's team seems to have cracked the code with this daring three-part effort.</p>

<figure data-uuid="14d63d770966d"><a title="FF7 Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/14d63d770966d/ff7-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>So, the third entry in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> trilogy officially has a final title (or subtitle, as is more likely), according to an interview with director Naoki Hamaguchi over at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-officially-has-a-title/1100-6537603/">GameSpot</a>.</p>
<p>It's a pretty significant milestone, and as stated by Hamaguchi-san, the team had it down to two potential titles during Paris Games Week at the end of October 2025. He said that the final decision was ultimately up to creative director Tetsuya Nomura, who served as co-director on Remake alongside Hamaguchi and Motomu Toriyama.</p>
<p>Here's what Hamaguchi said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It was up to Mr. Nomura to decide which it is. And yes, after returning from Paris Games Week, he did choose one, so I can say the title has been locked."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine having such a crucial decision rest on your shoulders. The power!</p>
<p>Of course, this news has merely reignited our curiosity as to what the title will actually be. 'Reunion' certainly sounds plausible, but then that's already been used for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crisis_core_-final_fantasy_vii-_reunion">Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII- Reunion</a> and the recently-announced <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/life_is_strange_reunion">Life is Strange: Reunion</a>.</p>
<p>We're also not too sure when Square Enix will decide to fully reveal the game given that it will also need to coordinate the upcoming release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> on the Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S. Phew!</p>
<p>Still, that certainly won't stop us from speculating. So we've compiled a poll below with some possible (and not-so-possible) subtitles for the third entry, so go ahead and choose which one speaks to you the most. And if you have a completely different idea, then be sure to let us know with a comment.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/clive-barkers-undying-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod-out-now/</link>
            <guid>1415950</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The latest<strong> RTX Remix path tracing mod</strong> to be <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/clive-barkers-undying-rtx-remix-mod/addons/undying-rtx-remix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on ModDB</a> is dedicated to <strong>Clive Barker's Undying</strong>. The original game, an acclaimed first-person survival horror released by <strong>EA Los Angeles</strong> nearly twenty-five years ago, was made <strong>with the very first iteration of Epic's Unreal Engine</strong>.</p>



<p>With the power of NVIDIA RTX Remix, modder <strong>Pathtracedparadise</strong> heavily overhauled the visuals. Some of their work includes <strong>replacing more than a thousand of the original game's textures</strong> so far with high-resolution (2048x2048) PBR materials that have been upscaled with additional levels of detail added by running each texture multiple times through various Topaz Gigapixel models and then hand-edited as needed. The PBRFusion model was used to generate the PBR map via ComfyUI.</p>



<p>That said, <strong>this is still just an Alpha release</strong> of Clive Barker's Undying RTX Remix path tracing mod. The modder has so far focused on revamping the first couple of hours, as well as a few sections later in the game. The remainder of the game is playable, as lights were automatically placed throughout by a custom D3D9 renderer, but they are not placed in ideal locations and have not yet been adjusted to look good. Furthermore, there are other issues at the moment:</p>



<ul>
<li>Mirrors still need to be fixed</li>



<li>Portals do not animate</li>



<li>Skyboxes aren't rendering correctly</li>



<li>Only some of the Scrye reveals work </li>
</ul>



<p>If you still want to check out the mod (whose download is around <strong>10.5 GB</strong> at the moment) even at this early stage, you'll have to <strong><a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/undying-renewal1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first install the Undying Renewal mod</a></strong>, which adds proper widescreen support with more resolution options (up to 4K), quality of life improvements, controller support, multiplayer support, subtitles support, restores cut content, adds a Vulkan renderer for improved performance, reduces load times, and adds a functional in-game settings menu. </p>



<p>After that mod is installed, extract the files from the "Place contents in Undying System folder" folder to the System folder of your Clive Barker's Undying installation (for example, C:\GOG Games\Clive Barker's Undying\System), overriding any existing files. Then, <strong>you must run the game once to ensure the RTX Remix hooks are installed</strong> (you should see a message in the top-left corner of the screen and be able to access the RTX Remix menu by pressing Alt+X). Close the game, then open the System folder location (for example, C:\GOG Games\Clive Barker's Undying\System) and create an 'rtx-remix' folder within it. Extract the entire 'Undying RTX Mod' folder into this 'mods' folder. To adjust the Field of View (FOV) value, you'll have to edit it directly in the User.ini file.</p>

<p>Fans of Clive Barker's work <a href="https://wccftech.com/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival-gamescom-hands-on-preview-pleasure-and-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can look forward to the new <strong>Hellraiser: Revival</strong> game</a>, in development at <strong>Saber Interactive</strong> and scheduled for release this year.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s shift from early access to full release came with heap of tweaks and changes as Larian finalised their huge <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>. Naturally, this meant certain bits or plans not making it into the final cut, and if you've come to long for any of those after playing them initially or hearing about them, then odds are a new mod is right up your alley. It's also really cool if you, you know, just want more BG3.</p>

<p>The mod's '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16830?tab=description">Early Access Scenes Restored</a>' by modding whiz HyperspaceTowel, who's been working on restoring <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/17511">bits</a> of early access Baldur's Gate 3 for a little while now. This latest creation's the culmation of all that effort, delivering a bunch of restored "deleted scenes, encounters, and NPCs" in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>According to the modder, that's "over 100 conversations and more than 1000 lines of voiced dialogue" so far, with plans to keep adding more going forwards. Making that up are the likes of chats with resurrected early access characters, camp chats, and companion reactions to the various stuff you get up to. HyperspaceTowel explains that most of these returning bits were a case of bringing back an early access scene as "pretty much a 1:1 transplant" with minor camera or dialogue tweaks, though there were some that had to be "built from the ground up based on the scraps I could find".</p>

<p>The modder cites shell-collecting kid Lotan, whose reconstructed chat's shown in the video above, as an example of the latter. Among the other revived NPCs or chats you can expect to run into include would-be music box seller <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um9-w9ovbn8">Nerela</a>, some enthralled fishermen, Shadowheart issuing an ultimatum, and Gale channeling his best Nigella Lawson as he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiSvKArS4ac&amp;t=3s">yacks about his deer stew</a>.</p><p>HyperspaceTowel's opted to stick to including bits of early access BG3 which fit into the final version of the game, which means the likes of early Wyll and Karlach - plus some romance scenes featuring Gale and the former - have been left to go into another mod or mods which'll keep non-can stuff separate. They've also opted to keep separate a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/20098">freshly restored quest</a> surrounding whether or not to chow down on a hermit crab. The reason in that case looks primarily to be the fact the files it's been restored from are very old, so some of the dialogue lacks voice files.</p>
<p>If you fancy seeing what these restored early access encounters add to your next BG3 playthrough, the good news is that the main restoration mod appears not to require any other framework mods to work. However, you will want to make sure you kick off a new run once you've installed it and avoid ditching it midway through a playthrough you plan to finish.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-millennium-falcon-is-back-at-a-record-low-in-another-clearance-move-on-amazon-not-the-official-store-2000662800</link>
            <guid>1415944</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are deals, and then there are deals that make you say “This is the way.” (It’s OK to mix metaphors in a galaxy far, far away.) Right now, LEGO’s Star Wars Millennium Falcon has been restocked at Amazon after a heavy-duty holiday selling burst and it’s arrived in 2026 in one of those rare price windows where it’s genuinely worth firing up the hyperdrive and snagging it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">The Amazon limited-time deal for the 25th Anniversary LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon set is going for $68, 20% off its usual price.</a> That might sound like pocket change compared to what some of us drop on boxed trilogy marathons or obscure action figures, but when a set that’s this beloved dips below its typical tag, it’s actually worth paying attention.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Grown-Up LEGO Fun</h2>
<p data-start="855" data-end="1359">Now before you go imagining the 7,500-plus-piece Ultimate Collector Series starship that’s the size of a studio apartment and costs about a much — let’s be super clear: This is the smaller 25th Anniversary edition 921-piece Millennium Falcon that’s been popping up in deals lately. That said, 921 pieces is still plenty of bricks to keep your fingers busy and your inner kid grinning ear to ear, and this version comes with a display stand so you aren’t sacrificing precious shelf real estate to chaos.</p>
<p data-start="1361" data-end="1855">This isn’t one of those microfighters you flick at your coffee table. It’s the kind of model that earns a place of prominent display as a collector’s item and conversation piece, and not in a heap of other half-wrecked LEGO sets after a pretend battle. Kids probably <em data-start="1649" data-end="1654">can</em> build it, but this adult-oriented set feels more like a collectible for anyone who’s ever whispered “She’s faster than she looks” at a spaceship dangling from a peg at a toy store.</p>


<h2 data-start="1361" data-end="1855">Use the Force</h2>
<p data-start="1857" data-end="2195">LEGO Star Wars sets — even ones that aren’t giant — don’t linger on sale for long. They’re the kind of things that disappear off retailer sites faster than the Falcon makes the Kessel Run. When the price drops to a fresh low and stock comes back, it’s usually fleeting.</p>
<p data-start="2197" data-end="2503">So if you’ve been on the fence about adding this to your collection, now’s the time to decide. Whether it’s for a gift, a weekend build sesh, or a new centerpiece atop your entertainment center, a 20% drop on a fan-favorite set isn’t something that happens every week. See it while you can, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">while it’s still on sale at Amazon for just $68 — because once it sells out again, there’s no guaranteeing when it’ll be back.</a></p>

<p>A new mention of Starfield 2.0 is leading fans to believe the update is real; however, there’s still no word on when it might be released. </p>



<p>We have heard about Starfield getting a new update and a DLC several times back in 2025, without a concrete release date. We have seen Bethesda mention it for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-next-starfield-dlc-still-cant-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third time</a> some months ago, and we also saw a tease with the words ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terran-armada-bethesda-starfield-anniversary-post/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terran Armada</a>‘ in an anniversary post; however, no concrete details have been shared. </p>







<h2 id="h-bethesda-is-handling-starfield-2-0-in-a-weird-way">Bethesda is Handling Starfield 2.0 in a ‘Weird’ Way</h2>



<p>The latest mention of Starfield 2.0 comes from the popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXqlxb0a6xk&amp;t=8136s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defining Duke Podcast</a>, with co-host MrMattyPlays, who claims he saw it behind closed doors. When talking about Starfield 2.0’s upcoming update with guest Gene Part, Matty started by saying, “The way Bethesda is handling 2.0 (Starfield 2.0) is weird.” </p>



<p>Matty confirmed that he saw it “behind closed doors”, but he can’t say anything else other than the fact that he saw it. He also confirmed that he wasn’t provided a release window. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-starfield-2-0">What to Expect from Starfield 2.0?</h2>



<p>Though no concrete details have been revealed about Starfield 2.0, some information has been shared in a previous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2026-update-rumoured-to-bring-quicker-space-flights-ps5-switch-2-ports-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>. It seems the game’s spaceflight mechanics will step away from loading screens for “more free-form and continuous” traversal, and the Creation System has also been enhanced for better spaceflight and future-proofed for upcoming titles. </p>



<p>Additionally, the Starfield 2.0 update will bring the long-anticipated PS5 and Switch 2 ports, with the developers optimising the title for “low power” devices like handhelds. Some sources have also shared that it won’t be on par with Cyberpunk 2.0. However, readers should treat this info with caution as it hasn’t been officially confirmed. </p>

            <guid>1415938</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite’s collab with South Park continues, with the stars of the show dishing out a bunch of tasks to tick off to earn rewards, but understanding Kenny’s quests is a tough task.</p>



<p>There are no direct instructions to complete Kenny’s quests in Fortnite, so you will be shooting in the dark unless you know exactly what is being asked of you.</p>



<p>To make the task much easier, Insider Gaming has all the details on exactly what you need to do to work your way through Kenny’s tasks in Fortnite before they expire.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-fortnite-kenny-quests">All Fortnite Kenny Quests</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Tick them off. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Kenny’s quests in Fortnite shouldn’t take too much difficulty to complete, once you know what they are, as they can mostly be ticked off by general gameplay.</strong></p>



<p>The tricky aspect comes from the fact that you need a translator to understand what Kenny is tasking you to do as, just like in South Park itself, it’s difficult to understand exactly what he is saying.</p>



<p>Like the other South Park quests, completing these tasks provides CRED and Memberberries to advance the Born in Chaos mini pass. However, they won’t appear or be completable until you complete four of the Cartman quests. If you haven’t completed the stages before that, there’s a fair bit of grinding ahead of you.</p>



<p>A full list of the quests is shown in the table below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Fortnite Kenny Quest</th><th data-align="center">How to Complete</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Mph mpphmmph</td><td data-align="center">Visit the zipline tower in Battlewood Boulevard</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mmmmpmpph mmhhmph</td><td data-align="center">Get Eliminated</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mph mpmphh mmmph</td><td data-align="center">Get revived by teammeates three times</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mphmmph mhhmmph</td><td data-align="center">Get 10 Headshots</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mmmh mpphh mmmph</td><td data-align="center">Travel 200m in the air</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mph mpph mhppmmph</td><td data-align="center">Hire a Specialist</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-when-do-kenny-s-quests-in-fortnite-expire">When do Kenny’s Quests in Fortnite expire?</h2>



<p><strong>Kenny’s quests will remain available in Fortnite until the end of the South Park collab on February 6.</strong></p>



<p>That gives players plenty of time to tick off all of the tasks and claim all of the rewards before they disappear, though, if you do miss out, the items could return to the Item Shop in the future.</p>



<p>Kenny’s quests are not the final batch coming to Fortnite before the end of the collab, either, as Part 6 will arrive on January 29, providing more tasks to complete.</p>

            <p>Mawning all and happy new week to the sickos who celebrate the return of Monday. It’s time for another helping of cosmic despair as we slide irresistibly down the Gullet of Entropy, pawing in vain at the Tonsils of Hubris. Also, some new PC game releases. Maybe save your pennies for Wednesday and Thursday, which are uncommonly rammed. </p><!--more-->
<h2>Monday 26th January</h2>
<ul>
<li>It’s time for John Highguard to guard high in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/">Highguard</a>, the Keighley-anointed sci-fantasy raid shooter that has attracted more critical writing pre-release than most games get in total by virtue of 1) it being made by former Apex Legends and Titanfall devs 2) nobody knowing a goddamn thing about how it plays</li>
<li>Oh no, John Highguard has been sucked into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2319730/Winnies_Hole/">Winnie’s Hole</a> (early access), this being a frightful cosmic horror roguelite based on the hitherto-cuddly A.A. Milne character. Battle through the Hundred Acre Forest as Winnie while mutating his insides using block-shaped viruses. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 27th January</h2>
<ul>
<li>For many years now, people have been trying to make ‘Minecraft survival with airships’ a thing, and failing. I don’t understand why it hasn’t caught on. I love airships. Anyway here’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2644050/Echoes_of_Elysium/">Echoes Of Elysium</a>, launching into early access with six player co-op and a “vast procedural clockwork world”.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 28th January</h2>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2612690/Roots_Devour/">Roots Devour</a> you are the absolute worst tree. Extend your tendrils through the forest, drinking the blood of non-sylvan lifeforms and deciding whether to merely witness or prey upon a furtive population of humans.</li>
<li>DON’T LET THEM IN unless they genuinely just want to buy pasta and chips in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3762550/HELLMART/">Hellmart</a> - a horror game about being a supermarket clerk, in which smiling customers are to be regarded with suspicion.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3278310/LANESPLIT/">Lanesplit</a> is a glossy first-person biking sim by twilight with a touch of the Nicolas Winding Refns.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2708880/Ghost_Keeper/">Ghost Keeper</a> (early access) appears to be a new version of polterzeitgeisty Sims parody Ghost Master. Set up a houseful of haunts without getting exorcised.</li>
<li>Seek out a mysterious signal at the heart of post-apocalyptic Antarctica in slightly Funko Pop-esque survive-o-wander <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2054310/Nova_Antarctica/">Nova Antarctica</a>. You'd think vanilla Antarctica was already apocalyptic enough, but they had to go the extra thousand miles.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 29th January</h2>
<ul>
<li>There have been over 30 Resident Evils and we’ve still yet to kill all the videogame zombies. Here to finish the job, maybe, is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2795540/The_Midnight_Walkers/">The Midnight Walkers</a> (early access), a first-person extraction shooter set in a megamall with a timed poison gas system.</li>

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3642000/Space_Warlord_Baby_Trading_Simulator/">Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</a> is the self-explanatory sequel to/escalation of Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/">Cairn</a> is a thoughtful, heavily-laden climbing adventure from the makers of Furi and Haven.</li>

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2610650/Dont_Stop_Girlypop/">Don’t Stop, Girlypop</a> is a Y2K arena shooter with sherbet in its veins, a crystal flip phone in one hand, and some kind of pink chrome lipstick launcher in the other.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2362060/CODE_VEIN_II/">Code Vein 2</a> is Bandai Namco’s latest anime Soulslike with a time-travelling, fix-the-past-to-save-the-NPC premise and some crackpot character designs and outfits. There is a bell-waving octopus gunship and your sidekick’s corset is an X-ray screen. Discuss.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 30th January</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397300/Half_Sword/">Half Sword</a> (early access) is a grimdaft physics-based medieval combat game in which you swing by moving the mouse. Expect much clanging and some entrails.</li>
<li>It’s time for a remake of turn-based mech bonanza <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3795900/FRONT_MISSION_3_Remake/">Front Mission 3</a>. Ah, I remember playing this briefly on PS1. I think I was lured away from it by Alundra 2, in the end.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question for the comments thread: how do I stop Steam game pages autoplaying trailers when shuffling the top media display? It routinely scares the pants off me when I have several tabs open. Some day, Gabe Newell will pay for his crimes. In the shorter term, the RPS team are spending this week thinking about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic">Deep Rock Galactic</a>, Yakuza, Arknights Endfield and various secret things.</p><p>What are you up to? Nothing good, I hope. Let us know if there's a recommendation-worthy game we've skipped. I left a few out because I'm utterly aghast at your apathy on this front. Don't let me tell you what to like. Show me you have guts and a little spine! Not like the lady in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/code-vein">Code Vein</a> 2, though.</p>

<p>Your Code Vein 2 efforts will be in vain without knowing the Code Vein 2 trophy list. Imagine getting all the way through the game and not knowing a crucial piece of information or encountering a missable trophy? The game’s trophies and achievements will test you.</p>



<p>Finishing a Soulslike deserves a physical trophy in itself. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/code-vein-2-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Vein 2</a> isn’t going to be easy, and anyone could tell you that, judging from the first game and what was shown before launch. In addition to the relentless difficulty and dastardly obstacles Bandai throws at you, there are plenty of extra things to do through trophies and achievements.</p>

<p><strong>The Code Vein 2 trophy list is split up into two lists: Visible trophies from the beginning, and a list of hidden achievements with story-spoiler implications.</strong></p>



<p>To start, here’s a full look at the 18 trophies and achievements the developer wants you to see from the beginning.</p>



<p>If you choose, you can read on for the remaining hidden Code Vein 2 trophies and achievements after.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Nothing to worry about, right? Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You can find 36 trophies and achievements to earn throughout your Code Vein 2 journey, with Xbox owners only getting 35, due to the PlayStation’s Platinum Trophy counting as extra.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not an exhausting amount from the outside. However, the reality is that bosses, exploration, and upgrading abilities and items to the maximum is going to take time. Make sure you’ve got plenty of free time for this one!</p>



<p>What do you make of the Code Vein 2 trophy list? How does it compare to the original Code Vein’s list? Let everyone know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

So, while other titles are expected, Undisputed will be February's main addition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Undisputed is expected to become available on February 3, for PlayStation Plus subscribers across all tiers from Essential upwards.

Still, the fluidity of its gameplay animations and reactiveness of its commentators don’t come close to living up to the high bar that was set by the Fight Night series back in the late 2000s, and its realistic fighting can be a little dull if you’re in the mood for a KO instead of a TKO."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>Ashly Burch, who voiced Chloe Price in the first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> game, says her character and that of Max Caulfield will "always have a special place" in her heart, despite the actress not returning to the series.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> and Deck Nine lifted the lid on the next series entry, Life is Strange: Reunion. Reunion is billed as the "thrilling finale to the Max and Chloe saga", which began over 10 years ago with the eponymous Life is Strange.</p>

<p>Since Life is Strange's original story from 2015, the character of Chloe has appeared twice more: once in 2017's prequel Before the Storm, and again in Reunion, which is set to debut later this year. However, unlike the original, Chloe in these two games is voiced not by Burch, but by Rhianna DeVries.</p>
<p>Now, speaking with Eurogamer following Reunion's reveal, Burch says she doesn't "know a lot about this project", but regardless, Max and Chloe's characters still mean a great deal to her, and there is no doubt that they always will.</p>
<p>"I wasn't asked to reprise my role as Chloe, so I'm learning about Reunion at the same time as the fans," Burch tells me, before adding she is "grateful people still care so much about these characters".</p>
<p>Closing, Burch says: "Max and Chloe will always have a special place in my heart."</p>

<p>As well as Life is Strange, Burch has also lent her talents to a myriad of other projects across games, films and TV. This includes Borderlands' Tiny Tina, The Last of Us Part 2's Mel, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-developer-replacing-all-actors-with-robots-not-going-to-happen-says-aloy-voice-actress">Aloy in PlayStation's Horizon series</a>, and many more. In addition, Burch is the creator of the YouTube series I'm Happy You're Here, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ashly-burch-gets-into-bed-with-puppets-to-talk-about-mental-health">which she describes as "like Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, but for adults"</a>, about the many mental health hurdles we face today.</p>
<p>As for the Life is Strange series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-reunion-will-be-the-thrilling-finale-to-the-max-and-chloe-saga-coming-march">Reunion is set to arrive on 26th March</a>, across Xbox Series X/S, PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <p>Work on Banjo: Recompiled, a PC port of the iconic N64 platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>, had been <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-decompilation-project-for-banjo-kazooie-is-now-100-complete.968472/">advancing in the background</a> for a while now, but no one was expecting a shadow drop. That's happened now, and we're impressed by the full list of features.</p>
<p>Wiseguy, a modder who'd already worked (alongside a team) on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIp7C2ro2T8">Zelda 64: Recompiled</a>, an adaptation for PC of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask">Majora's Mask</a>, shared the trailer on 24th January via his own YouTube channel:</p>

<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Banjo: Recompiled Release Trailer (Banjo-Kazooie PC Port!)" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0906Cz-59eU?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">
<span>Banjo: Recompiled Release Trailer (Banjo-Kazooie PC Port!)</span>
<template>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0906Cz-59eU?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0906Cz-59eU?autoplay=1" title="Banjo: Recompiled Release Trailer (Banjo-Kazooie PC Port!)">
</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0906Cz-59eU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>The nearly-four-minute look at the ambitious port isn't just a gameplay reel, as custom scenes and text boxes in the style of the classic game tell both veterans and curious newcomers about all the new features (and even a few surprises) added to this <a href="https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp">N64: Recompiled</a>-based version of the game.</p><p>In humorous and colourful fashion, we're told about high framerate support (60, 120, and "whatever FPS you want") and even adjustments for ultrawide monitors. Moreover, the custom options menu is full of settings for general, graphics, controls, and more. It really achieves the feeling of an official port or traditional remaster, alternative control schemes included.</p>
<p>The most surprising reveal comes with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom">Doom</a>-themed puzzle that confirms full mod and custom level support. New content will supposedly be easy to make and throw into Banjo: Recompiled for those with the right tools and knowledge, so expect more on that front fast. "We're getting one step closer to a community made Banjo-Threeie," one comment under the trailer says. Looking at <a href="https://www.slipseer.com/index.php?resources/quake-brutalist-jam-iii.549/">other ambitious projects</a> born out of preservation efforts, that's entirely possible.</p>
<p>Banjo: Recompiled also works out of the box on Windows, Linux (also SteamOS), and Mac. You can grab it <a href="https://github.com/BanjoRecomp/BanjoRecomp">here</a>, but you'll need a "copy of the North American 1.0 version of the game" that's been previously dumped from a cart you own, as the port loads the assets from the original game release.</p>

<p>This comes via key financial data (thanks, <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/19438-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-sales-numbers-1-million-copies">RPG Site</a>) in which Age of Imprisonment is listed with a note stating 'Over 1 million copies sold worldwide' when translated.

<p>The game launched on <strong>6th November 2025</strong> exclusively for the Switch 2 and tells the story of the Imprisoning War referenced in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>. It still has a little ways to go to surpass <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> on Switch at 4 million copies sold (at least!), but we have to keep in mind the much larger install base of the Switch compared to Switch 2.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2siyhrw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Overall, it's a great start for the game, and it thoroughly deserves to see sustained success.</p>
<p>Plans to make Age of Imprisonment <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/lets-make-it-nintendo-and-koei-tecmo-on-the-genesis-of-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">came to fruition quickly</a> for Koei Tecmo and Nintendo, with producer Yosuke Hayashi pitching the idea after playing Tears of the Kingdom during the weekend immediately after launch.</p>
<p>We gave the game a score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">9/10 in our review</a> and called it the "best entry in this spin-off franchise to date".</p>
