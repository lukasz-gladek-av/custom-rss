            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/12/24197221/apex-legends-battle-pass-incorrect-esports-payments<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Apex Legends</em> can’t seem to catch a break. The game has been plagued with a pair of high-profile issues for the last few weeks.</p><p>First up, earlier this week, the hero shooter’s developer, Respawn Entertainment, announced <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/battle-pass-update">it was retooling the game’s battle pass</a>. For season 22 and beyond, the battle pass will now be split into two halves, with 60 levels for each half. Additionally, players will no longer be able to purchase a battle pass with AC or <em>Apex</em>’s in-game currency. “The decision to move from AC to real world currency is not one that we made lightly, but it does allow us to decrease the price of Premium+ for our community,” the announcement read.</p><p>Players responded negatively to the changes, accusing Respawn and publisher EA of nickel-and-diming its customers. Respawn touts that the new system is a way to “increase value” for players. But eliminating the ability to pay for the battle pass with currency earned in-game (previously, players could earn enough coins by completing the battle pass progression to purchase another one without spending more real money) is seen by many as a way for the studio to squeeze more money out of a dwindling player base. The backlash progressed to the point where players <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/battle-royale/apex-legends-gets-the-ol-steam-review-bomb-treatment/">began review-bombing the game on Steam</a>, taking its former, mostly positive rating down to mostly negative. </p><p>On the esports side, <em>Apex Legends</em> suffered another embarrassment as players participating in the <em>Apex Legends</em> Global Series tournament <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24196854/apex-legends-global-series-agls-pro-league-wrong-prize-payment">reported incorrect payments to their accounts</a>. One player received $100,000 in their account after only a few days of play. Other players reported similar erroneous payments totaling either too much or too little. The tournament’s organizer, ESL Faceit, took responsibility, calling it a “systems error” that resulted in incorrect payments. In a statement to <em>Polygon</em> a spokesperson for the tournament wrote, “As the partner responsible for prize fulfillment, we’re working to quickly resolve this issue and ensure that all players receive the correct prize payouts.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Playing as the eponymous character, you find yourself in Heaven, only you’re an assassin-for-hire helping to clean out all the demons in the lower levels of the kingdom of God. In order to do so, you and the other Neons—sinners plucked from Hell to earn a spot in Heaven for killing the most demons—must use Soul Cards scattered around nearly 100 levels to exorcize the demons and get to the bottom of what the hell is exactly going on.<br></p><p>This premise sets <em>Neon White</em>, a speedrunning first-person shooter, into motion. However, it’s even more complicated and fascinating than that. Soul Cards basically function as stand-ins for guns, and each has a set number of uses, as well as an alternate ability if they are discarded. For example, the pistol is a card called Elevate, because discarding it gives you an extra jump. An SMG can be discarded in order to do a ground pound, and discarding a shotgun propels you forward as a fireball. Eventually, levels become so multi-tiered, not to mention replete with mixtures of these cards, that it stops feeling like a shooter and much more like the wildest 3D platformer with the slickest movement mechanics.<br></p><p>If that sounds involved, that’s because it is, and it’s only one facet of a busy, <em>busy </em>game. <em>Neon White </em>also doubles as a visual novel with dating sim elements, including hunting down gifts to give to characters around the hub area, which unlocks personal side quests and missions themed for the character’s personality. This is how you get to know the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/neon-white-steam-reviews-pc-overwhelmingly-positive-1849089380&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/neon-white-steam-reviews-pc-overwhelmingly-positive-1849089380">exceptionally horny</a></span> cast of <em>Neon White</em>, which is composed of other Neons who White seems to know from his days in the world of the living. Among them is Neon Green, who serves as the game’s primary antagonist, the bro-ish himbo Neon Yellow, your incredibly sultry ex Neon Red, and Neon Violet, the poster child of DDLG relationship dynamics. No, I will not spell that out for you, that’s between you, God, and your Google search bar.</p><p>In tandem, it all makes for a game that is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/neon-white-fps-platformer-puzzle-speedrun-dating-sim-sw-1849107271&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/neon-white-fps-platformer-puzzle-speedrun-dating-sim-sw-1849107271"><em>delightfully</em> all over the place</a></span>. One moment you’re pulling the sickest shit in some level to try and get the best time possible—maybe even trying to outrank your friends on <em>Neon White</em>’s leaderboards—and the next you’re in a fan-service anime beach episode with Neon Red and Violet, complete with artwork of them in bathing suits. One second you’re in a life-or-death boss battle, and the very next you could be in a scene where White is canonically belting My Chemical Romance’s “Welcome To The Black Parade” at a karaoke bar in Heaven of all places.</p><p>All of this is set to one of the coolest electronic soundtracks composed by the duo Machine Girl, and did I mention that White is voiced by Steven Blum, the voice of <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>’s Spike Spiegel? So many aspects of <em>Neon White</em> feel wrapped up in this fevered Y2K aesthetic, which extends to many of the characters designs and direction, as well as its broader cringe-inducing tone. My advice? It <em>wants </em>to be that corny, so steer into the skid rather than fight it. You’ll enjoy the game so much more this way.</p><p>What are you waiting for? What part of all that <em>didn’t </em>sell you on the most buckwild game you’ll pick up on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866">Game Pass</a></span> all year? You have shootouts in Heaven alongside busty assassins who may or may not kill you. What else could you want out of a game, or art for that matter?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Thirteen years after it released, Terraria has reached another major sales milestone. In a new State of the Game post on its <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-state-of-the-game-june-2024.136658/#community" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official forum</a>, it was announced that Terraria has sold over 58 million copies in its life span.</p>



<p>To be more specific, 58.7 million copies have been sold of the game. Roughly 32 million of those sales come from the PC version of the game.</p>



<p>“Once again, we are beyond humbled and thankful for your continued support – it is the force that drives us every day to make even more awesome Terraria experiences,” developer Re-Logic said. “I wonder what might happen when we get to sixty million…”</p>



<p>Reaching nearly 60 million copies sold of any game is a major accomplishment. That puts it ahead of games like Overwatch, The Witcher 3,  Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and more. </p>



<p>Re-Logic has announced plans for Terraria 2. However, information on the game has been limited aside from the plans to have it built on new engine.</p>

Set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, the Imperial forces are at the peak of their powers and naturally will serve as an enemy faction. But more integral to the Outlaws experience are the crime syndicates that Kay will encounter and the scum and villainy that comes with them. Dotted throughout the galaxy, each has its own stories to tell and – more importantly – can be used to Kay’s benefit when you see fit thanks to Outlaw’s reputation system.</p><p>“Across all of [the syndicates], there are fierce rivalries that Kay is going to have to navigate,” explains narrative director Navid Khavari. “And the player's going to have to engage with the reputation system in order to get what she wants.” </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/jabba-palace-1720787600965.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>You're going to be hanging out in a lot of places like this in Star Wars Outlaws.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“You're not friends, you're not employed, you're not pledging allegiance, you are someone surviving and trying to grow a name [and a] reputation in this world,” adds Mathias Karlson, Outlaws’ game director.  “Think of them as a little bit of a means to an end. What do they have to offer and what do I need and want right now?”. We’ve delved deeper into the gameplay impact of the reputation system (and how you can manipulate the syndicates) earlier in this month’s Star Wars Outlaws IGN First. But, who are these syndicates? We talked to members of the development team at Massive Entertainment to learn about the visual design of each and their place in the world of Star Wars Outlaws.</p><h2>The Hutt Cartel</h2><p>Perhaps the most well-known of the Star Wars criminal syndicates, The Hutts are led by everybody’s favourite giant slug man Jabba the Hutt. Flanked by Bib Fortuna, Salacious Crumb, and other hilariously named cronies, they first appeared in 1983’s Return of the Jedi as the crime lords of Tatooine. Straightforward and not afraid to dispatch with anyone who plays games with them, they love galactic credits and the power they bring.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/star-wars-jabba-1720777448322.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>This guy needs no introduction.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“The idea with the Hutts is really what you see is what you get,” states Khavari. “They aren't afraid to use force, they take what they want and they're just incredibly powerful.”.</p><p>“Jabba the Hutt is a very famous character in the Star Wars galaxy and so the Hutt Syndicate is definitely inspired by [what you’ve seen before]”, explains Marthe Jonkers, associate art director at Massive.” So you will see enforcers and you'll see characters from the movies as well, Gamorian guards for example.” </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/han-solo-carbonite-1720786998321.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>You don't want to cross the Hutts, otherwise...</figcaption></figure></output><p>“Their look is definitely Tatooine-inspired,” Jonkers says. “I think it's interesting to say that the Hutts have probably the most dirt and wear and tear on their clothing of all the syndicates.”</p><p>But while the Hutts are based on Tatooine, Jonkers says that “you will find them in different locations as well All the syndicates have power that goes beyond the planet where they're from.”</p><h2>Pyke Syndicate</h2><p>The Pyke Syndicate will be a recognisable name to anyone who watched The Book of Boba Fett or Star Wars: The Clone Wars TV series, but don’t expect them to look exactly like how you remember.</p><p>“They have a very distinctive look”, says Jonkers. “They are Pykes, but they're different from the Pykes you've seen in different shows. We really went in a different direction with color palettes. So they have a lot more dark blues, but also we went really into more of a graphic design for them. So you will see on the helmets and the clothing they wear, they have different patterns which will show which rank they are or which group they belong to. They're not as organized I would say as a military group, but they do have different units that have different weapons, for example, different skills, and you will see a distinction in that.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/outlaws-screen-toshara-8f599f4b-1720777517192.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>You'll find the Pykes in many places, including the moon of Toshara.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Through spice production and trading, the Pykes amassed a fortune from their home world of Oba Diah. But by the time of Outlaws, the syndicate finds itself spread out throughout the galaxy, including an operation on the freshly created Moon of Toshara.</p><p>“The Pike Syndicate is incredibly wealthy and powerful in this time period”, says Khavari. “And we sort of center around their underboss, Gorak, who is very much in charge of Pike operations on the moon of Toshara. And so while that is under Imperial control, just like the rest of the galaxy, we get to see the corrupt side of that because the Pykes have worked out a deal with the Empire there, where they get to do what they need to do and the Empire always gets its cut.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/pike-syndicate-1720787499108.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Gorak is the leader of the Pike syndicate.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Fuelled by an unrelenting desire to turn profits, no matter what moral lines may need to be crossed, the Pykes’ love of luxury and all things shiny is best demonstrated in the appearance of Gorak.</p><p>“We really wanted him to look very much like the boss,” explains Jonkers. “So he's much bigger than the regular Pyke characters that you will meet. [...] He's definitely not the one who fights. He's the one who tells people what to do. He has also a lot of jewelry. He's very rich. We really wanted to tell a story just by seeing, you definitely see that Gorak is the leader.”</p><h2><strong>Crimson Dawn</strong></h2><p>As more Star Wars stories are written, the more important Crimson Dawn’s influence in the galaxy appears to grow. Led by Lady Qi’ra, Emilia Clarke’s character from Solo: A Star Wars Story, Crimson Dawn is the syndicate responsible for auctioning off Han Solo’s frozen carbonite wall decoration in the comic books – a prize won by Jabba and the Hutts, who outbid the Pyke Syndicate.</p><p>A mysterious organisation operating in the shadows of power, many of Crimson Dawn’s intentions remain shrouded when it comes to Outlaws’ story. Khavari gives us some hints, however, noting that the syndicate is “really focused on intelligence spreading” and “aligning a little bit with [the] wider network” of organised criminals.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/sw-outlaws-gameplay-gallery-crimson-dawn-0e8cdd59-1720777580403.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Crimson Dawn is the crime syndicate that auctioned off Han Solo frozen in Carbonite.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“Crimson Dawn, especially if you look at some of the wider media, is up to something very, very interesting that I'll leave to others to explore and dive into,” he notes. “But this period is very, very important in terms of the character Lady Qi’ra.”</p><p>The shadowy nature of the group is reflected in their visual design, allowing them to blend into any location they might find themselves in but also place their stamp when they want to make their presence known.</p><p>“You'll be able to meet them in certain places and it's not always necessarily a place that's entirely theirs,” says Jonkers “Maybe they took over someplace. Now you can see certain elements of them on top of something that used to be something else”</p><p>“They're more fashionable, I would say, compared to the other syndicates, and we try to translate that as well in their clothing,” she explains. “The clothing is very practical but very clean as well, cleaner than any of the other syndicates really to show that they have access to better materials and it's maybe also part of their style.”</p><h2>Ashiga Clan</h2><p>The Ashiga Clan is a new syndicate created by Massive in collaboration with LucasFilm, and can be found on the freezing planet of Kijimi – one of five playable planets and moons in Star Wars Outlaws and last seen in The Rise of Skywalker. Although brand new when it comes to Star Wars canon, those more knowledgeable about the galaxy far, far away might be familiar with the alien species they hail from.</p><p>“They're completely new, but we did use an existing species called the Melitto for the Ashiga clan, and there are many different aspects of them,” Jonkers explains. “They don't have eyes, so they use different senses and that was really interesting to design a whole syndicate that doesn't use eyesight. So all of their designs have a lot of tactile elements.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/outlaws-screen-kijimi-syndicate-e4c48c87-1720777616349.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Kijimii, like the Ashiga clan itself, is inspired by Samurai movies.</figcaption></figure></output><p>They're based on Kijimii, so in the areas they control, you can see these lines on the floor, that's sort of their way of navigating [...] they're feeling around almost where to go.</p><p>Their style [is] really connected to Kijimi City. We wanted to show that they've been there for a long time. So the city itself influenced their look as well. And as Kijimi City is heavily inspired by samurai movies and has a lot of these Japanese influences, we use these same sources of inspiration for the Ashiga Clan as well. And you will see that in their silhouettes [which] have a lot of references to samurai armor or kimono type of clothing.”</p><p>The insect-like nature of the Melitto race not only provided some interesting visual challenges for the team, but also influenced how the syndicate is structured, and what its goals include. Whereas others such as the Pykes, Hutts, and Crimson Dawn value money, power, and information as ways to grow their influence, The Ashiga Clan is much more focused on itself and its small pocket of the galaxy.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Ashiga Clan can be found on the freezing planet of Kijimi – one of five playable planets and moons in Star Wars Outlaws</p></div><p>“The Ashiga Clan are really interesting because they follow this very strict hierarchical structure”, Kavari tells us. “Every single member of the clan is serving the wider group under the control of Queen Ashiga, more than any other syndicate where you might have some characters and some subordinates off to their own devices. In The Ashiga Clan, it's serving the Queen. And that's it. And that gave a really fascinating dynamic.”</p><p>“They have a strict code of honor,” adds Jonkers. “They're very like a hive mind, and they have one very powerful queen who is in charge. So there are definitely references to that as well in the way they organize their locations, for example, which will remind you a little bit more of an ant hill.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The Ashiga clan is really trying to keep control over Kijimi, which is a very important city, and trying to really get their revenue through that. And they're also a syndicate that you will maybe encounter less in different locations because they're so connected to the city. So it's really their power over the city that gives them their meaning.”</p><h2>Zerek Besh</h2><p>Sitting outside of the reputation system is the Zerek Besh, a mysterious syndicate that serves as Outlaws’ primary antagonist. Where you will be able to interact with the other four crime gangs and forge/break bonds of your choosing as the story progresses, the Zerek Besh serves more as a distant, looming threat. They are run Sliro, a man who has placed a “death mark” on Kay at the beginning of her story, forcing her to go on the run. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/zerek-besh-1720786909561.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Zerek Besh are the primary antagonists you'll face in Star Wars Outlaws.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“It's an incredibly wealthy organization,” says Navari about the Zerek Besh. “They have their own plans and are more of a new player to the galaxy and the syndicates. We very much wanted to treat them like they were the new player on the block. So for Kay, she's really on the run from them, and from Sliro. They are actively hunting her down and she's using the other syndicates to kind of get what she needs to pull off a heist that's going to secure her freedom from them.”</p><p>A deadly group not meant to be messed with, the Zerek Besh needed an ominous appearance to match, something that Jonkers and the team have worked hard on: “I mean, they look very threatening,” she says. “That's definitely one of the starting points for their design. We really wanted an imposing silhouette for them. We wanted them to look intimidating and they have big helmets, not to get a bigger silhouette, but [because] it creates a bit of a distance between you and them because really you don't know who's inside. So that was really for us, an important thing that they would feel like you need to get out of their way if you ever encounter them.” </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/zerek-besh-sliro-1720786942600.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Zerek Besh are led by Sliro.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Much about Sliro and his gang remains a mystery for now, with Massive reluctant to give away many more details about your encounters with them. We’ll learn much more about them, though, and why they’re at the core of Kay’s story when Star Wars Outlaws releases on August 30th.</p><p><em>Simon Cardy once got kicked out of a school assembly for calling somebody Salacious Crumb.

Here's where Xur is this weekend, and what he has for sale.</p><p>Xur is offering the Exotic weapon catalysts for <strong>Skyburner's Oath </strong>and <strong>The Wardcliff Coil</strong>. For Exotic armor, Hunters can pick up <strong>Assassin's Cowl</strong>; Titans can grab <strong>MK. 44 Stand Asides</strong>; and Warlocks can buy <strong>Sunbracers</strong>.</p><h2>Xur Location</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4332619-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4332619" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4332619-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4332619"></a><figcaption>Xur's new location in the Tower.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4332619-xur-tfs.jpg"></figure><p>Spawn in at the Tower and hang a right past Banshee-44.

The Helium Spirals perk increases the duration of Solar grenades, and Solar melee kills grant unlimited grenade energy for a brief time. Generally, this allows you to toos out four grenades in quick succession. Resilience on this Exotic is very good, and while recovery could be better, discipline, intellect, and strength aren't too bad either.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 3</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience:

For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

		<p>I have a bit of soft spot for Wind Rose as during the pandemic when all the heavy metal concerts were cancelled, they took their mining anthem Diggy Diggy Hole and made an a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnBvEddq7nw">banging EDM version of the track</a> as nightclubs were still open in some countries. Well, they’re back and this time they have teamed up with the video game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/deep-rock-galactic/">Deep Rock Galactic</a> for another song about smashing rocks.</p>
<p>The new track, “Rock and Stone” finds the band members being kidnapped by aliens in to the world of Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp; and “it’s not long before the band is called to arms and forced to face down hordes of terrifying Glyhpoid foes in true Deep Rock Galactic fashion to ensure they can keep rocking out.”</p>

            <p>
As an old person who's still not over the novelty of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles being allowed to be called the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the UK without anyone getting funny about the word "ninja", it'd be fair to say I'm a little behind on the franchise. So the news there's a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game out this October based on a movie I didn't know existed using an art style I'm totally unfamiliar with has brought a whole succession of revelations.
</p>
<p>
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, as the game is known, was actually announced earlier this year, but developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games have now released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTQ-DC3dOpk">first trailer</a>, which you can see below. Mutants Unleashed - a "story-driven 3D brawler/platformer" - is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, and promises "action-packed combat, hilarious teen spirit, and a whole load of pizza" as Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello traverse an "immersive" New York City.
</p>
<p>
You'll be able to "skate through the streets, grind on rails, and zipline between buildings amid a dynamic night and day cycle" as the gang hunts collectibles and embarks on missions set after the events of this year's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie. Series regulars like Master Splinter, April, Bebop, and Rocksteady will also pop in to say hello.

<p>
As for the turtles themselves, each will have his own distinctive play-style, and there's talk of combat XP, skill trees, plus the chance to level up ally friendships in order to unlock new locations. It's playable either solo or in two-player co-op, and the movie's cast - Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon, Micah Abbey, and Shamon Brown Jr. - all return to voice their respective turtles.

While writing this, I just had a flashback to the time I won a ticket in my local newspaper to see 1991's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: The Secret of the Ooze, and got to enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOV6H4NcGEs">Vanilla Ice's Ninja Rap</a> in a completely empty cinema because I guess the novelty of talking turtles was waning by then. Now, though, they look to have well and truly returned; there's a new movie coming in 2026 and two confirmed games in development - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tmnt-graphic-novel-the-last-ronin-will-become-a-dark-god-of-war-style-video-game">God of War-inspired The Last Ronin</a> and Mutants Unleashed. The latter launches on 18th October, when it'll be available for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and Steam.

Even just looking at an image of the character, you can already envision his look on Pharah’s silhouette.

Dennett said that while fans would have loved it, Blizzard knew they had to balance the time and resources they had.<br></p><hr><p>So those are just a few of the possibilities that didn’t make the cut, but the skins we have now for Ramattra, Reinhardt, Bastion, and Illari are still pretty great, and managed to capture some of the most recognizable robots in disguise.

Until recently, you might not have even heard of the upcoming film, starring <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>’s Glen Powell and <em>Normal People</em>’s Daisy Edgar-Jones. As a huge fan of the original movie, and an unabashed tornado fiend, I worried it was destined to be a box office dud. But the last few days have felt like an F5 movie hype tornado has swept through town, bringing with it some of the best marketing I’ve seen in years and surprisingly positive reviews from critics who have seen the film. If the hype on the internet is a sign of things to come, <em>Twisters</em> is going to be the blockbuster movie of the summer (and maybe beyond).<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193897" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="418" data-playlist="193897,194012,194316" data-current="193897"><div><p>10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19360.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>First, there’s the subject matter: tornadoes are fucking cool, and the original <em>Twister</em> was an incredible movie because it centered them for the first time ever on film. Tornadoes are a uniquely American problem—though they happen elsewhere in the world, they happen so frequently here because of the geography of the United States: cold air comes sweeping down off the Rocky Mountains and into the flat plains of the Midwest, where its met with warm, wet air from the Gulf of Mexico and—boom—you’ve got the recipe for a tornado. 1996’s <em>Twister</em> was a technological marvel for how it portrayed these almighty storms, and hopefully <em>Twisters </em>can do the same—nothing says “blockbuster” more emphatically than sexy people getting pelted with wind, rain, and debris, and nothing screams “popcorn flick” louder than the animal-like roar of a column of hundred-mile-an-hour wind.<br></p><p>Then, there’s the <em>Twisters</em> cast, led by a man who could have on-screen sparks with a plank of wood, Glen Powell. In the past several years, the sex-negative movement has somewhat sanded Hollywood’s raunchy edges, but Powell stands in stark contrast to that—the last few films he’s been in were sexy rom-coms in which his chemistry with his co-stars was so palpable fans started saying he has the real-life equivalent of the heart eyes emoji. This week has given us a barrage of clips, pictures, and sound bites that show off Powell’s innate movie star quality, from a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/twisters-cover-story-daisy-edgar-jones-glen-powell-anthony-ramos-8676182&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/twisters-cover-story-daisy-edgar-jones-glen-powell-anthony-ramos-8676182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">super-sexy <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> cover story</a></span> that blatantly hints at an on-screen romance with Edgar-Jones, to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/THR/status/1811593219538583620&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/THR/status/1811593219538583620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">him bringing his dog Brisket (whom he adopted from the <em>Twisters</em> set) to the Los Angeles premiere</a></span>.

There’s a reason they’re calling <em>Twisters</em> this year’s <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>…</p><p>And lastly, the marketing team behind <em>Twisters</em> has clearly decided to go the ‘90s Hollywood route, and it’s paying off. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/sereshawed/status/1811559966286721349&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/sereshawed/status/1811559966286721349" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboards for the upcoming film look like they’ve been ripped away</a></span> by strong wings and have furniture embedded in them, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/jsstansel/status/1811517791138087283&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/jsstansel/status/1811517791138087283" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">movie posters you’d see lining a theater are upside-down and sticking out of the ground in front of them</a></span>, the glass display shattered.

There is something so tactile and retro about the marketing around <em>Twisters</em>, something that feels like it’s reaching back towards 1996 and saying, “we know the first movie whips, just wait until you see ours.”<br></p><p>I’ll be there on day one to see <em>Twisters</em>, and I think there will be a lot of people doing the same. Let’s get twisted.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here are some more intuitive, albeit no more elegant, ways of summarising what you do in Dungeonborne than "FPPvPvEDCES": sword go clang, goblin go eek, treasure chest go jingle-jangle, other player go stab-in-the-back.

In Dungeonborne, you and up to two friends descend to a subterranean place of ill-repute, rinse it of riches, and get the seven hells out of there before you're gobbled up by vermin or mugged by other player teams. There are eight, largely self-explanatory classes - Fighter, Priest, Rogue, Swordmaster, Pyromancer, Cryomancer, Death Knight or Druid - each with a few eye-catching signature tricks such as using the Force to quad-wield, spinning with your blade held out, and summoning violent shrubs to guard an entrance. There are two major areas, Clouseau Castle, which somehow doesn't feature any bloodthirsty pink panthers, and Sinner's End. 
</p>
<p>
I dipped into the last playtest, and had a reasonably grand time thwacking the undead with a bog-standard sword and shield. It feels like a melee combat game in which circling, poking at defences and waiting for an opening are legitimate and suspenseful possibilities, though I'm sure some high-level obsessive has already worked out that they can bunny-hop straight into a finishing move, or similar cheesing strat. The dungeon-raiding aside, there's also a competitive arena mode for straight-up player-killers, which I fear to set foot in. I prefer my murderous intent to be veiled initially, thanks.
</p>
<p>
As somebody who files catacombs under "cosy" and is given to warbling about the good old days of Rune and Deathtrap Dungeon, I'm keen to give Dungeonborne a decent shake. Find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2448970/Dungeonborne/">Steam</a>. The big question for contemporary crypt-diving enthusiasts will be how it stacks up the already-released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-and-darker">Dark And Darker</a>. I've been playing a bit of that, as well, and my hour one verdict is that it has better beards.

The company behind <em>Super Mario</em> even, reportedly, forces these translators to sometimes sign 10-year NDAs, making it nearly impossible for them to talk about their work or put it on their CV or resume. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/nintendo-s-systemic-policy-of-miscredting-is-harming-external-translators#close-modal&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/nintendo-s-systemic-policy-of-miscredting-is-harming-external-translators#close-modal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a new July 12 report from <em>Gamedeveloper.com</em></a></span><em>,</em> multiple sources who have helped localize big Nintendo games claim that they and their colleagues weren’t named in the credits for titles like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-review-switch-rpg-1851490626&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-review-switch-rpg-1851490626"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a></span>. These uncredited translators work for months on Nintendo games. However, according to one source, Nintendo’s policy is to not individually credit these workers. Instead, only in-house, Nintendo-employed translators make the cut. </p></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,196698,191491" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> “If you look at the credits for <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, for instance, you will notice that only six people were credited for localizing a full title that’s available in eight languages,” one source told the outlet. “[In my experience] a game like this would normally be localized by a team of around 25 translators. Some languages are skipped over completely like they got magically added to the game.”</p><p>Worse, according to some external translators, Nintendo made them sign 10-year NDAs, prohibiting them from talking about or promoting their contributions to the game. <em>GameDeveloper.com </em>was able to independently verify these NDAs are real and have been used on multiple Nintendo projects. </p><p>“You work on an award-winning title with newspapers and magazines raving about your work, and you’re forced to hide the fact that you actually were a part of that for 10 years,” said one translator. <br></p><p> Nintendo didn’t reply to <em>Kotaku </em>or<em> GameDeveloper.com.</em></p><p>Of course, this isn’t a new phenomenon.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-game-companies-use-credits-to-reward-or-punish-de-1840905129&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-game-companies-use-credits-to-reward-or-punish-de-1840905129"> Video game companies have routinely failed to include everyone</a></span> who <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/everyone-who-worked-on-a-game-should-be-in-the-credits-1847669211&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/everyone-who-worked-on-a-game-should-be-in-the-credits-1847669211">worked on a project in the game’s credits</a></span>. And when it comes to third-party contractors and external teams, the workers are often stuck between big companies that point the finger at one another but don’t do anything to actually help the people translating some of the biggest games released. </p><p> “It is nigh impossible for translators to push back against this structure,” explained one source. “Anyone trying will get blacklisted before getting anywhere. This is a field where taking an annual break can shut you out of months of work. No one cares what we think because there’s literally nothing we can do about it, and that’s even if we were willing to forfeit our livelihood for the greater good.”<br><em> </em></p><p><em> .</em> </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Cast both incantations, drink your Flask of Wondrous Physick, then quickly heal up any necessary HP and FP.</p><p>Enter the fog gate and get on the boss as rapidly as you can (dodging any attacks that may come your way in the process). As soon as you’ve closed the gap on the boss, use your Rolling Sparks attack to deal heavy damage.</p><p>If you’ve followed the build guide perfectly, you should feel pretty confident against most of the DLC’s bosses, albeit not as over-confident as you might have felt before the nerfing patch. When you’re done with that, you’ll be able to carry this build into a NG+ cycle, too. Just remember to swap the Lightning Perfume Bottle for another Dexterity weapon when exploring, as this build probably won’t help you much during average enemy encounters.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Today the company announced four new limited-edition retro handhelds encased in  anodized aluminum. They’re beautiful and expensive, and Analogue is leaning into the FOMO with one-time-only pre-orders for “ highly limited quantities [that] will never be sold again.”</p><p>  The Analogue Pocket Aluminum Editions are precision CNC’d, meaning they are cut from blocks of metal rather than, in the words of CEO Christopher Taber, being made from “casted bullshit.” There are four colors—natural, noir, black, and indigo—and each one will set you back $500. They go on sale on July 15 at 11:00 a.m. and begin shipping July 17. “These are fucking nuts,” Taber wrote in an email.</p><p>If the Analogue Pocket’s past is anything to go off of, the PlayStation 5-sized price tag won’t scare collectors and retro enthusiasts away. The devices use field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips to run Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance cartridges exactly how you remember them. The latest in a series of console recreations from Analogue, the handhelds launched in 2021 and, due in part to supply chain issues resulting from the pandemic, remained perpetually sold out and incessantly hard to find, up until recently.</p><p>Last fall, the company announced <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/analogue-pocket-classic-limited-edition-release-date-1851022319&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/analogue-pocket-classic-limited-edition-release-date-1851022319">Game Boy Color variants</a></span> aimed at recapturing the pure joy of holding a device in your hands that pops with all the colors of the Zebra bubble gum rainbow. These aluminum models are instead channeling the brushed aluminum look of certain Game Boy SP editions when the brand was aiming to be a bit more reserved and refined. Personally, I’m hoping Analogue comes back this Christmas with a mash-up of both bright colors and cold metal. </p><p>Somehow I suspect that whatever comes next, Analogue’s plans for more editions of the Pocket aren’t done yet.

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/731040/view/4404040636376861069" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a new post on the game's Steam page</a>,&nbsp;<em>The Invincible&nbsp;</em>has crossed the curiously specific sales milestone of 123,000 copies since its release in November last year. Why 123,000? Perhaps there's some kind of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/invincible-revealed-as-new-sci-fi-game-from-ex-witcher-devs">scientific significance</a> I'm missing.</p>

<p><em>The Invincible&nbsp;</em>was originally unveiled in 2020 and was set for a 2021 release, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/retro-sci-fi-game-invincible-release-date-set-for-2022">pushed back to 2022</a>, eventually arriving across PC and consoles <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-amd-partnership">in November last year</a>.</p>
<p>The game is an adaptation of Polish author&nbsp;Stanisław Lem's 1964 novel of the same name, arguably one of the most influential Polish-language science-fiction novels ever written.</p>
<p>You take the role of Yasna, a scientist who has landed on the unexplored planet of Regis III and who must quickly reckon with the loss of her crew and the danger posed by her newfound environment.</p>

<p>Being a narrative adventure, <i>The Invincible&nbsp;</i>isn't the kind of game you'd pick up if you wanted high-octane thrills, but if you're looking for a thought-provoking science fiction story with an "atompunk" setting (that's Starward's word), then you'll likely want to give this one a look.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The Invincible&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/731040/The_Invincible/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10002666" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-invincible/9N19RM08QL3K" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24195175/zenless-zone-zero-impressions-genshin-impact-mihoyo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve given up on trying to understand <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/13/23070689/zenless-zone-zero-trailer-rpg-beta-pc-ios"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a>. In every other cutscene, I’m bombarded with in-game jargon about inter-knots, proxies, hollows, and w-engines that I just cannot keep straight. Meanwhile, my patience withers to dust as my eyes flit about the screen trying to make sense of the literal deluge of resources — dennies, polychromes, investigator logs, master tapes, and so, <em>so </em>much more — the game requires you to accumulate in order to progress. It is so overwhelming that the only time I feel a sense of peace is during the breakneck combat sequences filled with their own complicated waltz of combos, parries, and special attacks. It’s just too bad that those moments are few and far between.</p><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is the latest game from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22777194/genshin-impact-fanfiction-merchandise-rules-creators"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/24/23695826/honkai-star-rail-release-date-trailer-pre-install"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a> developer HoYoverse (previously known as MiHoYo). It combines action RPG combat with gacha game mechanics (<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/gacha">gacha</a> referring to the type of game where characters and resources are doled out randomly via loot boxes and other kinds of microtransactions). The game takes place in a futuristic urban setting where you play as a Proxy who controls a bangboo to guide your team of operators through a hollow to complete commissions taken from the inter-knot. And though this seems like a string of incomprehensible garbage, this is actually the easiest part of the game to understand.</p><p>Commissions work like daily quests and are categorized as to whether they’re story, combat, or exploration missions. No matter what type of mission it is, though, it seems like they all follow the same basic structure. First is the exploration part. The screen turns into a giant wall of TVs that you move your little rabbit avatar (called a bangboo... seriously) across to reach the goal. It looks kinda like a board game, with each TV representing some kind of event. Some TVs will have resources to pick up, while others hide combat encounters. If you run into a combat TV, the game changes, dropping your party into an arena with a bunch of monsters to fight.</p><div><figcaption><em>An example of </em>Zenless Zone Zero<em>’s exploration minigame.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Hoyoverse</cite></p></div><p>Usually, the <a href="https://youtu.be/GE_KeYdxG2A?si=VwCdy2HoUnOdktG-">highly polished, action-filled trailers</a> of most free-to-play games conceal actual gameplay <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com%2Fshorts%2FBScFjetm_B0%3Fsi%3DM9jynaNI6YusdZpq">that’s either nothing like the trailer</a> or nothing more than a mindless clickfest. So, I was not prepared for how engaging <em>ZZZ</em>’s combat really is. It’s fast and fluid, with a bunch of different actions you can string together to execute slick-as-hell combos. Add to that the ability to switch to any one of your party members mid-combo, and it makes for an experience that could stand next to any blockbuster action RPG game. It’s a hoot landing a dodge just right to chain together devastating attacks from each party member again and again. Pure gas.</p><p>But for some reason, the game is determined to keep that gas away from me as much as possible. There are so many other elements to the game that interfere with what’s most fun. While I appreciate that you can visit a noodle shop where the food buffs your party and that there’s an arcade with little minigames you can play with your party, it all feels like too much fluff. All I want to do is lead my little bangboo around collecting items and fight monsters with my party members, and all the game<em> </em>wants me to do is run a Blockbuster — really. </p><p>Why am I running a Blockbuster? I have no idea, and I’ve given up trying to figure it out. The game’s insistence on throwing so much at you upfront and its inability to explain anything coherently are so bad that I don’t even know how the gacha mechanics work. </p><p>Each combat mission comes with information like the type of enemies you’ll face and their weaknesses, while your party members have their own unique abilities and affinities. The appeal, then, is to acquire as many different operators to mix and match your party so you’ll have the right tool for each job. There are scores of interestingly designed characters — like the superhot wolfman with ice powers and an exquisitely tailored waistcoat — that I don’t know how to acquire because I’m still busy fussing with what movies to rent out at my Blockbuster. </p><p>Maybe that’s a good thing. Maybe HoYoverse is trying to curtail <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/10/06/genshin-impact-gambling/">the criticisms a lot of gacha games get</a> for being naked cash grabs by obscuring the function of its microtransactions to all but the most motivated of spenders. I can see the shop, but where I’m at in the way-too-long tutorial, I don’t have the faintest idea of how to use it.</p><p>I recognize that as video game trends evolve while I get older, there will be some games that I’ll never be able to comprehend. Despite my best intentions and as open a mind as I could muster, <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is that game. And if I don’t get that wolfman soon, I’m content to leave the game for the people who get it.</p><p><small><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now on Android, iOS, PC, and PlayStation.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Gaming hardware makers have often walked the line between enabling a player’s true skills, and simply delivering them an unfair advantage. Sometimes, honest accessibility aids are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/they-dont-care-inside-the-triumphs-and-failures-of-accessible-gaming-hardware">falsely accused of being cheating tools</a>; other times, a monitor will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-worst-and-weirdest-gaming-tech-of-ces-2024">straight-up play League of Legends for you</a>. This week, developments in gaming keyboards have sparked a new debate on what does and doesn’t fall within the scope of fair play, with mechanical keeb specialists Wooting <a href="https://x.com/WootingKB/status/1811425339697996247">declaring in no uncertain terms</a> that "Rappy Snappy is not the same as Snap Tap." Cool, glad that’s cleared up.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you’re convinced that only about half that sentence is comprised of real words... you’re right, but bear with me. A while back, Wooting announced the <a href="https://wooting.io/wooting-80he">80HE</a>, a superfast <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/should-you-bother-with-hall-effect-keyboards">Hall Effect keyboard</a> that would introduce their new Rappy Snappy feature. This tracks two keys of your choosing and allows one of them to activate even when the other is already being partially pressed – unlike how most keyboards only track one input at a time. In theory, this enables faster side-to-side strafing in pacey <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS games</a> like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/counter-strike-2-best-settings">Counter-Strike 2</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a>, as you don't have to fully lift your finger off one directional key before you can start moving in the opposite direction. Unlike your hapless, technologically inferior opponent, who'll likely be full of holes before they can sort their mutually exclusive feet.</p>

<figcaption>Here's a more visual explanation of Rappy Snappy, beginning about 1:24 in.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz9pTOLbeos" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 80HE is due to launch this September, but Razer – the dark green Goliath to Wooting’s presumably normal skin-coloured David – have pipped it to the post, releasing a firmware update to their existing <a href="https://www.razer.com/gb-en/pc/gaming-keyboards/huntsman-line">Huntsman V3 Pro</a> keyboards that adds a similar feature called Snap Tap. Like Rappy Snappy – which it turns out is really hard not to type as Snappy Tappy – Snap Tap allows for the same rapid strafing by letting you hold down one directional key and quickly hammer the opposite key for optimal sideways dodging.</p>
<p>Far from ushering in a new era of meritocratic manshooting, however, the near-simultaneous arrival of these duelling keyboard technologies has instead fuelled concern that such SnappyTapRapRapBabap systems are tantamount to cheating, with detractors citing similarities to similar-performing scripts that exist for games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> and CS2 progenitor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-global-offensive">CS:GO</a>. Scripts, as a concept, tend to occupy that grey area between 'Using the advantages available' and 'Being a cheating toe-rag', but I suspect most online shootists would agree that deploying them is not considered particularly good form.</p>
<p>Wooting elected to go on the defensive, <a href="https://x.com/WootingKB/status/1811425339697996247">tXeeting a series of tXeets</a> that explained how Rappy Snappy is functionally distinct from Razer’s Snap Tap – and therefore not as much of a competitive no-no as it might appear. In short, Wooting argue that Rappy Snappy only registers the input of whichever key is pressed in deeper; this still allows for faster transitions, because one key doesn’t need to be fully released before the next input can take place, but its effective usage still requires the player to put more force into just one key at a time. Snap Tap, on the other hand, merely registers the most recent input, meaning a player could (for example) fully hold down the D key with one finger and just mash the A key to strafe.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Razer-Huntsman-V3-Pro-series.JPG?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Razer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In other words, Razer’s system is more comprehensively flouting the comp-shooter rule of only one input being allowed at a time, whereas Wooting’s is... just fudging it a bit, I suppose? It’s still removing the need for a key to fully spring back before the initial input is considered complete, but it does sound like you’d still be manually and rapidly pressing <em>both</em> keys, as you would on a bog-standard keyboard. Snap Tap, by allowing for one key to be held down yet still register multiple inputs, probably does come closer to self-playing territory.</p>
<p>Either way, those looking to claim the supposed advantages of these systems may want to wait and see how they fare with anti-cheat systems. Valve don’t seem to be doling out VAC bans for those using Snap Tap in CS2, but different games will have different rules on hardware that could be considered assistive. And not just shooters, either: rhythm game and minor internet sensation Osu! <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Reporting_bad_behaviour/Handling_foul_play#is-using-specialized-hardware-considered-as-cheating?">enforces a ban</a> on "anything that decreases the skill required to play", a rule of which these input-boosting tools could very feasibly fall foul.</p>

<p>Starfy isn't a particularly familiar franchise to America players. They have received four games – three for Game Boy Advance, one for DS – but only the 2009 DS game ever released in America. Today, the original three Game Boy Advance games are now available for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. The games retain their original title, Densetsu no Stafy, and have not been localized. The gameplay has been describe as Kirby-esque, but I have never been able to confirm that myself until today.</p>

<p>If you’re waiting to get your hands on a new AMD Ryzen 9000 CPU for your next PC upgrade, it doesn’t appear to be much longer. While an official release date hasn’t been set for the latest CPUs from AMD — the only window given was July 2024 –, the Ryzen 9000 series has made its way to retailers ahead of the expected launch.</p>



<p>Reddit user ElectricalEmployer22 took to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1e193o8/just_got_them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCMasterRace subreddit</a> to share a quick snapshot of the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X in stock at his retailer. They didn’t share anything else about the CPUs, but seeing them in a retail store tells people that the release is coming.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The new flagship CPU lineup from AMD moves to Zen5 architecture, replacing the Zen4 architecture that launched in 2022. When they launch, there will be four new CPUs from AMD. There are two new Ryzen 9 chips (9950X and 9900X), one Ryzen 7 9700X, and the Ryzen 5 9600X.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>AMD CPU Model</strong></td><td><strong>Cores /</strong><br><strong>Threads</strong></td><td><strong>Boost&nbsp;/ Base</strong><br><strong>Frequency</strong></td><td><strong>Total Cache</strong></td><td><strong>PCIe</strong></td><td><strong>TDP</strong></td></tr><tr><td>AMD Ryzen™ 9 9950X</td><td>16 / 32</td><td>Up to 5.7 GHz /<br>4.3 GHz</td><td>80MB</td><td>Gen 5</td><td>170W</td></tr><tr><td>AMD Ryzen™ 9 9900X</td><td>12 / 24</td><td>Up to 5.6 GHz /<br>4.4 GHz</td><td>76MB</td><td>Gen 5</td><td>120W</td></tr><tr><td>AMD Ryzen™ 7 9700X</td><td>8 / 16</td><td>Up to 5.5 GHz /<br>3.8 GHz</td><td>40MB</td><td>Gen 5</td><td>65W</td></tr><tr><td>AMD Ryzen™ 5 9600X</td><td>6 / 12</td><td>Up to 5.4 GHz /<br>3.9 GHz</td><td>38MB</td><td>Gen 5</td><td>65W</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>These new CPUs will feature the AM5 socket and work with two new chipsets, X870E and X870. These new chipsets feature 44 PCIe lanes and “direct-to-processor PCIe 5.0 NVMe connectivity”.</p>



<p>As said, no official on-sale date has been announced. However, the latest rumors are that July 31 will be the date.</p>

It's all part of turning "a bloody mess into a bloody good cause."</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1299690/view/4261049898239205610?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, it's explained that Gori: Cuddly Carnage will feature "purple juice" instead of blood in Asian countries where it's censored. That won't affect the hack-and-slash action game in Europe or North America.</p><p dir="ltr">Gori: Cuddly Carnage will see players assuming the role of a hoverboarding cat who slices and dices up the Adorable Army, which includes unicorns. The game wants people to dispose of foes in the "most brutal and stylish way possible."</p><p dir="ltr">Launching August 29, Gori: Cuddly Carnage is slated to arrive on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. A demo for the game is coming August 8.</p>
