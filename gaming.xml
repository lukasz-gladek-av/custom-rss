                <p>Like many other games, Psyonix's Rocket League is getting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-2024-halloween-game-events/2900-5807/" data-ref-id="2900-5807">Halloween update</a>, and this one will also include a range of Spider-Man content focused on the franchise's heroes and villains.</p><p>The Haunted Hallows event begins this Friday, October 18, and runs through November 4. As part of the event, players can complete challenges to unlock rewards like toppers and decals inspired by Spider-Man villains like Venom, Mysterio, and Green Goblin.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=025TMNQHWV0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/025TMNQHWV0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Spider-Man superfans might be interested in buying the Spider-Man Mega Bundle (about $25 USD), which comes with everything, including a Venom-themed goal explosion, decals for Spider-Gwen and Spider-Punk, a Web-head boost and trail, Spider-Man and Symbiote wheels, and a Spidey sense topper, among other things. Check out everything available in the bundle below. Players don't have to buy the mega bundle, though, as individual items and bundles are available as well for separate purchase.</p><p>In addition to the Spider-Man content, Rocket League is adding two limited-time modes for Halloween, including Spooky Cube and Haunted Heatseeker. Spooky Cube is normal Rocket League except the spherical soccer ball is replaced with a cubical jack-o'-lantern. In Haunted Heatseeker, the field is invaded by ghosts who try to steal the ball and score--but there is a catch. If your opponent blocks a ghost's shots, the ball will ricochet back toward your own goal.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385913-screenshot2024-10-16at3.51.53pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4385913" data-ratio="0.56035889070147" data-width="1226" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385913-screenshot2024-10-16at3.51.53pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4385913"></a><figcaption>Spider-Man comes to Rocket League</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385913-screenshot2024-10-16at3.51.53pm.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385914-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.34pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385915-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.41pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385916-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.47pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385917-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.52pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4385914,1300-4385915,1300-4385916,1300-4385917" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4385914-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.34pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4385915-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.41pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4385916-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.47pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4385917-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.52pm.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385914-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.34pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385915-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.41pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385916-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.47pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385917-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.52pm.png"></figure><p>For lots more on Haunted Hallows, be sure to <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/its-a-spider-man-spooktacular-in-rocket-leagues-haunted-hallows" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">read the full blog post on the Rocket League website.</a>⁠</p><h3>⁠⁠⁠Spider-Man Mega Bundle (3000 Credits, or about $25 USD)</h3><ul><li>We Are Venom Goal Explosion <i>(2000 Credits individually)</i></li><li>Spider-Man Octane Decal Bundle <i>(900 Credits individually)</i><ul><li>Classic Spider-Man Octane Decal</li><li>Spider-Gwen Octane Decal</li><li>Spider-Punk Octane Decal</li><li>Scarlet Spider Octane Decal</li></ul></li><li>Web-Head Boost + Trail Bundle <i>(600 Credits individually)</i><ul><li>Web-Head Boost</li><li>Web-Head Trail</li></ul></li><li>Symbiote Fennec Bundle <i>(500 Credits individually)</i><ul><li>Spider-Man Symbiote Suit Fennec Decal</li><li>Scream Fennec Decal</li></ul></li><li>Spider-Man Wheels Bundle <i>(500 Credits individually)</i><ul><li>Spider-Man Wheels</li><li>Spider-Man Symbiote Wheels</li></ul></li><li>Spidey Sense Topper</li><li>Spider-Man’s Bag Topper</li></ul>

Sombra will now gain Stealth for five seconds after activating Translocator, though hacking enemies or taking damage will no longer end Stealth but instead will temporarily reveal her. Blizzard has also added back her Opportunist passive, allowing her to see critically injured enemies through walls and deal more damage to hacked targets.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Overwatch 2 - Season 13: Spellbinder Event Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24148443/director-s-take-tricks-tweaks-and-treats-for-season-13/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> going over the update, game director Aaron Keller said the changes were in order to make it so Sombra can't take any position she wants in Stealth while giving her a new gameplay loop that "increases her lethality."</p><p dir="ltr">Several Tank heroes have received changes as well in Season 13, namely Ramattra, Reinhardt, and Mauga. Ramattra's Pummel ability no longer pierces shields, though it will deal 2.5x more damage to them to compensate, with the patch notes stating that the ability being able to damage through shields was a "source of frustration for players trying to protect themselves or their allies."</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of shields, the health of Reinhardt's Barrier Field has been reduced by 100, which Keller said should lead to players having to make a choice between blocking attacks with their barrier or taking the hits themselves. Mauga, on the other hand, received a nice buff, with his ignite damage from his incendiary chaingun now dealing damage over four seconds instead of three. That should give him more power against "smaller, harder to hit targets," Blizzard said.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-season-12-introduces-juno-lets-players-become-egyptian-gods/1100-6525795/" data-ref-id="1100-6525795">Juno, the game's newest Support hero</a>, received a nerf to her healing both in terms of the amount healed and the falloff range of her Mediblaster. The change will require players to make better use of her mobility abilities in order to maintain proper positioning, Blizzard said. Other heroes got small updates as well, ranging from increased cooldown for Brigitte's Repair Pack to a slight health buff for Hanzo.</p><p dir="ltr">Other changes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/overwatch-2-season-13-battle-pass-all-skins-emotes-and-rewards/2900-5867/" data-ref-id="2900-5867">Overwatch 2 Season 13</a> include a number of adjustments to various maps. Four maps--Circuit Royal, Havana, Dorado, and Numbani--have seen various tweaks, ranging from added cover and adjusted sightlines to new pathways and changes to spawn locations. A full before-and-after breakdown can be viewed in the official patch notes.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to all the various map and hero changes, Clash, the newest Overwatch 2 game mode added during Season 12, received adjustments. Blizzard said it's looking to "reduce the number of one-sided stomps" in the mode, and as a result tweaked capture times as well as made it easier for Attackers to secure at least one segment of the final objective point.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-new-halloween-game-mode-mutates-heroes-for-brutal-pvp-action/1100-6527094/" data-ref-id="1100-6527094">Overwatch 2 Season 13 introduced a new PvP Halloween game mode</a> alongside bringing back previous PvE event modes like Junkenstein's Revenge and Wrath of the Bride, and will soon offer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-getting-another-anime-crossover-this-time-with-my-hero-academia/1100-6526743/" data-ref-id="1100-6526743">My Hero Academia-themed skins</a>.

The Interactive Scoreboard is intended to make reporting faster and easier, but also to improve your social experience through whatever channels you prefer to communicate in or avoid entirely. The following features are now accessible via Interactive Scoreboard:</p><ul><li>Adjusting Mic Volume of other players</li><li>Adjusting your Mic Volume</li><li>Reporting other players</li><li>Joining/Leaving Team Voice Chat</li><li>Joining/Leaving Group Voice Chat</li><li>Muting Team Text Chat</li><li>Muting Match Text Chat</li><li>Muting Text Chat of other players</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Matchmaking Updates</p><ul><li>Tuning changes to reduce queue times for Wide matches in Competitive Play.</li><li>Loss Streak avoidance tuned down to prevent cases where it could increase worst case scenario queue times.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: We're not seeing any measurable impact from this tech in preventing loss streaks and we're concerned it might be making queue times longer. So we're scaling it back for now.</p><ul><li>Role Delta tuning tightened, to try to match Ranks on the roles on each team more closely.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: We believe that match quality improves significantly when you are matched closely with one of the members on the opposing team in the same role. We believe we can tighten this preference without significantly impacting queue times.</p><ul><li>Role Delta has been updated to prioritize the Tank Role above other roles.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: We've been thinking about how to improve the Tank experience from every angle, to give them more even matchups and reduce 1-sided matches for the whole team further.</p><ul><li>At higher Ranks the effects of MMR Decay, Winning Trend, Losing Trend, and Calibration have been reduced.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: At our highest ranks these modifiers could sometimes allow very high skill players playing on new accounts to get lucky and surpass their peak ranks considerably, without actually earning their new rank like other players that have played more on their accounts.</p><ul><li>At higher Ranks the matchmaker now takes into account the benefits of grouping when constructing matches.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: At the highest ranks, groups have had noteworthy advantages against teams composed of all solo players for some time now. Our aim with this addition isn't to remove the advantage of grouping at higher ranks entirely, but we'd like the advantage of grouping at higher ranks to be less extreme.</p><p dir="ltr">Public Custom Games</p><ul><li>Hosting Public Custom Games now requires Endorsement Level 3.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: A reminder that we've been actioning accounts that post disruptive content in the Game Browser and we're serious about removing problematic players that don't follow our Code of Conduct. Whenever an account is actioned for a social penalty, they're reduced to Endorsement Level 0, so the combination of social actions and this feature will allow for one chance to change their behavior before they're permanently banned. Anyone that is below Endorsement Level 3 can still host games with the "Friends" or "Invite Only" settings, but they will not have access to the "Everyone" setting.</p><p dir="ltr">Streamer Protect</p><ul><li>Access to the "Hide My Name" function of Streamer Protect now requires completing the "Unrelenting Hero" Lifetime Challenge.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: We've been listening to community feedback that newer accounts should be required to earn access to the feature, but it's important that this feature can't be abused by various types of disruptive players that tend to play on very new accounts. As a reminder, the "Hide My Name" feature does not prevent disruptive players from being punished when they're reported since we know their actual battle tag behind the scenes.</p><p dir="ltr">Challenge Updates</p><ul><li>Select challenges are now visible in the Main Menu.</li><li>Challenge Rewards can now be inspected in detail in the Challenges Menu.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: Challenges are now in the main menu to highlight their rewards, primarily for new Event Challenges.</p><p dir="ltr">SHOP UPDATES</p><ul><li>Mythic Skin Aspects Add-on Cosmetic is now added to the Mythic Shop.</li><li>Overwatch League Store tab was removed and replaced by a separate button in the bottom of the main Shop tab.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">COMPETITIVE UPDATES</p><p>The requirements to appear on the Top 500 Leaderboard have changed:</p><ul><li>Win requirement per season reduced from 50 to 25.</li><li>The Seasoned Competitor challenge (750 lifetime wins in Competitive Play) is now required to be completed to be eligible for any Top 500 Leaderboard starting in Season 12.</li></ul><h4>Hero Updates</h4><p dir="ltr">General</p><ul><li>Swapping your hero hides your selection on the enemy scoreboard for 15 seconds.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: This change adds a more friction to counterswapping, especially in the extreme case where two players on opposite teams are both sitting in spawn with the scoreboard open and rapidly switch their heroes in response to each other’s choices.</p><h4>Tank</h4><h5>Mauga</h5><p>Developer Comment: Increasing the duration of Mauga's burn effect will help better reward going for the smaller, harder to hit targets.</p><p dir="ltr">Incendiary Chaingun</p><ul><li>Ignite damage over time duration increased from 3 to 4 seconds.</li></ul><h5>Ramattra</h5><p>Developer Comments: Ramattra's Pummel projectiles passing through barriers was a source of frustration for players trying to protect themselves or their allies. With these changes enabling Ramattra to deal critical damage to barriers, he will still be a valuable hero choice against barrier mechanics, but won't immediately apply damage to players on the other side.</p><p>Pummel</p><p dir="ltr">Pummel</p><ul><li>No longer pierces barriers.</li><li>Now deals 2.5x more damage to barriers.</li></ul><h5>Reinhardt</h5><p>Developer Comments: This is just some fine tuning for the barrier health and regeneration rate as it had become slightly too tough to break through.</p><p dir="ltr">Barrier Field</p><ul><li>Barrier Field health reduced from 1600 to 1500.</li></ul><h4>Damage</h4><h5>Hanzo</h5><p>Developer Comments: We are reverting Hanzo back to his previous health now that it's possible to take out an opposing Hanzo with a well-aimed headshot thanks to the weapon damage changes.</p><ul><li>Base health increased from 225 to 250.</li></ul><h5>Sojourn</h5><p>Developer Comments: These Railgun changes swap out the 25 minimum energy it decays to for a longer time before it begins to degenerate which alleviates some of the pressure to quickly use the secondary fire. Disruptor shot is getting a damage increase to helps its effectiveness as an area denial tool, andlong with additional utility through generating a small amount of Railgun energy to make it more broadly useful.</p><p dir="ltr">Railgun</p><ul><li>Energy no longer stops degenerating at 25 energy.</li><li>Time before energy degeneration begins increased from 7 to 12 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Disruptor Shot</p><ul><li>Damage per second increased from 60 to 80</li><li>Now generates 25% of damage done to enemy players as Railgun energy.</li></ul><h5>Sombra</h5><p>Developer Comments: This is a significant change to Sombra's playstyle in the hopes of making her more interactive for the opposing team and shifting some of her power from the utility of Stealth and Hack into increased lethality.</p><p>Stealth having a limited duration less than the Translocator cooldown is intended to create brief windows of vulnerability. It still enables Sombra to cross through dangerous areas unseen, but to really hang around in the enemy backline will require moving from cover-to-cover similar to other flanking heroes. No longer having the stealth movement speed removed upon taking damage also enhances its usefulness as an escape tool.</p><p dir="ltr">Hack</p><ul><li>No longer ends Stealth but does reveal Sombra.</li><li>Hacked ability lockout effect duration reduced from 1.5 to 1.0 seconds (EMP duration unchanged).</li><li>BOB hacked stun duration reduced from 10 to 3 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Translocator</p><ul><li>Cooldown increased from 5 to 7 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">EMP</p><ul><li>Ultimate cost increased 12%.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Stealth</p><ul><li>No longer passive and now activates by using Translocator.</li><li>Now has a 5 second duration.</li><li>Added stealth timer around the reticle and removed ability icon.</li><li>Taking damage now reveals Sombra for 1 second instead of ending stealth.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Opportunist</p><ul><li>The Opportunist passive has been added back in.</li><li>Increases Sombra's weapon damage versus hacked targets by 20%.</li><li>See critically injured enemies through walls.</li></ul><h4>Support</h4><h5>Baptiste</h5><p>Developer Comment: This change is aimed at reducing the fatigue resulting from controlling the recoil over longer periods of play more than trying to add power to Baptiste's primary fire.</p><p dir="ltr">Biotic Launcher</p><ul><li>Primary fire recoil reduced by 30%.</li></ul><h5>Brigitte</h5><p>Developer Comment: Brigitte's healing output over the course of a match is quite high, so this is just a slight adjustment to help bring that in line.</p><p dir="ltr">Repair Pack</p><ul><li>Cooldown increased from 5 to 5.5 seconds.</li></ul><h5>Juno</h5><p>Developer Comments: Juno's healing output is too high for how much mobility she possesses so we're shortening her falloff range to increase the importance of positioning well with her mobility abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">Mediblaster</p><ul><li>Falloff range reduced from 30-50 meters to 20-35 meters.</li><li>Healing per projectile reduced from 6.5 to 6.</li></ul><h4>Map Updates</h4><p dir="ltr">CLASH</p><ul><li>Capture time on the final objective points A and E now increases for Attackers as segments get secured consecutively from 1x /1x / 1x to 0.7x /1.1x /1.4x, to make the first segment easier to capture for attackers but consecutive ones harder.</li><li>Defenders now respawn instantly as the first segment and second segment get secured instead of when the previous objective points B or D get captured.</li><li>Unlock time for final objective points A and E has been increased from 25 seconds to 27.5 seconds.</li><li>Decay rate on final objective points A and E have been doubled for attackers to not lose their progress as quickly when stepping off the point.</li><li>Capture time for defenders on objective points B and D has been increased by 10% to give attackers more opportunities to attack the point.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: We want to reduce the number of one-sided stomps occurring in the Clash game mode. We also want to address the difficulty of securing at least one segment on the final objective points as attackers. So, we tweaked the capture time for the defending team to make the fight for objective points B and D a bit more favorable for attackers.</p><h4>Circuit Royal</h4><p>1st Point</p><ul><li>New exit options from attackers initial spawn to reduce spawn camping.</li><li>Initial high ground right flank brought in and access adjusted to reduce spawn camping.</li><li>Cover options added.</li><li>New far side flank option to contest defenders on the high ground by the bridge.</li></ul><p>2nd Point</p><ul><li>Improved spawn protections for attackers leaving the second spawn area to reduce spawn camping.</li><li>Additional cover added while pushing high ground for attackers.</li><li>New flank added for attackers to take rear high ground by the chicane.</li><li>Hill lowered slightly and road angled forward to make approach for attackers slightly more comfortable.</li></ul><p>3rd Point</p><ul><li>Improved options for attackers leaving the third spawn area to combat spawn camping.</li><li>Flank route to high ground pool area widened and additional cover added to increase play options in this space.</li><li>Sightlines improved for attackers to poke at entrenched defender positions in the final area.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Before and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and After</p><h4>Dorado</h4><p>1st Point</p><ul><li>Starting high ground cover and access has been adjusted to reduce spawn camping.</li><li>Flank routes have been streamlined for attackers.</li><li>Various geometry adjustments to provide more favorable gameplay opportunities for attackers in the market area.</li></ul><p>2nd Point</p><ul><li>Staircase added for easier attacker access to the high ground.</li><li>Added access to the courthouse for attackers.</li></ul><p>3rd Point</p><ul><li>Cover added after the chokepoint on the main path.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Before and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and After</p><h4>Havana</h4><p>1st Point</p><ul><li>Reduced sightlines into the attackers' spawn.</li><li>Added new options for attackers to exit their spawn.</li><li>Reduced oppressive high ground vantage points for defenders.</li></ul><p>2nd Point</p><ul><li>Widened doorways and certain routes for cleaner navigation and flow.</li><li>Closed small holes through certain assets to block sightlines and projectiles.</li></ul><p>3rd Point</p><ul><li>Redesigned attackers' spawn interior and added additional routes for a safer attacker exit.</li><li>Sightlines from the fort wall to spawn and main route have been reduced.</li><li>Pathing into the fort has been consolidated on one side for cleaner flow and to give both teams more options while in combat around the final chokepoint.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Before and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and After</p><h4>Numbani</h4><p>1st Point</p><ul><li>Attackers' initial spawn room has been pushed a lot closer to first point to reduce runback times.</li><li>Lowered some high ground around first point.</li><li>Easier access to flank routes around first point.</li><li>Combined the paths in the building behind the payload on first point - one room that connects everything.</li></ul><p>2nd Point</p><ul><li>Forward defender spawn points have been added to reduce runback times for defenders.</li><li>A staircase has been added near attackers forward spawn for easier access to high ground.</li><li>Added a connecting path past and above the choke into third point.</li></ul><p>3nd Point</p><ul><li>Relocated a pesky sign.</li><li>Removed a tree.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Before and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and After</p><h4>Bug Fixes</h4><p dir="ltr">General</p><ul><li>Fixed a bug that caused some players to be unable to purchase golden weapons.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the Voice Chat Devices setting was unable to be changed.</li><li>Fived a bug that caused Adrenaline Junkie achievement to sometimes not grant.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Heroes</p><p>Baptiste</p><ul><li>Fixed a bug with Baptiste's Zombie Walk Emote.</li></ul><p>Sigma</p><ul><li>Fixed a bug where Sigma would not gain Overhealth for Juno's Mediblaster.</li></ul><p>Reaper</p><ul><li>In a previous update, fixed a bug that caused exit sound enemy reaper's shadow step to not play.</li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-turn-based-rpg-andy-serkis-1851674347<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With its reveal buried in the middle of Microsoft’s mammoth Xbox showcase over the summer, you could be forgiven for not being aware of <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, a fantasy RPG from French studio Sandfall Interactive that looks like a mashup of <em>Dragon Age</em> and<em> Final Fantasy</em>. The turn-based adventure continues to look stunning though, and it just announced an all-star voice cast to boot that includes Andy Serkis.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196646" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="137" data-playlist="196646,196215,196055" data-current="196646"><div><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22202.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is a dark fantasy RPG inspired by the French Belle Époque (think French Impressionism and the Lumière brothers) about a group of explorers trying to take on a god called the Paintress who’s terrorizing the countryside with arbitrary mass killings. The turn-based combat mixes in real-time elements, while the gorgeous menus and evocative UI look like a cross between <em>Persona</em> and <em>Dishonored</em>. If the actual game can live up to its early trailers, we could have something really special on our hands. </p><p>And despite coming from a brand-new studio, the just-revealed cast for the game is full of top-notch talent. In addition to Serkis, best known as Gollum in Peter Jackson’s<em> Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy and as <em>Andor</em>’s Kino Loy in the single best episode of <em>Star Wars</em> TV ever produced, <em>Expedition 33</em> also features the voice talents of <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>’s Clive Rosfield (Ben Starr) and<em> Baldur’s Gate III</em>’s Shadowheart (Jennifer English). Here’s the full cast list so far:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Andy Serkis </strong>(<em>13 Going on 30</em>) as a man trying to save his family named Renoir</li><li><strong>Charlie Cox</strong> (<em>Daredevil</em>) as the lead engineer Gustave</li><li><strong>Ben Starr</strong> (<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>) as the dangerous stranger  Verso</li><li><strong>Jennifer English </strong>(<em>Baldur’s Gate III</em>) as the shy loner  Maelle</li><li><strong>Kirsty Rider</strong> (<em>Sandman</em>) as chief researcher Lune</li><li><strong>Shala Nyx </strong>(<em>The Old Guard</em>) as the cheerful warrior Sciel</li></ul></blockquote><p>The newest trailer features the talents of both Starr, who helped carry <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>’s uneven story <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xvi-ffxvi-clive-thirsty-fan-fiction-ps5-1850588637&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xvi-ffxvi-clive-thirsty-fan-fiction-ps5-1850588637">to hell and back on his shoulders</a></span>, and Serkis, who we still love <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/09/andy-serkis-ai-characters-project-gollum-lord-of-the-rings-1236096832/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/andy-serkis-ai-characters-project-gollum-lord-of-the-rings-1236096832/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">despite his saying some dumb stuff about AI</a></span>. The gameplay footage also gives a wider look at <em>Expedition 33</em>'s unique world and massive monsters. A giant clockwork golem fight demonstrates the game’s timing-based combat mechanics, and a grappling hook-like power shows off one of the game’s many traversal abilities. </p><p>Devora Wilde (<em>Space Marine 2</em>), Tracy Wiles (<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>), Rich Keeble, and Maxence Cazorla are in the game as well. “The actors were phenomenal to work with (and just all-around great people),” wrote <em>Clair Obscur </em>lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/16/introducing-the-cast-of-clair-obscur-expedition-33/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/16/introducing-the-cast-of-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the PlayStation Blog</a></span>. “We had a lot of fun during the recording sessions. The cast beautifully conveyed the complexity of the characters, who have each been shaped by the harshness of their world. Every character has been affected by deep and constant loss and has dealt with this in their own way.”</p><p>  <em>Expedition 33</em> doesn’t have a set release date yet, but it’s supposed to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC early in 2025. So far the Unreal Engine 5 game looks like it’s shaping up nicely. I wouldn’t be surprised if it still gets one or two minor delays, but I’m looking forward to it whenever it finally arrives. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Per the company, the decline is the result of Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden and Jusant not performing as well as expected.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/17/banishersthumb-1708181723447.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden didn't perform as well as expected, Don't Nod says.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"Our half-year results for 2024 reflect the economic underperformance of our latest release, despite solid ratings on Metacritic, as well as the accounting impact of the decisions we had to take," said CEO Oskar Guilbert in a statement. "The initial performance support measures announced last spring no longer seem sufficient to maintain the company's competitiveness. As a result, today we presented a reorganization project to the employee representative bodies, which could set Don't Nod on a new development trajectory. I am fully conscious of the impact this project may have on all our employees. Securing our company's resources and restoring its ability to perform more in an increasingly competitive and selective industry is extremely necessary."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Our half-year results for 2024 reflect the economic underperformance of our latest release, despite solid ratings on Metacritic</p></div><p>The company has already taken some restructuring measures to reduce costs, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-creator-dont-nod-has-rough-start-to-the-year-presses-pause-on-two-projects">including "pressing pause" on two unannounced projects</a>. However, this seems to not be enough, as Don't Nod is also expecting to lay off a number of individuals in the coming months. The exact number is still in flux, as Don't Nod management must negotiate with employee union representatives and may implement other measures such as a voluntary redundancy plan. Notably, earlier this year, the representative French union Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo (STJV) <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/02/dont-nod-ascension-or-free-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accused the company</a> of mismanagement, claiming employees were facing burnout due to the ongoing reorganization and that communication, understaffing, and shifting deadlines were endangering the workforce.</p><p><strong>Update 2:22pm PT: </strong>STJV has issued a statement condeming the layoffs, saying the company broke the law by not providing any information to employees beforehand about today's meeting agenda where the layoffs were announced. The union also accused the company of ignoring workers asking for clearer communication about the state of the company, saying that "alarm bells have been ringing for months."</p><p>"The Don’t Nod union section, as well the whole of the STJV, cannot tolerate the company rejecting the responsibilities of its own failures on its workers," <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/10/at-dont-nod-the-only-plans-for-the-future-are-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the statement reads</a>. "We warned them long ago, but they ignored us and accused us of being too agressive to speak with. With this layoffs plan, they are creating an atmosphere of extreme violece. We are calling on all workers at Don’t Nod to mobilise to save their jobs and working conditions."</p><p><strong>Original story continues:</strong></p><p>According to a <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">games industry layoff tracker</a>, over 13,000 game developers have been laid off just this year (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riot-lays-off-more-league-of-legends-developers-while-promising-to-increase-team-size">including 32 just yesterday at Riot Games</a>). Over 10,000 developers were laid off in 2023 and over 8,000 in 2022.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/new-world/" data-ref-id="5000-489582">New World: Aeternum</a>, Amazon Games' MMO, is set during the Age of Exploration, on an island where no one can die--but immortality isn't always a gift. For some, living forever leads to madness, while others lose their souls. Some corpses are long since hollowed out but live on, unable to find peace.</p><p dir="ltr">That idea gets pretty dark pretty fast, but in the episode of animated anthology series Secret Level that's based on New World, the focus is on a slightly different take on the material.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLihxsmI_OU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gLihxsmI_OU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"[New World: Aeternum is] not quite as light as [the episode] presents it," said New World: Aeternum narrative director Rob Chestney, during a question-and-answer session with press following a recent screening of Secret Level's first episode. "We talk about it as grimdark. We talk about it as supernatural, rather than fantasy."</p><p dir="ltr">The video game conceit of players dying is baked into the fiction of New World: Aeternum, giving an in-universe reason for players to die and resurrect frequently. In the game's fiction, Chestney said, that often gets treated seriously. The Secret Level episode, however, puts a darkly humorous spin on all that death and how it alters consequences for characters, resulting in a short that's a comedy, rather than a dark fantasy. It's a take on New World: Aeternum that utilizes the same ideas but to a very different effect than the game itself.</p><p dir="ltr">The New World episode might be a good example of creator Blur Studios' process in making Secret Level, which has episodes based on 15 different games from 11 different developers. The episode focuses on a key element of the game it's based on, teasing out something that can resonate with viewers regardless of their familiarity with that world. But it also means shrinking down an entire game world that might take players tens of hours to experience, like New World, into something with a few characters and a few minutes of story.</p><p dir="ltr">"Especially with this episode, but any game that is that vast and there's so much to draw from, especially with the sort of an unindoctrinated audience, you want to distill it down to something personal that people can connect to," Secret Level executive producer Dave Wilson said. "So, with everything that was available to us, that's why it got distilled down to a handful of characters that you could, in 10 minutes, you can actually feel something for. One of the mantras that we've attached to all this sort of storytelling is, people remember what they felt, not what they saw."</p><p dir="ltr">The process for creating Secret Level episodes sounded pretty intense, though. To get that distillation of a particular idea or aspect of a game in the first place, Blur Studios, the animation studio behind the series, spent time with developers to immerse themselves in the games.</p><p dir="ltr">As Secret Level creator and executive producer Tim Miller explained, Blur developed massive documents, or "decks," about each one.</p><p dir="ltr">"We do a really deep dive with the lore, with the game developers, we build a huge f**king deck. These decks are massive, you know? Like 70 pages of, like, dos and don'ts about the game, here's what's interesting," Miller said. "And of course, we ask the developers, what's interesting about the lore and the characters? What do you feel is territory worth exploring? And sometimes the answer is, let's just make something cool. Sometimes it is, predictably, 'Well, we have a game coming out that focuses on this,' and that's also cool."</p><p dir="ltr">Blur took all the material about the games they created and passed them onto writers, Miller said, who then pitched story ideas--like the one about the funnier side of living forever.</p><p dir="ltr">"Because there's so many [writers], and because they come from such varied backgrounds and it's such a wide variety of POVs, we get a really wide variety of stories, much better than Dave and I sitting in a room, you know, whatever two white guys would come up with," he continued. "It's a much more interesting and broad spectrum of stories. I love that aspect. And we get a lot of unexpected things we would not have come up with."</p><p dir="ltr">New World: Aeternum hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S this week, and is also available on PC, so while it'll be a bit until viewers can see Secret Level's take on Aeternum--the series releases in December--the grimdark fantasy MMO is available for players right now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> - the team behind the rather brilliant (in my humble opinion) Hitman games - hopes its upcoming James Bond origin story will be the start of a trilogy.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy">IGN</a>, IO boss Hakan Abrak said the team feels like it's had "20 plus years of training for the agent fantasy", thanks to Hitman. Indeed, Agent 47 is very Bond-like with his seemingly endless talents and ability to handle any weapon under the sun.</p>
<p>"But obviously James Bond is a different IP. It's a huge IP. It's not our IP. It's actually the first IP that is not our original IP from the ground up," Abrak told the publication, adding one of the most exciting parts of the upcoming release is that it will be an original story for the British spy.</p>

<p>"So it's not a gamification of a movie," Abrak continued. "It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond. It's a Bond we built from the ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is... to work on this together with the family [and create] a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with."</p><p>"It's been, what, almost 15 years since the last game. So it's been a long time," Abrak added. "It definitely is something that is not overexposed in gaming. We actually see that as a strength... There's a lot of people out there who think about GoldenEye as the classic... I don't want to speak too big about it, but I just hope we'll do a thing that will define James Bond in gaming for years to come. And that is not only one game, but that we create a universe for gamers to own for many years to come that we can grow with that next to the Bond on the movies."</p>
<p>As for when we'll all get to see the fruits of the studio's labours, that's still a mystery for now. "I don't have an update today, but believe me, it's itching here as well to be talking about it soon," Abrak admitted. "So we are following our plans. The production's going amazingly well and we will soon be talking more about it. I know it was a little teaser, not a lot of information, but there's a lot of cool stuff coming up."</p>

<p>IO first announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-io-reveals-fresh-project">James Bond game back in 2021</a>. Very little has been shared on it since, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-io-opens-up-a-little-about-its-james-bond-007-game">our Bertie managed to tease a few extra 00-details out of the team last year</a>.</p>
<p>But while we may have to wait a little longer to hear anything more concrete on IO's James Bond, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-to-publish-former-rockstar-and-gta-producers-mysterious-blockbuster-mindseye">has also announced it's taking on publishing duties for MindsEye</a>, the big-budget action adventure in the works from former Rockstar exec Leslie Benzies.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In light of this, the union, STJV, has denounced company leadership and called for workers to mobilize and defend their jobs.</p><p>Don’t Nod has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-creator-dont-nod-has-rough-start-to-the-year-presses-pause-on-two-projects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously said</a> that its latest releases, <em>Jusant </em>and <em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</em>, fell short of “commercial expectations,” leading it to “temporarily” pause two other in-development projects. Despite a focus on the upcoming and thus far well-received <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, Don’t Nod <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-88278" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now says</a> that “amid deteriorating results” it has been “compelled to consider a reorganization project to safeguard its competitiveness in an increasingly demanding and competitive ecosystem.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>STJV, which earlier this year <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/02/dont-nod-ascension-or-free-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a post criticizing Don’t Nod</a> for a burnout-inducing work environment in which "each project erratically follows another," has <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/2024/10/a-dont-nod-le-seul-plan-pour-lavenir-est-le-plan-de-licenciement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deemed</a> the layoff plan “the climax of a series of catastrophic decisions,&nbsp;denounced for a long time&nbsp;by workers' representatives.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Management is hiding being 'the state of the economy' and 'a very competitive market' as excuses for its failures, without ever questioning its inconsistent decisions, which have been harmful to the studio and its workers,” wrote Don’t Nod’s STJV union section in a post published today.</p><p>Workers, they say, must fight back. Specifically, they cite mass mobilization at Ubisoft, which <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-strike-france-pay-yves-guillemot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has included strikes</a> – something STJV also helped organize.&nbsp;</p><p>"The Don't Nod union section, as well as the whole of the STJV, cannot tolerate the company rejecting the responsibilities of its own failures on its workers. We warned them long ago, but they ignored us and accused us of being too aggressive to speak with,” the Don’t Nod STJV union section wrote. “Faced with executives who have decided to mock their workers, a social movement like the one currently happening at Ubisoft is necessary. It is up to us to establish the necessary balance of power to save our jobs. We will not pay for our bosses' mistakes."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A former member of renowned Texas-based support studio Certain Affinity has confirmed frequent reports the team was working on a battle royale mode for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a>, calling the cancelled project a potential "game changer".
</p>
<p>
Certain Affinity has worked on multiple major franchises since its founding in 2006, supporting development on the likes of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a> series, Call of Duty, and Doom 2016. One of its most intriguing projects, however, was the frequently rumoured and oft alluded to - but never officially confirmed - Halo-themed battle royale mode.
</p>
<p>
Whispers of the project began circulating in early 2022, when Certain Affinity <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-battle-royale-rumours-swirl-as-certain-affinity-confirms-it-has-joined-project">announced</a> it was "deepening" its relationship with Halo series stewards <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/343-industries">343 Industries</a> and working to 'evolve' Halo Infinite in "new and exciting ways" - later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/studio-rumoured-to-be-making-halo-infinite-battle-royale-offers-fresh-tease">confirming</a> over 100 employees had been developing the mysterious "something" since at least 2020. But despite the massive amount of time and resources invested in the endeavour, reports surfaced this January that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-battle-royale-reportedly-cancelled-after-years-of-work">Microsoft was pulling the plug</a> - news that was followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-call-of-duty-support-studio-certain-affinity-confirms-its-laying-off-25-employees">25 layoffs at Certain Affinity</a> two months later.

<p>
But while Certain Affinity and Microsoft have never publicly confirmed the succession of reports from reliable sources claiming the canned project was a battle royale mode for Halo Infinite, former Certain Affinity design director Mike Clopper - who recently joined Call of Duty studio Raven Software as a design director - has now done just that.
</p><p>
"I led a large team of designers working on a cancelled Battle Royale mode for Halo," Clopper wrote in an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-clopper-9300811/">update to his LinkedIn profile</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dev-claims-cancelled-halo-infinite-battle-royale-could-have-been-game-changing/">VGC</a>), adding, "I believe this product could have been a game changer for the franchise. We loved playing it and working on it, was a fantastic experience in spite of its cancelation."
</p>
<p>
Since the project's cancellation at Certain Affinity, Microsoft has announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-is-introducing-a-third-person-mode-for-the-very-first-time">third-person mode for Halo Infinite</a> - which is due to arrive next month - and has also shared its future plans for the Halo series. 343 Industries, now rebranded Halo Studios, is currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-developer-343-industries-rebrands-confirms-multiple-new-games">working on multiple new Halo games</a> - and the studio recently released some experimental footage showing how the series might look once it transitions to Unreal Engine 5. Digital Foundry, if you're curious, shared its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-halo-is-moving-to-unreal-engine-5-and-the-first-footage-looks-impressive">first impressions</a> of that "impressive" footage last week.

As files and information gradually surface, most of what we’ve seen so far has been early assets and concept art for old games over the franchise’s many years. But there have been a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1845560379428024713&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1845560379428024713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">few details about upcoming games</a></span> being rounded up by every <em>Pokémon </em>leak and fan account, including next year’s <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> and beyond. Here’s a rundown of what we know based on the leaks, but it is important to note that all this information should be taken with a grain of salt, as projects may have changed, been canceled, or this information could be otherwise proven false.<br></p></div><div><p>There isn’t too much information about upcoming games yet, but a few details about next year’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-kalos-war-az-switch-teaser-trailer-1851290552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-kalos-war-az-switch-teaser-trailer-1851290552"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a></span> have been released that aren’t story spoilers. Specifically, the fact that the game will include Mega Evolutions for Zygarde and Zeraora. The former isn’t surprising, as Zygarde will likely play an important role in <em>Legends: Z-A </em>story, which takes place in the Kalos region from which the legendary Pokémon is based. Zeraora is more surprising, however, because it has no connection to the region, as it was introduced in Generation VII.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0b55d2bba7e922064c9631bd20406316" data-recommend-id="image://0b55d2bba7e922064c9631bd20406316" data-format="jpg" data-width="1241" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ash and Pikachu hug." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ash and Pikachu hug." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0b55d2bba7e922064c9631bd20406316" data-recommend-id="image://0b55d2bba7e922064c9631bd20406316" data-format="jpg" data-width="1241" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ash and Pikachu hug." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We do know a little bit more about the next generation of <em>Pokémon </em>games thanks to the leaks, though they haven’t been officially announced as of this writing.

These Generation X games will apparently take place in an archipelago of several islands.

<p>Bethesda Game Studios is collaborating with Fallout for Hope to bring gamers a special ‘Fallout Day 2025’ broadcast on October 23. Known in the Fallout universe as ‘Bombs Drop Day’, October 23 has been an important date for fans for many years.</p>



<p>Fallout for Hope is a charitable endeavour that sees hundreds of fans, cosplayers, streamers, and creators join forces once a year to raise money for St Jude Children’s Hospital. It has grown exponentially over the years and is preparing to celebrate the fifth iteration of the special event.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-apocalypse-isn-t-all-bad">The Apocalypse Isn’t All Bad</h2>



<p>In 2020, Fallout for Hope hosted its first fundraising event, using Fallout as a creative platform. Today, the ecosystem has blossomed, and more than 750 creators and personalities take part in raising money for an extremely deserving cause once a year. </p>



<p>This year, on ‘Fallout Day’, Fallout for Hope will roll out a four-hour showcase spanning everything from cosplays to in-game fanmade films.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s being put together hand-in-hand with Bethesda Game Studios. Also on October 23, the creative team at BGS will host a broadcast diving into the future of Fallout 76, which saw massive growth this year because of the success of the Fallout TV show.</p>



<p>Creators are being invited to <a href="https://falloutforhope.com/join/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">join the Fallout for Hope stream team</a> and help make a difference by hosting their own fundraising initiatives. To date, Fallout for Hope has helped to raise more than half a million dollars for charity, and the network that supports the event is made up of representatives from more than 80 countries.</p>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios is preparing to go big for Fallout Day this year. It’s already more invested than in previous years, and some fans are holding out hope for an announcement of some kind. Perhaps Fallout 3: Remastered is on the horizon…</p>



<p>Are you going to tune in on Fallout Day? Let us know in the comments.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred</a> adds a ton of new content to the loot-driven dungeon crawler, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-all-tenets-of-akarat-locations-in-nahantu/1100-6527052/">new region</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-all-mercenaries-and-how-to-unlock-them/1100-6527178/">mercenaries</a>, and Runewords. Runewords are created when you combine two runes in an item with two sockets, giving you powerful bonuses. These new items are only available if you have the expansion and there is a large variety, giving you plenty of options, once you unlock them.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to unlock Runewords</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4385804-diablorunewords.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4385804" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4385804-diablorunewords.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4385804"></a><figcaption>Ritual Runes gather offering, which activates the ability of the invocation rune when the required amount is reached.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4385804-diablorunewords.jpeg"></figure><p>You unlock Runewords during the main Vessel of Hatred questline, during the Madman, Crowned quest that takes you to speak to Ormus in the Council Chambers. After speaking to him, you'll receive a briefing on the Runewords mechanics, and an initial set of Runes to begin experimenting with. <strong>Runewords don't start dropping as loot until you complete this quest, </strong>so you try and prioritize getting through the Vessel of Hatred campaign, or at least through this mission<strong>.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">How Runewords work and where to find more</h2><p dir="ltr">For a Runeword to work, you need to combine two halves into a single item. This means it needs to be an item that can have two sockets, a two-handed weapon, pants, chest, or helm. There are ritual Runes and invocation Runes. The ritual Runes create offerings by performing a specific task. For example the Yul Rune grants 50 offering each time you use a skill with a cooldown. Invocation runes activate a special ability when enough offering is collected. Sometimes it's something as simple as reducing any active cooldowns you have, but it can also activate an ability from another class. Combining one of each Rune in a single item creates a Runeword. <strong>You can only have two Runewords activated at once, </strong>but you can unsocket them at a Jeweler at any time to make changes or swap Runes.</p><p dir="ltr">Farming for specific Runes isn't possible currently, but you can farm for Runes in general. Runes can drop from any loot source, but they seem to drop more frequently from activities with a large chest as a reward. Infernal Hordes and summoned bosses seem to typically offer at least one if not a few, and activities like Helltides can drop them as well. While they can drop from almost anywhere, the best place to farm them is the Undercity in Kurast.</p><p dir="ltr">Using Tributes that specifically state they will drop Runes will reward you with Rune for completing an Undercity run, so long as you reach attunement level 1 by clearing enough enemies across the three floors prior to the boss fight. These also drop randomly, although <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-whispers-grim-favors-guide/1100-6514621/">Tree of Whispers</a> caches seem to drop them the most consistently and in the largest quantity. Once you have four of the same Rune, you can reroll them at the Jeweler for a random Rune, with a decent chance for it to be a higher rarity than the Runes you rolled. <strong>Be careful rerolling Runes, </strong>as Runes are required for crafting specific Mythic Uniques. You can check with the Jeweler to see which Runes are required for which Mythic, so you can save them.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/facebook-marketplace-has-incredible-deals-and-i-despise-it.1011531/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/facebook-marketplace-is-not-fun-to-use<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>People who know me know that I love a good deal, whether it is <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-best-gaming-chair-is-a-used-office-chair-from-craigslist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1000 dollar office chairs I found on the street</a>, or surprisingly well made C<a href="https://aftermath.site/chinese-fountain-pen-hongdian-jinhao-asvine-delike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hinese fountain pens</a>. Thrifting is in my blood, and there are few resources for deals quite as robust as Facebook Marketplace. It is also one of the single worst shopping experiences ever devised by god or man. There is no incentive for Meta to fix it, and at this point it should either be destroyed or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22456313/facebook-marketplace-european-commission-formal-antitrust-investigation-eu-uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heavily regulated</a> by the government, because it has taken the ambient flow of good deals and funneled them into an evil, impossible to navigate labyrinth.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Welcome to the Marketplace, it sucks real bad in here man. Credit: Meta.</figcaption></figure><p>Before I got into Marketplace, my Facebook account had been largely dormant for the better part of a decade. As a platform, Facebook has deteriorated so aggressively that it has become supremely irritating to use. Everyone under the age of 40 moved over to Instagram. Though the endless fountain of <a href="https://aftermath.site/facebook-ai-tiny-house" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI slop</a> grabs the most <a href="https://www.404media.co/where-facebooks-ai-slop-comes-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">headlines</a>, the bigger issue is that you are constantly forced to interact with feeds you do not subscribe to. In addition to the feeds of your grandma and a guy from high school you don’t talk to anymore because he moved to New Hampshire to become more racist, you now have a random assortment of strangers, niche fan groups, influencers, and an endless stream of content that even TikTok would not touch. While this deterioration – a forced intrusion into your digital life by strangers and grifters to juice interaction –&nbsp; is not unique to Facebook, Facebook manages to take all of the worst algorithmic choices from other platforms and somehow deliver them to you with none of their benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>That Facebook can have any redeeming qualities given its precipitous slide is a testament to how good Facebook Marketplace can potentially be. What makes this possible is that the best deals are often from people who are either clueless or apathetic about what their belongings are worth. This usually takes the form of bored rich people, who are either too lazy or old to use Google. What makes Facebook Marketplace an engine for finding those people is that those are the exact demographic who still actively use Facebook. Putting a big button on it that says “sell that stuff you’ve been meaning to donate to Goodwill” is an incredible engine of commerce, because nobody involved in the process has to register a new account.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately it is a Meta product, and as a result the process of using it is like an ironically designed torture in hell. I loathe it deeply for the following reasons.</p><h2>I do not want to buy a couch in Salem.</h2><p>The process of using Facebook Marketplace is a lot like Craigslist if Craigslist lied to you constantly. If you ask Facebook Marketplace for results for “Milo Baughman couch” within a 20 mile radius of your house, you will get whatever results match that, plus several other listings hundreds of miles away, plus a bunch of stuff you were searching before that are unrelated to what you are currently searching for. This is not unique to Facebook, but it is the core of the experience that Facebook helped usher in. The modern internet abhors a void, and so any product designed by an evil tech startup will never say “sorry, we don’t have any of those.” Instead it will provide an endless stream of OK results mixed with slightly imprecise suggestions algorithmically tailored to your online profile.&nbsp;</p><p>You can technically narrow this down by distance, price or date listed, but the second you do any other search, it will reset these suggestions. Mercifully, you can save searches with filters, but this feature is nowhere near as intuitive or exact as Craigslist’s.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Eventually if you ask it for a vintage designer it will give you a horse. Credit: Meta</figcaption></figure><p>Most infuriating of all, it will almost always ignore any distance parameters you give it, insisting that all of its out-of-the-way listings are “worth the trip”! Really, Facebook? Is it “worth the trip” to drive to Philly to pick up an OKish bookcase I would need to refinish? No other app like this (like Craigslist, Mercari and Offerup) manages to so aggressively fight and attempt to bamboozle the user every step of the way, and I hope that one day government regulators decide that this behavior is illegal, because it feels like the shit that would cause you to get a class action check in the mail for 25 cents eight years from now.&nbsp;</p><h2>You have to go on Facebook to use it.</h2><figure><figcaption>I don't know who any of these people are but I think they meant to quote H.G. Welles. Credit: Meta</figcaption></figure><p>When and if government regulators<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265983/doj-google-search-remedies-monopoly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> finally break up Google</a>, I need them to come for Facebook Marketplace next. This is because Facebook Marketplace itself requires that you interact with the Facebook app or website in order to use it. Unlike Messenger, there is no dedicated app that lets you ignore every other part of the site. And while there are some shockingly useful Facebook groups, having to go through the worst skinner box on the internet to get to the deals feels like going into a particularly dead mall because there’s one solid thrift store sandwiched between the shell of a Suncoast Video and a TJ Maxx that looks like it just survived a flood. There are many unpleasant ways to buy things from the internet, but nothing crawls in your gut and dies like logging into Facebook. This is also exacerbated by the fact that contacting strangers for deals is not just done in Facebook Messenger, but in an easy to miss sub-tab of Facebook Messenger, thus confusing any person you would theoretically wish to contact. Even though Meta owns Instagram and WhatsApp, it boggles my mind that such a clearly broken site as Facebook still has perceived value and is allowed to operate the way it is.</p><h3>It makes me realize how much I miss what Craigslist and junk stores used to be.</h3><figure><figcaption>I should have never doubted you. Credit: Craigslist.</figcaption></figure><p>In an ideal world, none of us would have ever left Craigslist, but unfortunately Craigslist as an ecosystem can be a mixed bag. This is a shame, because the actual experience of using Craigslist rocks – it doesn’t lie to you (although the people do) and it treats you like an adult, allowing you to have precise control over what you are searching for. There are still deals to be had, but a lot of the time if you are on Craigslist you probably know what your stuff is worth. The golden years of Craigslist feel distant. Perhaps some of this is the convenience of not just Facebook Marketplace, but also competing marketplaces like Mercari and Offerup. Part of it feels like they never got over <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/23/596460672/craigslist-shuts-down-personals-section-after-congress-passes-bill-on-traffickin" target="_blank">the loss of the personals section</a> following the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/4/13/17172762/fosta-sesta-backpage-230-internet-freedom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passing of FOSTA-SESTA</a>, an ineffective bill package that did nothing except make the lives of sex workers actively more dangerous.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook Marketplace’s dominance is made worse by the fact that many of the good thrift and junk stores I used to go to are long dead. There are a few holdouts I still frequent and love, particularly far away from the city center, but the ones that remain are often overpriced and over-curated. A good junk store should look like a hoarder’s house that just so happens to have a cash register set up. It should smell like water damage and black mold. These kinds of junk and vintage stores are too low margin to exist in any place with high commercial rent. What’s more, the topography of most cities has been thoroughly mapped – everywhere is a known quantity ruined by overexposure. This is not Facebook Marketplace’s fault. But every single time I log into it, I am reminded of the joy of digging through crates and getting low level lung damage to find a jewel. Maybe one day, if the real estate market collapses violently enough, we will return to those days.</p><figure><figcaption>This is what bliss looks like: The Thing in Greenpoint. Credit: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cv4499yrPwW/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Thing.</a></figcaption></figure><p>None of this is a recommendation for Facebook Marketplace. This is an unfortunate statement of where we are at. You can buy some incredible stuff on that site (I do regularly) but every single time you do, it will take a little part of you. To be on Facebook Marketplace is to experience that feeling of trying to run through mud that permeates every single engagement-optimized platform, that lack of precision that feels like your mind is slipping. Maybe Marketplace should be reformed, but honestly it’s probably best if it continues to spiral due to neglect until the entire thing becomes so precarious that nobody logs on any more.&nbsp;</p><p>I pray that one day we will all be forced to return to Craigslist. But until then, there’s a guy near me with a pretty good looking vintage bookshelf and I hope he remembers to check his inconveniently-placed Marketplace inbox.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-demo-out-now-on-all-platforms/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Digital Extremes has announced a demo release for the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-is-out-this-winter-will-add-romance-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warframe: 1999 update</a>, due later this Winter. The demo is available starting today on all platforms where Warframe is playable. Any player can access the Warframe: 1999 demo after completing the Awakening and Vor's Prize tutorial quests. They just need to find a mysterious infested terminal in the main ship's flight deck.</p>
<p>Stepping into the shoes of Arthur (played by Ben Starr) and his trustworthy Atomicyle, the demo lets players check out a small slice of the twisting alleyways of downtown Höllvania in a replayable Exterminate-style mission. You'll find the new enemy faction, the Scaldra, and their toxic goo weapons, barring your way. Those who manage to complete the Warframe: 1999 demo before the full update launches this Winter will get the Protokol Longsword Skin.</p>
<p>New cosmetic items are also hitting the Warframe Market today to celebrate the in-game Halloween event, Nights of Naberus. Get spooky with the Lycanblight Syandana Backpiece and Shoulder Armour or the Charger Liset Ship Skin.</p>
<p>By the way, as promised at TennoCon, Digital Extremes has now released the full musical track originally featured in the TennoCon demo. "The Call" by Matthew Chalmers and featuring vocalist Francesca Hauser is now available on Spotify, Apple, YouTube Music, and Bandcamp.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Warframe: 1999 will see the introduction of a romance system. Players can send email messages to other members of the Hex Squad and, if they 'play their cards right,' even receive a New Year's kiss. Hex Squad will be voiced by an amazing cast: Amelia Tyler (Baldur's Gate 3's narrator), Kevin Afghani (Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder), Melissa Medina (Zanuhali and Nitowikwe in Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail), Trieve Blackwood-Cambridge (one of the available player voices in Forza Horizon 5), and Alpha Takahashi (Hanako Arasaka in Cyberpunk 2077).</p>

Perhaps you’ve realized that gathering them all can be an overwhelming task. Maybe you’ve had a cry. Luckily, we can take the guesswork out of <em>one </em>of those many currencies in this guide by telling you the ways you can obtain the all-too-rare Ornate Coins.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h129281"><a id=""></a><strong>What are Ornate Coins?</strong></h2><p>Ornate Coins are one of two main currencies you use in <em>Throne and Liberty’s</em> Shop tab. Unlike Lucent, the game’s premium currency that is purchased by breaking out your credit card and paying up, Ornate Coins can’t be bought with real money. Instead, these special coins are obtained in-game or via another odd method we’ll explain further down.</p><p>As for what you can buy with Ornate Coins—well, there’s a lot, actually. There are some <strong>exclusive Amitoi</strong> (pets) and titles for your character, as well as limited weekly stocks of important materials like <strong>weapon growthstones, armor growthstones, accessory growthstones, and fishing bait chests</strong>. You can even buy dyes and sewing threads to customize your armor and outfits.</p><h2 id="h129282"><a id=""></a><strong>How to get Ornate Coins</strong><br></h2><figure id="" data-id="b2c1051e2d0274ac5c61fc113cf7db9e" data-recommend-id="image://b2c1051e2d0274ac5c61fc113cf7db9e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A very big fight against a skeletal beast." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A very big fight against a skeletal beast." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NCSoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b2c1051e2d0274ac5c61fc113cf7db9e" data-recommend-id="image://b2c1051e2d0274ac5c61fc113cf7db9e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A very big fight against a skeletal beast." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are two main ways to get Ornate Coins: Finding codex entries or waiting for in-game mail from the dev team. Let’s dive into how it all works.</p><h3 id="h129283"><a id=""></a><strong>Finding codex entries</strong></h3><p>If you’ve been exploring the vast open world in <em>Throne and Liberty</em>, you’ve almost certainly noticed the purple books and pages scattered around most zones in the game. By clicking and reading these, you’ll pick up codex entries, which grant you Ornate Coin x3 each.</p><p>Since codex entries are finite, this means you have a cap of how many Ornate Coins you can find with this method. Even if you round up every single codex entry, you’ll score just over 450 coins, meaning you’ll need to patiently wait to get your hands on them in other ways. And as of right now, there’s only one of those…</p><h3 id="h129284"><a id=""></a><strong>In-game mail</strong></h3><p>So, look, <em>Throne and Liberty</em> is an MMO, which means that server issues are inevitable. Hell, at the time of writing this guide, the world server is down and making it impossible for me to access the game. But while that’s undoubtedly irritating, it has one silver lining: You may get more Ornate Coins because of it.</p><p>That’s right—the dev team will frequently send you Ornate Coins as an apology for server maintenance (particularly when it’s unexpected). So any time the game is down for a while, consider taking a look at your mail next time you log in to see if you’ve obtained some coins for your trouble.</p><p>That all being said, <em>Throne and Liberty</em> is still a new game with a lot of fresh players arriving daily to increase the server load. This means that it’s likely to have more issues early in its life cycle and unexpected maintenance periods may be less frequent in the future, so I wouldn’t count on this method being consistent. Besides, we don’t know for sure if the team will continue doling out Ornate Coins for these problems permanently, or if it’s just a temporary way of keeping folks happy. Only time will tell.</p><hr><p>Ornate Coins aren’t the only thing that can be tough to come by in <em>Throne and Liberty</em>, though. Salt is also a bit scarce—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/throne-and-liberty-how-to-find-salt-cooking-amazon-1851667910&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/throne-and-liberty-how-to-find-salt-cooking-amazon-1851667910">unless you know where to look for it</a></span>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game quickly earned a loyal fan base thanks to a phenomenal main cast of characters and a compelling narrative hook. The game puts you in the shoes of Max Caulfield, who discovers she has the ability to rewind time after saving a friend from being shot by a bully in the school bathroom. She and her friend then team up to unravel the mysteries of their quaint Pacific Northwest town, including uncovering the whereabouts of a missing girl.

You’ll microdose <em>Groundhog Day</em> throughout the game as you rewind your mistakes in order to try again and impress your friends, or do better on a pop quiz. Time manipulation also becomes a mechanic for navigating the world, as sometimes you need to move or replace objects to get into previously closed-off areas. Max’s gift, however, isn’t all powerful. You can only turn back time so far and it can’t always save you from making dumb decisions. And eventually, because of its limitations, you have to choose one version of reality to live with.<br></p><p>Beyond the fascinating central mechanic, <em>Life Is Strange</em> thrives on its characters and world. The supernatural intrigue and mystery of the town only serve to hook you in, but the characters will keep you hanging on. That begins with Max herself, a young woman on the verge of graduating and hopefully leaving her home town to pursue a career in photography. She’s somewhat of a loner and only falls into the circumstances that drive the game’s plot due to that chance encounter with her old friend in the bathroom. That friend is Chloe, who Max was close with in childhood but hasn’t spoken to in a while. Every other student, teacher, and Arcadia Bay resident you interact with has a story of their own that connects to the larger plot taking place in the town. At the end of the game, though, Max and Chloe’s relationship proves to be the beating heart of <em>Life Is Strange</em>, and each episode adds layers to the two characters and their connection until it ends in a climactic final choice that only the two of them can make. It’s a beautiful game and it’s worth brushing up on before <em>Double Exposure</em>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/asmongold-starforge-otk-shambles/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/asmongold-starforge-otk-shambles/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Asmongold recently uploaded a lengthy apology video following controversial comments made about the Palestinian people during a Twitch stream. Following his tirade, during which he labelled Palestinians as ‘terrible people’ and ‘inferior’, he earned himself a temporary ban on Twitch, but it seems that has been something of a wake-up call for the creator.</p>



<p>In his video, he revealed he’s cutting down the amount of time he spends streaming. He also confirmed he’s stepping back from leadership positions at both OTK <strong>and </strong>Starforge.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-winding-down">Winding Down</h2>



<p>Zack ‘Asmongold’ Hoyt has seen his fair share of scandals over the years, but this latest escapade takes the prize. His recent racist rant earned him the backlash of a global community, and he has recognised in this latest video that he might have hit an all-time low.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I need to get myself in check. I need to get my mind under control. I need to fix my fucking life. It’s insane. I think about it – it’s just in shambles. Everything about my life is basically fucked.</p>



<p>I’m going to step away from my leadership position at OTK and Starforge and everything. They’re fine with that – they respect that, and I want to do this. I want to do this not only for them but mainly for myself so I can be a better version of myself.</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>He then went deep on his apology, explaining that he has ‘read a lot of very bad things about Islam’ and has always cast an ill light on the religion because of that. With that in mind, the 34-year-old creator plans to visit the Middle East to witness Islam first-hand. It was also mentioned that as a punishment, he’s going to clean his home without a cleaning company to back him up.</p>



<p>If you know how Asmongold lives, then you understand how immense a task that will be.</p>



<p>Stepping back from leadership positions at OTK, a streaming organisation, and Starforge, a custom PC company, is just the start.</p>



<p>Going forward, Hoyt plans to make big changes to his content:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My plan is to, when I get unbanned, I’ll keep streaming regularly, and I want to focus more on trying to do things that are fun, trying to laugh more with people rather than at people. It’s about a focus, and it’s about a tone. I listened to my tone in that clip and I just sounded like such a piece of shit. </p>



<p>I don’t want to be that person anymore.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you accept Asmongold’s apology, or do you think he’s going to slip back into his old ways as soon as he’s back? Let us know in the comments.</p>

It's a great match for the new and more powerful PlayStation 5 Pro that's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-ps5-pro">currently up for preorder</a>.</p><h2><s>6</s>5" LG Evo C3 4K OLED Smart TV: The Best PS5 TV</h2><div catalogid="395ac392-d076-44a8-84e5-568d7eb19a08" id="189727"><div id="189727" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>65" LG Evo C3 4K OLED Smart TV</h3></p></div><p>The C3 is the previous generation 2023 model among LG's highly vaunted C-series OLED TV lineup. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. The C3 uses LG's Evo panel, which offers higher brightness levels than traditional OLED TVs. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV excels at displaying 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. Compared to other OLED TVs, LG has the most generations of updates and improvements.</p><p>The C3 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV. It has four HDMI 2.1 ports all capable of up to 120Hz refresh rate at 4K resolution. That's great news for PS5 (and now PS5 Pro), Xbox Series X, and PC gamers, since several games can be played at frame rates of 120fps. The C3 also supports variable refresh rate (VRR) including Nvidia G-Sync and auto low latency mode (ALLM). When connected to a PC, it supports chroma 4:4:4 for better text legibility.</p><p>A particularly nice feature that isn't advertised often is the surprisingly light weight of the C3. The 65" TV weighs in at only 36.6 pounds without the stand. That's because the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that's lighter than the plastics most TVs use. It might not matter much in the long term, but this is a welcome advantage when you are first setting up your TV, especially if you plan on wall mounting.</p><h3>What's the difference between the 2023 C3 and the 2024 C4?</h3><p>The LG Evo C3 is a 2023 model, just one year behind the 2024 LG Evo C4. So what are the differences? Aside from the $300 price difference, not much. The most important trait – picture quality – is more or less identical. Where the C4 improves on the C3 are an upgraded processor, newer WebOS smart interface, and a higher 144Hz refresh rate, all of which are updates that you may very well never notice.</p><h3>Should You Buy Now or Wait for Black Friday?</h3><p>Although this is an extremely good discount for one of our favorite gaming TVs, you may be wondering if you should wait until Black Friday to make a purchase. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday 2024</a> will definitely have more options available, however if this particular model drops in price even more, it certainly won't be by too much. Whatever you decide, this discount makes this easily one of the<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-deals-labor-day-2024-sales"> best TV deals right now</a>.</p><p><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-sells-45-million-in-just-over-a-month<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The Emperor is pleased.</h2></div><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> has sold 4.5 million copies, publisher Focus Entertainment has announced.</p><p>The Saber Interactive-developed action game set in Games Workshop’s grimdark science fiction universe had already broken records upon its launch on September 9, becoming the most-played Warhammer 40,000 or Warhammer video game ever released on Steam with huge peak concurrent player counts. Now, a little over a month after launch, Space Marine 2 has hit 4.5 million players.</p><p>Last month, Saber Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>how the breakout success of Space Marine 2 had “changed everything” for the company</u></a>. At the time, Willits wouldn’t go into hard numbers, either in revenue or profit terms, but did go on the record to say <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-id-software-execs-space-marine-2-is-selling-faster-than-any-of-their-games-including-doom-and-quake"><u>Space Marine 2 is the fastest-selling game he's ever worked on</u></a>, and that includes all the Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein, and Rage games id Software released over the 24 years he was at the studio.</p><p>Speaking to IGN, Willits revealed that the budget for Space Marine 2 was less than half that of Doom Eternal, the last game he was id Software studio director on before leaving to join Saber in 2019. It seems likely that Space Marine 2, whose standard edition currently costs $59.99 on Steam and $69.99 on console, is already a highly profitable endeavor for all involved.</p><p>There are already ideas floating around for the now inevitable Space Marine 3, but in the shorter term Space Marine 2 has a confirmed Year 1 roadmap of post-launch support to deliver. Speaking of which, Focus has confirmed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-reveals-new-tyranid-enemy-the-huge-hierophant-bio-titan"><u>the imminent arrival of the Tyranid Hierophant Bio-Titan enemy type</u></a>, the new Neo-Volkite pistol, and the hotly anticipated Dark Angels chapter cosmetic pack. But that’s not all that’s coming to Space Marine 2. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-spot-chapter-all-but-confirmed-to-get-cosmetic-pack-after-the-dark-angels">Eagle-eyed fans have spotted the Space Marine chapter now all-but confirmed to get a cosmetic pack after the Dark Angels</a>, and even an unannounced new Thousand Sons enemy type.</p><p>Saber recently released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/big-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-patch-30-adds-pc-ultrawide-support-private-pve-lobbies-and-more"><u>Space Marine 2’s game-changing patch 3.0</u></a>, which made <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-patch-30-made-a-seemingly-innocuous-change-to-the-games-ending-and-now-warhammer-40000-lore-fans-are-losing-their-minds"><u>a seemingly innocuous change to the ending that got Warhammer 40,000 fans excited</u></a>.
