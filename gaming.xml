            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Have you all been a bit hot and bothered this week? It’s yet another heatwave in the UK, so sun screen, sun glasses, breezy clothing and hydration have been the order of the week.</p>
<p>But there’s always games, as well. I’ve had two reviews on the go, for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/12/abyssus-review/">Abyssus</a> and Drag x Drive, both of which sadly missed their potential for very different reasons. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/13/drag-x-drive-review/">Drag x Drive</a> in particular missed a lot of the colourful Nintendo charm that you’d want, though the core wheelchair basketball is enjoyable.</p>

<p>Much more exciting is a trio of games that I played to experience some Gamescom previews before Gamescom, which I will be able to tell you all about next week… during Gamescom.</p>
<p><strong>Miguel</strong> was one of my Abyssus buddies, but alongside that co-op rogueliking, he played a bunch of&nbsp;Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, and a bit of his current gacha game favourites – Girls Frontline 2: Exilium and Zenless Zone Zero – &nbsp;and the “incredible” indie visual novel South Scrimshaw.</p>

<p>It’s also been a bit of Death Stranding for <strong>Gamoc</strong>, who joined that with some Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and reviews of Sengoku Dynasty and Peglin for review.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has had the cosy indie game Tiny Bookshop on the go for a review, which “is letting me live my dream.” I never knew he wanted to be a travelling book seller, but there we go!</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> thoroughly enjoyed finishing his run through DOOM: The Dark Ages, but has had plenty more on the go. He’s been playing both Shinobi: Art of Vengeance and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown for review, but much more concerning for his time and finances, he and his son have got into Warhammer 40,000 lately. He’s boosting his understanding of the Grimdark future by playing through Space Marine 2 a few weeks back and has now moved on to the confusingly named Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters – “a terrific XCOM type game which is proving to be great fun!”</p>
<p>Tuffcub played some of the Battlefield 6 beta last weekend “which was fun”, and has been replaying Uncharted 4. “There’s a lot of cut scenes in that game aren’t there? Does seem to drag on playing it now…”</p>
<div role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa="virtual-list-item" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1755246850.156659" tabindex="-1" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1755246850.156659">
<p>Having joined me for a touch of Abyssus – “which was briney fun albeit with some toxic banter from the editor… and a lot of Terry turrets” – <strong>Steve</strong> has been struggling with some of the bosses in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, and making a start on a Switch 2 game which he’ll tell you about in due course.</p>
</div>

<p>And finally, <strong>Dom’s</strong> popping off on holiday today, but has preceded this with a busy week of gaming that has included Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar, Donkey Kong Bananza, Grounded 2,&nbsp;Is This Seat Taken?, and a spot of Madden too. What will he manage to play while he’s away?</p>
<p>But we’ll leave that question hanging in order to ask another. What have&nbsp;<em>you</em> played?</p>

That’s because the word Paladin was found in the name of a build uploaded to Blizzard’s servers (2.5.Xpaladin67961).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Paladin is one of the most popular classes from Diablo 2, so its arrival in Diablo 4, should it happen, would be celebrated by the game's community. Now, this may be <em>nothing</em> (and Diablo 4 fans are already joking that the Paladin will be added as a Mercenary rather than a new class), but a new class is expected from Diablo 4’s second expansion, and the Paladin would certainly be a crowd-pleaser.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Blizzard confirmed earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4s-next-expansion-after-vessel-of-hatred-wont-come-until-2026">Diablo 4’s next expansion was pushed out of 2025 and into 2026</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">McDonald's has announced fresh restrictions aimed at combating scalpers, as it launches the next wave of its enormously popular Pokémon promotion in Japan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last weekend, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mcdonalds-pokmon-card-giveaway-ends-early-amid-restaurant-chaos-scalping-and-widespread-food-waste-as-fans-buy-dozens-of-happy-meals-only-to-dump-uneaten-burgers">fast food chain was swamped by scalpers who bought up dozens of Happy Meals just for the exclusive Pokémon cards within them</a>. Photos and videos posted to social media by outraged fans highlighted arguments among patrons over the scalping, and showed examples of huge food wastage, with the Happy Meals dumped by the side of the road or left in the restaurant uneaten. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The incident meant McDonald's ran out of its cards within hours of its three-day promotion going live, forcing the burger brand to apologise to Pokémon fans left empty-handed. And now, McDonald's has gone further — with new rules regarding the availability of Pokémon merchandise in Happy Meals applied from today.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We deeply apologize to our customers who regularly use McDonald's restaurants, as well as to our store staff and many others for any inconvenience caused by the Happy Set Pokémon Card Campaign," McDonald's wrote in a new <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0814a/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> released this morning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We will continue to release the Pokémon Happy Meals, which include five different toys, as scheduled from Friday, August 15. However, in light of the current situation, we will be implementing the following purchase restrictions for three days until Sunday, August 17th."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These restrictions include a maximum purchase of three Happy Meals per group (this was previously higher, and per person). "If you order four or more," McDonald's now says, "we will refuse your purchase and cancel the order."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Furthermore, during this period, there may be restrictions on use at some stores and during certain hours," the chain continued. "We will not allow purchases from customers who do not follow the above rules and etiquette."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest difference with the coming weekend's promotion, however, is that it no longer features Pokémon cards at all — just Pokémon toys. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/untitled-1-1754903573029.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A Pokémon fan shows a collection of Happy Meal card packs, while food lies unopened and dumped.

However, it's unclear how the chain can and will be able to enforce this. Still, what's obvious is the brand has taken note of the social media outrage — and the disappointment among young Pokémon fans and families at not being able to get cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused to customers who look forward to dining with their children, grandchildren, or friends due to these purchase restrictions," McDonald's concluded. "We will continue to review and improve these sales methods and measures, listening to the opinions of our customers and store staff."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Pokémon news, last week <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-updated-with-new-card-art-following-ho-oh-plagiarism-controversy">The Pokémon Company replaced the art for its Lugia and Ho-Oh cards</a> which had fallen foul to claims they included fan designs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>Sonic the Hedgehog isn't loved by everyone, but most people can agree that the music in his games is generally top-tier stuff. We expect the soundtrack to the upcoming Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be stellar, and Sega has released a brand new video that highlights six of the tunes in the game.</p>
<p>The video below, which runs for almost eight minutes, features a mix of six remixed tracks from CrossWorlds put together by Kanon Oguni!. These tracks from the official soundtrack are said to be inspired by courses in the game based on Sonic Unleashed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-colours">Sonic Colors</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-sa2-dc">Sonic Adventure 2</a>.</p>

            <p>Floating amid the scrap belts of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space</a>, some news. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a> is now owned by developers Blackbird Interactive, with the studio having bought control of the ship-stripping <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> from publishers Saber Interactive. They're not having a rest after cracking open that bubbly either, writing that "multiple Hardspace projects" are in development.</p>
<p>Blackbird revealed all of this via a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1161580/view/836099892906557718">Steam post</a>, writing that they've "reached an agreement with Focus Entertainment, our publishing partner, to reacquire full ownership of the Hardspace: Shipbreaker intellectual property". So, as you might expect, doing plenty of Hardspacey things is going to be a big part of the studio's plans going forwards.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To that end, they revealed here that "multiple Hardspace projects are already in development". "We're not ready to share any specifics yet, but rest assured we have paid close attention to your feedback and are laser-focused on ensuring this next generation of Hardspace expands on the original game in all the right ways," Blackbird added.</p>
<p>In the run up to releasing these new games, the studio aim to "grow the Hardspace community", urging folks to join the series' <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FYEcBqgHa">Discord server</a>, where breaking updates will be launched into your orbit whenever they're ready. You can also <a href="https://blackbirdinteractive.com/lynxpioneerprogram/">pre-register for the "LYNX Pioneer Program" via Blackbird's website</a>, if you fancy the chance to take part in early playtests and offer feedback on future Hardspace games. There's some other community stuff like contests and the chance to generally chat with devs included in that too.</p>
<p>Also, Hardspace: Shipbreaker itself will be getting a "small update" that'll mainly take care of housekeeping details to indicate the change in ownership, like revamping the privacy policies and splash screens.</p>
<p>Our Liam wrote the following about the game in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hardspace-shipbreaker-review-moreish-sci-fi-work-sim-sticks-the-landing">his review</a>:</p>
<blockquote>What a thrill, to exist on the sidelines. To look longingly out towards the stars and wonder what’s going on beyond your little corner of this expansive universe. To understand a society purely through its waste products. Hardspace: Shipbreaker is a truly marvellous thing to spend time within. I quite like being a background character, it turns out. Being the hero is overrated. If Shipbreaker has taught me anything it’s that the satisfaction of a hard day's work beats saving the universe every single time.</blockquote>
<p>There are also thoughts on it from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hardspace-shipbreaker-and-the-joy-of-doing-a-boring-spacejob-perfectly">Alice O</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-want-to-like-hardspace-shipbreaker-but-im-very-bad-at-it-and-it-makes-me-sad">Alice B</a>, if you're keen to fill your Alice quota.</p>

<p>With Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater slithering toward release, it’s the perfect time to learn about the differences between the remake and the original Snake Eater 3 title from over two decades ago.</p>



<p>Due to be released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-release-date-confirmed-during-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 28</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater could revive the Metal Gear Solid franchise after a few years of dormancy following the disappointment of the last release, Metal Gear Solid Survive, in 2018.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for details on all the big differences between the original title and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, we’ve got you covered.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Blending in. Image via Konami</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-no-kojima-amp-shinkawa-involved">No Kojima &amp; Shinkawa Involved</h3>



<p>One of the biggest points to note is that the original creator, <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hideo Kojima</a>, and the original artist, Yoji Shinkawa, are not involved in the remake. However, the developer pledged to stay fully faithful to the original content.</p>



<p>While neither of the starring pair is on board, their original work will still shine through. With Kojima not on board, Konami’s internal studio, Konami Digital Entertainment, is developing the game, while Noriaki Okamura, producer of Metal Gear Survive and Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops, and Yuji Korekado, creative producer of Metal Gear Solid V, are supervising.</p>



<p>Singaporean studio Virtuos also contributed to development.</p>

<p>While those on PlayStation and PC will be able to play through a remake of Snake vs. Monkey, a crossover with Sony’s Ape Escape that released with the original title, Xbox Series X|S players will have a brand new experience with a crossover with a Konami property, Bomberman.</p>



<p>Snake vs. Bomberman has been created entirely for the Xbox Series X|S version of the game, given that Sony probably wouldn’t want their Ape Escape franchise to feature on the rival platform. </p>



<h3 id="h-trophy-amp-achievement-changes">Trophy &amp; Achievement Changes</h3>



<p>Several changes have been made to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-trophy-list-all-achievement-trophy-differences-in-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy and Achievement list</a> for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, marking one of the biggest differences for the game compared to the original. </p>



<p>Some Trophies have been removed entirely, while others have had their rarity changed. Others have been streamlined into a single Trophy or Achievement for achieving 100% of an objective, whereas previously they were broken down into separate objectives.</p>



<p>Minor adjustments include some changes to names and descriptions, though the core task remains the same.</p>



<h3 id="h-updated-graphics">Updated Graphics</h3>



<p>One of the biggest differences in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater compared to the original title is updated graphics, which is a given considering the original game released over two decades ago.</p>



<p>Expect the graphics to be in-line with recent AAA titles, showcasing the beloved game in a new light. While there are these visual changes, the core story remains the same, and no major adjustments have been made on that front.</p>







<p><strong>Given the original title released over two decades ago, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a must-play for anyone who adores the original title.</strong></p>



<p>Bringing the game into the modern generation provides the Metal Gear Solid franchise with an opportunity to attract new players, but those who are well-versed with the franchise will be crucial to the game’s success. If you want to see other Metal Gear Solid games receive a remaster, I’d highly recommend buying.</p>



<p>The good thing about a remake is you know what to expect with the story, so you won’t be disappointed or feel short-handed. Instead, use the game as a trip down memory lane to reminisce about your first experiences playing the original game.</p>

<p>That's one radical highway</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>With the release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> drawing ever closer (that's 25th September, speed freaks), Sega is keeping the old hype train rolling along in the right direction with a brand new remix of some of the tunes featured in the upcoming racer, which, we have to say, looks absolutely cracking.</p>
<p>You can check out the video in full above, and honestly, if you've got any nostalgia or love for Sonic in your bones at all, brace for some unexpected emotions.</p>
<p>Here's some further details from the official press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SEGA released the third OST video for <em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds,</em> spotlighting a DJ mix that features six remixed tracks from the game. The OST focuses on music inspired by courses including Apotos, Dragon Road, and Market Street based on <em>Sonic Unleashed</em>, Galactic Parade and Sweet Mountain based on <em>Sonic Colors</em>, and Radical Highway based on <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em> will release digitally and physically on September 25, 2025 for Switch 1. The Switch 2 version - which will be available as a paid upgrade path from the Switch 1 version - will release this year, too, they've just not put an official date on it. Oh, and physical versions for Switch 2 won't see the light of day until early 2026.</p>
<p>On that note, while there is a little delay for physical Switch 2 fans, as we reported a little while back, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/sonic-racing-crossworlds-on-switch-2-will-feature-the-full-base-game-on-cartridge">the full game will at least be on the cart itself</a>. Hooray!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Reliable insider billbil-kun has <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/non-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ne-sera-pas-disponible-sur-la-nintendo-switch-2-a-sa-sortie-60383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 should launch on November 14, echoing the previous rumor shared by TheGhostofHope last month on X. Billbil-kun however added that there won't be a version of the Nintendo Switch 2, and there is no information on whether Activision Blizzard plans a later port of the game for the console.</p>



<p>The question arose within the Call of Duty community because back in February 2023, Microsoft, during its efforts to conclude the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-and-nintendo-sign-binding-10-year-contract-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a ten-year deal with Nintendo to bring the popular first-person shooter franchise to the Switch platforms. So far, no Call of Duty game has been released on Nintendo consoles. With the release of the Switch 2, it should certainly be easier to bring new titles to the freshly released hardware; after all, Black Ops 7 is also coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and it's been established that the Switch 2 is more powerful than Sony's and Microsoft's previous generation consoles. Still, there are clearly some hurdles to be overcome first.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will also be released in physical editions on consoles (PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X) at the price of €79.99. According to billbil-kun, pre-orders will be opened on Wednesday, August 20, right after Geoff Keighley's Gamescom Opening Night Live event. </p>



<p>The game itself is co-developed by Treyarch and Raven Software. The campaign follows the events seen in 2012's Black Ops II. Ten years later, David Mason (voiced once again by Milo Ventimiglia) and his team of agents will pursue "a manipulative enemy who weaponizes fear above all else". Of course, there will also be plenty of multiplayer modes, including a round-based cooperative Zombies mode. When it comes to gameplay, the developers promised an evolution of the omnimovement system seen in last year's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>

<p>The launch of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is rapidly approaching, and many questions still linger about whether the game is a remake, so we’ve got the answer.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-release-date-confirmed-during-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">August 28</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-to-release-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims of a Nintendo Switch 2 launch</a> later this year, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater could spark a rebirth for the fan-favorite Konami franchise after years of dormancy for the series—and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-trophy-list-all-achievement-trophy-differences-in-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trophy list</a> shows big challenges await.</p>



<p>With fans having waited so long for a new Metal Gear Solid release, there may be some confusion about the remake status, but we’re here to clear up any confusion.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Here we go again. Image via Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a fully fledged remake of 2004’s Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.</strong></p>



<p>Snake Eater is a fan-favorite for the franchise, as, while it was the fifth Metal Gear Solid game in the series, it was the first chronologically. As such, it is the first remake in the series and was chosen due to its time setting, which is set in 1964 during the Cold War.</p>



<p>The game will stick true to the original story that first played out over two decades ago, with the biggest difference being that neither Hideo Kojima nor original artist Yoji Shinkawa have been involved in the game’s development.</p>



<p>Snake Eater’s remake was first announced in May 2023, representing a shift in approach from Konami after the previous decision to move away from developing and publishing major third-party games. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is the first title in the franchise to release since 2018’s spin-off title Metal Gear Survive.</p>







<p><strong>There has been no confirmation of any further Metal Gear Solid remakes, but the door is certainly open for them to take place if Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is successful.</strong></p>



<p>The decision to remake Snake Eater first provides Konami with the opportunity to tell the story of the franchise chronologically for the first time, which could mean that remakes for Metal Gear Solid 1 &amp; 2 are next in line. </p>



<p>However, speaking to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202410/19148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a> in 2024, series producer Noriaki Okamura claimed remaking the first Metal Gear Solid would be much harder than Snake Eater, with the same difficulties for the second game. This is due to the fact both titles originally released on the MSX2 and Nintendo Entertainment System, meaning much more would need to be built for the ground up in a remade version.</p>



<p>There has already been a Master Collection for the series, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-had-a-pretty-rough-launch-so-konami-says-its-being-more-careful-with-vol-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Volume 2 confirmed to be in the works</a>, but these are not remakes and iinstead bundle several games in the series together.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Turtle Beach Rematch Controller Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/15/turtle-beach-rematch-controller-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/turtle-beach-rematch-controller-review.1270845/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Options are never a bad thing. Over the years, different peripheral manufacturers have made sure that console makers can never rest on their laurels, often besting and improving on the official controller designs by adding extra features or updating the technology within them. The new wireless Turtle Beach Rematch controller focuses more on providing a similar experience to the Switch Pro Controller, while cutting into Nintendo’s fairly steep asking price. In this case, however, it’s not a steep enough price cut for the reduction in quality.</p>
<p><iframe title="Turtle Beach® Rematch Wireless" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7gqWyLu0VDU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I’ve loved many of Turtle Beach’s most recent controllers, from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/04/turtle-beach-stealth-ultra-pro-controller-review/">Stealth Ultra Pro</a> to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/10/turtle-beach-stealth-pivot-controller-review/">Stealth Pivot</a>. They’re doing things differently and bringing new features to bear that have a real-world use case. The Rematch slightly glows in the dark. Fundamentally, its looks are its best feature, with its green and purple Mario-toting livery very pleasing to the eye, and certainly bright enough to stand out next to all those bland black and grey controllers you’ll find elsewhere. The glow-in-the-dark effect isn’t really bright enough to warrant its inclusion, and it’s not applied to the buttons, which are, surely, the most important thing you’d want to glance at in the dark.</p>


<p>The top shell is made from a great-feeling soft-touch plastic, to lift the experience somewhat, but the lightly-textured purple underside doesn’t carry that through, and you get two, very different, sensations when you’re holding the controller in your hands.</p>


<p>Designed with the original Switch in mind, the Rematch works with both of Nintendo’s consoles, though it lacks the Switch 2’s C button for opening up GameChat. That’s not the biggest problem when it’s accessible via the central menu, but it’s odd to release it at the same time as the Switch 2 without the new console’s full functionality. For all that it feels like an omission, that’s balanced out by an impressive 40 hours of battery life, which makes the Rematch a very easy controller to live with.</p>
<p>The most immediately gratifying aspect of the Rematch are its well-tuned analogue sticks. They feel great in use, with a nice level of tautness, and a quick return to centre. Now, that’s balanced with the disappointing fact that these are not Hall Effect or TMR type sticks, meaning they’re using the old style of stick tech that has a far higher chance of wearing out. When other manufacturers, Gamesir in particular, are putting out similarly priced hardware, with improved analogue sticks, it feels like Turtle Beach are a step behind with the Rematch.</p>
<p>As the Rematch is targeted as an entry-level pro-styled device, it’s little surprise to find the inclusion of two additional grip inputs, the flared, decently-sized buttons sitting easily beneath your middle fingers, and activating reassuringly with a press or even just a squeeze of the grip. They feel great in use, and are a real boon to players looking for an edge in competitive games.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the rest of the inputs don’t feel as good. The main face buttons are overly firm, and feel a fraction too high, making them feel slower in use. The digital triggers maintain some of that firmness, but they also make a slightly loose clacking sound that lends a sense of cheapness each time you use them. The shoulder buttons, at least, are fine, and benefit from activation across their entire length, but no interaction with the Rematch makes it feel as if this is a £50 controller.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of alternatives out there. If you own a Switch 2, the official <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/16/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review/">Switch Pro Controller 2</a> is an easy choice, and while it’s more expensive, the overall build, the inclusion of a 3.5mm headphone socket, and the console-level customisation for the grip inputs, are streets ahead of what the Rematch offers. As mentioned before, Gamesir is the current champion of this category, and both the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/gamesir-cyclone-2-controller-review/">Cyclone 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/05/gamesir-super-nova-controller-review/">Super Nova</a> are fantastic. They’re fully featured pro controllers, with Hall Effect Sticks, better-feeling inputs, and a charging stand, and they come in at more or less the same price as the Rematch. The only downside is the need for an additional dongle that the Rematch doesn’t need.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just like every year around Gamescom, Berlin-based developer Elysium Game Studio has released a fresh trailer for their upcoming debut title, NEO BERLIN 2087.</p>



<p>The story of NEO BERLIN 2087, a first and third-person action roleplaying game, begins on a dark and ominous night in the German capital, which has been plunged into chaos following the brutal assassination of the police chief. The protagonist is Nolan (voiced by Elias Toufexis, the same actor behind Deus Ex's Adam Jensen), a detective with a troubled past who is given the daunting task of finding and protecting the police chief's daughter. She may hold the key to solving her father's murder. With state-of-the-art technology and weapons at his disposal, Nolan begins a perilous journey to find Natalie as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Eventually, with each new step, he grows closer to a sinister conspiracy that endangers him and the entire city. When Nolan finally meets the fiercely independent and resourceful Natalie, it becomes clear how their fates are intertwined in ways he could never have imagined. Their connection is a volatile mix of love, fear, and uncertainty. As they navigate the treacherous path ahead, they must confront their deepest fears and the shadowy forces threatening to tear them apart.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Neo Berlin 2087 - Gamescom 2025 Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i8B89MssneU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>According to Elysium Game Studio, the gameplay lets players customize Nolan's abilities and weapons to suit their preferred play style. They will be able to choose from a wide array of shooter, stealth, and RPG mechanics. NEO BERLIN 2087 is inspired by classic cyberpunk movies (Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell), albeit with a different city at its heart. Berlin in the year 2087 has become a cyberpunk metropolis shielded by massive walls from its devastated surroundings. There, outcasts gather, and malfunctioning machines roam the land. In the game, players will also explore the surrounding wasteland, which is full of dangerous enemies. They'll also get to test their reflexes in exciting combat sequences or, if they prefer, they may avoid confrontation entirely by adopting a stealthier approach.</p>



<p>NEO BERLIN 2087, which is powered by Unreal Engine technology, still doesn't have a release window. However, we know it will be available for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2326200/NEO_BERLIN_2087/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/neo-berlin-2087-500f0d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008070" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series S|X. You can already add it to your favorite platform's wishlists.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[5 Best Non-FromSoftware Soulslike Games to Play in 2025]]></title>

<p>FromSoftware is the undisputed master of Souls games, but they’re not the only company that makes stellar Soulslike experiences. Here are 5 Soulslike games not made by FromSoftware you should be playing in 2025.</p>



<p>Demon’s Souls and its spiritual successor, Dark Souls, started a revolution in gaming, which eventually turned into its own genre: the Soulslike game. But over time, this term has come to refer to games that were not made by FromSoftware but borrowed heavily from them.</p>



<p>Some of these games are only imitators, but others move the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/things-soulslike-games-must-stop-doing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soulslike</a> needle in new and creative ways, going on to become as celebrated as FromSoftware’s own games. Below, we’ll reveal the 5 best Soulslike games you can play in 2025 that were not developed by Hidetaka Miyazaki or the team at FromSoftware. </p>



<h2 id="h-stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Eve is an android sent to save Earth from vicious alien invaders. Image credit: Shift Up</figcaption></figure>



<p>There will be some that dispute Stellar Blade’s status as a Soulslike, but in terms of its overall gameplay loops, it absolutely is one. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-devs-are-considering-a-switch-2-port-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade</a> doesn’t conform to all of the conventions of the genre and strays from them at times, sometimes feeling more like Nier Automata or Bayonetta— and this is why it’s excellent.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is a great entry point for those who want to try Soulslike games, and even features some very challenging boss fights that would even make Malenia from Elden Ring blush. Rather than imitating Dark Souls, Stellar Blade simply takes inspiration from it and other action-adventure games, says a respectful “Thank you”, then blazes its own trail. </p>



<h2 id="h-lies-of-p">Lies of P</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lies of P: Overture features new combat styles and bosses. Image credit: NEOWIZ</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lies of P is a dark retelling of the story of Pinocchio, but this time, the puppet who wants to be a “real boy” needs to defend his creators against a robot uprising, all while weighing up the cost of honesty and deceit. It really shouldn’t work, but it does, and despite the game releasing in 2023, it’s still one of the best Soulslike games that wasn’t developed by FromSoftware. </p>



<p>While Lies of P was a highly original game, its gothic setting is eerily reminiscent of Bloodborne, a game that FromSoft fans are desperate to receive a remaster or sequel. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lies-of-p-headlines-augusts-free-playstation-plus-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lies of P</a> scratches that itch and manages to be an excellent game in its own right. Its first major expansion is also coming in summer 2025, making the game relevant all over again. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-lords-of-the-fallen-2023">The Lords of The Fallen (2023)</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lords of the Fallen is a worthy successor to Dark Souls. Image credit: Hexworks </figcaption></figure>



<p>The Lords of the Fallen is actually a sequel to another title called Lords of the Fallen that came out in 2014, and what makes this game so good is that this is truly one for the Dark Souls purists. Never mind Sekiro, Bloodborne, or Elden Ring, The Lords of the Fallen is a love letter to where the Soulslikes genre began.</p>



<p>The game pays tribute to Dark Souls by existing in a similar grimdark world where nearly everything wants to kill you, and is quite capable of it. Those who love Demon’s Souls and Dark Souls will feel immediately at home. But that’s not all, the game also allows players to move between the world of the living and the world of the dead, adding a mechanic that feels similar to old-school Soul Reaver games. </p>



<p>Some would call <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-friend-pass-crossplay/">The Lords of the Fallen</a> derivative, but what it’s really doing is providing Soulslike veterans with the thing we’ve been craving, something that can serve as a Dark Souls 4 surrogate. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan">The First Berserker: Khazan</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The First Berserker is one of the best Soulslikes not made by FromSoftware. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Like Stellar Blade, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-bosses-in-the-first-berserker-khazan-how-many-bosses-are-there/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker: Khazan</a> is unmistakably a Soulslike game, but it also does its own thing and represents evolution rather than stagnation. Even on its normal difficulty, Khazan is a tough but rewarding adventure, but it also offers an easy mode for those who just want to enjoy the story, but test their mettle after mastering its mechanics, which is fair enough. </p>



<p>The First Berserker: Khazan isn’t trying to hide the fact that it’s inspired by games like Bloodborne and Dark Souls, but it’s also not afraid to lean into more arcade-style action like Ninja Gaiden. Its theme of Norse mythology also helps it to stand out in the increasingly crowded space, and in 2025, it’s easily one of the best Soulslike adventures that wasn’t designed by FromSoftware. </p>







<h2 id="h-wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Wuchang is the best Soulslike of 2025, so far. Image credit: Leenzee</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a post-Elden Ring world, Soulslikes that use the old interconnected world system feel slightly antiquated, but that hasn’t stopped Wuchang: Fallen Feathers from being the best Soulslike of 2025 (as of August at least). Set in ancient China, Wuchang wakes up suffering from a dark malady that is slowly killing her, and with no memory of how she caught it. Desperate for answers, she picks up her blade and starts slashing monsters until a solution can be found.</p>



<p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers has more in common with games like Nioh, Wo-Long, and Black Myth: Wukong than Dark Souls, but the FromSoftware DNA is there. The game is probably the most difficult on this entire list, and even seasoned Tarnished warriors will find the game a serious challenge. While <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-longsword-build-wuchang-fallen-feathers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuchang</a> doesn’t have an invasion mechanic, if you die while touched by “Madness”, your own ghost will remain after death and then relentlessly hunt you down to kill you again.</p>

He confirmed that could mean additional divestments are in the offing. Will we also see layoffs? Who knows, but Embracer has been rather trigger happy in that regard previously.

It's a deeply harmful practice that can stall careers and create uncertainty as to who is actually making the games we play, but what is the solution?

The South Korean publisher once again insisted that all three downed tools as soon as it purchased Unknown Worlds and placed their own "monetary interests" over those of the development team and Subnautica 2 itself.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Vancouver-based game developer Blackbird Interactive has <a href="https://x.com/BBIgames/status/1956060573453705411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it has acquired the rights to the Hardspace: Shipbreaker IP from Focus Entertainment, which published the original game in 2022. Hardspace: Shipbreaker was well-received at launch; it <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hardspace-shipbreaker-its-a-hardspace-life-for-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earned a 9/10 score here on Wccftech</a> from reviewer Rosh Kelly:</p>



<p><em>If you’re after a game to recover from the burnout and exhaustion of daily life in the 21st century, Hardspace offers a game that lets you lose yourself in satisfying, procedurally generated puzzles that are the ships that appear in your dock each and every ship. Whether you just want to listen to some ambient country music that calls into mind Firefly and other less problematic science fiction frontier stories, rip apart unique and detailed ships, or want to feel what it’s like to fight a massive company, win or lose, Hardspace: Shipbreaker is a fantastic game worthy of the fifteen hours or so it takes to complete.</em></p>



<p>Clearly, Blackbird Interactive feels there's much potential to expand the IP. Indeed, they have already announced that multiple games in the Hardspace: Shipbreaker franchise are in development.</p>



<p>At the same time, they have also unveiled the so-called LYNX Pioneer Program. Pre-registration <a href="https://blackbirdinteractive.com/lynxpioneerprogram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is open on the official website</a> for users who would like to get:</p>



<ul>
<li>Exclusive early playtests of future Hardspace (and other BBI original IP) projects</li>



<li>Behind-the-scenes development updates and access</li>



<li>Opportunities to help shape BBI's next generation of games, participate in contests, and more</li>
</ul>



<p>Blackbird Interactive, a studio founded by former Relic Entertainment developers, has historically focused on strategy games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/deserts-of-kharak-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak</a>, Crossfire: Legion, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/homeworld-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Homeworld 3</a>. However, it has found success with an unusual action/adventure simulation game. Still, one of these Hardspace projects could very well be a strategy game take on the IP, which would be interesting to see at some point.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/to-catch-a-predator%E2%80%99s-chris-hansen-planning-roblox-documentary-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1270815/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Roblox is facing an insurmountable wave of controversy at present, with child safety activist groups and ‘predator hunter’ organizations pummelling the game for not adequately protecting young players. The situation hit a new all-time high recently when the Roblox Corporation’s lawyers harangued Schlep, a creator who has directly influenced the arrest of several predators preying on Roblox players.</p>



<p>The Roblox ‘child safety’ scenario unfolded further in recent hours, with a claim surfacing that Chris ‘Have a Seat’ Hansen, the iconic face of To Catch a Predator, is planning a documentary to shed light on Roblox’s nefarious side.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-chris-hansen-making-a-roblox-documentary">Is Chris Hansen Making a Roblox Documentary?</h2>



<p>On social media, claims emerged from several prominent channels that Chris Hansen, the host of To Catch a Predator for <strong>many years</strong>, is preparing to create a documentary hand-in-hand with Schlep, the creator who was recently pursued by Roblox’s legal team.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Anything tied to Schlep is being destroyed by the Roblox Corporation as we speak, with players receiving bans just for having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-legal-notice-banned-predator-hunter-freeschlep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#FreeSchlep</a> written in their username or anywhere else on their profile. This trend comes despite users pointing out that nefarious and harmful games are still sitting in the Roblox library, despite countless reports from concerned users.</p>



<p>It’s a question of priorities.</p>



<p>The situation is skyrocketing as we speak. In recent days, it was revealed that Louisiana’s Attorney General <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/15/us/louisiana-roblox-lawsuit-child-protection-hnk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">had filed a lawsuit</a> against Roblox for allowing sexual predators to ‘thrive, unite, hunt, and victimize kids’ on the platform.</p>



<p>Congressman Ro Khanna of California has also taken action, <a href="https://act.rokhanna.com/a/save-roblox-petition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">starting a petition</a> to demand that the Roblox Corporation do ‘more to protect children, provide more support to parents, and strengthen law enforcement protocols.’</p>



<p>It’s hard to tell what will happen next in this ongoing debacle, but the team at Roblox isn’t helping things. Just days ago, it was claimed that Roblox might one day become the home <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-dating-someday-for-those-afraid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of a legitimate dating platform</a>.</p>



<p>It’s hard to believe how some of this is unfolding.</p>

<p>Game Science has teased Black Myth: Wukong’s attendance during the Opening Night Live showcase at Gamescom. Fans saw this reveal and instantly jumped to the assumption that Black Myth: Wukong DLC is inbound and about to be revealed. The time is right, and the game drops on Xbox just one day after the Opening Night Live show.</p>



<p>It has been almost a year to the day since Black Myth: Wukong was released, and fans are <strong>hungry </strong>for more content.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-myth-wukong-at-gamescom">Black Myth: Wukong at Gamescom</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, the Game Science team behind 2024’s Black Myth: Wukong teased a reveal:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Destined Ones, GameScience will be joining this year’s Gamescom Opening Night Live. The show kicks off at 8:00 p.m. (CEST) on August 19, and we look forward to seeing you there.<a href="https://x.com/BlackMythGame/status/1956174001128268031/photo/1"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The core belief within the community is that a grand expansion is incoming for the game that turned heads in August 2024 when it proved to be one of the most successful additions to an already dense lineup of Soulslike games.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The post went hand-in-hand with a charming image showing fearsome monsters, calligraphy, and some ethereal elements. In the comments under the post, a user translated the visible script:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The extraordinary is ordinary in this world; ‘gods and devils’ often wear respectable attire.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Strangely, there’s a date on the image of August 20, 2025, the <strong>day after </strong>the Opening Night Live reveal will be shown. This has fans believing that a shadowdrop of sorts will take place, with Game Science revealing that Black Myth: Wukong DLC will be available almost instantly after the show.</p>



<p>Are you hoping for DLC for Black Myth: Wukong, or are you more curious about the potential for a sequel? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dying Light: The Beast is one of the most highly anticipated titles of 2025, and it’s set to be released <strong>very soon</strong>. This open-world, zombie-slaying epic has been dubbed ‘Dying Light 3’ by Techland, and in many ways, this major title kickstarts the next generation of the series. In this guide, learn everything about the Dying Light: The Beast release date and platforms.</p>



<p>I’m hugely excited for Dying Light: The Beast, which marks an evolution from 2022’s Dying Light 2: Stay Human in many ways. I’ve been a fan of the franchise since 2015’s Dying Light turned heads, and Techland has worked hard to make the series a shining gem of the zombie apocalypse niche ever since.</p>



<p>Read on to find out when Dying Light: The Beast is coming out and how much it’ll cost when it does.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-dying-light-the-beast-coming-out">When is Dying Light: The Beast Coming Out?</h2>



<p><strong>Dying Light: The Beast will be released on September 19 on <strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</strong></strong></p>



<p>The game was originally intended to be released on August 22, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-delayed/">a delay was needed</a> for Techland to fully polish the game and make it the best zombie-slashing adventure possible.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast started life as an expansion to Dying Light 2: Stay Human, but Techland realized it was too big for that and needed to flex as a standalone title. For this game, Roger Craig Smith (the original game’s lead voice actor) returned to play the role of Kyle Crane, a fan-favorite protagonist.</p>



<p>The Beast will now be a full-fledged game with all-new mechanics, upgraded visuals and effects, and an original story that brings to life the future of Dying Light.</p>



<h3 id="h-dying-light-the-beast-pricing-structure">Dying Light: The Beast Pricing Structure</h3>



<p>As Dying Light: The Beast has plenty of meat on the bones, it’s coming out with a premium price tag:</p>



<p><strong>Standard Edition </strong>– $59.99 / £59.99</p>



<p><strong>Deluxe Edition </strong>– $69.99 / £69.99</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-early-access-for-dying-light-the-beast">Is There Early Access for Dying Light: The Beast?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no way to access Dying Light: The Beast earlier than the global launch</strong>.</p>



<p>Techland has arranged a neat Deluxe Edition for Dying Light: The Beast, but the bonus content you get includes digital collectibles and in-game cosmetics; there is no way to get early access to The Beast.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Dying Light: The Beast? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/every-xbox-game-confirmed-for-gamescom%E2%80%94full-stream-schedule-explained.1270797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gamescom is almost here, and Xbox has published an extensive list of games that will be revealed or expanded on during the Xbox at Gamescom broadcast slate. This is made up of two streams that will take place between August 20 and August 21, with the team broadcasting a stack of trailers, panels, and reveals <strong>live from Gamescom</strong>.</p>



<p>Below, I’ve outlined every Xbox game coming to Gamescom to populate the stream schedule. Enjoy!</p>







<p>Here’s how the first day of Xbox at Gamescom will work:</p>



<p><strong>Wednesday, August 20</strong></p>



<p>Stream times: 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET / 2 PM BST / 3 PM CEST</p>



<p><em>Headlines:</em></p>

<p><em>Headlines:</em></p>

<li>Lego Voyagers</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-how-to-watch-xbox-gamescom-streams">How to Watch Xbox @ Gamescom Streams</h3>



<p>The best places to watch the Xbox streams broadcast from Gamescom will be YouTube and Twitch. Ensure you’re watching the official channels to have the best chance of unlocking any live rewards:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a></li>
</ul>



<p>I’m fully expecting more to appear during these broadcasts, titles that aren’t necessarily being touted ahead of the streams taking place. Every year, Xbox invests <strong>a lot </strong>in Gamescom, occupying a vast section of the show floor and putting on one hell of a show. They’d be remiss to not have a few surprises up their sleeves.</p>

<p>But it will have "full crossplay"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Borderlands 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5bcb028bc3af9/borderlands-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 2K Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> for the Switch 2, we've had a number of updates from Randy Pitchford and the team at Gearbox Software about what exactly fans can expect.</p>
<p>Following the news last month the game would run at "mostly" 30fps (instead of 60fps) on Nintendo's new hybrid hardware, we've now got another Switch 2-related update. This was spotted in the <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/articles/43481582561939-Borderlands-4-Nintendo-Switch-2-FAQ#h_01K1XYNQ5NRRFJZ170AXZSQYQ7">game's official FAQ</a>, which was updated earlier this month.</p>
<p>This version will apparently offer "the same exciting" experience as other platforms "minus the split-screen option". Although this is missing, the same paragraph notes how the Nintendo release will have crossplay support with the other platforms. Here it is in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Switch 2 players will have the same exciting <em>Borderlands 4</em> experience as other platforms minus the split-screen option, and yes, it will have full crossplay with Epic, Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox X|S!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you were hoping to enjoy some split-screen action on a single Switch 2 device, it seems you may need to instead consider the game on another console platform for this particular option.</p>
<p>It was also confirmed not long ago how the Switch 2 physical release of Borderlands 4 will require a download, so expect a Game-Key Card release. This game launches for this platform on <strong>3rd October 2025</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wuchang-update-censorship-bizarre/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wuchang-fallen-feathers-implodes-following-bizarre-1-5-%E2%80%98censorship%E2%80%99-update.1270788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has only been a few weeks since Wuchang: Fallen Feathers was released, adding yet another Soulslike to the increasingly expansive array of titles in the niche. In that time, Wuchang has suffered, being plagued by stability issues at launch and facing the wrath of gamers in thousands of negative reviews.</p>



<p>In the latest debacle, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers’ 1.5 update has rendered fans furious as developer Leenzee ‘censors’ various aspects of the game, applies a nasty retcon, and skews some of the title’s more challenging sequences.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-happened-with-wuchang-s-1-5-update">What Happened With Wuchang’s 1.5 Update?</h2>



<p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers isn’t a terrible game, but it doesn’t do too much to differentiate itself from the slew of Soulslike games drowning out the industry these days. That’s <strong>one reason </strong>why it earned some negativity at launch, but the UE5-related performance issues (particularly on PC) didn’t help the situation.</p>



<p>Recently, Leenzee released the 1.5 patch for Wuchang, causing chaos and disappointing fans worldwide.</p>



<p>With a single line in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498329191821869869?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full 1.5 patch notes</a>, Leenzee made waves:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Added dialogs for some NPCs to complete some plots. We will further optimize the exhaustion animations in the future to improve the plot performance.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Eagle-eyed Wuchang fans dove into the game after the 1.5 patch and discovered what that meant. Following the update, certain bosses can’t be killed and enter a state of ‘exhaustion’ after being defeated. Some have been reworked with new voice lines that alter the story, and other enemies in certain sequences (such as Ming Dynasty soldiers) won’t attack you at all.</p>



<p>This has caused one key chapter that was previously very difficult to become a breeze, further disappointing sadomasochistic Soulslike fans. </p>



<p>The situation was exacerbated by mods on the official Wuchang subreddit reportedly deleting posts complaining about the 1.5 patch. This has naturally caused the review stats for Wuchang to fall into the red once again.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, user Lance McDonald expressed concerns about <strong>why </strong>these changes were made:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>By the way, it isn’t the Chinese Government that forced these changes, WUCHANG is quite pro-government, it’s to please fringe groups of nationalists. I don’t really understand the details sadly.</p>
</blockquote>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">lmao Liu Wenxiu just stands around exhausted after the fight now, no dialogue . By the way, it isn't the Chinese Government that forced these changes, WUCHANG is quite pro-government, it's to please fringe groups of nationalists. I don't really understand the details sadly. <a href="https://t.co/QdjMZQbX8W">pic.twitter.com/QdjMZQbX8W</a></p>— Lance McDonald (@manfightdragon) <a href="https://twitter.com/manfightdragon/status/1956007542284268001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>It’s relatively easy to predict that Wuchang: Fallen Feathers will start falling to the wayside now, and that this will forever be a mark on Leenzee’s reputation. This was the first outing for the studio, and it certainly isn’t how you’d want to make a name for yourself.</p>

<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/56c21bd8dc43d/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>One of the many surprises during the Switch 2 reveal in April was the new game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, a sequel to the GameCube outing.</p>
<p>It's scheduled to arrive later this year, so what's the latest? Game director Masahiro Sakurai has issued another small update <a href="https://x.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1956187495991009776">via social media today</a>, mentioning how he thinks the team should be able to share some information about this game soon.</p>
<p>This small update on this project about Kirby's new game lines up with Sora's 20th anniversary in 2025 – with Sakurai thanking fans for their "continued support" over the years. Here's a rough translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Masahiro Sakurai:</strong> "It doesn't matter to most people, but today, Sora Co., Ltd. is celebrating its 20th anniversary. …That's a long time! Thank you for your continued support.</p>
<p>"The new game *Kirby Air Rider* hasn't even shown gameplay footage yet, but I think we'll be able to share some information soon. Please wait!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This latest update on Kirby Air Riders follows the game getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/kirby-air-riders-has-been-rated-for-switch-2">classification last month</a>. Sakurai also mentioned in July how the title was "shaping up to be something great".</p>
<p>Again, Kirby Air Riders is scheduled for <strong>2025</strong>, so hopefully we'll at least get some gameplay footage soon. In the meantime, you can take another look at the announcement cinematic.</p>

<p>Scalpers are reportedly at it again, and this time they're targeting exclusive merch available at the 2025 Pokémon World Championships.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-merchandise-scalper-reseller-2000617744">highlighted by Kotaku</a>, there are already eBay listings popping up for the commemorative Pikachu plush, themed TCG playmats, card binders, the <a href="https://x.com/JoeMerrick/status/1955663752457810413">jukebox</a> and various other items available at the event taking place in Anaheim, California this weekend.</p>
<p>Although there's a "one-per-person" rule in place at the venue, scalpers are still taking advantage of the fact the merch is currently exclusive to this event. Some of the community is already highlighting the scenes at the World Championships, as well as the resellers and online listings.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fvuwqiz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here's one post, in particular, that's been called out by the Pokémon community. And below this are some scenes from the Pokémon Center pop-up at the event.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Selling 2025 worlds bearwalker and shiny gyarados statue. $1000 on bearwalker and $600 on shiny gyarados statue. Payment up front. Zelle/PP FF/cashapp preferably. Pm me if interested. Thanks"</p>
</blockquote>






<p>It's sad to see this sort of behaviour, as it continues to ruin the hobby for many legitimate Pokémon fans and collectors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this follows a story earlier this week about McDonald's Japan having to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mcdonalds-japan-pulls-happy-meal-pokemon-cards-early-and-fans-blame-scalpers">pull its Pokémon TCG Happy Meal promotion</a> after 24 hours because of similar issues tied to scalping – with one customer supposedly attempting to buy 40 Happy Meals. The fast food giant even issued a formal apology.</p>

<p>If you happen to be heading to the 2025 Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, California this weekend, you can receive a special <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> distribution.</p>
<p>When you enter the badge pickup zone at the venue, you'll receive a unique code for a Toedscool. It's apparently "based on the Toedscool on this year's key art" for the World Championships (<a href="https://serebii.net/">thanks, Serebii.net</a>). You'll need to redeem this code in-game by <strong>August 29, 2025</strong>. Here's a look:</p>

<p>If we hear anything about an online distribution, we'll let you know. For now, if you want to get your hands on this, you'll need to attend this weekend's event, which takes place between <strong>August 15 - 17, 2025</strong>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:140671 @ 1755254080 -->
<p>Apart from this, the Pokémon World Championships will also be offering trainers a <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/tune-in-to-worlds-to-get-luca-ceribellis-farigiraf-and-other-special-gifts">special Farigiarf this weekend</a>. It comes equipped with Psychic Noise, Foul Play, Helping Hand and Trick Room.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-mwkAYKvypQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0a5spzwou&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mwkAYKvypQ" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>To obtain this Pokémon, you'll need to watch the official 2025 Worlds livestream for a password you can then use in the Mystery Gift feature of Scarlet and Violet. The password can only be used one time "per save", and it expires on <strong>August 22, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>You can see the full schedule for the 2025 Pokémon World Championships in our previous post. There's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-legends-z-a-playable-switch-2-demo-appearing-at-upcoming-events">also a Switch 2 demo</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> at this event. This follows on from a free Switch 2 upgrade for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in June, which included frame rate improvements and a higher resolution update.</p>

In fact, if you've tried to pay for something on Steam using PayPal recently, you might've noticed that the option isn't available. This is apparently isolated to certain countries, and now Valve has offered an explanation.</p><p>"In early July 2025, PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam," Valve wrote on its <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/731C-13C7-7D04-A11E#purpp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Purchasing Issues support page</a>, as reported by RockPaper Shotgun. "This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD."</p><p>"We hope to offer PayPal as an option for these currencies in the future but the timeline is uncertain," the page continues. "We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected by this. In the meantime, please use one of our other current payment methods during checkout. If you can't use any of the available options, you can consider using a Steam Wallet code to add funds to your account."</p><p>Valve further confirmed to RPS that this is "regarding content on Steam related to what we've previously commented on surrounding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mastercard-responds-to-censorship-allegations-after-forcing-storefronts-to-remove-adult-games/1100-6533641/" data-ref-id="1100-6533641">Mastercard</a>."</p><p>"One of PayPal’s acquiring banks decided to stop processing any Steam transactions, which cut off PayPal on Steam for a number of currencies," Valve explained via a spokesperson.</p><p>In other words, unless you're paying with euros, pounds, dollars (US, Australia, Canada), or Japanese Yen, you can't make Steam purchases using PayPal for the time being.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A new report claims that Activision’s upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-trailer-xbox-ps5-1851784008"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> will merge the franchise’s famous multiplayer with the game’s single-player campaign by having the final mission take place in a 32-player online match.</p><p>In June, Xbox and Activision <a href="https://youtu.be/uUo5gnaYB_w">officially revealed <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> as the next entry in the uber-popular shooter series. The game’s first teaser trailer offered up some glimpses of its future-based campaign as well as a brief look at multiplayer and Zombies, two <em>Call of Duty</em> staples at this point. We also know the game will feature a campaign that can be played solo or with up to three other players in co-op. That’s not a first for the series, but it isn’t common. What would be a first is that, reportedly, <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s campaign will end in a climactic mission set inside a multiplayer match.</p><p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-avalon-map-campaign/">On August 14, as reported by </a><em><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-avalon-map-campaign/">Insider Gaming</a>,</em> sources told the outlet that <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s campaign will feature 12 missions, and the final one will integrate the campaign into a 32-player multiplayer experience. The mission will take place in the map “Avalon,” which has been rumored for a bit now to be a battle royale location, but is actually the setting of this odd campaign experiment.</p><div data-player-id="plTxkEoh" data-name="Video_Collapse_Autoplay_SoundOff" id="cls-video-container-n9o50j6H"> <p><em>Insider Gamin</em>g says that the final mission sounds a lot like it will be an extraction-based experience with players needing to complete objectives before exiting the level and, presumably, finishing the game’s final campaign mission, though we’ll have to wait and see just what this all looks like in practice. While I’m always happy to see <em>Call of Duty</em> trying new things and shaking up the formula, I’m not a big fan of locking the game’s final mission behind an internet requirement. Will people be unable to play the last mission in 20-30 years when the servers are dead? Hopefully there’s a backup plan for offline folks.</p> <p>The merging of campaign and multiplayer like this is reportedly part of a larger push in <em>Black Ops 7</em> to merge the game’s various modes and offer players full progression across every part of the upcoming shooter, with the idea being that regardless of where you play, even in campaign, you can level up weapons, characters, and the battle pass. That’s a neat idea that seems inspired by <em>Fortnite’s</em> universal progression and XP system, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/coming-soon-progress-your-fortnite-passes-by-playing-any-experience?lang=en-US">which Epic implemented last year</a>.</p> <p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> doesn’t have a release date yet, but Xbox and Activision will show off the game’s multiplayer later this month at Gamescom, and that seems like a fine time to announce a launch date. If the past is prologue, I’d expect you’ll be playing <em>Black Ops 7</em> in October or November.</p> </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-final-campaign-mission-will-reportedly-be-a-big-multiplayer-battle-2000617873]]></content:encoded>

It remains to be seen if that’ll hold, but the increased value is due to its ability to generate counters in the upkeep step. That’s an ideal inclusion for the new Counter Intelligence precon, or the Final Fantasy Counter Blitz precon.</p></div><div catalogid="cb6d924f-1950-4986-a366-5b704bdf35d2" id="226690"><div id="226690" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Ragost, Deft Gastronaut</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7mmY?object_uuid=be3e6e11-2de2-40bf-b7ad-92a46d21fcd6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Ragost, Deft Gastronaut</u></a> is sticking around, now at around $15.
