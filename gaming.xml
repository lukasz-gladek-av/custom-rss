			<p>Just as every week brings another <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-amazon-fire-tv-app-reanimal-kingdom-come-deliverance/">GeForce NOW Thursda</a>y, we also get an <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4</strong> Tuesday, with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/star-trek-voyager-styx-blades-of-greed-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen/">a new batch of games</a> adding support for NVIDIA's DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation technology. </p>



<p>This week, two games are launching with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4:<strong> Styx: Blades of Greed</strong>, the return of the stealth-driven action adventure, and <strong>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</strong>, a new strategy management game where you have to try to manage the crew of the U.S.S. Voyager and get the ship out of deep space and back to Earth.</p>



<p>Both games also arrive with support for NVIDIA Reflex and DLSS Super Resolution, which those with the NVIDIA app can upgrade to DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution. </p>



<p><strong>NORSE: Oath of Blood</strong> is another game that's launching this week with support for some of NVIDIA's DLSS technology, arriving with DLSS Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution. Once again, if you're using the NVIDIA app, you'll be able to upgrade to DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation and DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution.</p>



<p>Styx: Blades of Greed arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S later this week, though you can already check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/styx-blades-of-greed-review-a-sandbox-goblin-adventure/">Francesco De Meo's review of the goblin's return</a>, in which he gave the game a <strong>7.5/10</strong>, and also noted that while the game does suffer from a few technical issues, when you flip the switch for DLSS 4 with Mult-Frame Generation, those issues are smoothed out. </p>



<p>"<em>Despite the technical friction and a 20-hour runtime that becomes slightly repetitive toward the end, </em><em>Styx: Blades of Greed</em> is a <strong>solid stealth title</strong>. It doesn't revolutionize the genre, and it lacks a much-needed in-game map for its sandbox maps, but it compensates with <strong>excellent level design and immense heart</strong>. For fans of the series or those craving a pure stealth experience, <strong>Styx's hunt for Quartz it’s a journey worth taking</strong>," writes De Meo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>is, at the very least, an aptly-named game. It really does feel like a theater of idols; in fact, it feels like a theater that pays tribute to two idols in particular, namely <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/bioshock" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="59ad10c9-4ae1-417e-a4af-d1ad3147da86" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>BioShock</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/resident-evil-village" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7d76fc24-612e-4e7e-9804-64ccee40af28" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Resident Evil Village</em></a>.</p><p>The DNA of both games can be found everywhere in developer Vermila Studios and publisher Blumhouse Games' horror shooter. Whether it's the gloomy, glitzy post-disaster setting of Tormentosa, a suspiciously familiar weapon upgrade system, or structural similarities that are hard to ignore, there's no denying the connections.</p><p>Of course, it's one thing to pay tribute to your idols and quite another to transcend those influences in order to create something truly original. <em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>knows what it likes, but it can't quite find a way to translate those heady origins into something new and compelling.</p><h2><em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>Is Atmospheric, but Uninvolving</h2><figure role="group">

<figcaption>You will grow to loathe Mediodia.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>Crisol </em>tells the story of Gabriel, a religious soldier sent to the island of Tormentosa on a holy mission. In true <em>BioShock </em>fashion, Gabriel awakens on the coast of Tormentosa at the outset of his quest and journeys inland, encountering horrors aplenty as he goes.</p><p>It's clear that <em>Crisol </em>wants religion and dogma to be the central pillars of its narrative, but it lacks the courage to say anything meaningful about its subject matter.&nbsp;</p><p>What unfolds is not a tale of zealotry and the lengths to which religion will go to subjugate its victims; rather, it's a histrionic, uneven story that takes some pretty egregious logical leaps in attempting to deliver shocking twists.</p><p>I don't want to spoil anything, but I found <em>Crisol: Theater of Idols</em>' narrative to be equal parts uninvolving and baffling. Many of its key mysteries felt unresolved, and the conclusions of those that did receive some sort of closure felt unsatisfying and weak.</p><p>The problem lies chiefly with characters. Gabriel is about as stock a protagonist as you could hope to find, and his radio support companion Mediodia is intensely, desperately annoying (not to mention horribly animated).</p><p>Unfortunately, there aren't many other major characters to get to know; the enemies Gabriel comes across are generally stock characters indebted to their key influences. One major villain even directly paraphrases <em>BioShock </em>during a climactic moment, and it feels like a cheap reference rather than a sly wink.</p><p>It's a shame, because the atmosphere on display can be very effective indeed. The sound design here is excellent, capturing the feel of an abandoned city and its labyrinthine horrors perfectly.</p><p>When the moon hits a ramshackle dock or a glittering carnival just right, <em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>threatens to become immersive, but knowing there's another lame narrative twist around the corner derails that sense of tension.</p><p>Not only that, but <em>Crisol </em>is in deep with the yellow paint mob. Its largely linear environments are covered in these patronizing, obvious directional signals, and it lessens immersion even further. Who's painting the entrances of these tunnels? Who knows Gabriel's journey better than he does?</p><h2>Combat In <em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>Struggles With Repetition</h2><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Get used to this enemy. You'll be seeing it a lot.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>During <em>Crisol</em>'s opening moments, Gabriel comes face-to-face with a creepy porcelain mannequin enemy, which wrenches itself off the wall and rushes him with nary a change of its painted expression.</p><p>It's a very effective opener, and the ways in which Gabriel can dismember the creature and even behead it without making a dent set up an adaptable, worryingly durable foe that will take smarts and perseverance to overcome.</p><p>Sadly, this is another area in which <em>Crisol </em>disappoints. These mannequins will form the vast bulk of the enemies you'll face throughout a roughly 10-12-hour playthrough; I reckon about 90% of the enemy encounters are made up solely of these guys.</p><p>Over the course of my time with <em>Crisol</em>, I counted four distinct enemy types. One, a sort of goblin creature that crawls between paintings, isn't really a combat encounter; it and its friends infinitely respawn, meaning it's much more worth your time to sprint to your goal rather than engage the monster.</p><p>The best survival horror games constantly wrong-foot you with new enemy types and changes to existing enemies, meaning you're never quite able to relax. <em>Crisol </em>absolutely fails on this front; its encounters are so repetitive that they're almost comforting.</p><p>Your weapons themselves feel...fine. It's a pretty bog-standard lineup - think pistol, shotgun, rifle - but bullets land with a satisfying enough thud. That's only half of the equation, though, and when enemies are this boring to fight, even <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-eternal" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1cbdb0ce-87bb-479c-9216-3442b390a2cf" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Doom Eternal</em></a>'s gunplay wouldn't suffice.</p><h2>There's Simply No Scarcity in <em>Crisol: Theater of Idols</em></h2><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>can't manage scares or tension at any point.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I bring up survival horror because <em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>explicitly bills itself as such, and judged on these terms, it's an abject failure.</p><p><em>Crisol </em>revolves around a rather neat little mechanic whereby blood serves as ammunition, so if you want to keep yourself stocked up, you'll have to sacrifice health to do so.</p><p>Blood can be recovered by draining animals (and, sometimes, humans) throughout your environment, as well as by using consumable syringes. As such, <em>Crisol </em>clearly wants you to constantly be asking whether it's worth draining that last scrap of health to give yourself a fighting chance in a battle.</p><p>It's unfortunate, then, that <em>Crisol </em>suffers from an almost total lack of scarcity. There was not a single point during my playthrough when I struggled for resources. I was awash with blood, drowning in corpses, carrying a bag bulging with syringes.</p><p>Ironically enough for a horror game, <em>Crisol </em>seems terrified of alienating you or frustrating you, so its levels are absolutely chock-full of health pickups. I was constantly ignoring syringes or using them with 95% of my health remaining just so I could pick up more.</p><p>Without scarcity, a survival horror game can no longer deliver on dread. If you're constantly well-prepared for whatever's coming around the next corner, then it won't surprise you or terrify you.</p><p>Combined with the terminal lack of enemy variety, any chance that <em>Crisol </em>can provide a tense or scary experience is gone.</p><p>The problem, though, is this: if <em>Crisol </em>doesn't work as a survival horror shooter, and its enemies are nowhere near varied enough for a serviceable action-horror game, then what, exactly, do we have before us?</p><h2><em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>- Final Thoughts</h2><figure role="group">

<p>It pains me to say it, given the obvious ambition on display, but <em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>just...doesn't work.</p><p>Its survival horror elements are undone by a total lack of scarcity, thus making resource management a complete non-issue, and its enemy encounters are stultifyingly repetitive, thus kneecapping any chance of high-octane and exciting combat.</p><p><em>Crisol </em>just feels like it keeps getting in its own way.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-tips-tricks-beginner-2000669702</link>
            <guid>1438201</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been almost a decade since the release of the legendary farming sim <em>Stardew Valley</em>, and it’s easy to be daunted by its massive reputation and dedicated player community. Fortunately, the game is all about chilling out, and isn’t too tough on newcomers. That being said, going in totally blind can be a bit overwhelming in a game so packed with information. So, whether you’re a brand new player or it’s been so long you’ve forgotten the ropes, here are 15 tips for starting a fresh <em>Stardew Valley</em> save in 2026.</p> <h2>Choose the Four Corners, Standard, or Forest Farm</h2> <p>There are eight different farm maps to choose from, but not all are created equal. Be sure to make an informed decision — you can’t change your mind later!</p> <p>The Four Corners farm is described as being ideal for multiplayer, but it’s my favorite for single player, too. Four Corners’ structured layout is great for planning how you want to organize your base later on, and each corner has a different perk to it.<br> The Standard farm is another solid choice since it gives you the most space for raising animals and farming crops. The Forest farm also works well; it doesn’t offer a lot of farming space, but it’s great for foraging, which is a crucial skill in the early game.<br> The other farms make starting out more challenging, and <em>Stardew</em> is already overwhelming enough without adding extra hurdles. I would know; my first ever farm was on the Riverland map (because it’s the prettiest), but I got so frustrated I abandoned the save.</p>

 <h2>Take it easy</h2> <p>It’s inevitable that you’re gonna make a mistake. Whether you can’t get home before 2 a.m., or you give someone a present they don’t like, or you miss out on farming a particular crop before the season changes, don’t beat yourself up about it. <em>Stardew Valley</em> is a game about going at your own pace—it’s not possible to play it “wrong,” so long as you’re having fun. It isn’t the end of the world if you accidentally sell something you need later on. Find the joy in stumbling as you learn.</p> <h2>Plan ahead for the Community Center</h2> <p>That being said, if you do want to strategize, the best thing you can do is keep track of what you’ll need to finish rebuilding the Community Center. I like to keep a physical list of all the stuff I need to complete the Community Center handy for quick reference.</p>

 <h2>Watch TV every day</h2> <p>Flicking through the TV when you wake up will reward you with helpful intel from a variety of channels. The content on every channel changes daily, so make a habit of TV surfing before you head out each morning.</p> <h2>Keep one of every item</h2> <p>As a general rule, I like to keep at least one of every item I stumble upon stored at my base. Odds are the stuff you think is worthless now will turn out to be useful later on.</p>

 <h2>Start a tree farm</h2> <p>You’re gonna need a lot of wood in this game. Trees take forever to grow, so set up a designated area for trees on your farm as early as you can.</p> <h2>Don’t plant too many seeds</h2> <p>Believe it or not, there is such a thing as too much farming. Watering your plants costs energy, which you have a limited amount of each day. There’s much more to explore beyond your farm, so don’t spend all your time trying to till every square inch of your land—keep it manageable.</p>  <h2>Go fishing</h2> <p>Fishing is one of the best things you can do in the early game. Not only is it a quick and easy way to earn some cash, you also have a chance of fishing up rare treasure. Upgrading your rod as soon as you’re able is also a good move.</p>

 <h2>Fish where you see bubbles</h2> <p>If you see bubbles in the water, make sure to cast your line there. Fish are way quicker to bite in bubble spots and you’re less likely to catch trash.</p> <h2>Dig for worms</h2> <p>When you’re walking around, keep an eye out for any grass tiles that have three little worms wriggling on them. Using a hoe on that tile will yield valuable items.</p> <h2>Place chests in key locations</h2> <p>Remember that you can place chests anywhere so long as they aren’t on NPC walking paths. It’s easy to run out of inventory space while spelunking, so having a chest right outside the elevator in the mines is super helpful. I also like to keep chests on the beach and by the river for fishing.</p> <h2>Build a silo ASAP</h2> <p>Silos automatically store all the grass you cut. Constructing one before you start on any other buildings is a good idea because it’ll give you a big reserve of hay for when you do get animals.</p>

 <h2>Pet your animals</h2> <p>Once you get livestock on your farm, right-click to pet them! If you make a daily habit of it, you’ll be rewarded with higher quality animal goods—plus a cute heart animation. It’s my favorite part of the daily farm routine (no I will never buy the auto petters).</p> <h2>Prepare for winter with heaters</h2> <p>Winter is tough. Your farmland is rendered barren and your animals can’t go outside, so you’ll have to rely on resource reservoirs and animal produce to survive. Make sure your animals have a siloful of hay to munch on and a heater in every barn/coop so they don’t go cold.</p>

 <h2>Press and hold right-click to save time</h2> <p>Most repetitive actions can be done en masse by holding down the right mouse button. It makes harvesting crops, petting animals, and collecting items from machines way faster.</p>

            <p>Microsoft has revealed the next batch of games coming to its Xbox Game Pass subscription service this February, and into next month.</p>
<p>Along with the already announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-xbox-game-pass-games-for-february">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Avowed</a>, which are available from today (17th February), Game Pass subscribers can look forward to the following games making their way onto the service:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aerial_Knight's DropShot</strong> (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Handheld, and PC) – 17th February via Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>
<li><strong>Death Howl</strong> (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Handheld, and PC) – 19th February via Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, PC Game Pass</li>
<li><strong>EA Sports College Football 26</strong> (Cloud and Xbox Series X/S) – 19th February via Game Pass Ultimate</li>
<li><strong>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</strong> – Complete Edition (Cloud and Console) – 19th February via Game Pass Ultimate, Premium</li>
<li><strong>TCG Card Shop Simulator</strong> (Game Preview) (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Handheld, and PC) – 24th February via Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, PC Game Pass</li>
<li><strong>Dice A Million</strong> (PC) – 25th February via Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>
<li><strong>Towerborne</strong> (Full Game Release) (Console, Handheld, and PC) – 26th February via Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, PC Game Pass</li>
<li><strong>Final Fantasy 3</strong> (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, and PC) – 3rd March via Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, PC Game Pass</li>
<li><strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </strong>(Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, and PC) – 3rd March via Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, PC Game Pass</li>
</ul>
<p>I am quite intrigued by Death Howl, which is a soulslike deck builder.  The game is described as a "poignant tale of grief, healing, and resilience", and follows the journey of hunter Ro as she leaves her tribe and ventures into a disturbingly realised realm of the spirits in the hope of reuniting with her deceased son.</p><p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, meanwhile, garnered a lot of love for its dedication to toil and turmoil in Bohemia, told through the eyes of Henry of Skalitz. A hardy combat system and eager embrace of vulgarity come together in a compelling RPG well worth playing.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/bumpy-ride-steam-demo/</link>
            <guid>1438183</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>In 2024 I wrote about <em>A Short Trip</em>, a tiny hand-drawn game where a cat drives a train. Well now I’m back with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3056840/A_Bumpy_Ride/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>A Bumpy Ride</u></em></a>, a Western game where a bear (I think?) drives a train. I’m not sure why we’re seeing a boom in the animal-drives-a-train genre, but I’m into it.</p><p><em>A Bumpy Ride </em>is being developed by Cosmoporium Games; its Steam demo recently got an update that includes a tutorial and unlimited in-game days of play. During those days, you pick up various animal passengers from one station and drive them to another. In addition to wanting to get to their destination on time, the animals like it when you obey train traffic signs, like going slow when a sign says to go slow or sounding your train whistle when a sign says to sound your train whistle.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2JZH8mAgvI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="OUR NEW DEMO IS LIVE! 🚂 A Bumpy Ride, Demo Update!"></iframe></figure><p>The tracks you follow are set into a sprawling desert landscape that, even rendered cartoonishly, really evokes a 19th century developing West. Wooden towns appear among the tumbleweeds and cacti, from little outposts of only a few houses to relatively sprawling metropolises set among cliffs or along rivers. Some paths in the demo are blocked off by boulders that the game says requires TNT to clear, and though you can’t do this in the demo I did enjoy rolling into a TNT depot and imagining chugging around with a bunch of dynamite. The weather changes, as does the time of day, with the sky becoming an endless expanse of stars that reminded me of being alone in the wilderness in <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>.</p><p>While there isn’t all that much to do in the demo mechanically, what you <em>can</em> do is very satisfying thanks to the game’s chunky interface. You control the train with a lever on the right side of your screen, pulling it to speed up, slow down, stop, and reverse. The whistle is controlled with a pull-down tab at the top of the screen that I spent a lot of time pulling just for fun. Track directions are switched with a pop-up interface that’s equally satisfying, and also often sent me frantically checking my map to make sure I was headed the right way, especially when I was first unveiling which directions are available and wasn’t sure where a set of tracks would take me. You also have to keep your train topped up with water, stopping in just the right spot at towers placed around the map to let water pour into the right car of your train.</p><figure><figcaption><span>I wish I could explore the town (Cosmoporium Games/Aftermath)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Satisfied passengers pay you money, and you can use this to upgrade to a new train, buy more seats for passengers, or install a bar car that makes passengers a bit more cheerful. I definitely did not satisfy all my passengers, especially when I was first learning the map and took them on long, scenic tours into the night instead of getting them to their destinations. But once I knew where I was going, <em>A Bumpy Ride</em> was a simple, lovely experience of chugging along following traffic laws and watching the landscape roll past, listening to the jaunty music and admiring the landscape.</p><p>Cosmoporium plans to release the game later this year, and the Steam page promises more areas, train cars, and a level-up system that will include “new upgrades, staff, and skins.”</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/short-trip-impressions-review/"><div><p>Short Trip Is A Tiny Game Where A Cat Drives A Train - Aftermath</p><p>And also rings the bell</p><p><span>Riley MacLeod</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> has announced a fresh batch of games that are landing soon on <strong>Xbox Game Pass</strong>, and there's a lot of love for roleplaying game fans, starting with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-might-join-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously teased <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</strong></a>.  The first-person historical RPG from <strong>Warhorse Studios</strong> will be available starting March 3 on the Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, and PC Game Pass tiers. </p>



<p>In just two days from now, though, another massively acclaimed action RPG will join Game Pass: <strong>CD Projekt RED's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Complete Edition</strong>. Unfortunately, this will only be available via <span>the cloud and on Xbox Series S and X consoles,&nbsp;<strong>leaving PC users out</strong></span>. The game will be playable by Xbox Game Pass Premium and Ultimate subscribers.</p>



<p>Starting today, subscribers to the Premium tier (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-could-be-merged-with-pc-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored</a> to be under revision by Microsoft, which <strong>is considering a potential merge with PC Game Pass</strong>) can also play <strong>Obsidian's Avowed</strong>. I heartily recommend the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as I did in my original review</a>, and <span>it has since been improved, including the recent Anniversary Update that&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-lands-ps5-february-17-2026-anniversary-update-drops-on-all-platforms/" target="_blank">launched</a>&nbsp;alongside its</span> debut on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of new games that will join Xbox Game Pass at the various tiers, including some that had been previously confirmed:</p>

            <p>Well, this is cool. You can now download <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unreal-tournament-2004">Unreal Tournament 2004</a> for free and with a patch that ensures it'll run smoothly on modern hardware. This is all thanks to a fan community called OldUnreal, who've made it their mission to keep Epic's classic shooters alive, even going as far as getting the Fortnite publishers' permission to do so.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/unreal-tournament-2004-is-now-available-for-free-thanks-to-its-fan-community-and-theyve-even-updated-the-game-for-modern-pcs-this-is-the-first-public-patch-for-unreal-tournament-2004-in-over-20-years/">Parade Call Gamer</a>, the OldUnreal lot have now pushed their re-release live, alongside a hefty community patch. That's the same OldUnreal lot who gave Unreal Gold and Unreal Tournament <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/classic-shooters-unreal-and-unreal-tournament-are-now-free-and-preserved-on-the-internet-archive">similar treatments</a> a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>"Please note that this is the first public patch for Unreal Tournament 2004 in over 20 years," OldUnreal project manager Stijn-volckaert wrote in the release notes for the <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/UT2004Patches/releases">patch's latest version</a>. "We have implemented numerous fixes and improvements, written a new SDL backend for Linux and macOS, and even a new renderer. We have also migrated the entire codebase to modern build systems. Some new bugs may have slipped in!"</p>
<p>As the OldUnreal team outlined when they announced this revival <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/unrealtournament/comments/1pdbe69/breaking_unreal_tournament_2004_is_back/">late last year</a>, their revival works by grabbing UT 2004's original disc image via a Windows installer you can download from the <a href="https://www.oldunreal.com/downloads/ut2004/full-game-installers/">group's website</a>. You'll then need to mosey on over to Github to grab <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/UT2004Patches">the community patch</a> which spruces up the game. That's also where Linux and Mac users can find UT 2004 <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/FullGameInstallers/releases">installers</a> for those operating systems.</p><p>Classics like this being preserved via free distribution is always good news. Especially so in this case given UT 2004 is so important to PCdom that RPS co-founderman Jim Rossignol rated its importanceness as vitally high when compling a presentation on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-very-important-list-of-pc-games-part-1">the greatest, most important PC games of all time</a> back in 2011.</p>

<p>Embark Studios has revealed why the investigation into ARC Raiders’ exploits took so long and how they will be serving punishments to players who used them. </p>



<p>For those unaware, ARC Raiders has been experiencing several glitches recently, mainly the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-devs-release-hotfix-for-duplication-glitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">duplication</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ammo-glitch-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ammo</a> glitches that players were exploiting to gain an unfair advantage. The developers have already released hotfixes for both, and now that the investigation is complete, enforcement can begin. </p>

<p>In their blog <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/an-update-on-recent-exploits-and-corrective-actions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a>, Embark Studios first explained why it took so long for them to investigate the ARC Raiders’ exploits. There is a specific process that the developer follows, which includes validating reports against data, confirming the scope and effect of the exploit, separating accidental/edge-case behavior from repeated and intentional abuse, and, lastly, assessing the measurable impact on the economy and competitive integrity. </p>



<p>The developers want to “act once, with intention, and with confidence that we’re doing the right thing,” which is why the process took so long. Now that the investigations are over, Embark will be taking actions based on severity, intent, frequency, and impact. Low-severity cases will receive only a warning. If exploit activity is observed, coins will be removed, and in severe cases where there is a significant impact on the in-game economy or other players’ experience, suspensions will be served. </p>

            <p>One of the best racing horses in the modern era of the sport will be coming to Umamusume: Pretty Derby, according to a statement from the horse's owner.</p>
<p>Speaking to horse racing outlet Idolhorse following Forever Young's victory at the Saudi Cup yesterday, Susumu Fujita teases the appearance of the champion: "Forever Young will be in Umamusume soon, I can't say the exact details, but it's a huge thing for me personally that Forever Young can contribute to Umamusume."</p>
<p>This follows <a href="https://x.com/uma_musu/status/1984753867087888389">a mysterious tease from the official Umamusume: Pretty Derby last year</a>, which showed a silhouette of a horse and a date. This date, it turns out, is Forever Young's birthday. So there's some extra proof if you aren't convinced.</p>
<p>Umamusame: Pretty Derby remains an incredibly popular mobile game since it released back in 2021, and further still when it came out in Europe and America last year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">It even won a Game Award</a> for Best Mobile Game, which is certainly something.</p>
<p>The developers of Pretty Derby, Cygames, announced in January <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cygames-ai-studio-formed">its intention to create an AI-focused sub studio</a>, aimed at producing "AI-services and tools". Following backlash, Cygames rolled this back somewhat, stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/umamusume-developer-apologises-after-ai-studio-backlash-says-it-will-not-use-generative-ai-without-prior-notice">it wouldn't use generative AI "without prior notice"</a>.</p>
<p>Do you have a horse you'd like to see in Umamusame: Pretty Derby? Oh, and if a certain song is stuck in your head, you're looking for Forever Young by Alphaville.</p>

            <p>Things aren't looking great when it comes to the ongoing RAM and storage shortages, and the Asus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review">ROG Xbox Ally X</a> is being hit with a price increase in Japan that may or may not extend to other territories.</p>
<p>The current tech drama kickstarted by the AI and data centre boom is already altering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-mulling-ps6-delay-while-nintendo-eyes-switch-2-price-hike">Sony and Nintendo's plans for hardware in the coming years</a>, with Microsoft likely missing the big console generation refresh next year too.

<p>Now, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-gets-a-price-increase-of-nearly-200-in-japan/">via VGC</a>, we're learning about the ROG Xbox Ally X situation in Japan. As spotted by the site <a href="https://0115765.com/archives/172482">Otaku Souken</a>, the ROG Xbox Ally X is upping its price tag to ¥169,800 ($1,109) vs. the previous ¥139,800 ($913) mark. That's a whopping $196 increase. The standard ROG Xbox Ally seemingly isn't altering its ¥89,800 ($585) price, however.</p>
<p>An official reason for the price increase hasn't been shared yet, but everyone is thinking about the same thing pending confirmation; as pointed out by VGC, the RAM on the big Xbox Ally is faster than the regular model's. With the more expensive model now almost doubling the price of the regular one, it'll be quite interesting to see how both perform in the Japanese market in the coming months. As a reminder, Xbox products have never been too big over there, so this probably won't go down well.</p><p>The difficult situation has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-admits-its-steam-machine-and-steam-frame-will-be-delayed-due-to-ram-and-storage-price-surges">forced Valve to delay the release (originally planned for early 2026) of the Steam Machine and Frame</a>, which are now expected by most enthusiasts to arrive at higher price points (though we never got official word on those with the reveal). Even worse, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-blames-dwindling-steam-deck-supplies-on-ram-and-storage-shortages-as-ai-driven-demand-further-threatens-games-industry">securing a Steam Deck is becoming harder</a> as I write this. Thanks, Big Tech.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Outside of those developed by FromSoftware, few Soulslikes manage to capture my attention. Despite this, the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/code-vein-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Code Vein</em></a><em> </em>seemed to be just different enough, and competently made, to stand out among its competitors. So, my expectations for <em>Code Vein 2 </em>were high, to say the least.&nbsp;</p><p>With more of an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> approach with its open world and (somewhat) non-linearity, <em>Code Vein 2</em> tries to tap into that formula but just doesn't quite nail its execution, which is a crying shame given how much I enjoyed the first game. <em>Code Vein 2</em>'s got its run of problems, despite being a <em>sometimes</em> beautiful, and even enjoyable, Soulslike.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Time Travel Shenanigans</h2><p><em>Code Vein 2</em> is an interesting case of ditching the story of its first game and creating a new world for its sequel; as far as I know, there aren't any connections to the first game besides the fact that there are these Vampiric entities called Revenants, as well as Revenant Hunters.</p><p>The premise of <em>Code Vein 2</em>'s narrative is actually intriguing and held a great deal of potential to capture my attention, but we're met with mixed results. It revolves around this idea of the "Resurgence," a calamity-level event that threatens to destroy the world.&nbsp;</p><p>100 years in the past, heroes attempted to stop the Resurgence, but in doing so, they became sealed in cocoons to hold off this mysterious threat. With the heroes' bodies in a stasis of sorts, the Resurgence is returning, and to end it, you'll have to destroy the cocoons.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Meet Lou, your time-traveling companion.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>But</em>, in order to open these cocoons and destroy the heroes inside, you'll have to use a Revenant called Lou to time travel into the past. You'll befriend these heroes, learn about their stories, and -- as it is the only known way to end the threat -- return to the present to slay them with a catalyst that opens their cocoons.</p><p>It sounds convoluted, and it's a bit intimidating to jump into with all the lore. That said, I was more concerned about the stories of the heroes in <em>Code Vein 2, </em>and how my interactions with them in the past would affect the present timeline.&nbsp;</p><p>You have a wide range of personalities for said heroes -- ones that definitely fit into some cliche anime archetypes -- from the doting and flirtatious doctor Holly, to Lyle, your local edgy boy. There are five heroes in total, and you'll learn about each of their stories, with most of them having some sort of tragic background.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Alright Holly, not the most appropriate attire for a doctor.&nbsp;</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I did develop some emotional connection to the characters, since you're going into the past with the knowledge that, in the present, they're in their cocoons and must be slain. Only tragedy awaits them, and all of these characters also lead tumultuous lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Their backstories are explained a bit crudely, however, as you embark on quests with them. They'll often go into long lore dumps for no reason (perhaps because you're a silent protagonist), so <em>Code Vein 2</em> is more of the "tell, don't show" type of game.</p><p>Some characters are deeper than others, with Lyle not being all that compelling and Holly being somewhat likable but otherwise a tad too "fan servicey" for my taste. Josee was much more captivating as a character, with her dominating personality and a past filled with familial trauma. Her story is emotional, but it would probably have more of an impact were she not tramping around in her underwear the whole time.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Alright, guess we're not talking about the past.</figcaption>

<p>Then there's Zenon, a gregarious and towering Revenant that is introduced via a musical number. Despite the tonal whiplash, that was a pretty silly moment that I haven't seen in many games, and it immediately told me what I needed to know about Zenon.</p><p>From a narrative perspective, the time travel aspect isn't really all that well utilized in <em>Code Vein 2</em>. You're changing the present timeline, but in what seem to be very, very minute ways. The payoff happens if you decide to pursue the two additional endings in <em>Code Vein 2 </em>beyond the first, but you'll have to contend with this game's combat to see those -- both the good and the bad.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<h2>Weapons Come in Many Formae</h2><p>When I play a Soulslike, my first thought is always, "How am I going to build this character?" Almost always, I default to strength -- pure strength. <em>Code Vein 2, </em>like its predecessor, is a bit different in that regard. You gain Haze (which operates as this game's runes or souls), and that is spent for a level increase. Leveling up increases all stats, not just the ones of your choosing.&nbsp;</p><p>So how, then, do you build a strength-based character, or a dexterity one, for that matter? It's all in the Blood Code. These are basically equipable classes that automatically scale stats a certain way. So it all comes down to finding the right Blood Code, which, if you use it enough times, upgrades to unlock better ones.</p><figure role="group">
<picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cv2-bloodcode.jpeg?itok=6OVfQwur 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

<figcaption>A look at Blood Codes, of which there are many.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This system is great -- it rewards players for sticking with a certain style of play. Not only that, it allows you to switch classes on the fly, so you're not pigeonholed into one specific archetype if it's not working for you. Though if you're stubborn like me, you'll just stick to the same thing throughout.</p><p>This type of flexibility is where <em>Code Vein 2</em> shines. There's also a lot of equipment to choose from to further enhance your build. The in-game names for these items are a bit confusing -- Jails, Bequeathed Formae, Defensive Formae, Boosters -- but it's easier to just think of them as weapons or tools for your kit.</p><p>For instance, Jails are used to suck ichor from injured enemies, which is a precious resource that allows you to use Weapon Formae (simply, weapon skills), and that is your main source of damage. Bequethed Formae is a powerful, secondary weapon that uses ichor, and Defensive Formae are defensive items like shields or dashes that allow you to avoid or reduce damage.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>Boosters, on the other hand, are additional little items that can give base stat increases, increase damage with certain weapon types, and more. I preferred running with boosters that increased my offense, defense, and gave extra hammer damage. All of these terms are intimidating at first, but you can intuit what they all mean pretty quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>And so, with all of these parts working in tandem, there's a great deal of depth to <em>Code Vein 2</em>'s combat. You can also roll with one additional weapon that can be switched on the fly, but that'll increase your burden a bit, but the options seem pretty limitless.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Tossed Around</h2><p>Bosses are large and imposing, with attack patterns and almost too much health for it to be reasonable, and enemies can even pack a punch too. Thankfully, you can run with an AI companion to lighten the burden of <em>Code Vein 2</em>'s difficulty, though you can also decide to go without them for an extra challenge.</p><p>For me, though, <em>Code Vein 2</em> was a constant battle to stay ahead. The beginning stages were challenging as I was formulating my build, until I eventually landed on the proper Blood Code and weapons I wanted to use. After you pin that down, things can be a bit less grueling, though I couldn't help but think that this game wasn't built for players like me.</p><p>I opt for slow and heavy weapons, hence my hammer, and that's what I usually play in most Soulslikes. So, I expected to be a warrior who packs a punch while also taking a punch. If only it worked out that way.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Dream Land! I love Dream Land!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Enemies, particularly bosses, in <em>Code Vein 2</em> feel quite overtuned. Their attacks will almost always toss you, so it's nearly impossible to <em>not</em> have your poise broken. Seriously, it felt like <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/monster-hunter" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter</em></a> at times when you'd get hit by an enemy. I'd just get tossed into the air by some over-aggressive abomination while I whittled away at bosses' insane health pools.</p><p>Boss patterns feel almost too aggressive and too fast, and the window to dodge felt off. As a heavy player, I expected to tank some hits, but in most cases, I'd have to chug a potion or two, only to be tossed again. Most of the time, I was able to damage bosses when they targeted my AI companion, because it's very hard to stand toe-to-toe with bosses when they're constantly on your ass.</p><p>The ideal scenario is winning a fight and feeling satisfied, but that was rarely the case. <em>Code Vein 2</em> just doesn't feel like it's built to accommodate gamers with my style of play, which is a shame.</p><figure role="group">

  </picture>
<figcaption>Here's just a snippet of a single region in <em>Code Vein 2</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>An Open World, But Also an Empty One</h2><p>I say all this already knowing, however, that Bandai Namco is aware of these issues and is addressing them in a future patch; indeed, the highlights of said patch would "adjust Evasion performance for higher effectiveness," and "Implement other balance adjustments, including changes to enemy behaviors."</p><p>Even so, there are several more issues that will take more than a patch or two in order to fix. I'd actually be very surprised if these next few complaints are fixed at all. I have issues with the open world and dungeon design. I suppose it all boils down to these areas of <em>Code Vein 2</em> being relatively uninteresting and empty.</p><p>The concept of an open world has promise; after all, it worked for <em>Elden Ring</em> splendidly. You could turn in almost any direction and see something that catches your eye in <em>Elden Ring</em>, whereas it's the opposite in <em>Code Vein 2.&nbsp;</em></p><figure role="group">
<picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cv2-flight-1.jpeg?itok=KHDZDc9H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture>
<figcaption>You have a motorcycle that can traverse the world, and it also doubles as a glider.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's a shame, because the world is vast, and each zone has its own distinct feel. Even so, there are few dungeons out in the open world, so there's very little incentive to explore. I'd usually just go from Point A to Point B, wherever my current quest wanted to take me, as you rarely stumble upon anything worthwhile.</p><p>Once you discover part of the map, you can actually see where most points of interest are, so that almost destroys the feeling of discovering something rare or special. For instance, the ruins of the Sunken City, despite having miles and miles of dilapidated buildings and facilities, generally doesn't have much beyond a few key areas.</p><figure role="group">
<picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cv2-map.jpeg?itok=POkXsGS_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture>
<figcaption>Okay, there is one exception to the mostly linear dungeons.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When you do come across a dungeon, they have the feel of the catacombs with those creepy little gargoyles from <em>Elden Ring</em>. Arguably, those dungeons are the worst part of <em>Elden Ring</em>, since they all look the same. For the most part, <em>Code Vein 2</em>'s dungeons follow that same formula. These drab, grey facilities filled with enemies feel samey and do nothing to stand out. Rewards at the end don't particularly feel useful beyond the Haze you get from killing all the enemies.</p><p>There are a few exceptions to this critique, but this is mainly during the main storyline. One such area is this floating, fractured theme park with perilous drops and enemies lurking in corners, waiting to push you over. These work well and hearken back to <em>Dark Souls</em> level design of being able to explore in unconventional ways. For the most part, though, dungeons are almost always completely linear in nature and have little exploration.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

  </picture>
<figcaption>There is a nice little QOL feature that allows you to see where you've been before.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><em>Code Vein 2 </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p>Performance is another area where <em>Code Vein 2 </em>is found to be lacking, though it's also on the list for fixes in the upcoming patches. On PS5's Performance Mode, frame rates are super choppy and inconsistent. I don't think I ever reached 60 FPS, which is the minimum I'd expect for a game such as this.</p><p>While <em>Code Vein 2</em> has excellent visual design, Performance Mode definitely doesn't do it any favors. It makes <em>Code Vein 2</em> look like an early title from the previous generation. The scale of the world and the detail can actually be impressive, but it desperately needs these optimization fixes to show its true potential.&nbsp;</p><p>I've been pretty harsh on <em>Code Vein 2</em>, but despite my gripes, it's a promising game. Combat is versatile and challenging (if unfair, for the time being), and the characters are still more memorable than most other games of its genre. Once a few more patches start to roll out, I'm sure <em>Code Vein 2</em> will be in a much better state.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em><strong>Code Vein 2 </strong>was reviewed on PS5 with a copy provided by the publisher over the course of around 35 hours of gameplay.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile </em>will be shutting down completely in April, publisher Activision has announced, so make sure you get in the games you want to play before it goes away.</p><p>In a <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> on the official <em>Warzone Mobile </em>website, Activision says that the game's servers will be closing on April 17th, after which point you won't be able to play it at all.</p><p>In May last year, <em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile </em>was delisted after not meeting Activision's "expectations", so its closure probably shouldn't come as a surprise. Still, it's a little disappointing that <em>Warzone Mobile </em>will be disappearing entirely and that you won't be able to play it at all anymore.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>If you still happen to have <em>Warzone Mobile </em>installed, you can use any COD Points you may have left over in order to buy in-game content until the April shutdown, but you can't buy any more of it with real cash.</p><p>You also won't be able to get any refunds for COD Points you've purchased, so it's best to use those points towards anything you might want in <em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile </em>before it shuts down.</p><p>It's worth noting that this shutdown won't affect the more popular <em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em>; that game will continue to operate as normal, as will the PC and console-based <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>. This shutdown strictly applies to <em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</em>.</p><p>It's a little confusing, but you can remember it this way: if you can currently download and play the game on your platform of choice, then it's probably not shutting down anytime soon.</p>
<p>This is where I'd usually tell you where to download and play <em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</em>, but, well, unless it's already installed on your device, you can't, unfortunately. The game will be shutting down on both Android and iOS on April 17th.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When it comes to extraction shooters, it can be every man for themselves, and one way to guarantee your success is by getting ahead of the rest. Early access is a great way to do so, but not every title offers it before launch. </p>



<p>Enter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a>, the latest extraction shooter to break onto the scene. Developed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a>, it’s bound to feature intense gunfights, and you’ll want any advantage you can find—including early access.</p>







<p>But are Bungie kind enough to offer it? Insider Gaming reveals all down below.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marathon-through-early-access">Can You Play Marathon Through Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Shoot first. Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no early access available for Marathon, which means that you’ll have to wait to play the full game at launch alongside everyone else. </strong></p>



<p>The lack of early access for Marathon can be seen as both a positive and a negative. On the one hand, it ensures that everyone starts their journey on the same footing, but on the other, it means waiting longer to dive into the game!</p>



<p>However, just because the full game won’t have early access, that doesn’t mean that you can’t play Marathon before it launches…</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marathon-before-launch">Can You Play Marathon Before Launch?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, you can play Marathon before launch, during the Server Slam Playtest, which begins on February 26 and ends on March 2.</strong></p>



<p>It might sound like early access, and whilst it technically is, you won’t have access to the full game. Instead, it’s supposed to serve as a stress test for the servers before Marathon officially launches worldwide.</p>







<p>That being said, Bungie are packing the playtest full of content, with two maps fully explorable, as well as a host of entry-level quests ready to be tackled.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has a full breakdown of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-marathon-server-slam-playtest-dates-times-platforms-content/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-marathon-server-slam-playtest-dates-times-platforms-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon Server Slam Playtest</a> up already, so if this interests you, check out how you can get involved!</p>

            <guid>1438099</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite continues to drop regular new content, and though the start of the next season has been delayed, a fresh drop lies ahead with the deployment of V39.50.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battle-royale/" id="127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> behemoth has already seen some huge collabs and crossovers so far in 2026, including the likes of South Park and The Office, and new content is on the agenda to appease fans frustrated by the delay to the start of Chapter 7 Season 2.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fort</a>nite V39.50 is due to arrive this week, and Insider Gaming has all the important details on exactly when it drops and what you can expect to be added.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-fortnite-update">When is The Next Fortnite Update?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Return. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite’s next update is set to arrive on Thursday, February 19, when Epic Games deploys v39.50 into the fold.</strong></p>



<p>Epic Games is pretty settled when it comes to regular updates, deploying major updates and downtime every few weeks. With the l;ast update landing on February 5, it’s time for a new update and new content to be added to the game.</p>



<p>It won’t be the final update of Chapter 7 Season 1, however, with the current season extended until March 19, so there will be at least one more update before Season 2 begins.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-in-fortnite-v39-50">What’s Coming in Fortnite v39.50?</h2>



<p><strong>New collabs and a fresh slew of content are arriving in Fortnite with the v39.50 update, including the new Lantern Fest event and map in Reload.</strong></p>



<p>The Reload Map will feature teams with up to eight players, and the ranks for Reload will also be reset by the update. Additionally, expect new cosmetic items to be available as part of the Lantern Fest event.</p>



<p>In the main Battle Royale, the schedule for the Love &amp; Legends event already revealed the return of the DeLorean in the update, but, more importantly, there should be a slew of details about the imminent return of The Seven, along with further hints on what to expect next season.</p>



<p>As for collabs, Solo Leveling is expected to debut, further details of the Honkai: Star Rail collab are expected, and more details about the Looney Tunes collab could also be uncovered.</p>

              <p><span>Game engine maker Unity is, like most other tech companies, fully embracing generative AI technology in its products (making the already bloated engine even more slow and annoying to use). Still clinging to the AI hype — even after it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-stocks-down-take-two-gta-nintendo-roblox-unity-google-ai-game-maker-2000664594"><span>made their own stock plummet</span></a><span> — Unity is promising to unveil a new version of its AI tool that will supposedly eliminate the need for coding entirely.</span></p> <p><span>As </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-says-its-ai-tech-will-soon-be-able-to-prompt-full-casual-games-into-existence-?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky"><span>reported</span></a><span> by GameDeveloper, the new Unity AI beta is planned to launch at the GDC Festival of Gaming in March. In </span><a href="https://investors.unity.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx"><span>a recent earnings call</span></a><span>, Unity CEO Matthew Bromsberg stated, “AI-driven authoring is our second major area of focus for 2026. At the Game Developer Conference in March, we’ll be unveiling a beta of the new upgraded Unity AI, which will enable developers to prompt full casual games into existence with natural language only, native to our platform — so it’s simple to move from prototype to finished product.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“This assistant will be powered by our unique understanding of the project context and our runtime, while leveraging the best frontier models that exist. We believe together this combination will provide more efficient, more effective results to game developers than general-purpose models alone.”</span></p> <p><span>Half of game developers attending GDC this year think generative AI is </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/one-third-of-game-workers-use-generative-ai-but-half-think-it-s-bad-for-the-industry"><span>bad for the games industry</span></a><span>. Some game developers also report that using generative AI </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-video-game-development-art-vibe-coding-midjourney/"><span>actually makes their jobs harder</span></a><span>. Developers are already struggling to get attention for their games in a market where <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/a-terrifying-20-282-games-were-released-on-steam-in-2025-and-just-608-managed-to-get-1-000-reviews-expert-finds-we-might-be-in-a-bit-of-an-indie-golden-age/">20,000 new releases</a> came to Steam last year. AI threatens to flood digital storefronts with even more noise.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Our goal is to remove as much friction from the creative process as possible, becoming the universal bridge between the first spark of creativity and a successful, scalable, and enduring digital experience,” Bromsberg said.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The distaste for generative AI extends to players as well. In a </span><a href="https://quanticfoundry.com/2025/12/18/gen-ai/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email"><span>survey</span></a><span> taken by nearly 2 million players, over 85% have a negative attitude toward generative AI in video games.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>During the Q&amp;A segment of the earnings call, Bromsberg said there will eventually be “tens of millions of more people creating interactive entertainment” using AI tools, and that Unity plans to spearhead that hypothetical movement.</span></p> <p><span>Basically, the AI revolution is coming any day now.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-switch-2-exclusive-all-platforms/</link>
            <guid>1438081</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon fans are set to be spoiled in 2026 as the franchise celebrates its 30th anniversary, and Pokopia is a major release that is right around the corner. However, questions continue to be asked about platforms.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokopia</a> will be released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-announced/" id="157069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 5</a>, a week after the expected flood of news emerges on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-day-2026-pokemon-presents/" id="172098" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Day</a>, providing players with a new way to explore the world of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a>, taking the form of a humanoid ditto.</p>



<p>If you’re unsure whether Pokopia is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> exclusive, Insider Gaming has all the important details.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-pokemon-pokopia-a-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive">Is Pokémon Pokopia a Nintendo Switch 2 Exclusive?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Next gen. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Pokémon</strong> <strong>Pokopia will only be available to purchase on Nintendo Switch 2, and is the first platform exclusive for the newest system for the franchise.</strong></p>



<p>While Pokémon Legends: Z-A was available on both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" id="302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a> consoles, Pokopia is being released solely for Switch 2. Additionally, it’s expected that any future releases for Pokémon moving forward will be Switch 2 exclusives, excluding mobile titles.</p>



<p>Additionally, there will not be a physical copy of Pokopia, and those who purchase a boxed version of the game will be provided with a Game-Key Card, which prompts a download. Unlike codes, however, they can be resold or shared with others, like a regular game cartridge.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pokemon-pokopia-on-the-original-nintendo-switch">Can You Play Pokémon Pokopia on The Original Nintendo Switch?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, while Pokémon</strong> <strong>Pokopia won’t be released on the original Nintendo Switch, the game can still be played on the original console, though there are significant limitations.</strong></p>



<p>Pokopia’s Gamershare feature allows users to invite another player to their game to create a 2-player co-op session, including the ability to send invitations to players with an original Switch console.</p>



<p>Shared games are only playable during the active session, however, and cannot be played independently by a player on the original Switch console later.</p>



<p>While this opens the door for players to enjoy Pokopia without splashing out on a Nintendo Switch 2 console, you will require someone with the game. If you want to enjoy everything Pokopia has to offer and work through the story at your own pace, you’ll need access to a Switch 2 yourself.</p>

<p>The console barriers seem to be falling down, as Sony-developed Marathon will be playable on Xbox Series X|S. It’s not the first time this has happened, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/helldivers-2/" id="850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Helldivers 2</a> being one of the first to break the stigma, and it looks like Marathon will keep the streak alive.</p>







<p>However, whilst it’ll be playable on Xbox devices, does that mean <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> will be available on Xbox Game Pass too? Insider Gaming has all the details down below.</p>

<p><strong>No, Marathon will not be available on Xbox Game Pass when it releases on March 5, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Just because it’s on the platform doesn’t mean it’ll break into the Xbox game’s service, as sad as that may be. If anything, it’s a coupe that Marathon will even be playable on both Xbox Series X|S, so it might be a case of taking your wins and moving on. </p>



<p>However, whilst it’s not on Xbox Game Pass at launch, that doesn’t mean it can’t feature in the future, does it?</p>



<h2 id="h-will-marathon-be-added-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Marathon Be Added To Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no news suggesting that Marathon will ever release on Xbox Game Pass, and considering it’s developed by Sony-owned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a>, it’d be incredibly unlikely.</strong></p>



<p>Microsoft tend to release almost all of its first-party titles day and date on Xbox Game Pass, with many third-party titles very much on the cards in the future. However, it’s currently rare enough to find a PlayStation title on Xbox, let alone on Game Pass.</p>







<p>That being said, stranger things have happened, so until it’s officially ruled out, don’t write it off. Who knows, in a year or two, Marathon may well be on Game Pass—just don’t hold your breath.</p>
