            <p>It’s been a little while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-the-co-creator-of-skins-became-the-lead-writer-on-an-upcoming-aaa-open-world-game">since we last heard</a> about the untitled open-world driving game from Maverick Games, the studio opened a couple of years back by ex-Playground Games veterans including former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> creative director Mike Brown. We still don’t know what the team’s new game is called or when it might hit the road, but we have been given a few more snippets of what to expect and news on who’ll be helping pump up its tires and fill it with fuel as publisher.</p>

<p>As well as the obvious racing game experience of the Playground devs (along with other devs who’ve worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open-world games</a> like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>), the untitled driving game is mixing in an element that Brown and team feel reckon will set it apart: a closer focus on its story and characters, with what Brown describes as a “human connection”.</p>
<p>“Lots of great driving games have amazing gameplay, amazing content,” <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/maverick-games-mike-brown-interview">said</a> Brown. “But to really cross that bridge, to become a game that people genuinely love, then there needs to be that human connection where you’re actually rooting for these characters, falling in love with these characters.</p>
<p>“That, I think, is a place where our game will be able to really differentiate itself from the other titles in the genre. There’s nothing about this genre that prevents it from having amazing characters and amazing stories - it’s just not really been explored yet.”</p>

<p>Helping with the “narrative-led” portion of the game is lead writer Jamie Brittain, who co-created Channel 4’s era-defining noughties teen drama Skins. Brown said that Brittain’s knack for creating characters who are “flawed and actually a little bit weird - just like the rest of us” (though presumably quite good at driving regardless) will come through in the game’s story. While Brown mentions that "human connection", I quite like the idea of a gritty Cars-like world full of sentient vehicles going to driving school by day and partying in grotty clubs by night.</p>
<p>Maverick is now up to more than 60 devs from the ten or so that founded it back in 2022, and has <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/maverick-games-publishing-agreement">inked a fresh deal</a> with Amazon Games to publish their debut “AAA” racing game across PC and consoles - making it Amazon’s latest game after the likes of MMOs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/new-world">New World</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a>, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-tomb-raider-will-be-published-by-amazon-games">Crystal Dynamics’ next Tomb Raider game</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-games-announce-a-second-attempt-at-the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">a Lord of the Rings MMO</a> also in the works. Brown, for his part, claims that Amazon have backed the team’s efforts to “foster an environment of creativity and risk-taking”.</p>

  <p id="h3xpn4">The World Series of Poker may have its coveted bracelet, but the <em>Disney Lorcana</em> trading card game now has its own piece of hardware for its highest-performing players. Naturally, it’s a golden Mickey Mouse.</p>
<p id="vNoWXD">The very first <a href="https://www.disneylorcana.com/en-US/play_/lorcana-challenge#schedule">Lorcana Challenge regional tournaments</a> were held over the Memorial Day weekend, with two-day events taking place in both Lille, France and Atlanta, Georgia. The game’s publisher, Ravensburger, confirmed Wednesday to Polygon that the tournament in Lille concluded first by just a few hours. That means Frank Karsten, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Pro Tour player and a member of the <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>Hall of Fame, is the world’s first Lorcana Challenge champion. </p>

<p>Black Ops 6 is set to be revealed worldwide in little more than a week, and fans are excited. It’s poised to be the best Call of Duty game in several years and marks a grand return to Black Ops, arguably the most popular sub-franchise in the Call of Duty series. In recent days, leaks have been sneaking online courtesy of several insiders, and the most recent tidbit has revealed key art for the Vault Edition and Standard Edition of Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>This leak includes some intense art of ‘Zombie Woods’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-vault-edition-confirmed">Vault Edition Confirmed</h2>



<p>The Vault Edition is typically the highest digital edition of Call of Duty these days, boasting fully unlocked weapon sets, high-tier battle passes, exclusive operator skins, and more. Recently, <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1795851896214729148/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">key art surfaced online</a> suggesting that the Vault Edition will be heavily geared towards the Zombies offering that’s going to be available in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Also included in the leaks was a ‘Standard Edition’ print – which is assumed to be the base game and nothing more – and a shot of Frank Woods as a dishevelled, chewed-up Zombies-like character. Not only that but the leaks revealed that Park, Adler, and Klaus will also be surfacing in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>It was recently revealed that Black Ops 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-for-game-pass-on-day-one/">will be released on Game Pass</a> on day one, coming to PC and Xbox consoles free for those with a subscription. This was somewhat expected, but the confirmation was a shocker – it’s not yet known if other Call of Duty titles will follow suit.</p>

"Not sure if they decided to scrap the FSR3 update or not but I feel like there will be one (small) final patch, considering the internal QA branch was updated six hours ago for the first time since the last update released," wrote Apoqsi on <a href="https://x.com/Apoqsi/status/1795478237973225618" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>This certainly seems to be the case, even if the update only arrives for the PC version of Cyberpunk 2077.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-road-to-glory-mode-nil<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">We learn more about all the features that are coming to College Football 25.</h2></div><section><p>Just a few weeks after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-first-trailer-revealed">properly revealing</a> College Football 25, EA has shared new details on its long-awaited return to college football video games, such as how name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals will work and what other things we have seen in prior college football games will not return. </p><p>Among other details, EA confirmed that Road to Glory will not be including the high school season found in previous NCAA Football games, which allowed players to play at the prep level for an abbreviated season before heading to college. Instead, Road to Glory players in College Football 25 will select their star level and other attributes while creating their player, after which they will begin their collegiate career.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Dynasty Mode, meanwhile, will return largely intact, though players will not be able to export draft classes from College Football 25 into <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-25">Madden NFL Football 25</a>. While EA did not explain why the feature was removed, College Football 25 is notable for being the first in the series to use real-world student-athletes.</p><p>Other absences include Mascot Mode, in which players could dress up as the mascot of their respective academic institution and play football. Additionally, College Football 25 will not have the ESPN license, like previous games such as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/07/09/ncaa-football-11-review">NCAA Football 11</a>, meaning ESPN-style presentations like College GameDay will not be available, despite EPSN talent like Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbstreit being available for commentary. </p><h2><strong>Out with the old</strong></h2><p>Despite some noticeable absences, EA did share new details on recent additions to the college football landscape — most notably the transfer portal and NIL deals. </p><p>The development team explained that NIL — which in real life allows players to make money on sponsorships and other deals — was tough for them to implement in Dynasty Mode, but did say that it will be an influential component in the mode. Road to Glory, meanwhile, will allow players to sign NIL deals of their own. </p><p>EA teased that depending on the NIL deal your player obtains, it can influence things like attributes for your character. However, College Football's developers did not elaborate further. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>College Football 25 Official Reveal Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>In the meantime, College Football 25 will also implement the transfer portal, allowing Dynasty Mode players to try and get players to commit to their institution while keeping their own rosters intact. The transfer portal was first introduced in 2018, making it one of the biggest changes to come to college football since the release of the last NCAA Football game. Its implementation was a key question mark for fans ahead of College Football 25's reveal.</p><p>To enhance the immersion and spirit of college football, EA also confirmed that both costumed and real animal mascots will be available. EA previously teased the inclusion of various mascots, such as Florida State's Chief Osceola riding Renegade, the University of Texas animal mascot Bevo, and University of Florida's Albert Gator in <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/college-football-25-official-reveal-trailer">the first official trailer</a>. </p><p>College Football 25 will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date">be released on July 19</a> for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It’s been over a decade and an entire console generation since we last had a new college football game to sink our teeth into. So, you can imagine the surprise to many (myself included) when EA Sports <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTS/status/1356644353901539342" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> over three years ago that it would <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-is-returning-for-the-first-time-since-2013">once again make a college football video game</a>. I recently had the opportunity to go hands-on, and I am happy to say that in my brief time with College Football 25, I ended up leaving with as much excitement as I had when I arrived. </p><p>Graphically speaking, College Football 25 is gorgeous. From small things such as how players wear their uniforms, to the realistic grass and turf on fields, College Football 25’s graphics are, as you’d expect after such a long layoff, a significant leg up from what we saw in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/05/ncaa-football-14-review">NCAA Football 14</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Graphics aside, the vibes of College Football 25 are immaculate. Any college football fan will tell you that school spirit, traditions, and pride from the fandom deliver an unprecedented passion you otherwise would not normally see from most professional sports leagues. From the energetic broadcasts from Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbsteirt, to Clemson Football players <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCLt6VPudwk&amp;pp=ygUmQ2xlbXNvbiBGb290YmFsbCBEZWF0aCBWYWxsZXkgaGlsbCBydW4%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">running enthusiastically down The Hill in Death Valley</a>, or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYuSCk1EFxg&amp;pp=ygUWUFNVIEZvb3RiYWxsIFdoaXRlIE91dA%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White Out game at Penn State</a>, College Football 25 absolutely conveyed that college pride and enthusiasm. </p><p>New-gen visuals are nice, but the biggest addition to College Football 25 is the inclusion of real-life student-athletes, as the <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/14-16601/14-16601-2015-09-30.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">O’Bannon case happened</a> since the last time EA made a College Football game. Gone are the days when we had generic faces and names; these are <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-will-pay-players-to-use-their-likeness">actual players</a> who voluntarily chose to opt in, each with their name, image, and likeness (NIL) present to attempt to recreate those athletes in virtual form. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>All these players present are not created equal, and if there is a major mismatch, it will be exploited.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Gameplay-wise, while many quickly point out that the same developer makes both Madden and College Football, College Football 25 is no junior-sized version of Madden. Prominent gameplay mechanics in modern Madden NFL games like X Factor are not present, though throw power, accuracy, and hit sticks are present. </p><p>Additionally, the skills and overall level of each school vary greatly—a match between Alabama and Georgia is going to look radically different from a game between Coastal Carolina and Michigan. This matches much more with the consistency of the real-world programs, recruiting, and rosters of each of the 134 FBS teams, which can lead to some uneven play, depending on the matchups you set up. All these players present are not created equal, and if there is a major mismatch, it will be exploited. </p><p>One key distinction to point out between the core gameplay of both College Football 25 and Madden is that the former is undoubtedly faster, from the agility of running backs and how they juke to the snappiness of a spin move. The speed of College Football 25 also means there is minimal room for error. During my session, I played a few rounds of Play Now, and each team I played as had an extremely tight window for which you had time to perfectly throw your pass, ensuring it did not result in an incomplete or an interception. The faster-paced gameplay may be off-putting, but the faster gameplay makes this a good starting point for newcomers to football sims and might even help novice Madden players who invest enough time into College Football 25. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>College Football 25 Official Reveal Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Meanwhile, to maintain the level of immersion seen in College Football, EA Orlando is introducing a new Wear &amp; Tear system designed to replicate real-life scenarios that can impact players in this sport. While selecting a play in Play Now, for example, I could see my QB's full body schematic to show his body's wear and tear. If he was taking a lot of hits, it could impact his throwing ability. Wear &amp; Tear is a risk factor system meant to challenge you both in managing the game and deciding whether to play it safe or perform a potentially high-risk, high reward coaching maneuver by keeping an injured player on the field. </p><p>College Football 25 has four modes: the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-wont-be-released-until-summer-2024">returning fan-favorite Road to Glory and Dynasty Mode</a>, College Football Ultimate Team, and the all-new Road to the College Football Playoffs. Each mode aims to replicate the real-life adjustments and changes made to the overall landscape of College Football in recent years. </p><p>And yes, the transfer portal will impact both Road to Glory and Dynasty Mode, and NIL deals will be key for your players. However, the extent to which NIL deals will impact players in both modes, particularly in the case of Road to Glory, where the development team teases that you can alter your player’s overall performance and skills, remains to be seen. </p><p>Road to Glory is still the standard single-player experience where you create a player and strive for glory, whether it's racking up individual accolades or looking to win the College Football National Championship. You’ll pick between one of five positions: QB, WR, RB, MLB, or CB in addition to your Star Level, along with present individual attributes that will allow you to lean into some strengths over others. Will you choose to be the QB that can scramble and be a dual-threat, or someone with a cannon for an arm? That’s all up to you. </p><p>Road to Glory also emphasizes the “student” in student-athletes than what was previously seen in the NCAA Football series, as players will need to balance multiple categories that will impact their academic performance, trust-building with their coach and teammates, and what type of NIL deals they can obtain. Time management and how you make your decisions when you are not at class, practice, and games will factor into your character's overall perception, performance, and where they stand on the depth chart. Your position is always at risk, depending on your choices and your player’s overall performance. </p><p>Like previous iterations, Dynasty Mode flips the script compared to Road to Glory, allowing you to play as a coach. You can start out as a head coach, or have humbler beginnings as either an offensive or defensive coordinator. Each has its own skill trees you can choose from, whether it’s one that can boost team morale or do a great job at snagging recruits to commit and sign. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>College Football 25: First Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Recruiting also maintains a multi-layer aspect that goes beyond just the star-caliber players. Some recruits will express interest in playing time, others will express interest in attending a school with high academic prowess, some may care more about how close to home it is, and others will care more about winning a National Championship. All these things, combined with what the school you choose has to offer and when you choose to schedule them to come for an official visit, will impact the odds you can sway a recruit to play for you. Even when you schedule players to take a visit, they can play at these odds.</p><p>Your performance in your team will also determine if other schools will try to poach you. With the mode supporting up to 30 seasons, you could start as an offensive coordinator and work up to a promotion at the same school or leave and head coach at another institution. </p><p>Unfortunately, EA did not dive into College Football Ultimate Team, but we did learn about the brand-new mode called Road to the College Football Playoffs. This online-only mode is ranked, where players will pick a team and battle online against other players as they race to win a national championship. As is common with ranked modes, you start off as a Recruit, but can work your way up to Heisman; the higher you go, the tougher players you will face online, but in theory, it should provide better balance and still maintain the competitive edge for players, regardless of skill level. </p><p>Though my time was brief, and there’s still a lot we don’t know, I am nevertheless eagerly awaiting my chance to play the final build of College Football 25 when it releases on July 19. </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-relaunch-draws-many-players-and-many-complaints<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a> has finally launched fully after the open beta (which many didn't realize was an open beta) shut down in June 2023, and while its return has attracted more than 100,000 concurrent players on Steam alone, it's also sparked many complaints.</p><p>Data from player-tracking website <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a> shows MultiVersus — the Warner Bros. brawler where Gizmo from Gremlins, Rick and Morty, Lebron James, Batman, Arya Stark, Bugs Bunny, Shaggy, Tom and Jerry, Jason, and more can all fight — hit a 24 hour peak of 114,515 concurrent players upon its May 28, 2024 launch day. It's a strong start for the free-to-play brawler on PC (Sony and Microsoft do not publish player numbers for PlayStation and Xbox.)</p><p>Not everyone is happy with the changes developer Player First Games made during the hiatus, however, and MultiVersus has dropped to an overall "Mixed" perception on Steam as a result of negative reviews. Changes to mechanics, the removal of certain features, and intrinsic monetization headline the complaints, with some fans even saying this final version of MultiVersus "feels more like a beta than the beta."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"They’ve taken away more features than they’ve added.</p></div><p>"They’ve taken away more features than they’ve added. The camera being zoomed and team color options removed is pretty crazy in my opinion, on top of a list of other really important changes like locking characters even in practice range," Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersus/comments/1d2vd4s/this_feels_more_like_a_beta_than_the_beta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radbrad4333</a> wrote.</p><p>"When Marvel Rivals is in a playtest alpha and can launch with a competitive mode, built in tournament system, and relatively well-balanced characters, and this game launches like this after nearly half a year of public playtesting... I don’t get it. They were supposed to learn lessons in the beta and I know it’s early, but after playing most of today, this feels like a miss."</p><p>MultiVersus was originally released in July 2022 but many didn't realize its status as an open beta due to its battle pass and other microtransactions, additional downloadable characters, and so on. After <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-peak-player-count-plummets-to-below-1000-amid-content-drought">the game's numbers had dwindled to under 1,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>, Player First Games announced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-early-access-closing-in-june-full-release-window-confirmed">the beta would come to an end in June 2023</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>MultiVersus Characters</h3></div></output><p>"Throughout our open beta, we’ve been working hard to build the best gameplay experience, and we appreciate all of the inspiration you’ve given us," co-founder and game director Tony Huynh said at the time. "Our open beta has been an important learning opportunity for us and a stepping stone to the next phase of MultiVersus."</p><p>But as noted by myriad players online, the full version of MultiVersus is lacking several features the beta did. "Let's give it up for Warner Bros. and Player First Games for killing the offline scene by removing the complete offline roster," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersus/comments/1d2o74n/lets_give_it_up_for_wb_and_pfg_for_killing_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doinky420</a> said on Reddit. "Other honorable mentions go to not being able to test characters before buying them and removing options that people built muscle memory with."</p><p>Another post from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersus/comments/1d2wi9s/everything_that_changed_for_the_worse_from_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sloppybuttons</a> lists "everything that changed for the worse from the beta period", which includes battle changes like no leaderboards or after battle report, and mode changes like the removal of cooperative battles against AI and no free for all mode with items. It also points to more loading screens, removed input options, and more.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Let's give it up for Warner Bros. and Player First Games for killing the offline scene by removing the complete offline roster.</p></div><p>Players are otherwise frustrated with the economy in this version of MultiVersus. While it's a free-to-play game (with the likes of a battle pass and other microtransactions that let players buy skins and new characters), many players are complaining about major changes to how monetization works.</p><p>A cheaper tier of characters available for 1,500 Fighter Currency (one of the in-game currencies) are no longer available, with every character now costing between 3,000 and 6,000 each, or with 1,000 to 1,250 Gleamium (the main premium currency bought with real money). The cheapest players can buy Gleamium is in a pack of 450 for $4.99 while its most expensive and best value pack comes with 6,000 and costs $49.99.</p><p>These bundles have specifically caused frustration too, as an uncommon skin costs 500 Gleamium, meaning the cheapest $4.99 bundle doesn't quite grant players enough to buy one. This is a common technique used to keep players spending. "Scummy as hell," wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersus/comments/1d2xdcr/uncommon_skins_cost_500_gleamium_and_499_gets_you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IWantTheDomoHat</a>. "No one wants to spend $10 for what should be a $5 skin. Please change it to 500 Gleamium. I think I can speak on the behalf of everyone that this is absurd."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Only five characters are available for free at launch too, and the rest of roster must be unlocked with Fighter Currency, which is earned through completing missions, seasonal events, single-player mode Rifts, and the battle pass, or with Gleamium. Players who want the full roster immediately must therefore pay, using the cheapest options available, $155.</p><p>This will give players access to every character, but not the extensive collection of skins, announcer packs, animated ringouts, profile icons, and so on, which are all available at an additional cost. A bundle which includes one skin, stance, emotes, voice over, and a ringout for Shaggy is currently available on sale for 2,444 Gleamium instead of 3,325. Players purchasing the $20 Gleamium pack will, again, find themselves just short of that amount with 2,200 total.</p><p>This pack is on the cheaper end of the many on offer too, with others costing as much as 3,390 Gleamium on sale or 4,525 usually. This one includes a banner on top of what's included in the Shaggy bundle, and would cost players $35 at its discounted price or $45 usually.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I think I can speak on the behalf of everyone that this is absurd.</p></div><p>"They spent a year making literally everything gameplay wise worse and on implementing f**king currencies, stories, FOMO, and mobile game level grind gems for player versus everyone upgrades," wrote Patrick on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818750/MultiVersus/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>. "So much potential wasted due to baffling decisions and corporate greed," wrote another user.</p><p>"They locked the ability to test out characters and skins in practice, removed our universal currency of Gold and replaced it with three different [mobile game] bulls**t currencies, including 'prestige' which is basically a VIP system. Pay more money, get more prestige currency, use prestige currency to unlock the most wanted cosmetics."</p><p>MultiVersus still pulled in a good number of players despite these complaints, but Player First Games knows from experience that number can quickly fall. Fans are therefore hoping it moves to address the community's complaints quickly.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p>YouTube has announced the introduction of over 75 games to its platform, all of which can be played in-browser or via the YouTube mobile app. Over the past few months, the game library--referred to by YouTube as "Playables"--has been made available to select users in certain markets, but the company announced this week Playables is being expanded.</p><p dir="ltr">Playables can be accessed via a user's browser or iOS device (no word yet on Android compatibility), and the current selection consists of simple-yet-engaging games similar to those found on Google Play and the App Store. From classics like chess and billiards to modern titles like Angry Birds Showdown and Tomb Of The Mask, YouTube's Playables collection has games spanning multiple genres.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, even after the official announcement regarding their introduction, not everyone can access the games yet, but YouTube has assured users that the new feature will be accessible for all in the near future.</p><p dir="ltr">"Not seeing Playables yet? Don’t worry, we’re widening availability to more users over the coming months, so keep checking back!" reads a portion of <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-playables/" rel="nofollow ">the blog post announcing the introduction of the feature</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Playables can be accessed by heading to the YouTube homepage and selecting "Playables'' from the Explore menu. Players can save their game progress to return to later, and even track high scores. YouTube is currently requesting community feedback on the new feature.</p><p dir="ltr">"Have ideas for how we can make Playables even better? We want to hear from you! You can give us your thoughts through the 'send feedback' option while playing by tapping the three-dotted 'More' menu," the announcement blog post explains.</p><p>Prior to its closure, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stadia/">Google Stadia</a> featured YouTube integration, and Google wanted users to be able to start playing games directly via video ads. Alas, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stadia-is-officially-dead/1100-6510708/" data-ref-id="1100-6510708">the service is no more</a>, with Google also shutting down its first-party development teams.</p>

<p data-characters="194" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Ahead of <em>Warzone</em> and<em> Modern Warfare 3 </em>Season 4, <em>Call of Duty’s</em> anti-cheat team addressed boosting concerns in Ranked Play, but players wanted more than a slap on the wrist for wrongdoers. </p> <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="378" data-injectable="false">One day before Season 4 started, <em>Call of Duty’s</em> anti-cheat team <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1795554591020642673" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that players who participated in any form of boosting behavior will have their Skill Rating reset and will be removed from the leaderboard. Also, all accounts that boosted their progression in Ranked Play will be permanently restricted from accessing the game modes in <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> or <em>Warzone</em>. </p> <figure data-current-count="678" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🛡️ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MW3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MW3</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warzone?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Warzone</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TeamRICOCHET?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TeamRICOCHET</a></p><p>In continuation of our commitment to combating unfair play, all accounts found to have participated in any form of boosting behavior in Multiplayer or Warzone Ranked Play will have their SR reset and be removed from the Leaderboard ahead of the…</p></div>— Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1795554591020642673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="603" data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true">Before Season 3, the anti-cheat team also <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1775523850807304275">reset SR</a> and removed cheaters from the leaderboard. Boosting is an issue across all of <em>Call of Duty</em>, but is especially a problem in <em>Warzone</em>. Cheaters will either pay for a service that puts them in a lobby with players that don’t shoot back, or large groups will coordinate lobbies where players will earn Skill Rating for getting free kills on enemies in a Ranked Play match. As a result, several of these cheaters have earned top leaderboard spots. At the end of every season, Ranked Play gives out awards based on how high you finish in a given season.</p>
 <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="336" data-injectable="false">Luckily, the anti-cheat team has been able to weed out any wrongdoers before those awards go unfairly into undeserving hands, but a segment of the player base wants further action. Since these cheaters are only banned in Ranked Play modes, that means its still possible for them to load into a normal <em>Warzone </em>or<em> Modern Warfare 3 </em>match. </p> <p data-characters="165" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">“Good. But why not ban them from the game completely?” Warzone Loadout <a href="https://x.com/Warzone_Loadout/status/1795554925113483514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked</a>. “I’m personally all for a very strict anti cheating policy.” </p>
 <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">Other users questioned why the team would wait until the end of the season before taking action. If players were allowed to boost all season, this could have had a direct impact on other competitors attempting to earn Skill Rating properly. “My question is why wait so long,” a frustrated commenter <a href="https://x.com/CtrlDub/status/1795554706225238311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued</a>. </p> <p data-characters="178" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="false">For now, <em>Warzone</em> players will have to live with this slap on the wrist, and rest comfortably knowing that the anti-cheat team is aggressively restricting accounts every season. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everything-we-know-about-making-of-original-dungeons-dragons-1970-1977</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-we-know-about-the-making-of-original-dungeons-dragons-1970-1977.884001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everything-we-know-about-making-of-original-dungeons-dragons-1970-1977<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2024 continues to be a massive year for <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/dungeons-dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>. With the recent release of the level 10-20 adventure, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/vecna-eve-of-ruin-dd-5e-review-culmination-of-years-of-work"><em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em></a>, and the upcoming Core Rulebook updates on the way there's one more book from Wizards of the Coast releasing; <em>The Making of Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons 1970-1977</em>.</p>

<p>Unlike other releases, this isn't an Adventure or Sourcebook but instead is a celebration of the creation and development of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> on it's 50th anniversary.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago we had a chance to sit down and hear from those involved in the creation of the book including Jason Tondro, Senior Game Designer, and Jon Peterson, D&amp;D Historian and the Author of this book.</p>



<p><em>The Making of Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons 1970-1977</em> will be releasing on June 18th, 2024 and will be available for $99.99. This book will be 576 pages long, roughly one and a half times as large as a normal <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> adventure if that's the best reference you have to picture it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"There are a lot of books that tell people how <em>D&amp;D</em> was made, but what we wanted to do with this book was show it to you instead"<br>
- Jason Tondro, Senior Game Designer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tondro explained that the book sis separated into four different sections; Precursors, The 1973 Draft of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, and Articles &amp; Additions. This path is meant to illustrate what kinds of Pen &amp; Paper RPGs were already in the space and influencing Gary Gygax, all the way to the first three supplements that were released including Greyhawk, Blackmore, and Eldritch Wizardry.</p>



<p>On top of the resources themselves the book will also show off documents about how the game is played that Gary wrote, articles from Dragon, and even letters from Gary to show off not just what was happening directly to the game of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> but also to highlight what was happening to those in that space.</p>

<p>Greg Tito, Senior Communications Manager at WOTC, also took a moment to highlight that each of these sections come with their own colored ribbon to help you keep your place as you move through the massive tome.</p>

<h2>Inception of the Idea</h2>

<p>Jon Peterson, having written multiple <em>D&amp;D</em> history books, shared to those present how their involvement came about. "Wizards reached out to me back in the spring of 2021 and asked if I had any ideas about any ideas for what they could&nbsp; do to honor the 50th anniversary and I said 'Yes I do'"</p>

<p>"Having worked on books like <em>Playing At The World, The Elusive Shift, Game Wizards</em>&nbsp;I thought wouldn't it be amazing to go back to all the originals. Unfortunately, some of the material that tells this story is hard to get these days."</p>

<p>Peterson explained that due to the limited printings of some of these fan zines they now cost incredible amounts at auction and with this book they want to put that information in front of people and in an easier to access manner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If it were up to me this book would be twice as long"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"We did our best to be able to include what we could that we thought was the most essential to telling the story."</p>

<h2>Precursors &amp; Inspirations</h2>

<p>Continuing to discuss the contents of the book specific highlights were paid to games like <em>Braunstein</em>, a wargame about an Austrian town being invaded where player characters were given individual goals and a referee would have to make up outcomes or consequences for players unique actions and how that ended up becoming the <em>Blackmoor </em>setting.</p>



<p>Included beside this explanation is a copy of the announcement of the release of "<em>Medieval Braunstein</em>" and an invitation to players to play. The invitation also included that there would be "refreshments" showing that even 54 years ago the DM would end up having to step up and provide table snacks.</p>

<p>Comparing what was going on in <em>Braunstein </em>to <em>Chainmail</em>, which Gygax was working on, was that <em>Braunstein </em>would have players take on the roles of characters in a more 1:1 fashion, and not just as a human at a table commanding groups of characters. <em>Chainmail </em>also had its own <em>Fantasy Supplement</em> to add in spells and wizards of varying ability.</p>

<h2>A Combination of Ideas</h2>

<p>Discussing further the inspirations and pieces that would work together to become <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> some other key points that were highlighted include the discussions between Arneson and his adventure in <em>Blackmoor</em>, Gygax working on <em>Chainmail</em>, and then the additional inclusion of <em>Outdoor Survival</em>, and <em>Dungeon</em>.</p>

<p>Each of these games were being individually worked on or developed with the awareness and investigation from one another that it made sense they would all end up coming together.</p>

<p>Looking through the different documents that are included it was highlighted that like an archeological dig where you can see one persons typing up of rules, with additional penwork and handwriting over it as editions shifted and addendums were made. One addendum that was pointed out was the handwritten inclusion of Sleep as a second-level Cleric spell.</p>

<h2>Documents Of Their Time</h2>

<p>One aspect of preserving these original documents that was pointed out was that there's verbiage in these that include things that we wouldn't say today. Wizards of the Coast hired inclusivity consultants to identify the language that they would want to call out.</p>

<p>For historical purposes they didn't want to alter any of that material, but they did want to educate readers and call out the historical context. From there the reader is able to be informed.</p>

Yesterday, District Judge Michael Fitzgerald ordered several defendants, including EngineOwning itself, to pay the company $14.465,600 for their creation and distribution of <em>Call of Duty </em>cheats.</p><p>In addition, the judge ordered EngineOwning to turn over its website, stop making and selling cheats, and pay $292,912 in attorney fees to Activision. You can find a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24698335-la22cv00051-mwf-o12?responsive=1&amp;title=1">PDF of the ruling here</a>. The site, engineowning.to, is apparently still operating today, offering cheats like an “Aimbot” that automatically aims and fires or the ability to see other players through walls for many games, including several in the <em>CoD </em>series.</p><p>Activision had previously won $3 million in a pair of settlements with two of the people — Ignacio Gayduchenko and Manuel Santiago — involved with EngineOwning, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name">as <em>IGN</em> notes</a>. But it had originally sued many more people who never responded to the lawsuit. </p><p>Yesterday’s filing named EngineOwning itself and its founders, Valentin Rick and Leon Risch, in addition to several others, including people involved in managing and marketing, site moderation, and an authorized EngineOwning reseller named Pascal Classen. Because they didn’t respond, the company finally asked the court in April to make a call, leading to yesterday’s default judgment. </p><p>The judge found EngineOwning and its many associated defendants guilty of violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He also found them guilty of “intentionally” inducing players to buy and use cheats, despite knowing that the <em>Call of Duty</em> terms of use forbid it.</p><p>Gaming companies are increasingly turning to the courts to deal with cheat creators. In 2022, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/17/23172558/destiny-2-bungie-cheat-settlement">Bungie settled</a> with <em>Destiny 2 </em>cheat makers for $13.5 million. Bungie also won a much smaller sum of $63,000, but it was also likely the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/25/24164679/bungie-anti-cheating-lawsuit-jury-trial-aimjunkies-copyright-violation-victory">first time a jury had ruled in such a case</a>. AimJunkies, the defendant in that case, had taken the extraordinary approach of fighting the case, rather than ignoring it or settling.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="RLK2wV">Once you start talking about Jane Schoenbrun’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24064917/best-movies-2024"><em>I Saw the TV Glow</em></a>, it’s hard to stop. Their eerie, tragic follow-up to the underground hit <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23027388/were-all-going-to-the-worlds-fair-review"><em>We’re All Going to the World’s Fair</em></a> is endlessly layered and unpackable, from its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158543/i-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview">complicated central metaphor about trans coming-out</a> to its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24153069/i-saw-tv-glow-amber-benson-cameo-fixing-buffy-vampire-slayer">close links to <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> and other media</a> to that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24160895/i-saw-the-tv-glow-ending-explained-interpretation">indelible, hard-hitting ending</a>. </p>
<p id="mER3Uu">While there’s plenty to talk about throughout the movie, we keep coming back to the ending, in part because we’ve seen an interesting split in how people are interpreting it. Like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/interviews/22275255/bliss-movie-ending-mike-cahill-interview">the ending of <em>Inception</em></a>, like <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/the-electrifying-ending-of-challengers-explained#:~:text=Kuritzkes%20wanted%20this%20climactic%20moment,final%20moment%20in%20the%20movie.">the ending of <em>Challengers</em></a>, the end of <em>TV Glow</em> prompts viewers to see different things in the same images and the same moments. Here at Polygon, we’re seeing the same split in our own writers… and you know what that means. It’s time for another case file at Polygon Court.</p>
<p id="RqmCl6">Polygon Court is where we take our divisive pop culture conflicts, as we did when we debated the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23613387/titanic-alternate-ending-meaning">alternate ending of James Cameron’s <em>Titanic</em></a>, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23720275/fast-furious-movies-best-races-chases">most important part of the Fast &amp; Furious franchise</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23521274/avatar-way-water-spider-jack-champion">the problem of Spider in <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em></a>, the song cut from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23518742/muppet-christmas-carol-streaming-deleted-song-when-love-is-gone"><em>The Muppet Christmas Carol</em></a>, and the mysterious, maybe problematic ending of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24080734/all-of-us-strangers-ending-explained-good-or-bad"><em>All of Us Strangers</em></a>. So pull up the stenograph and get ready to take notes (and take sides), because court is in session.</p>

<p id="fOzKlQ">The quick summary: <em>I Saw the TV Glow</em> follows decades in the life of Owen (Ian Foreman as a young teenager, Justice Smith thereafter), a shy, deeply awkward, lonely young man who finds solace in a late-night cult TV show called <em>The Pink Opaque</em>. He’s lured into the show’s fandom by a slightly older teenager, Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine), who considers the show “more real than real life.” Maddy desperately wants to escape their small town, and sees <em>The Pink Opaque</em> as a form of escape. The show centers on two girls, Isabel and Tara, who share a psychic connection, which they use to fight the sinister Mr. Melancholy and his evil agents.</p>
<p id="b7yEoF">Eventually, Maddy runs away from home — she invites Owen to join her, but he’s too afraid to leave. Eight years later, Maddy returns, telling Owen that <em>The Pink Opaque</em> is real, she is actually Tara, he is actually Isabel, and that in the real world, Isabel has been captured by Mr. Melancholy, who buried her alive, using his potions to hold her in an illusion and prevent her from escaping. Owen’s entire life is that illusion. Maddy says she can break Owen out of it before Isabel dies, but he needs to undergo the same dangerous, frightening ritual she put herself through, allowing herself to be buried alive so she could get back in touch with herself as Tara and force her way through the illusion.</p>
<p id="Ty8Nnf">Owen refuses, and Maddy retreats, telling him he still has time, but not infinite time. Decades go by in the blink of an eye. <em>The Pink Opaque</em> changes in an unsettling, disappointing way. Owen claims he’s happy enough, but he seems disconnected, drifting, and miserable — until one day, at his job at an arcade, he snaps and screams that he’s dying, that he needs help. Everything around him freezes, and no one seems to notice what he’s said. He retreats to the bathroom, where he cuts open his chest and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24160895/i-saw-the-tv-glow-ending-explained-interpretation">sees the static glow of his television inside himself</a> — but he just returns to the arcade, where he apologizes to every customer he sees for his outburst, even though none of them acknowledge him or seem to notice. And that’s where the movie ends.</p>

<p id="w6ywjb"><strong>Tasha: </strong>Pete, I was shocked to hear you see a light at the end of the tunnel after all that! I <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24160895/i-saw-the-tv-glow-ending-explained-interpretation">wrote about the end of the movie</a> specifically because I felt the finale was so bleak, dark, and sad that I felt it was designed as a severe warning to anyone facing a difficult life or an uncomfortable decision. It left me unsettled and shaken. I admire Schoenbrun for the courage of their convictions, and for creating something so emotionally moving, and the more I think about the movie as a whole, the more I admire it. But certainly not for its sense of hope! You see it differently?  </p>
<p id="K1PPLq"><strong>Pete: </strong>I do! Like you, I have so much respect for this film. I loved the movie when I first saw it, and I’ve only grown to love and appreciate it more with every passing day. It’s rare to have a movie like this, where even people who have completely opposite readings of it than I do only make me appreciate the depth and complexity of what Schoenbrun has done here more. <em>I Saw the TV Glow</em> is a true, rare masterpiece, and a movie that fills me with a sense of fulfillment just thinking about it.</p>

<p id="pTpieC"><strong>Pete, the case for hope: </strong>Yes, I do see a glimmer of hope at the ending, but I understand why some audiences do not. As with the rest of the movie, I think Schoenbrun deftly leaves some things open for interpretation, while clearly signaling others. The movie is ripe for all sorts of allegorical interpretations, on top of the very present trans story on the surface. </p>
<p id="9b0UIC">For me, the ending suggests a breakthrough for Owen — but the kind of breakthrough that isn’t easy. Truly discovering yourself is a hard process, and one that comes with ups and downs, even through the beauty of finding a real truth. It can be an embarrassing experience to reinvent yourself — hence Owen’s constant apologies to anyone nearby — and I think the film beautifully showcases the complex, seemingly oxymoronic emotions that come with self-discovery. </p>
<p id="0h51fP"><strong>Tasha, the case against: </strong>I sure understand why people would want to see the end as a breakthrough for Owen, a step forward that’s going to lead him somewhere safer and happier. I recently recorded a podcast about the movie with <a href="https://episodes.ghost.io/">trans critic/author/screenwriter Emily St. James</a>, and she mentioned that over on AO3, people are already starting to write fanfic about Owen and Maddy’s future — a natural response to being left in such a dark place. </p>
<p id="SF0HE5">I just don’t see it on screen at all. The fact that he literally opens himself up to discover what’s inside him is a potent visual symbol — especially given his revelation earlier in the film that he feels like he’s empty, like someone hollowed him out. When Maddy tells him Mr. Melancholy literally cut out Isabel’s heart and put it in a refrigerator, that explains both his feeling of hollowness and what he sees when he cuts his chest open. (That act could also be debated as a metaphor for gender-confirming surgery.)</p>
<p id="xdqpCY">And then there’s the fact that seeing the TV glow inside himself is the first really overt supernatural thing he’s experienced, the first thing that might confirm Maddy’s story as something other than a delusion. (Depending on how he personally experienced that aborted moment where he stuffs his head into his own television and his creepy Fred Durst father drags him out.) </p>

<p id="4CoqfD">So the fact that he responds to all of that weighty coming-together of story and vision and explanation by closing himself up, going back to his job, and apologizing to everyone he sees is stunning to me. I don’t see it as suggesting he’s had a life-changing revelation, I see it as him suppressing his new knowledge, denying it, and trying to go back to normalcy. Did you see anything overt on the screen that keys you into a different future for him? Or is it more about a vibe and a hope? </p>
<p id="1VKNzh"><strong>Pete, the case for hope: </strong>To me, the fact that Owen is finally willing to look inside himself at all, in a way that is depicted so graphically and intimately, is a win on its own. That moment gives me hope for his future — that first, terrifying step is the most important one on the path to self-discovery. In some forms of self-discovery, it’s harder before it gets better.</p>
<p id="Kf1ZWN">And I think we know enough about the town and environment Owen is in to know that is true of this situation. It wouldn’t feel genuine to me for Owen to come out in celebration after this moment of self-discovery, and just have all the answers — it’s the spark that starts what’s going to be a difficult but fulfilling process.</p>
<p id="hiEyLS">As the sidewalk chalk puts it, when Schoenbrun’s camera pans over a piece of street graffiti after Maddy leaves: “There is still time.” There is still tragedy in the moment — as critic Willow Catelyn Maclay <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/film-review-i-tv-104674692">puts it in an excellent review of the film</a>, “there is still time, but only so much.” But I do believe that it is the first, important step on Owen’s path to being happy. There is still time for Owen, and for everyone. It isn’t too late to find yourself, no matter how far along in your journey you wait to truly look. </p>
<p id="O88lnH">Of course, I choose to believe that, but I think Schoenbrun’s comments about this support my reading of the ending. In an interview with Maclay, <a href="https://www.filmcomment.com/blog/interview-jane-schoenbrun-on-i-saw-the-tv-glow/">they said</a>, “I don’t necessarily think that in a portrait of transness we need to see the person that they were before the egg cracked, or the person that they were after the egg cracked, or the person that they want to be. I don’t think we need an entire lifetime’s worth of growth to understand somebody.”</p>
<p id="BSkC5q">Schoenbrun has described this moment at the end of the film for Owen as the moment of the egg cracking, and I think they want to leave what’s next intentionally open, because this film is precisely about that moment of self-discovery — not necessarily about what happens next. I can understand why that might feel unfulfilling to some people, or why it could be interpreted to mean Owen will remain in the closet. But I choose to see it as the start of Owen’s next chapter. </p>
<p id="rOOsG1"><strong>Tasha, the case against: </strong>That’s a compelling argument! I know Schoenbrun is drawing from their own journey of self-discovery here, so we can potentially look to where they ended up to suggest where Owen might end up. It’s good to know they don’t think of this as the absolute end for Owen, in spite of the long delay and the threat to Isabel.</p>
<p id="V8mzSU">I still don’t see anything in this movie that gives me hope for him personally, though, given how consistent he is about resisting. But… I want to! Maybe this is just a “glass half empty/glass half full” <a href="https://www.avclub.com/so-the-lady-or-the-tiger-28-stories-that-make-the-aud-1798230464">lady-or-the-tiger story situation</a>, where what you see in the ending says more about you and your bent toward cynicism or optimism than it says about what Schoenbrun actually puts on the screen. Maybe I just need to fight my own cynicism here. </p>
<p id="JtseWv">Looking at another quote from Schoenbrun, though, <a href="https://ew.com/i-saw-the-tv-glow-director-jane-schoenbrun-explains-ending-justice-smith-brigette-lundy-paine-8643442">talking to Entertainment Weekly about the ending</a>, I think it’s also clear that they wanted to leave the movie open to that cynical read, because of a sense that an optimistic read would feel unrealistic, and wouldn’t affect audiences the same way: </p>
<blockquote><p id="7bMVN1">I think it takes years, if not a lifetime, to undo that damage [of being constantly pushed to suppress a trans identity]. And to undo it in our case in 2024, in a world where, at best, cis people want to be PC and nice and use the right pronouns but don’t see me the way that I want them to, and, at worst, want me dead — it’s kind of psychotic, and for the movie to end in any way beyond this, like, fledgling, furtive, maybe a first step that’s still rife with trauma and all of the consequences of it, would have felt to me like I wasn’t doing my job as an artist.</p></blockquote>
<p id="NFJjGs">Speaking of what Schoenbrun achieves as an artist here, Emily wrote about the ending for Vulture, and I had the chance to preview that piece. It hasn’t been published yet (I’ll link it here when it goes up), but she has some insights I think are particularly enlightening about how the movie ends in such an ambiguous, unresolved way because that “gnawing sense of dissatisfaction,” the sense of melancholy and disconnection, is meant to leave cis people with “contact-high gender dysphoria.” I don’t know if that was part of Schoenbrun’s thinking at all, but the idea that the movie has to end in an ambiguous way to provoke a sense of recognition and understanding strikes me as powerful and daring.</p>

<p id="yHcYdt"><strong>Pete, the case for hope: </strong>I deeply appreciate how ambiguous <em>TV Glow</em> is, how open it is for all sorts of interpretations, and that Schoenbrun does not give in to easy answers. That’s one of the things I find most fascinating in this movie, that our colleague Austen Goslin put very well when I was discussing the movie with him: Many examples of cinema in the trans canon are movies that are not textually trans, but can be read subtextually as trans. This is a movie that is textually trans, but can be read subtextually in all sorts of other different directions.</p>
<p id="pekbYO">It makes the movie much more discussable, for sure, but it’s also a breath of fresh air in an environment that seems to require an unreasonable amount of clarity from challenging art.  Even the quotes you dropped in above — I read them in support of my take on the ending, you read them in support of yours. Cinema! Gotta love it.</p>
<p id="0s5v7r">My interpretation of the ending comes down to this: Not all forms of self-discovery and change are created equal. Sometimes, it becomes harder before it gets better.</p>
<p id="1D55qy">Such a massive moment of self-discovery shakes people to their very core. Yes, you may find some semblance of truth hiding within yourself, but that’s also a revelation that you’ve been living your life as a lie — lying to yourself, and to everyone else around you. In this light, Owen’s actions after that moment of discovery make complete sense to me. Owen’s life isn’t over just because the movie is over, and the end gives the opportunity for a choice. A choice where Owen no longer lives as a shell of a person, no matter how hard it remains to get there.</p>
<p id="aLA59r">As Schoenbrun said <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/jane-schoenbrun/id1330522019?i=1000655384730">on an excellent episode of Tuck Woodstuck’s <em>Gender Reveal</em> podcast</a>: “What comes first are the negative consequences, not the positive ones.”</p>
<p id="2u6lKu"><strong>Tasha, the case against: </strong>Amazing. Well, amid all the other things this movie is about, it’s about working on yourself, and finding a path to a more satisfactory, centered life. I’m going to take that note, and go work on my cynicism problem. </p>

For the city-builder genre, the game introduced a comprehensive framework for urban planning, allowing players to tackle complex issues like zoning, road placement, taxation, public services, and overall city management, including budget, health, employment, traffic, and pollution. These elements were combined with a sandbox mode to provide complete creative freedom for players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Built on the experience gained from their earlier </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities in Motion</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> series, which focused on transportation systems, Colossal Order developed a game engine that could simulate the daily routines of nearly a million unique citizens. This capacity not only deepened the gameplay experience but also helped players intuitively address urban challenges such as traffic congestion. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities: Skylines</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> stood out for its depth and open-ended gameplay, sharply contrasting with the 2013 SimCity's restrictive elements like always-online gameplay and limited city sizes. The ability to modify the game via the Steam Workshop extended its longevity and fostered a dedicated player community.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cities: Skylines, while a commercial triumph, initially faced opportunities for enhancement. Early iterations of the game drew feedback for their absence of dynamic elements like natural disasters and random events. Colossal Order positively responded to this input, enriching the game with expansions that incorporated these vibrant features. Furthermore, the game's intricate mechanics, initially challenging for new players, were progressively refined through updates designed to boost accessibility and enrich the user experience, demonstrating the developer's commitment to continual improvement and player satisfaction.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One element Colossal Order sought to improve was the repetitive nature of the non-player characters (NPCs); the original game featured only about 50 different NPC models.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Elevating ">Elevating <span>Cities: Skylines II</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the sequel, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities: Skylines II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Colossal Order aimed to surpass their previous. The development team was set on creating a city teeming with unique individuals, reflecting the dynamic variety of real urban populations. This ambition was rooted in the game's new capabilities and enhancements, particularly in character modeling and animation, which were facilitated by advanced technologies like Popul8 from Didimo.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Design Goals and New Directions">Design Goals and New Directions</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The goal for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities: Skylines II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was clear: enhance every aspect of the game. With improvements like the new Photo Mode, which allows players to zoom in closely on urban scenes, NPCs needed to withstand scrutiny up close—demanding a higher level of detail and realism. This led to a push for significantly more variation among the characters to foster a more inclusive and realistic gaming world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To enhance the realism and diversity of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities: Skylines II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Colossal Order meticulously crafted an extensive wardrobe to dress the game's myriad characters, ensuring that each NPC could represent a wide range of professions and lifestyles—from firefighters and police officers to office workers and motorcyclists. This attention to detail extended to seasonal clothing variations, providing warmth in winter and comfort during summer months. However, the true value of these garments would only be realized through the diverse characters designed to wear them. It was imperative that these clothes not only varied aesthetically but also functioned on characters of all shapes, sizes, and backgrounds, making the city's population as vibrant and diverse as its urban landscape.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Character Creation with Popul8">Character Creation with Popul8</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Popul8 played a pivotal role in achieving the desired diversity in NPCs. The tool enabled Colossal Order’s developers to quickly generate a wide array of character models that could seamlessly integrate into the game’s environment. With Popul8, Colossal Order could easily&nbsp; create varied groups of citizens—each tailored for different seasons, age brackets, and occupations, reflecting a broad spectrum of humanity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Furthermore, Popul8's asset-fitting capabilities played a crucial role in Colossal Order's ability to rapidly produce a diverse cast of characters. The tool's mathematical approach allowed for precise garment fitting to new body shapes with about 95% accuracy, greatly accelerating the character creation process. This efficiency enabled the developers to focus more on the creative aspects of character grouping, significantly enhancing productivity and diversity in character design. With the bulk of the manual labor taken care of, the Colossal Order team were free to create more variety in characters, check and test important details or continue working on optimizing gameplay ahead of the highly anticipated release.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Technical and Artistic Process">The Technical and Artistic Process</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The creation of NPCs was both a technical and artistic endeavor. Colossal Order was able to use a detailed base mesh that represented their unique art style straight from Popul8. This was then used to generate diverse characters. The tool provided sliders for different physical characteristics and ethnicities, ensuring a wide representation of people. The process also included designing seasonal clothing options in Popul8, allowing characters to change outfits according to the weather, adding another layer of realism.</span></p><p>Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Behind the Scenes: From Concept to Game Integration">Behind the Scenes: From Concept to Game Integration</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The integration of these characters into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities: Skylines II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> brought the virtual city to life. Early placeholder characters were replaced with detailed models that interacted with the environment—jogging in parks, taking selfies, and attending street events. This transformation was crucial in making the city feel alive and diverse.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The technical integration also involved ensuring that animations were adaptable to various character forms without glitches. This was particularly challenging for models that deviated significantly from the average build or height, such as children or characters with more unique body types.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the most significant technical challenges faced by Colossal Order was the task of rendering a large number of characters within a single scene without overwhelming the player's GPU. Traditionally, rendering a single character consumes up to 50MB of memory, which quickly becomes impractical when scaling up to thousands of characters. To overcome this, the team implemented a memory-optimized format that drastically reduced the memory footprint of each character. This approach enabled the use of batch rendering techniques, where multiple characters are processed in a single draw call. By adopting this method, the game was able to efficiently render scenes with up to 10,000 characters, creating a bustling, lively urban environment without compromising performance or visual fidelity.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Reflecting Real-World Diversity">Reflecting Real-World Diversity</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the key successes of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities: Skylines II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is its reflection of real-world diversity. Characters in the game exhibit a range of ages, body types, and ethnic backgrounds, contributing to a city that feels vibrant and authentic. Each NPC's clothing and behavior respond dynamically to the game’s environmental conditions, further enhancing the realism.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Future Directions and Community Engagement">Future Directions and Community Engagement</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moving forward, Colossal Order plans to continue expanding the diversity and realism of the character models. This includes introducing more varied animations, accessories, and options for characters with disabilities to broaden the game’s inclusivity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The development team is also working with the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities: Skylines II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> player community, inviting feedback and suggestions on what types of characters they want to see in the game. This collaborative approach’s purpose is to both help enhance the game's development while also ensuring that it remains a living project, continually evolving to meet the desires and expectations of players.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The journey from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities: Skylines</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities: Skylines II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> showcases a significant evolution in how NPCs are created and integrated into a massive, dynamic world. By leveraging advanced tools like Popul8 and embracing a philosophy of diversity and realism, Colossal Order has created a model for how city-building games can be a world that more realistically mirrors the complexity and diversity of our own.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As a co-founder of Thirdverse, overseeing our studios in both Japan and the US, and a games industry veteran with over a decade of experience in the VR market, I have witnessed firsthand the evolution and steady adoption of VR technologies. Our Japan Studio’s latest VR game aimed not only to captivate but also to broaden the market by engaging more casual gamers in VR. Here, we share the development insights and lessons learned from the journey of SOUL COVENANT, highlighting both successes and challenges.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Celebrating the Wins: Enthusiastic Reception of SOUL COVENANT on PlayStation VR2 in Asia Markets">Celebrating the Wins: Enthusiastic Reception of SOUL COVENANT on PlayStation VR2 in Asia Markets</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the initial launch, SOUL COVENANT major success in some key markets – reaching #1 in sales on PlayStation VR2 in Japan, where it has strongly resonated with audiences, notably in Japan and other parts of Asia. This enthusiastic reception underscores the alignment of our game with the preferences of these VR players who appreciate immersive narrative experiences. The development team's deep love for JRPG mechanics and storytelling shines through in every element of the game, making it a hit among traditional and casual VR players alike.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Development Insights">Development Insights</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition to our successes, we’ve also experienced some major opportunities to adopt and learn for our future projects. Let’s dive in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Technical Challenges and Solutions</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the major challenges we faced during the development of SOUL COVENANT was managing the performance demands of VR, particularly given the high number of creatures and enemies in the game. VR hardware, especially on standalone headsets like Meta Quest, has limitations that required us to optimize the game's performance continuously. We focused on maintaining a high graphical quality while ensuring the game ran smoothly, which was particularly challenging with the fast-paced, action-heavy gameplay (inspired by titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dynasty Warriors</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">)</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another technical hurdle was minimizing motion sickness, a common issue for Japan players in VR. To address this, we designed intuitive controls and simplified mechanics, ensuring that players could enjoy extended play sessions without discomfort. This approach, while beneficial for reducing motion sickness, also meant we had to forgo some complex physics-based interactions that might have appealed to more VR enthusiasts in other markets.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Design Challenges and User Feedback</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cultural differences played a significant role in the reception of SOUL COVENANT. While the game was well-received in Asia, and particularly in Japan, hitting #1 in sales on PlayStation VR2, we noticed varying levels of enthusiasm in other regions. Japanese players, who often play VR games while seated, appreciated the game's design. However, Western players, who tend to prefer standing and more physically engaging VR experiences, found the gameplay less immersive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We realized that our development team, being based in Japan, had naturally designed the game with Japanese players in mind. This led to some design choices that did not resonate as well with Western audiences. For instance, we avoided aggressive physics interactions and focused more on narrative and storytelling elements, which aligned with the preferences of Japanese gamers but not necessarily those of Western players.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Key Lessons Learned">Key Lessons Learned</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Understanding Your Audience</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the most critical lessons we learned is the importance of understanding and designing for your target audience - whether it’s local or global, core or casual, and so on. While it is natural to cater to familiar cultural preferences, expanding our focus to include a broader range of player experiences was essential for us. In future projects, we plan to conduct more extensive market research and beta testing across different regions to better tailor our games to diverse player bases when the focus is reaching and engaging more global audiences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Flexibility in Game Design</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also learned the value of flexibility in game design. Implementing different modes, such as a more physically demanding "hard mode" and a less intense "beginner mode," could cater to both hardcore and casual gamers across markets where preferences really vary. This approach would allow us to maintain the core elements that make our game unique while adapting to various player gameplay nuances.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Technological Innovation</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Investing in proprietary technology and optimizing existing tools were crucial to overcoming technical challenges. Our experience with SOUL COVENANT has reinforced the importance of staying at the forefront of VR technology, continuously seeking innovative solutions to enhance performance and player experience.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Looking Ahead">Looking Ahead</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The development and launch of SOUL COVENANT have been both challenging and rewarding. Our success on PlayStation VR2 in Japan and Asian demonstrates the potential of VR to offer novel and engaging gaming experiences. However, the varying reception across different regions highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of global audiences for VR.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As we move forward, we are committed to learning from these experiences and applying these lessons to future projects. By embracing a broader range of player preferences and continuing to innovate in VR technology, we believe that VR gaming can transcend traditional boundaries and invite players from all walks of life into immersive, compelling worlds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With our continued dedication to innovation and quality, Thirdverse is poised to keep pushing the limits of what VR can achieve. We invite gamers to join us on this exciting journey as we strive to develop experiences that not only entertain but also inspire and connect with people across the globe.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony%E2%80%99s-neil-druckmann-interview-shows-why-we-need-journalists.883977/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sony-druckmann-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In last Friday’s Aftermath newsletter, I wrote about an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240528084149/https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> <em>Last of Us</em> creator Neil Druckmann gave to a Sony blog. He said a lot of dumb shit about AI and mainstream perceptions of video games that people across the internet swiftly dunked on. Except it turns out he didn’t exactly say those things, prompting Sony to now remove the interview.</p><p>That Friday night, Druckmann took to <a href="https://x.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187395279253837" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> to clarify his closing remarks in the interview, in which he was quoted as saying that his upcoming game “could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming” and saying that HBO’s <em>The Last of Us</em> show has “spotlighted gaming” and is helping “bridge the gap between gamers and non-gamers.” On Twitter, Druckmann wrote, “In editing my rambling answers in my recent interview with SONY, some of my words, context, and intent were unfortunately lost.” He then includes a very long, very different answer than what ended up in the final interview, which most notably doesn’t include the “redefine mainstream perceptions” line.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In editing my rambling answers in my recent interview with SONY, some of my words, context, and intent were unfortunately lost. Well, here's the full long rambling answer for the final question about our future game... <a href="https://t.co/tVuxX3LYJF">pic.twitter.com/tVuxX3LYJF</a></p>— Neil Druckmann (@Neil_Druckmann) <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187395279253837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Game File’s <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1794205221448765443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Totilo</a> posted a good highlight of the stark and copious differences, in which he pointed out that the final interview doesn’t include a line Druckmann actually said, which is “Not because games need to be movies, or they need to be TV shows, but I think it just kind of opens the eyes of a bunch of people that just weren’t aware of the kinds of experiences that exist in games.”</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>If you're curious (about what he said; and how I spend a Friday night when my wife and kids are away), here's a comparison of the original answer and the edited one. </p><p>Many changes</p><p>No surprise, this was cut: "Not because games need to be movies, or they need to be TV shows" <a href="https://t.co/FkxNkqQPY2">pic.twitter.com/FkxNkqQPY2</a></p></div>— Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) <a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1794205221448765443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Some time <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1795802233952510235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">today</a>, based on results from the Wayback Machine, Sony removed the interview, replacing it with text explaining,</p><blockquote><p>In re-reviewing our recent interview with Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann, we have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don't represent his perspective and values (including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects). We apologize to Neil for misrepresenting his words and for any negative impact this interview might have caused him and his team. In coordination with Naughty Dog and SIE, we have removed the interview.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>This raises a couple questions. One is that, while Druckmann clarified his final statement in the interview, he didn’t say anything about other parts of it, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-ai-new-game-1851496423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the unpopular stuff he said about AI</a>, which Sony now seems to be disavowing as well. It’s naive to think that the final question was the only thing misrepresented on the page, but it raises suspicion about the accuracy of the entire interview. What, exactly, did Druckmann even say?</p><p>The second question is, how did this happen? That question is easier to answer: this isn’t an interview with a journalist. It <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sony-unveils-vision-for-growth-and-creative-synergy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appears </a>to be part of a corporate strategy push that includes <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other interviews</a>, and not meant for a broader audience. It feels like whoever put this together–there’s no name attached to the “question” part of the Q&amp;A–had the instinct to edit things into investor-friendly language. In that light, cutting the line “Not because games need to be movies, or they need to be TV shows” makes a certain cursed sense; in this age of IP, Sony probably very much wants games to be movies and TV shows! But even with that context, it’s still misrepresenting what Druckmann said, using his words to launder a corporation’s desired message.</p><p>A journalist writing for an independent publication wouldn’t do this. While a journalist will often summarize a quote in a piece that includes their own words alongside a source’s, that’s not done in question and answer formats like Druckmann’s Sony interview, in which a reader would reasonably assume the subject’s answers to questions are their actual answers. In Q&amp;As, a journalist will sometimes edit a quote a bit for clarity or space, but that’s always indicated with ellipses, brackets, or other punctuation. To use a few words to reinvent a quote would get a journalist in a lot of trouble, if not outright fired. (It’s unclear what’s happened to whoever conducted this interview, but given the backlash, I can’t imagine it’s something good.)</p><p>But again, this isn’t journalism; this is corporate messaging dressed up to look a little bit like journalism. And while a badly-written interview would have just been an internal crisis for people who work at Sony if it hadn’t broken orbit to a mainstream audience, we’ve been seeing this kind of thing get mistaken for games journalism for years now. We’ve all sat through press conferences that look like interviews when they’re in fact PR exercises, where interviewers ask questions they obviously know the answers to because everyone on stage works together. <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a> run their own blogs, as well as major publishers and storefronts like <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic</a>, where alongside the game updates and sale announcements that are clearly their purview you’ll also find <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/7GuRzEQEr7vbP8K6Y6RLl2/rainbow-six-siege-operation-new-blood-operator-remaster-and-balancing-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guides</a>, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/22/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-our-full-four-part-feature-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features</a>, and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/seven-features-that-make-men-of-war-2-the-most-detailed-strategy-game-you-ll-play-this-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quasi-reviews</a> that you might expect to see on a mainstream games site.&nbsp;</p><p>None of these things are journalism, and personally I don’t think they’re intentionally attempting to mislead an audience into thinking they are. If anything, a reader might mistake them for journalism because actual games sites are coming to resemble PR more and more each day, as games journalism’s complicated relationship with access combines with ownership’s obsession with <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">traffic</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-gamurs-group-games-journalism-escapist-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEO</a> until practically everything looks like marketing. This erosion of actual journalism exists alongside publisher <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-price-of-games-journalism-1743526293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blacklists</a>, late or <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-suicide-squad-situation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">withheld</a> review codes, prioritizing streamers and influencers over journalists, <a href="https://aftermath.site/rolling-stone-glixel-savvy-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sketchy funding</a> for games sites, and <a href="https://aftermath.site/ken-levine-judas-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">softball interviews</a>, among other ills. Combined with rampant distrust of and contempt for the media, and the unique manifestation of that in games, the Druckmann interview feels a lot more dire than just a major fuckup on a corporate blog.&nbsp;</p><p>As journalism outlets close left and right, and as more journalists <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-game-development-ign-kotaku" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">switch careers into PR</a> and leave those newcomers who can even find jobs without mentors and training, we’re likely to have more and more information filtered through corporate mouthpieces with their own standards and priorities, and who don't do what they do out of a desire to tell the public true things. Journalism might have weird, confusing rules and customs and its own <a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/a-test-of-the-news-wesley-lowery-objectivity.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outdated, problematic</a> values, but the truth remains its highest priority; you have to accurately report what a person did or said, because you believe it's important that the public knows those things. Without an <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">independent press</a>, stuff like this interview might be all we'll have left.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Sony has announced its next State of Play showcase.
</p>
<p>
After being rumoured and speculated about for some time, the Playstation maker has finally confirmed that yes, we will be getting a showcase event in May.
</p>
<p>
It all kicks off tomorrow, 30th May, at 11pm UK time. That's 3pm PT / 6pm ET for those across the pond.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Let's Play God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla - Roguelike rampage!" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_AliuDYge_s?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<figcaption>Let's Play God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla - Roguelike rampage!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AliuDYge_s" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
The show is set to last for "30+" minutes, and will cover PS5 and PS VR2 titles. It will also provide us with a look at some upcoming PlayStation Studios games, which are arriving later this year. In total, 14 titles will be shown.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, we will hear more about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-is-the-next-sony-game-coming-to-pc-leaker-suggests">God of War: Ragnarök's reported PC release</a> here? Or, more on Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, which was first announced at a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-sonys-playstation-showcase">PlayStation showcase around this time last year</a>.
</p>
<p>I suppose, we will have to wait and see. Stay tuned for more!</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/237561b8c80c66ef2363048d582c60b4656d00c7.webp?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>
If you fancy making an evening/early morning combo of video game broadcasts, remember Konami also has its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-announcement-stream-scheduled-for-this-week">Silent Hill Transmission show set for tomorrow</a> as well. This particular show will air after State of Play, at midnight (again, that is UK timing). </p>
<p>
Both essentially act as a kick off into this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">not-E3/Summer Games Fest/IGN Live week</a>, with showcases from Ubisoft and Xbox to follow.</p>

            <p>Many moons ago, premiere wordsman Nate Crowley <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/maneater-review">reviewed</a> shark ‘em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/maneater">Maneater</a>, decrying its incurious perpetuation of anti-shark propaganda, and calling it “an ecstatically violent simulation of being a fool's idea of a shark.” My own frothing penchant for the plan-schemes of Warhammer’s Skaven ratboys has been documented in these pages to the point of rabidity, but I do feel broadly similarly about media that sullies rats - clean, smart and good folk that they are. Lively tactics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trash-of-the-titans">Trash Of The Titans</a> does not aim to emancipate its villainous vermin. But, like Warhammer, it gets a pass for its evident affection towards its antagonistic dumpster diving scuttlers. Also, it's just plain fun.</p>

<p>Solo-willed-into-existence by developer Alex 'Thayer And Back Again', Trash Of The Titans’ grid-based, elevation-respecting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> most immediately evokes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>. You play as a party of assorted trash mammals trying to protect your rotting hauls from a gang of criminal vermin known as The Rat Crue. Misspelling ‘crew’ is, of course, the telltale signature of only the most badbutt crews. It’s vaguely roguelike in structure, with one stage leading to the next as you nab upgrades based on how much trash you managed to protect. The game’s setting is left vague, although it is clearly set somewhere with a bizarre culture of nibbling at whole chickens before discarding them, since that's most of the trash.</p>

<p>Turn order is set before each round, and each trash mammal has their own specialisation. Badger is a tank, able to clear gaps by charging, with a bonus buff to attack damage based on how much health they’re missing. Racoon is a sneak thief, able to turn invisible and backstab. They can actually cloak, stab, then re-cloak in a single round, although this eats through MP, which regens slowly throughout. Happily, they also provide some bonus regen for squad cohesion. Possum is an archer, able to take advantage of the aforementioned elevation, and Skunk is a fart-shaman, with poison gas attacks used for board control.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there’s some lovely QOL features, like previews for specific attack damage. Also, move and attack points are spent separately, so you can mix and match for dastardly plays. There’s plenty of additional non-trash additions, like boons you can collect for extra abilities, and bonus buffs and upgrades at the end of each mission depending on how much trash you save. It’s neat! I said “this looks neat” when I saw it, and then I played it, and it’s neat! If only life in general could unfold so smoothly! Trash Of The Titans, you are forgiven for your rat slander. It’s out today, and there’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2450400/Trash_of_the_Titans/">demo available</a> at time of writing.</p>

			<p>The former NPD Group (now named “Circana”) has released its <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1795803675530522972" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full North American sales data for April</a>, and it was a bit of a down month for the industry. Players spent $4.1 billion on games, additional content, and hardware in April, down 3 percent year-on-year. While software spending was up slightly, hardware numbers were down a whopping 43 percent year-on-year. As has been the case for a several month straight, PS5 was #1 in terms of unit and dollar sales, Switch was #2 in terms of unit sales, and Xbox Series X/S was #2 in terms of dollar sales.</p>
<p>Sony had a lot to be happy about on the software front, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/stellar-blade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stellar Blade</a> debuted at #1 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helldivers 2</a> held steady at #2 in its third month on the market. A number of previously-Xbox-exclusive games that launched on PlayStation in April also hopped up the charts – <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/sea-of-thieves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sea of Thieves</a> went from #55 in March to #4 in April and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/grounded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grounded</a> went from #167 to #12. Meanwhile, the effect of the Fallout TV series was also felt, boosting Fallout 4 to #5 and Fallout 76 up to #8.</p>
<p>Here are April’s top 20 premium games according to Circana:</p>
<p><em>1 - Stellar Blade</em></p>
<p><em>2 - Helldivers 2</em></p>
<p><em>3 - Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</em></p>
<p><em>4 - Sea of Thieves</em></p>
<p><em>5 - Fallout 4</em></p>
<p><em>6 - MLB The Show 24</em></p>
<p><em>7 - Dragon's Dogma 2</em></p>
<p><em>8 - Fallout 76</em></p>
<p><em>9 - Hogwarts Legacy</em></p>
<p><em>10 - EA Sports FC 24</em></p>
<p><em>11 - Rise of the Ronin</em></p>
<p><em>12 - Grounded</em></p>
<p><em>13 - Minecraft</em></p>
<p><em>14 - Madden NFL 24</em></p>
<p><em>15 - Princess Peach: Showtime!</em></p>
<p><em>16 - Rainbow Six Siege</em></p>
<p><em>17 - Tekken 8</em></p>
<p><em>18 - Mario Kart 8</em></p>
<p><em>19 - Elden Ring</em></p>
<p><em>20 - Spider-Man 2</em></p>
<p>And here are the top games of 2024 to date:</p>
<p><em>1 - Helldivers 2</em></p>
<p><em>2 - Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</em></p>
<p><em>3 - Dragon's Dogma 2</em></p>
<p><em>4 - MLB The Show 24</em></p>
<p><em>5 - Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></p>
<p><em>6 - Tekken 8</em></p>
<p><em>7 - Madden NFL 24</em></p>
<p><em>8 - Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em></p>
<p><em>9 - Hogwarts Legacy</em></p>
<p><em>10 - Persona 3 Reload</em></p>

		<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/644930/They_Are_Billions/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>They Are Billions</em></a><em> </em>is a steampunk zombie survival RTS, which is probably not the most enticing collection of words and might tell you a lot about the particular moment it emerged from. On the other hand, it’s a game made of everyone’s favorite RTS mission archetype: the hold-out mission. Carentan in <em>Company of Heroes</em>, the mountaintop defense at the culmination of <em>Warcraft III</em>, any number of missions in the Terran campaigns of <em>StarCraft</em>… the list of all-time classic missions goes on.&nbsp;<em>Homeworld 3 </em>recently made a couple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F368tbT9QQ&amp;ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">worthy additions</a> to the list as well.</p><p>Structurally they tend to solve the biggest problem with RTS games, which is that they are so fast-paced and ask so much of the player that it’s rare they give you a chance to sit back and watch the fireworks. They were so popular you could argue they spawned the tower defense genre, which goes back to <em>StarCraft </em>and really took off with special game modes for <em>Warcraft III. They Are Billions </em>just winds the clock back to the <em>Age of Empires II </em>era with an RTS where the entire game is about surviving huge onslaughts of enemies that will gratifyingly march headlong into your defenses.</p><p>It’s also a game designed to be very dangerous to me personally. It’s conceptually straightforward, but lends itself, via its No Reloads survival mode, to repeated runs. I constantly work to beat the odds and get a high score, but I can pour hours into a run only to have it completely undone due to an obvious-in-retrospect error. As the zombies overrun my sprawling colony and the its little clockwork defenses crack and then crumble, I’m primed to move on to the next run immediately.</p><p>The problem is that I’m never sure I want to. This past winter, when I finally had a week to myself and was still reeling from grueling months of medical emergencies involving my dog Mina, I had a stack of great games I’d wanted to dig into before the end of the year. The trouble was, while I had a lot of good games to play, I felt like they were all too good to be wasted on the tatters of mental energy and slivers of free time that I had available. Restless scrolling through my Steam library brought <em>They Are Billions </em>back to my attention. Five minutes later, I was launching into my first game. “I’ll just mess around in there until I figure out what I really want to play,” I told myself.</p><p>For months, I found myself playing it whenever I had a few loose minutes. It went from feeling like a welcome return to an old favorite to something closer to a fixation. I'd quit the game and consider watching or playing something else, but the only thing I could think about is how much better I think I’d do on the next run.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo via </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/NumantianGames?snr=1_5_9__2000&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><span>Numantian Games</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>I don’t know if it was always like this for me. However, when I think back to my love affairs with <em>Europa Universalis III</em>, <em>Medieval: Total War</em>, or <em>Civilization II, </em>they had a lot of the same characteristics. I internalized these games so much that I could almost play them on mental autopilot, racing through rehearsed steps toward the trickier parts I was dying to master. </p><p>Now, all those franchises have gotten just complicated enough that I find they require more mental investment, which both saves me from this compulsive loop but also creates the kind of friction that makes it almost too easy for me to bounce off a game entirely. There are a lot of days I don’t want to think <em>quite</em> that<em> </em>hard, so I’ll save a strategy game or a tricky RPG “for later when I have more time and I’m in a better place.” (It looks like, far from being the only one, I am part of <a href="https://quanticfoundry.com/2024/05/21/strategy-decline/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">a measurable trend</a>.) Meanwhile, games like <em>They Are Billions </em>keep slipping under my guard. Hours that I didn’t think I had available to spend will go flying by, and I’ll find myself wondering, “What was the point of doing all that again and again?”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24166978/tom-bombadil-rings-of-power-season-2-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="wskIZk"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23414847/rings-power-season-1-review"><em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em></a> is doing what no Lord of the Rings adaptation has done before: putting <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/2021/1/20/22239302/who-is-tom-bombadil-poem-hobbit-lotr-books-movies">Tom Bombadil</a> in the thing. </p>
<p id="YoY6IL">Rory Kinnear (<em>Black Mirror</em>) will play the puissant and pacifistic character in season 2 of the Prime Video series, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/tom-bombadil-the-rings-of-power-first-look">Vanity Fair</a> revealed on Wednesday. With a few months ahead of its Aug. 29 premiere date, showrunners <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23329258/lord-rings-power-review-episode-release">J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay</a> were ready to explain how and why they brought the oft-overlooked Tolkien character to the screen. </p>
<p id="g3vcec">To fans of J.R.R. Tolkien’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings"><em>The Lord of the Rings</em></a>, Tom Bombadil is divisive out of proportion to his prominence. The linchpin of a three-chapter digression early in the pages of <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, Tom rescues Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin from an intelligent and malicious tree known as Old Man Willow and takes them back to his house to meet his wife. But also, he’s apparently so powerful that the One Ring has no effect on him. </p>

<p id="gCZBjF">Tom is neither hobbit nor human, nor dwarven, nor elven. He says that he’s older than the existence of rivers, and trees, and paths. Though he has Gandalf’s deep respect, he’s not a wizard, and aside from saving the hobbits’ lives a couple times, he has no interest in weighing in on the Ring Quest. But also he’s cheerful, has a big bushy beard, wears a funny hat, and he constantly spouts almost nonsensical rhyming couplets.</p>
<p id="Y7VxpS">It’s that mystery and dichotomy that made Payne and McKay interested in bringing him into <em>The Rings of Power</em>, despite his canonical appearances being limited to those few chapters in <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>. </p>
<p id="Fxj54b">“Tom Bombadil is singing and saying lines that could be nursery rhymes from children’s poems,” Payne told Vanity Fair. “So he sort of defies the tonal shift of the rest of the season and is a real point of light amidst an otherwise sea of darkness.” </p>
<p id="soFybX">Payne and McKay’s Bombadil is concerned with the fate of natural life on Middle-earth: “In our story, he has gone out to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23365209/lord-rings-power-white-robe-character-sauron-dweller-nomad-ascetic">the lands of Rhûn</a>,” said Payne, “which we learn used to be sort of Edenic and green and beautiful, but now is sort of a dead wasteland.” This isn’t a big stretch for a figure who soothes angry trees and married the daughter of a river, but in <em>Rings of Power</em>, he’ll drop some cryptically-put advice to Stranger, who <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23403120/rings-power-who-is-stranger-wizard-actor-daniel-weyman">may or may not be an amnesiac Gandalf</a>, instead of a group of hobbits.</p>
<p id="TOb3ST">“He nudges the Stranger along his journey, which he knows will eventually protect the larger natural world that he cares about. So I’d say our Tom Bombadil is slightly more interventionist than you see in the books, but only by 5% or 10%,” Payne said.</p>
<p id="Pfko8u">For decades, casual readers have puzzled over Tom’s place in the Lord of the Rings, but the truth is that the character is something of a relic of the origin of Tolkien’s high fantasy trilogy as a simple sequel to his episodic adventure for children, <em>The Hobbit</em>. Tolkien wrote Tom, a figure <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/2021/1/20/22239302/who-is-tom-bombadil-poem-hobbit-lotr-books-movies">originally invented to entertain his children</a>, into the story before he had even conceived of Aragorn’s kingly destiny, or that Sauron was the ultimate antagonist, or that Frodo’s name shouldn’t be “Bingo Baggins.”</p>
<p id="a6KXaR">So why did Tom stay in, through all processes of revision? </p>

<p id="YVaWeh">“Tom Bombadil is not an important person — to the narrative,” Tolkien once wrote to his proofreader for <em>The Lord of the Rings.</em> “I suppose he has some importance as a ‘comment.’ I mean, I do not really write like that... He represents something that I feel important, though I would not be prepared to analyze the feeling precisely.”</p>
<p id="ESuFGH">Tolkien was an academic specializing in Old English and Scandinavian languages, one who held a lifelong fascination for the folklore, mythology, legends, and epic poetry of those regions. His fiction is a constant mix and remix of stories he invented for his children, fairy tales, Norse myth, Arthuriana, epic poetry like <em>Beowulf</em>, and other references, allusions, and motifs familiar pretty much only to other academics in his field. </p>
<p id="A3VK4S">Tom Bombadil began as a cameo for his children, but he stayed in the story because he made it feel more like Tolkien’s favorite <em>kind</em> of stories. Tolkien just liked what Tom Bombadil contributed to the vibe — and so does <em>The Rings of Power</em>, apparently. </p>

<p>A new trademark has been filed by FireFly Studios named Stronghold: The Dark Ages, which could suggest it will be the next name for the series’ next installment.</p>



<p>The trademark was first spotted by <a href="https://respawnfirst.com/a-new-installment-in-the-stronghold-series-possibly-trademarked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Respawn First</a>, which was filed on April 8th, 2024, and is currently in the ‘”examination” stage. </p>



<p>If you thought ‘The Dark Ages’ sounded familiar, well, you’re right, as last week Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusively reported that the next Doom game</a> would be called ‘Doom: The Dark Ages.’ Our reporting (and the impending reveal of the next Doom game) suggests that the title is likely to be rejected.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the filing does tell us that the next Stronghold game is almost certainly to be set in the ‘Dark Ages’, which began after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.</p>



<p>The next Stronghold game would mark FireFly Studios’ first major new release following the studios’ acquisition by Devolver Digital in 2021. Currently, FireFly Studios is focused on post-launch content of Stronghold: Definitive Edition, which was released in November 2023 and has received ‘Very Positive’ reviews on Steam based on 6400 reviews at the time of writing.</p>



<p>What do you think of a new Stronghold title? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion played a massive role in my childhood. It was one of my first true open-world RPG experiences, and I lost myself for the longest time. I explored every inch of Cyrodiil, favoring Anvil. Despite my undying love for the RPG, I can admit that it’s showing its age. We could use more information about the Oblivion Remaster release date, so here’s what we know currently!</p>



<h2 id="h-is-oblivion-getting-a-remaster">Is Oblivion Getting a Remaster?</h2>



<p>Thanks to the FTC leaks, specifically the ZeniMax Management Forecast, we know that Bethesda was working on an Oblivion Remaster at one point. The open-world RPG project was said to launch sometime in Fiscal Year 22, meaning sometime between July 2021 and June 2022, but that didn’t happen. Most projects received significant delays following the pandemic and a tumultuous games industry.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Phil Spencer said you can’t always trust these leaks, as projects constantly shift and change in game development. He’s likely trying to cast a shadow of doubt over the entire leak, but that doesn’t mean it’s not happening sometime this year or next!</p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-fallout-3-remaster-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Do We Know the Fallout 3 Remaster Release Date?</a></p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-oblivion-remaster-release-date">When is the Oblivion Remaster Release Date?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, we don’t yet have an official Oblivion Remaster release date. There is very little information surrounding the project, including whether it’s still happening. Unlike with the Fallout franchise, there’s less of a wait time from this point until the launch of The Elder Scrolls VI, though we still don’t have an official release date for that title either.</p>



<p>That said, remaster The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion would make a lot of sense. It was a fan-favorite RPG, and it would help bridge the gap between The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and The Elder Scrolls VI.</p>

"In editing my rambling answers in my recent interview with Sony, some of my words, context, and intent were unfortunately lost,” Druckmann added, before posting the “full long rambling answer for the final question about our future game".</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/29/gettyimages-1928390322-1716992512182.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Photo by FREDERIC J.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-reveals-homelander-gameplay-fatalities-and-a-first-look-at-ferra<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Warner Bros. Games has revealed gameplay for Homelander, the next DLC character for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>.</p><p>Homelander, who is based on the supervillain from Prime Video’s mega hit show <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-boys">The Boys</a>, appears as a guest DLC character in NetherRealm’s gory fighting game, and based on the gameplay trailer below, the ‘evil Superman’ is a good fit.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Homelander joins the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MortalKombat1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MortalKombat1</a> roster on June 4, Ferra Kameo joins later in June. Check out their game-play here!<a href="https://t.co/QIjuLCEPWe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/QIjuLCEPWe</a></p>— Ed Boon (@noobde) <a href="https://twitter.com/noobde/status/1795805484336734606?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Here's the official blurb on Homelander:</p><blockquote>Homelander is the most powerful being on the planet and the leader of The Seven, the elite superhero team owned and managed by Vought International. In a world where “Supes” are made, he’s the strongest of them all. Homelander presents himself as the ultimate patriot and protector, but don’t let his movie star good looks or high approval rating fool you. He is a murderous, narcissistic sociopath with an insatiable need for validation, love, and power. Homelander’s destruction of enemies and lust for power does not end with his world. Challengers from other realms will also face his wrath. As seen in the new video, Homelander asserts dominance over opponents through his super strength, aerial attacks, and capacity to laser enemies with his eyes. </blockquote><p>If you can get through Homelander’s disgusting milk-drinking victory pose, you’ll see he uses his famous laser eyes in much of his combo building, as a launcher, an interrupt, as well as a combo extender. Indeed, the laser eyes are the basis of one of Homelander’s Fatalities, which we get a glimpse at at the end of the clip.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/29/screenshot-2024-05-29-143348-1716989639063.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Mortal Kombat 1 fans have wondered who Homelander might differ from similar Superman-style characters already in the game, such as Omni-Man from the Invincible series. Based on the gameplay trailer, we can see Homelander shares many abilities with Omni-Man, such as flight and heavy hitting attacks, but the difference appears to be in speed and, again, those laser eyes.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/29/screenshot-2024-05-29-143110-1716989487729.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Warner Bros. has remained coy about the voice actor behind Mortal Kombat 1’s Homelander. Antony Starr, who plays Homelander in The Boys, has said he is not voicing the character in the game, much to the disappointment of fans. Omni-Man voice actor J. K. Simmons reprised his role for Mortal Kombat 1, as did Peacemaker actor John Cena. It is unclear why Starr did not do the same here. Still, fans will be able to live out their Homelander versus Omni-Man fantasies through Mortal Kombat 1 when the character is made available next month.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/29/screenshot-2024-05-29-143232-1716989566907.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Meanwhile, we also get a look at Kameo character Ferra, who Homelander uses to set up a number of combos. Ferra is the small fighter who sat atop the hulking Torr as part of the combined Ferra &amp; Torr character from Mortal Kombat X. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/29/screenshot-2024-05-29-143542-1716989748027.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Homelander hits Mortal Kombat 1 on June 4 for early access players, followed by wide availability on June 11, whereas Ferra has a June release window. You need the Premium Edition or the Kombat Pack to play early. The Mortal Kombat 1 Kombat Pack includes the Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin for Johnny Cage (available now), and one-week early access to six playable DLC characters: Omni-Man (available now), Quan Chi (available now), Peacemaker (available now), Ermac (available now), Homelander (out soon), and Takeda Takahashi, as well as five DLC Kameo fighters. The Boys Season 4, meanwhile, kicks off June 13.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<p>The families of multiple victims of the 2022 mass shooting at Uvalde's Robb Elementary School are suing Activision in a California civil court, alleging that the company's <em>Call of Duty</em> games act as a "training camp for mass shooters."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/736998045/Activision-Uvalde-suit-via-Polygon">The lawsuit</a> (as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166245/uvalde-school-shooting-activision-blizzard-negligence-lawsuit">obtained by Polygon</a>) compares Activision's <em>Call of Duty</em> marketing to the cigarette industry's use of <a href="https://tobacco.stanford.edu/cigarettes/cartoons/joe-camel-cartoons/">now-barred spokescartoon Joe Camel</a>, putting the gaming company "in the wildly lucrative business of training adolescents to become gunmen." The <em>Call of Duty</em> games "are chewing up alienated teenage boys and spitting out mass shooters," the lawsuit alleges, and in Uvalde, the games "knowingly exposed the Shooter to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as the solution to his problems, and trained him how to use it."</p>
<p>Meta platforms is also a party to the lawsuit for "explicit, aggressive marketing" of firearms to minors via Instagram.</p>
<h2>Too real</h2>
<p>While <em>Call of Duty</em> may have started as a mere video game, the lawsuit argues that more recent versions have crossed the line into a realistic "simulation" that "enables the operator to reproduce or represent under test condition phenomena likely to occur in actual performance." The extreme realism in the game desensitizes players to killing in familiar environments like malls, airports, and restaurants, the suit says, and exposes "high-school aged boys with developing brains" to "morally complex situations with an assault weapon."</p>
<p>By "manipulating players' brain chemistry so that killing was associated with dopamine release, reward, and/or pleasure," the suit alleges that the games cause a "real life physical and neurological response" that some users are likely to try to replicate in the real world. "It is highly foreseeable that the addictive and hyper-realistic content of Call of Duty products will lead some users, including minors, to attempt or achieve the real-life enactment of what the Call of Duty products simulate so effectively, including the use of firearms for mass killing," the suit alleges.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In 2015, the American Psychological Association <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/08/violent-video-games">said</a> that "violent video game play is linked to increased aggression in players." But in a 2020 update, the APA clarified that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/apa-warns-against-linking-violent-video-games-to-real-world-violence/">there was no statistical link</a> between exposure to violent video games and incidence of real-world violence, affirming <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/11/meta-analysis-uncovers-no-real-link-between-violence-and-gaming/">earlier meta-analyses</a> on the topic.
</p><p>In a statement provided to Polygon, an Activision spokesperson said that “the Uvalde shooting was horrendous and heartbreaking in every way, and we express our deepest sympathies to the families and communities who remain impacted by this senseless act of violence. Academic and scientific research continues to show that there is no causal link between video games and gun violence.”</p>
<h2>Real virtual guns</h2>
<p>The lawsuit pays particular attention to Activision's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shooters-how-video-games-fund-arms-manufacturers">long-standing licensing agreements with real-world gun manufacturers</a>, which bring additional realism to the games while promoting the gun-makers' products. Gun-maker memos cited in the lawsuit show how the industry feels that "a primary means for young potential shooters to come into contact with firearms and ammunition is through virtual gaming scenarios." And while the specific brands of those guns are not highlighted in the game itself, the lawsuit lays out significant evidence that gun buyers seek out the real versions of the weapons they use in the <em>Call of Duty</em> games.</p>
<p>"In service of... their bottom line, Activision created a firearm showroom for its millions of users—one where adults and teenagers alike could browse, test, covet, and compare each weapon's capacity to kill," the lawsuit alleges.</p>

<p>Daniel Defense, which manufactured the actual gun used in the Uvalde shooting, is not a defendant in the suit. While the plaintiffs say the gun maker's actions are "contemptible, reckless, and at times unlawful," it adds that the company "cannot reach its target demographic, teenagers and young men, without the substantial and critical assistance of the Defendants."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - Official Season 4 Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The patch notes include weapon balancing for Modern Warfare 3's multiplayer, including a huge nerf for the popular BP50 assault rifle. The gun now has a 4% decrease to movement speed and sprint speed, as well as a 13% reduction to the maximum damage range, 11% less near-medium damage, and 8% decrease to the medium damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Several submachine guns are buffed to have increased damage ranges, with the list including Season 3's FJX Horus, the RAM-9, AMR9, Rival-9, HRM-9, Striker-9, Striker, and WSP-9.</p><p dir="ltr">A few perks are corrected in the big update. It fixed an issue with the Gunslinger Vest, which previously caused Throwing Star kills not to refresh stamina, and it corrected the issue that caused Throwing Star kills not to trigger health regeneration with the Compression Carrier Vest equipped.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 4 also makes several adjustments to killstreaks, which should hopefully make them feel more effective. The Precision Airstrike now has a 17% increase to the explosive damage radius, the Cruise Missile received a 50% increase, and the SAE has a 7% increase to the explosive damage radius as well. For the Carpet Bomb, the streak is decreased in price from 10 kills or 1,250 score down to eight kills or 1,000 score, the explosive damage radius is increased by 25%, and the flight speed of the bomber is now 40% faster.</p><p dir="ltr">On the Zombies side, the update includes several fixes for bugs and stability issues. This includes a correction for a bug that previously prevented players from activating the third punching bag in the Tattered MMA Gloves attunement challenge, and fixes a problem that previously caused a loss of weapons when dying while the Juggernaut suit was active.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4309946-mwiii-s4-announcement-tout3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309946" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4309946-mwiii-s4-announcement-tout3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309946"></a><figcaption>Season 4 roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4309946-mwiii-s4-announcement-tout3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The big highlight for Warzone's Season 4 update is the raised player count in standard battle royale mode, with the increase from 100 to 120 players per match. The developer addresses these changes by saying, "Player feedback continues to indicate a desire for more action. So with that in mind, we have made the necessary changes to accommodate a higher player count without disrupting the delicate balance" of the matches.</p><p dir="ltr">Changes also arrived to the Urzikstan map. Exit hatches were added to the open bunkers to provide an additional escape route, and the Gulag now has a silo setting with four different map layouts to provide more variation to the 1v1 arena. A circle change is also made to delay the time before the initial circle begins to shrink on the map, which is increased from one to two minutes, and the developer says this change was made to give players more time to find bunkers and also adjusts the match pacing to fit 120 players.</p><p dir="ltr">A stealing feature is added to the Champion's Quest nuke challenges across all maps and modes. When a team with the Champion's Quest contract is fully eliminated, the quest tablet will drop and the first team that interacts with the tablet can now steal the contract and continue the quest.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/05/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-season-4-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Modern Warfare 3</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/05/call-of-duty-mwiii-warzone-season-4-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be found below, as shared by Activision.</p><h3>WELCOME TO SEASON 4</h3><p>Welcome to Season 4 of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III!</p><p>Before you jump into all of the new content this Season offers, read the Patch Notes below for the latest balance adjustments, gameplay improvements, bug fixes, and other changes.</p><p>Pre-download the Season 4 update now on all platforms and get started at 9 AM PT.</p><h3>NEW MAPS</h3><p>The fog of war goes global.

Wanting to be with Hammer for as long as possible, Manoel trained him as a working dog, and enrolled in the military with Hammer by his side. First, he was part of the Guard Battalion utilizing Hammer as a guard dog, and later, moved his way into the Brazil Special Operations where Hammer’s hunting and tracking skills became invaluable in chasing down targets.</i></p><p><i>One day, on a tracking mission, Hammer was killed in action by the SpecGru organization. Manoel took Hammer's name as his own callsign, and vowed revenge. He joined KorTac to do it and promised to never work with another K-9 unit, and to avenge his dog.</i></p><p>Dupe &amp; Copy</p><p><i>REDACTED</i></p><h3>NEW EVENTS</h3><p>Kick off the first 4 weeks of Season 4 with the Critical Countdown Event before heading into several other Events scheduled throughout the Season, including some surprises along the way.</p><p>Critical Countdown</p><p><i>Collect DNA samples from fallen foes to earn rewards and uncover the truth behind the superweapon.</i></p><p>Mobile Suit Gundam Legends</p><p><i>Embrace the awesome power of Mobile Suits!

100.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In an effort to enhance the Battle Royale experience on Urzikstan, we've decided to increase the number of players in each match from 100 to 120.</p><p>Our initial design intent at the launch of Modern Warfare 3 was to focus on mid-game pacing, ensuring a steady and consistent build-up throughout the match. To strike a balance between matchmaking times, client performance, and match pacing, we initially centered our game balance around 100 players. This required extensive revisions and balancing across various aspects of the game, including early game looting, engagement times, weapon damage, armor values, movement mechanics, redeploy mechanics, economy, and strategic and defensive tools. We’re proud to say that overall we’ve been quite pleased with the results over the past few seasons.</p><p>That said, player feedback continues to indicate a desire for more action. So with that in mind, we have made the necessary changes to accommodate a higher player count without disrupting the delicate balance we have worked hard to achieve. This time around, these adjustments have been primarily focused around redeploy mechanics and our match economy.</p><p>Gulag tokens now have a low chance to appear in general loot, with specific spawn rates from different chest types and guaranteed availability from Most Wanted and buy stations. Redeploy tokens are now part of a new tier of legendary items and have specific spawn conditions to maintain balance. Additionally, redeploy flares have a controlled spawn rate in legendary chests and other support item locations.</p><p>Our goal with the economy is to make cash more meaningful and create clearer paths for acquiring key items. We've slightly reduced the amount of cash found in loot, increased the number of supply boxes, updated the cost of buy station items, and adjusted the rarity of certain items to promote a more engaging and strategic looting experience.</p><p>With all these changes live in Season 4, we aim to deliver a more strategic experience that emphasizes risk-reward while maintaining consistent, action-packed pacing throughout the match. As always, our team will be carefully monitoring internal data as well as external player feedback - and adjustments will be made where necessary as we move forward.</p><h2>MAPS</h2><h3><b><u>MAP UPDATES</u></b></h3><h4>» URZIKSTAN «</h4><ul><li><b>Bunkers</b><ul><li>Unlocked bunkers now have an escape hatch as an alternative exit.</li><li>New rewards have been added to various locations.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Gulag</b><ul><li>4 new Gulag layouts have been added:  <ul><li>S: Stacked equipment and L-shaped plywood walls with an S-shaped central wall over the circular floor grate.</li><li>2: A three-panel curved wall, stacked equipment against two walled sections, and two curved inner walls above the circular floor grate.</li><li>3: Stacked equipment against two walled sections, with concrete L-shaped walls around the central circular floor grate.</li><li>8: A rectangular concrete barrier wall outside long central section around the central circular floor grate with one plywood wall sprayed with a blue “8”.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>MODES</h2><h3><b><u>RETURNING</u></b></h3><h4>» URZIKSTAN | BATTLE ROYALE «</h4><ul><li><b>Buy Back Royale</b><ul><li>Cash is everything in this returning game mode.
