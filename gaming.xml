            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has become the staging ground for a digital gang war backed by some of the biggest content creators in the world. The feud, which has been dubbed the ‘ARC Raiders War’ or ‘The Battle of the Bunguraiders’ has taken over the social circles surrounding ARC Raiders, with creators far and wide joining forces and urging their followers to show their support by dressing a certain way.</p>



<p>It’s a hilarious example of how engaged the community is inside ARC Raiders, the all-new and electric extraction shooter from Embark Studios. Let’s dive into the ARC Raiders War and figure out what it all means.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-arc-raiders-war">When is the ARC Raiders War?</h2>



<p>The ARC Raiders War is set to come to a head this Saturday, November 22. An immense group of streamers, featuring the likes of Myth, The Burnt Peanut, xQc, HutchMF, and Ninja, will all go live simultaneously to broadcast ‘The Final Showdown’. It will be the culmination of days of social media hype, and it’s set to take place on Spaceport.</p>



<p>If you want to watch the ARC Raiders War, you’ll need to be around and tuning into your favorite streamers at:</p>



<ul>
<li>5 pm PT</li>



<li>7 pm CT</li>



<li>8 pm ET</li>



<li>1 am GMT</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-did-the-arc-raiders-bungulators-war-begin">How Did The ARC Raiders Bungulators War Begin?</h2>



<p>During a recent stream, HutchMF was brutally downed and executed (read: <em>knocked out</em>) in ARC Raiders. He was pleading for mercy and went down screaming, vying for war against The Burnt Peanut after being taunted with the phrase ‘For the Bungulators’. </p>



<p>Hutch declared war on social media, and The Burnt Peanut quickly reciprocated. Before long, all manner of streamers were pulled into the fight, forming some sizeable teams:</p>



<p><strong>Team Burnt Peanut (The Bungulators):</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Myth</li>



<li>Summit1g</li>



<li>Cloakzy</li>



<li>RNGingy</li>



<li>Shroud</li>



<li>Ninja</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Team HutchMF:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>TimTheTatman</li>



<li>Nadeshot</li>



<li>Symfuhny</li>



<li>NICKMERCS</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s quite possibly one of the most loaded community-backed roleplaying events in recent years, and it’s only growing. Even xQc has joined the story, but he’s remaining impartial and hasn’t signed up to fight for either side.</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-how-to-join-the-arc-raiders-war">How to Join the ARC Raiders War</h2>



<p>If you want to represent your chosen faction in the ARC Raiders war, you can do so by equipping the following gear:</p>



<p><strong>The Bungulators:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Striker Skin: Red</li>



<li>Bag: On</li>



<li>Gas Mask: On</li>



<li>Helmet: On</li>



<li>Padding: On</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The FMF (Hutch):</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Torpedo Skin: Red</li>



<li>Helmet: Off</li>



<li>Goggles: On</li>



<li>Mask: Off</li>



<li>Sleeves: Off</li>
</ul>



<p>If you want to join xQc’s neutral faction, it’s just the Origin skin in <strong>blue</strong>.</p>



<p>Hutch has ‘control of the South’ of the map, while The Burnt Peanut has staked the North of the map.</p>



<p>This is one of the primary reasons why ARC Raiders continues to perform well, almost a month after its release. It’s a game that streamers can’t put down, pulling their audiences onto the platform.</p>



<p>Speranza is about to become a battlefield. Are you ready to serve in the ARC Raiders War? Let everyone know what side you’re taking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After many leaks, Silent Hill 2 Remake is finally confirmed for Xbox Series X|S. Furthermore, it’s already out to play and at half price.</p>







<p>Released in 2024, Silent Hill 2 Remake was a collaboration between Konami and Bloober Team to bring the 2001 horror classic to new consoles. Following James Sutherland, you’ll enter the fog-riddled town of Silent Hill to find your once-thought-dead wife. The psychologically twisted narrative was a hit then and even more so now, winning multiple awards and receiving praise from fans and newcomers alike. However, the game only came out for PlayStation 5 and Steam. Rumors and even a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-store-leaks-silent-hill-2-xbox-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">storefront leak</a> hinted that the remake would come to Xbox and, now, we can confirm it’s on its way and sooner than you’d think.</p>



<h2 id="h-silent-hill-2-remake-is-now-available-on-xbox-series-x-s">Silent Hill 2 Remake is Now Available on Xbox Series X|S</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Xbox Store has <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/silent-hill-2/9PNVDQKPJRQV/0010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">officially listed Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, confirming that it is on Xbox Series X|S. No trailer or anything has come out yet, making this a pretty huge shadow drop. Even more so, it’s appears that the game is out in full and can be bought right now. It’s Standard Edition is priced at $69.99, but is actually half off at $34.99. The game <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/silent-hill-2-silent-hill-f-standard-dual-pack/9MZQ9BGNL7VK/0010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can also be bundled</a> with Silent Hill f for $79.99.</p>



<p>As for DLC, we still don’t have a confirmation for Born from a Wish. Fans have been asking for it for quite a while, but no luck so far. Hopefully, with the game on Xbox, Bloober Team may revisit Silent Hill 2 and give Maria the content she deserves. The team is already working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-silent-hill-remake-development-bloober-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 1 remake</a>, so perhaps it would bide players over until we return to that foggy town. </p>

<p>A celebratory illustration for the Tales series’ 30th anniversary may have spoiled the next remaster. Even more so, it’s a title many fans have been vocal about since the Remaster project was announced.</p>







<p>Since 1995, the Tales series (also known as Tales of Series) has been charming players with vibrant adventures and grand action RPG combat. While not as mainstream as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-will-be-close-to-100gb-on-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy</a> or Persona, the Bandai Namco franchise has had a few successes in the West with Tales of Symphonia and Vesperia. Since 2021, with Tales of Arise, the series has been remastering past games like Xillia and, announced this week, Berseria. The full lineup hasn’t been revealed, but a new illustration from Ufotable may have let the cat out of the bag early.</p>



<h2 id="h-tales-of-the-abyss-remastered-possibly-in-development-hints-anniversary-illustration">Tales of the Abyss Remastered Possibly in Development, Hints Anniversary Illustration</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">◤ Step back into the story ◢<br>The 30th Anniversary Key Visual by ufotable is now revealed ✨<br>Characters from titles celebrating their anniversaries in 2025–2026, along with characters from remastered titles, invite you into the heart of the story. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tales30thAnniversary?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Tales30thAnniversary</a> <a href="https://t.co/BNcY6IfIJI">pic.twitter.com/BNcY6IfIJI</a></p>— Tales of Series (@TalesofSeries) <a href="https://twitter.com/TalesofSeries/status/1991703111467958370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In the post, <a href="https://x.com/TalesofSeries/status/1991703111467958370?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">seen above</a>, the Tales series commemorates its 30th anniversary. The illustration, done by Ufotable (Demon Slayer), showcases all the recent Tales titles like Arise, Xillia Remastered, Graces f Remastered, and Berseria Remastered. However, one character there is from a game that isn’t a remaster, let alone announced: Luke from Tales of the Abyss. Given that the game came out in 2005, it being there is a bit interesting.</p>



<p>Tales of the Abyss was a PlayStation 2 exclusive and the eighth main title in the series. Following Luke fon Fabre, he’ll venture into the unknown to figure out his birth and escape a dangerous prophecy. Fans have been asking to see the game brought back to life for a while. It wouldn’t be too surprising if the next remaster after Berseria is Abyss, though Xillia 2 was confirmed earlier this year. Still, while it isn’t confirmation, it does give a small glimmer of hope that the PS2 title may be reborn.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is considered one of the standout video games of 2025, and the Switch 2 exclusive has now been officially recognised at the 43rd annual Golden Joystick Awards as the recipient of the Critics' Choice Award.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza was also up for 'Ultimate Game Of The Year' and 'Console Game of the Year' at the same event (voting for these categories was open to the public). <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> took out the ultimate award, and Sony's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ghost_of_yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> won the console category. The PlayStation exclusive also beat <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> in the same category.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytfMx2XNyAq4E" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4sukmnz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>The Switch 2 and Switch 2 Pro Controller had also been shortlisted for "Best Gaming Hardware". This award went to AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D CPU. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a> took out the "still playing" mobile award, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight_silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> won best self-published indie game.</p>

<p>In our review of Donkey Kong Bananza here on Nintendo Life, we awarded this title an "excellent" nine out of ten stars:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whether it's smashing through the scenery with a Bananza Transformation or carefully planning a route to a hidden Banandium Gem, you'll have trouble finding more originality and, crucially, more enjoyment from a platformer in recent years. As the DK Rap so wisely said, "Donkey Kong is here." Now let's just hope he stays."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some <em>other</em> award show news, earlier this week it was announced Donkey Kong Bananza was in the running for The Game Awards' Game of the Year Award.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it faces some tough competition, including games such as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (which is up for 12 awards at the same show), Hollow Knight: Silksong and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xqc-league-of-legends-unwatchable-esports/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xqc-thinks-league-of-legends-is-an-%E2%80%98unwatchable%E2%80%99-esports-game.1360330/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>During a recent stream, Felix ‘xQc’ Lengyel, one of the biggest streamers in the world, bagged on League of Legends esports. He stressed that the game is fine to play, but branded the esports side of things ‘f***ing unwatchable’. Instead, he backed Counter-Strike 2, suggesting that Valve’s shooter ‘clears it by a margin of like 10x or 20x’.</p>



<p>Once upon a time, xQc was an esports competitor himself, but those days are long gone. Do you think xQc is right about League of Legends esports?</p>



<h2 id="h-that-will-probably-never-change">‘That Will Probably Never Change’</h2>



<p>In a recent stream clip, xQc was captured telling his viewers that League of Legends is, in his opinion, an awful esports game.</p>



<p>This was during the Esports Awards, where League of Legends secured the award for Game of the Year, beating games like Counter-Strike 2 and VALORANT to the punch. It has been a stunning year for League of Legends, with records being broken at the League of Legends World Championship event, hosted this season in China.</p>



<p>That’s not enough for xQc, though.</p>



<p>In a slight rant, xQc said on stream:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>CS2 will always win: It’s a game that offers good storytelling, the spectator POV is unmatched, and it’s easy to make a story. Anyone can just jump in, and they know exactly what’s going on, and that will probably never change. It’s why it’s still so successful as a title. League of Legends? </p>



<p>It’s god f**king unwatchable… It’s great to play, but it’s not a great esports game… I love League, don’t get me wrong, but Jesus, as an esports game, Counter-Strike clears it by a margin of like 10x or 20x.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://escorenews.com/en/csgo/news/73655-xqc-i-love-league-but-as-an-esports-game-cs2-clears-it-by-a-margin-of-10x-or-20x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EScoreNews</a> for the quote)</em></p>



<p>Counter-Strike hasn’t made the cut at the Esports Awards in almost a decade. The last time it clinched Game of the Year was in 2017, and since then, League of Legends, Overwatch, and VALORANT have all had their time in the limelight.</p>

<p>This marks the beginning of "regularly scheduled in-game events" for Kirby Air Riders, which may or may not remind you of the limited-time events in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>. During these events, participants will be able to earn rewards such as "street names, stickers, and themes" to customise their license.</p>
<p>These events are currently planned to run for "a year after launch", so get ready for many more in the future! You'll be able to access them from the main menu of Kirby Air Riders, which you can see in the screenshot below:</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adthximj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>The first event is titled "Everyone, to the Stadium!" and sees everyone gather at the same Stadium contest in a fixed eight-player Trial, with the goal being to take out the top spot.

              <p>Floor cleaning splits into two separate tasks that waste time and leave you switching between vacuuming and mopping with different equipment. Tineco dominates the wet dry vacuum category by eliminating this inefficiency, and competitors haven’t caught up to their smart sensor technology that adjusts cleaning parameters automatically based on mess detection. The<strong> Floor One S5</strong> handles everything from dry debris to sticky spills in a single pass without manual mode switching or guesswork about water flow rates. Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5768/"> just dropped this machine to a record low of $259 for Black Friday, down from its usual $449 price</a>, which makes this pro floor cleaning accessible at nearly half the typical cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5768/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Transforms Cleaning Intelligence</h2>
<p>Proprietary <em>iLoop</em> technology <strong>detects the level of mess and automatically adjusts suction power, water flow volume, and brush roller speed</strong> in real-time to match what it encounters. Heavy dirt automatically turns up the suction and quickens the brush speeds; light dust reduces power consumption to prolong battery life. The sticky messes get more water flow to dissolve the residue, while the dry ones get less to avoid over-wetting</p>
<p>The dual-tank system keeps the <strong>cleaning solution and dirty water completely separate throughout the process</strong>. Fresh water and cleaning solution flow from the clean tank to the brush roller, while contaminated water gets sucked into the separate dirty tank. This design ensures you’re always cleaning with fresh water rather than spreading dirty water around, like most mop and bucket systems do. The clean water tank increased 30% in capacity compared to previous generations, allowing it to cover larger areas before requiring refills.</p>



<p>The design of the brush roller places the bristles close to baseboards and into corners where dirt accumulates, but standard vacuum heads cannot reach. The edge-to-edge coverage of the roller eliminates the gap that requires you to go back with hand tools or separate edge cleaners. Floors are completely dry within minutes after cleaning, rather than remaining damp for hours like traditional mopping leaves them.</p>



<p>The <strong>hands-free self-cleaning cycle</strong> takes care of the most dreaded maintenance task with traditional mops. Press one button, and the machine automatically flushes the internal tubing and brush roller with clean water, which dislodges trapped hair, debris, and dirty water from the cleaning system. After the cleaning cycle is complete, the centrifugal drying function spins excess water out of the roller to prevent mildew growth and odors that build up in damp cleaning tools. This automated maintenance takes mere minutes with zero manual scrubbing or touching of the dirty roller.</p>
<p>The <strong>3-in-1 docking station combines storage, charging, and self-cleaning in one small footprint</strong>. The vertical storage design saves valuable floor space over maintaining a separate vacuum and mop with their accessories and cleaning supplies. The station charges the battery between uses and is the anchor for the self-cleaning cycle. The cordless design reaches all areas of your home without being tethered by extension cords limiting your range or presenting tripping hazards while cleaning.</p>
<p>The machine deals with hard floor types like tile, hardwood, laminate and vinyl without any specific attachments or changing settings. From sticky kitchen spills and bathroom grime to muddy footprints and pet accidents, all clean up with the same equipment and technique. The cleaning solution works on multiple floor types without residue or requiring specific formulations for different surfaces. Regular maintenance involves cleaning the filter and the HEPA element monthly to maintain suction performance and wiping the dirty water tank sensor to avoid false full alerts.</p>
<p>At $259, you’re getting Tineco’s flagship wet/dry vacuum technology for $190 below standard retail pricing that puts this category out of reach for many households. The 42% discount brings automated floor cleaning within budget for people tired of the vacuum-then-mop routine that doubles cleaning time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Friday, and that means that the weekend is <strong>finally here</strong>. Before you can enjoy it, you simply must complete today’s NYT Connections puzzle! Fortunately, I’ve got the hints and solutions you need to get things wrapped up as quickly as possible. If you’re stumped by today’s puzzle, simply read on for the top NYT Connections hints.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-21">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 21)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #894:</p>



<ul>
<li>RACECAR</li>



<li>LAPEL PIN</li>



<li>SCREWDRIVER</li>



<li>WOLF EEL</li>

<li>GRUMPY OLD MAN</li>



<li>COSMOPOLITAN</li>



<li>LAVALIER</li>



<li>CLOWNFISH</li>



<li>AWARENESS RIBBON</li>



<li>TALKING DOLL</li>



<li>CHOW MEIN</li>



<li>BOUTONNIÈRE</li>



<li>SEA BREEZE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of what politicians, prom dates, or awareness campaigns might wear.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Names evoke breezes, colors, or canine companions.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>They’re the heart of beloved family films</em>.</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each begins with a word that means to devour.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 21:</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/skip-gopro-this-insta360-8k-360-action-camera-drops-to-new-record-low-on-amazon-2000645958</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skip-gopro-this-insta360-8k-360%C2%B0-action-camera-drops-to-new-record-low-on-amazon.1360294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Action cameras used to be a choice between GoPro’s standard rectangular frame or settling for cheaper alternatives with questionable quality. Insta360 has emerged as a heavyweight competitor that delivers capabilities GoPro can’t match, specifically the ability to capture everything around you simultaneously in 8K resolution. The <strong>X5 records full 360-degree video</strong> that lets you choose angles during editing rather than committing to a single perspective while filming. Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5767/"> just dropped this camera to a record low of $464 for Black Friday, down from its usual $549 price</a>, and this aggressive pricing puts serious pressure on GoPro’s market dominance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5767/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>8K 360-Degree Capture Eliminates Missed Moments</h2>
<p>It boasts <strong>dual 1/1.28-inch sensors to capture 8K footage at 30 frames per second</strong>, recording everything in your line of sight with really impressive detail and dynamic range. This omnidirectional recording means you’ll never miss the action happening behind you or to the side while focused on something else. The bigger sensor size relative to most action cameras pulls in more light and offers more excellent color accuracy across a wide range of lighting conditions. You can pull any angle from standard flat video after filming, which effectively gives you infinite camera positions from one recording session.</p>
<p>The t<strong>riple AI chip architecture will process the enormous streams of data from both sensors</strong> and at the same time applying sophisticated noise reduction algorithms. This computing power results in usable footage in low-light conditions where conventional action cameras produce a grainy, unuseable result. Night skiing, evening events, or indoor activities become viable shooting scenarios rather than situations in which you pack the camera away.</p>



<p>The invisible selfie stick effect creates impossible-seeming third-person perspectives that follow you through scenes. The camera’s software automatically removes the selfie stick from the 360-degree footage and make shots appear as if filmed by a drone or cameraman tracking alongside. This cinematic effect works because the stick occupies such a narrow slice of the<strong> full 360-degree field of view that the AI can seamlessly stitch around it</strong>. You get professional-looking tracking shots without carrying gimbal equipment or recruiting someone to film you.</p>
<p><em>InstaFrame Mode</em> automatically generates a ready-to-share flat video without requiring a full 360-degree editing workflow. The camera can auto-track your movement, keeping you centered in the frame as you move around, or lock to a fixed angle for static compositions. It lets you do this far quicker when all you want is quick social media content rather than elaborate 360 experiences.</p>



<p><em>FlowState</em> stabilization and 360-degree <em>Horizon Lock</em> eliminate the need for additional weight and complexity due to gimbal equipment. Advanced stabilization algorithms work to smooth out bumps, vibrations, and sudden movements that would make traditional footage unwatchable. The horizon lock keeps framing level even during complete rotations or dramatic angle changes. Mountain biking, skiing, skateboarding, and other high-impact activities result in smooth, professional-looking footage without the floating camera effect that electronic stabilization sometimes produces.</p>
<p>The replaceable lens design addresses the biggest weakness of previous 360 cameras where damaged lenses necessitated the replacement of the entire expensive unit. Similarly, the upgraded lenses in this device are more resistant to scratches and impacts compared to their predecessors, but when an accident occurs, you can swap them out in seconds. Such repairability significantly extends the camera’s useful life because lens damage becomes a minor maintenance issue rather than a catastrophic failure.</p>
<p>This four-microphone array features advanced Wind Guard technology, capturing clearer audio when engaged in outdoor activities. Where normally wind noise drowns out voices, this system focuses on vocal frequencies while filtering out the wind interference that often ruins audio in traditional action camera recordings. This matters for vlogging, narration, or any scenario in which you’re talking while filming.</p>
<p>Waterproof construction to 49 feet operates without separate housing that adds bulk and degrades image quality. You can take the X5 swimming, surfing, or diving in shallow water without protective cases. The <strong>battery life of 185 minutes</strong> covers extended shooting sessions or full-day adventures, while fast charging reaches 80 percent capacity in just 20 minutes.</p>
<p>You’re getting cutting-edge 360-degree technology at $85 below standard retail pricing that already undercut GoPro’s flagship models for $464. The 15 percent discount brings pro 360 capture capabilities within enthusiasts’ reach who want creative flexibility beyond what rectangular action cameras provide.</p>

              <p>With modern laptops, connectivity was sacrificed for thin designs and give you two to three USB-C ports where you used to have a variety of choices in connecting your devices. This minimalist architecture now creates constant frustration when you try to hook up monitors, external drives, charging cables and peripherals all at once.</p>
<p>The <strong>14-in-1 docking station from Anker resolves this limitation by taking that single USB-C port</strong> and breaking it out into fourteen connection options that cover every device you might need to plug in. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5770/">just dropped this hub to a record low of $39 for Black Friday, down from the usual $69 price</a>, which makes essential connectivity affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5770/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Triple Display Expands Your Workspace</h2>
<p><strong>Dual 4K HDMI and a 1080p VGA port</strong> enable three-monitor setups that transform how one works with multiple applications and documents. You can dedicate one screen to email and communications, another to active work, and a third to reference materials or monitoring dashboards. The 4K resolution on HDMI outputs brings sharp text and detailed images, which help reduce eye fatigue during extended work sessions. The VGA port keeps compatibility with older projectors and monitors that businesses and conference rooms still use frequently. Windows users get true <strong>extended desktops across all three displays</strong>, while macOS mirrors the same content to all connected monitors due to operating system limitations.</p>



<p>The <strong>five USB-A ports</strong> accommodate legacy devices like external hard drives, printers, webcams, and wired keyboards that haven’t yet moved to USB-C connections. The 5 Gbps transfer speed will handle file operations well, transferring gigabytes of data in minutes, not the glacial speeds of older USB 2.0 hubs. <strong>A dedicated USB-C data port adds another high-speed connection</strong> for newer devices while matching the same 5 Gbps throughput. That matters when backing up large photo libraries, transferring video projects, or syncing substantial data sets between devices.</p>
<p>The p<strong>ass-through charging of 80 watts powers</strong> your laptop through the hub while using all connected devices. You plug your laptop’s USB-C charger into the hub’s power input, and the hub distributes power to your laptop while maintaining all connectivity functions. This single cable solution means your laptop charges while accessing all peripherals without juggling multiple power adapters.</p>



<p>The <strong>Gigabit Ethernet port</strong> ensures solid wired network connections that avoid unreliable Wi-Fi in crowded offices or when maximum upload and download speeds matter. Wired connections eliminate the latency spikes and bandwidth competition that wireless networks introduce during video calls or large file transfers. The consistent throughput supports remote desktop sessions, video conferencing, and cloud backup operations that demand reliable connectivity. The <strong>SD and microSD card slots</strong> handle camera cards and storage expansion without separate card readers cluttering up your desk. The <strong>AUX port</strong> connects wired headphones or external speakers, preserving audio quality that Bluetooth sometimes compresses.</p>
<p>Compatibility extends to USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt-equipped laptops running Windows 10 and 11, ChromeOS, or macOS 12 and newer. The hub expects that your laptop’s USB-C port supports DisplayPort Alt Mode for video output and Power Delivery for charging functionality. Most modern business laptops and MacBooks boast both features, although some budget laptops with USB-C ports omit the required protocols.</p>
<p>For $39, you’re getting professional docking station functionality at almost half the $69 standard price that already undercut dedicated docking solutions costing $150 or more. The 43% discount brings essential connectivity to remote workers and office users who’ve struggled with inadequate laptop ports.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Free League has launched a new TTRPG crowdfunding campaign. The new game, <em>Twilight Sword</em>, is inspired by classic videogame RPGs and is the latest collaboration between the publisher and the developers of the high-octane experience, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/free-league-announces-publishing-partnership-for-cinematic-ttrpg-outgunned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Outgunned</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Twilight Sword</em> Backerkit Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its Backerkit <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/two-little-mice/twilight-sword" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, <em>Twilight Sword</em> is a fantasy TTRPG that draws heavy inspiration from <em>Legend of Zelda</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-preview-return-to-eden" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dragon Quest</em></a>, and the art style of Studio Ghibli. The game has players exploring the world of Radia, a land that is under attack by the forces of evil and despair. Heroes will do this not just by fighting monsters, but by rekindling hope through acts of courage and selflessness.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/twilight-sword-champion-artwork.jpg?itok=GDZ2O9Pz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/twilight-sword-champion-artwork.jpg?itok=fH4tb8sJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The campaign includes three different books. The Core Rulebook contains the rules for both players and GMs to play. <em>The Lands of Radia</em> book fleshes out an original fantasy setting full of monsters, villains, and quests for players to undertake. Lastly, there is a starter set for people curious about the game but don't have much time or money to commit to a full purchase.</p>

<p><em>Twilight Sword</em> uses an original gameplay system called CAT, or Created at Twilight. Skill rolls are resolved with a d12 roll tied to one of a character's eight skills. If the d12 result is equal to or lower than that skill's number, you succeed. Natural 1s are critical successes; natural 12s are critical failures.</p>

<p>Other features of the game include a Hope/Despair mechanic. Hope is built up when characters perform selfless or kind acts, which can dispel Despair, which protects strongholds controlled by the bad guys.</p>

<p>In addition, it will include a high level of character customisation. Each character picks one of two Ways, which gives them unique perks and feats, and one of five playable Kin, such as human, catperson, and penguin.</p>

<p>The pledge levels for <em>Twilight Sword</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Wanderer for $41:</strong> PDF copies of the core rulebook, <em>Lands of Radia</em> supplement, a PDF starter set, and a PDF card chest</li>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-shows-no-pride-silently-offloads-galaxy-watch-7-at-nearly-50-off-via-amazon-2000645949</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smartwatches compete based on health tracking accuracy and ecosystem integration, and Apple Watch remains on top despite premium pricing starting at $399 for the latest Series 10. Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 7 brings similar health metrics, AI-powered insights, and advanced sleep tracking at a fraction of Apple’s cost, and Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5766/"> just dropped it to a record low of $129 for Black Friday, down from its $249 retail price</a>. That nearly 50% discount undercuts even older Apple Watch models, but you get hardware that Samsung quietly released earlier this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5766/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Galaxy AI Powers Personalized Health Insights</h2>
<p>The <strong>Energy Score calculates your daily physical readiness</strong> by analyzing yesterday’s activity, sleep quality, heart rate patterns, and recovery metrics. This AI-driven analysis tells you if your body is prepared for hard work or needs lighter activities and rest. The score updates every morning, based on the data collected during the night, providing actionable information before you plan your day’s training. <strong>Samsung’s AI analyses that data</strong> on the paired phone rather than in the cloud, keeping health data private while providing personalized recommendations. Over time, the system learns your patterns to fine-tune accuracy while gathering more data about your unique physiology and response to different levels of activity.</p>
<p><strong>Performance tracking provides real-time comparisons</strong> of your current run or bike ride to past sessions, showing exactly where you’re maintaining, improving, or falling behind your pace. It’s that real-time feedback that lets you dial in your effort during a workout, rather than finding out later that you underperformed. The Galaxy AI removes movement artifacts from the heart rate signals of exercising users, improving the accuracy in cases where an individual’s arms are swinging or vibrations impact sensor contact.</p>



<p>S<strong>leep tracking follows your rest cycles</strong> and detects patterns that show poor sleep quality or probable health issues. For example, the watch identifies light sleep, deep sleep, REM stages, and periods of wakefulness throughout the night with accuracy that rivals dedicated sleep tracking devices. From there, Samsung’s AI analyzes the data to provide recommendations for improving sleep hygiene, adjusting bedtime routines, or modifying evening habits that interfere with quality rest. The sleep apnea detection feature screens for moderate and severe cases by monitoring breathing disruptions and oxygen levels during sleep.</p>
<p>Wellness tips provides<strong> personalized recommendations from the advanced health data</strong> your watch gathers all day. Its AI looks at patterns of activity, stress levels, and sleep quality, along with heart rate trends, to identify areas in which small changes may help optimize overall wellbeing. Such advice isn’t just about general fitness; it comments on real-life behavior and physiological responses unique to each person. The system may recommend earlier bedtimes when it observes accumulated sleep debt, advise stress management techniques during especially tense weeks, or encourage one to move more on days when mostly sedentary.</p>



<p>The<strong> 40mm case size fits smaller wrists comfortably</strong> without the bulk larger smartwatches create. Bluetooth connectivity keeps a stable connection to your phone for notifications, calls, and data syncing without requiring cellular service that adds to monthly fees. Battery life extends through a full day and night of continuous health tracking, though exact duration varies based on which features you enable and how often you interact with the watch.</p>
<p>Samsung’s ecosystem integration works seamlessly with Galaxy phones but <strong>also functions with other Android devices and even iPhones</strong>, though some features require Samsung hardware for full functionality. The watch face customization options let you prioritize which health metrics appear prominently, adjusting the display to show the data you actually care about rather than generic layouts.</p>
<p>At $129, you’re getting Samsung’s latest smartwatch technology at nearly half the price of entry-level Apple Watch models that don’t offer comparable AI-powered health insights. For those who have been priced out of the smartwatch market by Apple’s premium positioning, this 48% discount brings flagship health tracking within reach.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-22tb-external-hard-drive-drops-60-amazon-clears-stock-for-black-friday-2000645970</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate-22tb-external-hard-drive-drops-60-amazon-clears-stock-for-black-friday.1360252/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cloud storage subscriptions will drain your budget month after month and leave you dependent on internet connectivity to access your own files. The Seagate 22TB HDD offers enough capacity for massive photo libraries and years of accumulated digital content in one device, and Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5769/">just dropped this drive to a record low of $229 for Black Friday</a>, and while that compares to a typical $249 price, <strong>this same drive sold for $599 until just days ago</strong>. That represents a 60% discount from the price you’ve seen throughout the past year and the lowest this capacity has ever cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5769/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>22TB Eliminates Storage Anxiety Completely</h2>
<p>The h<strong>uge 22-terabyte capacity stores around 5,500 hours of HD video, 5.5 million high-resolution photos</strong>, or 440,000 songs at resolutions without compression or quality loss. With this much space, you can keep everything instead of making painstaking choices over what to delete or archive. Professional photographers maintain RAW file libraries spanning entire careers without resorting to cloud services. Video editors store entire project files complete with all source footage, renders, and iterations available instantly. It<strong> handles 4K and even 8K video projects</strong> that consume hundreds of gigabytes per hour of footage.</p>
<p><strong>USB 3.0 connectivity delivers transfer speeds up to 5 Gbps</strong> under ideal conditions; you could be moving large files in minutes, not hours. The real world, of course, will vary depending on the USB implementation on your host computer and the drive’s mechanical performance, but sustained transfers of about 100-150 MB per second for sequential file operations are within reason. This speed manages general backup tasks efficiently without tying up your computer for extended periods. Transfers of large files, such as moving an entire photo shoot or backing up a video project, complete within reasonable time frames.</p>



<p>Seagate includes <em>Rescue Data Recovery Services</em> that provide professional data recovery should the drive fail mechanically or suffer logical corruption. This service covers the cost of laboratory recovery attempts that cost hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars if you were to buy them separately. It’s the peace of mind when you’re storing family photos, work for clients, or a lifetime of creative work on a single device.</p>
<p>The plug-and-play design instantly works with Windows and Mac computers, requiring no software installation or complicated setup procedures. It means that Windows will immediately recognize the drive and assign a drive letter to it, ready for use. If you are a Mac user, you can easily reformat it to APFS or HFS+, although it will ship formatted for compatibility right out of the box.</p>



<p>The drive’s performance suits cold storage and archival purposes where you are writing data once and reading it occasionally, rather than running active databases or applications. Time Machine backups on Mac or File History on Windows work perfectly with this drive’s speed characteristics. Media servers streaming video to local network devices perform well since the sequential read speeds handle multiple concurrent streams.</p>
<p>Yes, this means that at $229, <strong>you are getting 22 terabytes of storage for just a little over $10 per terabyte</strong>. That is exceptional value that was not around at this price until now. The 60% discount from the $599 price that prevailed until recently brings enterprise-scale storage capacity to consumer budgets. This Black Friday deal has space enough to consolidate several smaller drives, cancel cloud storage subscriptions, or simply stop worrying about storage limitations for several years.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-200ft-outdoor-lights-pro-drops-40-on-amazon-now-cheaper-than-budget-home-lighting-2000645934</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/govee-200ft-outdoor-lights-pro-drops-40-on-amazon-now-cheaper-than-budget-home-lighting.1360234/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Permanent outdoor lighting takes your home’s exterior from drab to dramatic without the tacky holiday-only vibe some cheap string lights create. The Govee <em>Permanent Outdoor Lights Pro</em> serve as sophisticated daily accent lighting that switches to festive colors when the occasion calls while maintaining architectural elegance-never screaming seasonal decoration-all year long. This <strong>200-foot system features 120 individually controllable RGBIC LEDs</strong> for ample coverage at most homes and color flexibility to match any mood or event. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/">just dropped this complete system down to a record low of $459 for Black Friday, down from its usual $759</a> which makes professional architectural lighting accessible at nearly 40% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>RGBWWIC Technology Delivers True White Light</h2>
<p>The upgraded warm white and cold white capabilities differentiate these lights from cheaper RGB alternatives which tend to produce muddy, off-color whites. Color <strong>temperature ranges from 2700K to 6500K</strong>, from cozy warm candlelight tones to crisp daylight whites matching your home’s existing exterior lighting. Each LED produces 50 lumens for real illumination, not a dim decorative glow that makes you run additional lighting. This level of brightness works for daily accent lighting that highlights architectural features, pathway illumination, or subtle perimeter lighting that enhances security without harsh floodlight aesthetics.</p>
<p>The anti-glare lens design creates a triangular lighting effect that directs light out but doesn’t blind anyone who looks directly at the fixtures. This optical engineering prevents the harsh glare that makes cheap LED strips uncomfortable to be around. The light spreads evenly along your roofline or architectural features without hot spots or dark gaps between LEDs. Enhanced lens technology keeps color accuracy high across the entire RGB spectrum and improve the white light quality that most outdoor lighting actually uses.</p>



<p>The cuttable and extendable design allows you to tailor the installation to your home’s exact dimensions rather than deal with excess cable or come up short. You can cut the strand at designated points and reconnect sections with waterproof joints every 16.4 feet. This flexibility accommodates complex rooflines, multiple buildings, or layouts that require wrapping corners and spanning gaps.<strong> Up to 200 feet of connected length</strong> can be supported in the total system, covering substantial properties without needing multiple separate systems.</p>



<p><strong>Water submersion up to 1 meter is protected by the IP67 waterproof rating</strong> on the adapter and the lights themselves, while the control box is IP65 for heavy rain and snow. These <strong>lights will survive from -4°F to 140°F,</strong> and cover most extremes of temperature that any climate will see in the course of a year. The 50,000-hour lifespan equates to roughly 17 years of daily use at 8 hours per day, eliminating concerns over frequent bulb replacements or system failures. In fact, this durability justifies this permanent installation approach, as the lights really do last several years, rather than needing seasonal replacement like temporary holiday decorations.</p>
<p><strong>Installation takes about 8 seconds per light</strong> with the included VHB adhesive and mounting clips that attach securely to eaves, soffits, or trim. The system recommends placing lights 2 to 4 inches from the wall surface to develop the optimum lighting effect and to prevent shadows. Waterproof splice connectors join sections together without exposed wiring or weak points where moisture could infiltrate.</p>
<p>The Govee Home app gives you individual control over each of the 120 LEDs, allowing you to create custom patterns, gradients, and effects flowing along your roofline. You could program schedules that automatically turn lights on at sunset and off at midnight, or create scene triggers that respond to weather conditions or special occasions. <strong>Of the 75 pre-programmed scene modes, holidays, seasons, and moods</strong> are already set up and don’t require you to manually select colors or design patterns.</p>
<p>At $459, you’re getting permanent architectural lighting for $300 below the standard retail price that puts this system out of reach for many homeowners. The 39% discount brings professional installation-quality results to a price point typically occupied by temporary seasonal decorations that last one or two years.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-november-2025-reanimal-trailer-free-demo-2000645835</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/we-saw-12-games-during-the-latest-xbox-showcase-and-some-of-them-definitely-have-my-attention-now.1360228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft’s November Xbox showcase didn’t have any major reveals but it did have plenty of nice surprises. Most of them were all geared around making the now $30 Game Pass Ultimate subscription seem a little more worth it thanks to a slew of promised upcoming day-one releases. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgOiQPxEF-I">The livestream</a> confirmed that <em>Dave the Diver</em> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/slot-machine-horror-steam-cloverpit-balatro-2000631009">recent Steam hit <em>CloverPit</em></a> are now both available on Xbox, each with new DLC coming early next year. But it also offered updates on a bunch of stuff that’s not out yet, including trailers for some new games we didn’t previously know about. Here’s all of them:</p> <h2>The <em>Godfall</em> studio is making a third-person roguelike shooter</h2>  <p>Counterplay games confirmed it’s <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-godfall-dev-counterplay-games-quietly-closed-down">not closed</a> and has actually been hard at work on its upcoming game <em>Armatus</em>. The very <a href="https://kotaku.com/remnant-ii-dark-souls-handler-class-does-the-dog-die-1850540297"><em>Remnant</em>-looing</a> action game has you wandering around the ruins of Paris and facing off against demons following a mysterious, urban-fantasy-coded cataclysm. The run-based game will have you collecting upgrades and experimenting with different powers. Hopefully, it can marry <a href="https://kotaku.com/next-gen-launch-title-godfall-really-really-wants-you-1848149707"><em>Godfall</em>‘s excellent combat</a> and neat visuals to a more rewarding progression loop. It’s coming out in 2026 and will be day-one on Game Pass.</p>

 <h2>The next wave of <em>Silksong</em>-likes is coming with <em>Crowsworn</em></h2>  <p>2D action platformer? Check. Metroidvania world? Check? Plague Doctor-inspired hero? Check. It’s impossible to tell if <em>Crowsworn</em> has the goods from the gameplay trailer alone but there are secrets to find and loadouts to optimize as you kill enemies in front of stylish scene art. There’s no release window but it’s also day-one on Game Pass.</p>

 <h2><em>Erosion</em> promises isometric action in a glorious voxel art world</h2>  <p>It’s a Western-themed, time-warping sandbox. Every time you die, you respawn 10 years in the future. The world around you changes and evolves in the meantime. A really neat idea helped by a really neat aesthetic. It looks like you’ll be exploring different towns and making choices that affect the future, too. It’s headed to Xbox Game Preview on PC in spring 2026 with a console launch to follow.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Echo Generation 2</em> looks like a promising sequel</strong></h2>  <p>The first <em>Echo Generation</em> was a humble little <em>Stranger Things</em>-style adventure that took inspiration from games like<em> Paper Mario</em>. There was turn-based combat, puzzle solving, and the occasional narrative-driven quick-time event. This time it looks like you’ll be propelled into a cyberpunk future fighting evil robots with a <em>Gremlins</em>-esque sidekick. It’s coming “soon” but doesn’t have a release date yet.</p>

 <h2><strong>Multiplayer horror gets a period piece</strong></h2>  <p><em>The Mound: Omen of Cthulu</em> is a co-op horror game that has players exploring a Lovecraftian haunted coastline in the colonial era. They’ll have to navigate “shifting perceptions” to survive and find treasure. This one’s out summer 2026 and <em>not</em> coming to Game Pass on day-one.</p>

 <h2><strong>Indie darling <em>Raji</em> levels up&nbsp;</strong></h2>  <p><em>Raji: Kaliyuga</em> is a sequel to Nodding Heads Games’ 2020 action adventure. It swaps the isometric perspective for a full third-person view and adds Raji’s brother Darsh as second playable character for a story that leans even deeper into mythology. The blue cat monkeys are the big highlight of the cinematic trailer reveal, though we haven’t really seen gameplay yet. It’ll be on Game Pass but there’s no release date yet.</p>

 <h2>The wait for <em>Reanimal</em> is almost over</h2>  <p>The upcoming horror game from the original <em>Little Nightmares</em> developers got a new trailer, a release date, and a demo. The co-op adventure arrives February 2026 and its first demo is out today. Not surprisingly, the price to bag this one was too high and it won’t be a day-one Game Pass release.</p> <h2><em>Roadside Research</em> looks like <em>Supermarket Simulator</em> with aliens</h2>  <p>You’re still stocking shelves, still checking out customers, and still trying to stay in business. Except this time you’ll also be wearing disguises and trying not to raise the suspicions of the local populace that you’re actually from another planet.&nbsp;<em>Roadside Research</em> aims to engineer some co-op comedy in addition to the smooth-brained satisfaction of succeeding at capitalism. It’s coming Q1 2026 to Game Pass.</p> <h2><em>Tides of Annihilation</em> has some wild boss fights</h2>  <p>This one gave me big “<em>Harpy fight from Final Fantasy XVI</em>” vibes, in a good way. <em>Tides of Annihilation</em> is playing loosely off of the King Arthur mythology but mostly just seems interested in figuring out how it can mash up cool combat ideas from other flashy dark fantasy action games. The lack of a coherent visual identity probably won’t matter too much if the combat and boss fights can stay on point. Still no release date, unfortunately.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Total Chaos</em> is out today</strong></h2>  <p>The follow-up to <em>Turbo Overkill</em>, about surviving creepypasta horror come to life, was shadow-dropped today on PC and console. It’s also on Game Pass. It looks way darker than its neon-fueled predecessor.</p> <h2><em>Vampire Survivors</em> turns into a 3D pixel art dungeon crawler</h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-vampire-survivorssequel-was-just-revealed-and-its-a-dungeon-crawler-2000645860"><em>Vampire Crawlers</em></a> might be too good to play. Like, I’m seriously afraid to actually pick this one up once it’s out lest it consume all my free time against my will. Unlike the top-down first game, this one is a deck-building roguelike that seems to weigh strategy more than RNG. Mostly it just looks cool as heck.</p> <h2>Furry May Cry</h2>  <p><em>Zoopunk</em> also looks cool as heck. It’s set in the same universe as <em>F.I.S.T.: Forged in Shadow Torch</em> and looks like someone learning to use Unreal Engine mashed together <em>Destiny 2</em> and <em>Star Fox</em>. Unfortunately, it’s also leveraging <a href="https://kotaku.com/zoopunk-generative-ai-demo-trailer-xbox-showcase-2000645874">some generative AI tools</a> to let players craft and customize user-generated content in the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The pioneer of the extraction shooter is still enticingly challenging, but a rocky 1.0 launch shows its age.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I played Escape From Tarkov for the first time in 2018, I remember being captivated by its obtuse, insanely challenging structure. Like PUBG was to the battle royale genre, this promising prototype of an extraction shooter had so many unique elements going for it that made me absolutely certain it would be the next big thing, even if it was sometimes completely broken in its Early Access state. All these years later, now finally hitting 1.0, it’s pretty shocking how much has changed while it also remains exactly as exasperating as I remember it. The hands-off approach to onboarding that forces newcomers to beat their heads against its unforgiving mechanics for dozens of hours before claiming even a single victory captures the same relentless challenge I’ve always adored, while other frustrations, like its continued bugs, poor technical performance, and inability to address an abundance of cheaters, remains disappointingly worse than ever. I’ve only spent 30 hours with the 1.0 version so far, which (as any veteran player will surely tell you) is no time at all, but right now it feels like this progenitor may have been left in the dust of the genre it spawned.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Escape From Tarkov isn’t just the original standalone extraction shooter, but also the one most fanatically adherent to the ruthless principles on which the genre was founded. Not only are you thrown into a deadly hellscape filled with lethal NPCs and merciless human opponents, but you’re given absolutely no guidance in your quest for survival and loot. Practically none of the progression systems are explained to you, there’s no map for you to look at while out in the field to indicate where the extraction points are, and you could easily spend tens of hours studying weapon attachments and ammo types just to understand how the heck to use the tools of death you’ll find in your journey. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In some ways, I really admire how unrepentant Tarkov is – its beautifully exacting game design, and the sense of discovery that takes place across hundreds of lessons learned the hard way can be incredibly rewarding. But then there are times where it’s all just so dang frustrating, like how atrociously the UI and menus are organized, as if they were designed specifically to offend you. Whether or not the payoff of finally feeling comfortable enough to bring your best equipment out and try for a proper extraction is worth it will ultimately depend on couple things: your tolerance for pain, and your drive to master something designed to really test your expertise of systems Tarkov refuses to teach you. At least in these early hours with 1.0, I find myself somewhere in the middle of enamoured by its harsh edges and utterly disgusted by outdated design choices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, the intentionally punishing design is marred by completely unintentional issues that have made this full launch that much harder to enjoy. The servers so far have been incredibly unreliable, with regular disconnects and wait times greater than 15 minutes to get into a match, and cheaters are very prevalent since accounts and items can be sold for real money in the gray market. As a result, I decided to spend most of my time this first week just focusing on the PvE mode for the sake of my sanity. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also the matter of just how bad this thing looks and performs by the standards of the day. I remember thinking Escape from Tarkov already didn’t look great when I last revisited it, and coming back to it again a few years later has not done it any favors. Objects in the environment are blurry and low res, and with the exception of the vendors you’ll chat with as you complete quests, human faces look like they were modeled using the monster-generator that is The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion’s character creator. It’ll take me a while before I’ve played enough to call this review final, so hopefully developer Battlestate Games will smooth out the worst of these issues before they drive me insane, but it’s been an incredibly rocky start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, I should get back to it – between the PvE mode, PvP mode, and Arena, I’ve got plenty more to see and do before I can make a recommendation either way. For now, diving back into this influential, daunting game has been equal parts fascinating and irksome, but I’m looking forward to going as deep down the rabbit hole as I can.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Extraction Shooters</h3><p>For those who like risking it all on loot that's well worth it, these are your best bets.</p></div></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Get your garlic.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Poncle says its newly announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/vampire-crawlers-the-turbo-wildcard-from-vampire-survivors"><u>Vampire Crawlers</u></a> is more of a spinoff than a sequel, but it sounds like Vampire Survivors 2 may actually be in the works, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans had their eyebrows raised when the studio behind the hit monster-slaying video game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-survivors-is-getting-a-spin-off-and-its-totally-not-a-roguelike-deckbuilder-it-is"><u>announced Vampire Crawlers as its new game</u></a> during today’s Xbox Partner Preview. While the roguelike deck-builder might seem like a proper <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/vampire-survivors"><u>Vampire Survivors</u></a> sequel at first glance, Poncle says in a new <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/vampire-crawlers-xbox-partner-preview/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>interview with Xbox Wire</u></a>, this isn’t the case.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is just a spin-off of Vampire Survivors – hopefully the first in a series of spin-offs!” studio founder and CEO Luca Galante said. “The idea is to take some of the core pillars behind the development of VS and to apply them to existing genres. I’m talking about accessibility, immediacy, affordability, replayability, and sparkly stuff. Tons of sparkly stuff!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s no doubt an idea a wide range of Vampire Survivors fans will gravitate to, especially as Poncle teases what could be more than one spinoff. Alas, the lack of a 2 next to the title means Vampire Crawlers is planned to offer something different from the core experience, but fans hoping for a proper follow-up may not want to count out Vampire Survivors 2 just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With regards to a sequel to Vampire Survivors, we’re working on <em>something</em>, but we’re not talking about that just yet,” Galante adds.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Vampire Crawlers: The Turbo Wildcard from Vampire Survivors - Xbox Partner Preview Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's just one sentence of acknowledgement, but it’s still enough to confirm that Poncle has multiple ideas brewing when it comes to the future Vampire Survivors. Whether that lands a 2 next to the original title's name or results in something else entirely, we’ll have to wait and see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Vampire Crawlers seeks to bring the humor the series is known for together with a new gameplay loop. A trailer for the spinoff, which Galante says Poncle has been working on for around four years, reveals a switch to first-person gameplay with some dungeon-crawling to boot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vampire Survivors 2 could be years away.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/expedition-33-star-uses-award-speech-to-say-what-everyone%E2%80%99s-thinking.1360213/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s video game awards season, which has now become synonymous with the annual reminder that </span><i><span>Clair Obscur:</span></i> <i><span>Expedition 33 </span></i><span>star Ben Starr is an absolute gem. Not only is Starr once again being a total goofball for everyone else’s enjoyment, but he’s also using his voice to speak out against the industry’s inability to retain talent. Go off, anti-layoff king.</span></p> <p><span>Though he’s been an actor for a while, Starr catapulted to gamer fame after playing Clive Rosfield in 2023’s </span><i><span>Final Fantasy XVI</span></i><span> and </span><a href="https://x.com/The_Ben_Starr/status/1732968375423209538"><span>going viral during that year’s Game Awards</span></a><span>. He then became the face of 2024’s breakout card battler </span><i><span>Balatro</span></i><span>, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AamFDYUaMhM"><span>doing weird advertisements as Jimbo</span></a><span>, its Joker mascot, proving once and for all that he commits to a bit. This year, he’s been nominated for several year-end awards for his role as Verso in </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span>, and is back on his delicious bullshit.</span></p>

 <p><span>During the November 20 Golden Joystick Awards, the UK-based award ceremony that’s been around in some form since 1983, Starr walked up on-stage to present the award for Best Indie Game wearing a Golden Joystick-style </span><i><span>Balatro</span></i><span> card with a face hole cut out that placed him at the top of the trophy. “I am classically trained Golden Joystick-winning actor Ben Starr,” he said, standing there with just his face and legs showing behind the card. “Isn’t independence empowering? You can do whatever you want.” </span></p>

 <p><span>Watch the entire presentation <a href="https://x.com/GoldenJoysticks/status/1991548621012234573">here</a>, it’s worth it.</span></p> <p><span>But Starr wasn’t satisfied with being silly. When it was announced that he’d won Best Supporting Performer for Sandfall Interactive’s </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span>, he spoke about Verso as a character, about his flaws, and how they make him a polarizing figure. “I think that is what this industry does best,&nbsp; it presents us with flawed characters that reflect the lives we have on the outside,” Starr said. “‘Cause life, guys, as we know—and I’m gonna be the first one to swear—is fucking hard.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Starr also made sure to speak plainly about the video game industry’s deluge of layoffs over the last several years. “This industry is hard. We are celebrating today, astonishing video games, but there are many people who should be here who aren’t because they are laid off from the industry,” he began. (As he paused, someone in the audience shouted, “Well said, Ben.”) He continued:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Many people might criticize me for grandstanding right now, but the one thing that Sandfall do and have done is respect people that work for them. They respect the people that they are making games for, and they want to make them good. That is why this game is great, it’s because they wanted to make it good for the people they’re making it for. They didn’t want it to be popular. So they wrote characters that are flawed, they wrote characters that are broken, they wrote characters that, ultimately, you might hate. And I’m very very fortunate to potentially play one of them.</span></p></blockquote> <p><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span> won seven </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/events-conferences/golden-joystick-awards-2025-all-winners/"><span>Golden Joysticks</span></a><span> and set a record for the most nominations at this year’s Game Awards with 12. Let Ben Starr give every winning speech.</span></p>

<p>The 2025 holiday shopping season has already started for many, and Xbox is rolling out a wide range of discounts to help players grab some last-minute gifts. Whether you’re hunting for a new Xbox Series X or S console, fresh accessories, or deals on Game Pass subscriptions and the biggest games of the year, Microsoft has lined up plenty of savings for Black Friday and beyond.</p>



<p>So, what do you need to be on the lookout for, and what deals are actually worth jumping on directly from Xbox? Below, you’ll find the best Xbox Black Friday deals for 2025. If something catches your eye, leave your thoughts in the comments and join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider</a><a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Gaming Discord</a> to talk about what you’re picking up this year.</p>







<h2>When Do the Xbox Black Friday Deals Start?</h2>



<p>Xbox’s Black Friday deals began on <strong>November 20th</strong> and will run through <strong>December 3rd</strong> for most hardware and game discounts. </p>

<h3 id="h-xbox-series-x-s-console-deals">Xbox Series X|S Console Deals</h3>



<p>Unfortunately, if you are looking to pick up an Xbox Series X or S console this holiday season, you won’t find any luck getting a traditional discount from the official Microsoft store. All available systems are still their full retail price if you want one. The only way to save on a new console is by trading in an eligible system for up to $130 off the purchase of a new Xbox console. </p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-xbox-game-pass-deals">Xbox Game Pass Deals</h3>



<p>If you’re looking to finally join Xbox Game Pass, there really isn’t a discount on a long-term subscription, either. Instead, Xbox is offering 14 days for $1 either Xbox Game Pass Essential or Xbox Game Pass Premium. After that period ends, however, it will go up to $9.99 and $14.99 per month, respectively.</p>

Sadly, it won’t arrive in time for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/819996/fallouts-new-season-two-trailer-brings-the-war-to-new-vegas">season two</a> premiere of Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> series that starts on December 17th, 2025.</p><p>It’s not the first time Bethesda has offered a replica of the chunky wrist-worn computer, but an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/8/10/16125156/fallout-4-pipboy-release-date-price">earlier version</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/2/9655846/fallout-4-pip-boy-photo-gallery">bundled with a collector’s edition of <em>Fallout 4</em></a>, relied on a smartphone and an app to replicate its in-game functionality.

Bethesda says “almost all of the in-game content” accessible in both titles has been replicated including hundreds of menus that can be navigated with scroll wheels and dials, and you’ll even find a playable version of the <em>Atomic Command</em> minigame. The screen simulates the appearance of a vintage cathode-ray tube display with glitches and flickering effects that can be temporarily fixed by hitting the device, thanks to an accelerometer.</p><p>The replica’s front casing is made from die-cast metal while the body is injection-moulded plastic with a memory foam cuff that can be enlarged using an included spacer. Other functionality includes a flashlight, a headphone jack, an alarm clock mode that can be used alongside an included display stand, and a functional radiation detector. However, instead of measuring the dangerous fallout from a nuclear blast, the replica Pip-Boy 3000 measures the radiation of FM radio broadcasts using on-screen meters and the simulated sounds of a geiger counter.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/825283/bethesda-wand-company-fallout-3-new-vegas-pip-boy-3000-replica]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/return-to-silent-hill-2-new-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/return-to-silent-hill-gets-new-trailer-and-it%E2%80%99s-confusing.1360177/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Return to Silent Hill has a new trailer ahead of its January 23rd release in theaters. While an adaptation of Silent Hill 2, it certainly looks to be a loose and confusing one.</p>







<p>Director Christophe Gans, who did the original Silent Hill film in 2006, is back at the helm to do Return to Silent Hill. A teaser for the film <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/return-to-silent-hill-teaser-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came out in August</a>, and it was certainly a first look. Lots of shots compiled into one trailer, and it was confusing to figure out just what was going on. While the new official trailer does clear things up, it does make fans of the original Silent Hill 2 quite confused.</p>



<h2 id="h-return-to-silent-hill-official-trailer-released-features-iconic-characters">Return to Silent Hill Official Trailer Released, Features Iconic Characters </h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="RETURN TO SILENT HILL | Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z_oNLLln8aE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The new trailer, <a href="https://youtu.be/z_oNLLln8aE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">seen above</a>, shows off a lot more footage of Return to Silent Hill than we’ve seen so far. In it, the film brings several characters from Silent Hill 2, like Angela, Eddie, and Laura. Their scenes look fairly similar to those in the game, but the rest is a bit confusing. It seems to be a loose adaptation, as some scenes look new, like the burning hospital and pre-Silent Hill 2 town scenes. It doesn’t scream Silent Hill 2 as it does a typical horror flick.</p>



<p>For many fans, the Return to Silent Hill trailer isn’t the Silent Hill 2 news they wanted to see today. Silent Hill 2 Remake was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-switch-2-xbox-rumor-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supposedly being announced today</a> at the Xbox Partner Preview, but it was a no-show. Unfortunately, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-achievements-go-live-full-announcement-imminent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achievements</a> and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-already-for-sale-on-australian-xbox-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Australia’s Xbox Store listing</a> have been found, meaning an announcement is imminent. In any case, at least the remake can act as a palate cleanser before the film arrives on January 23rd, 2026.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/microsoft-makes-zork-i-ii-and-iii-open-source-under-mit-license/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p><em>Zork</em>, the classic text-based adventure game of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/from-infocom-to-80-days-an-oral-history-of-text-games-and-interactive-fiction/">incalculable influence</a>, has been <a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork1">made available</a> under the MIT License, along with the sequels <em>Zork II</em> and <em>Zork III</em>.</p>
<p>The move to take these <em>Zork</em> games open source comes as the result of the shared work of the Xbox and Activision teams along with Microsoft’s Open Source Programs Office (OSPO). Parent company Microsoft owns the intellectual property for the franchise.</p>
<p>Only the code itself has been made open source. Ancillary items like commercial packaging and marketing assets and materials remain proprietary, as do related trademarks and brands.</p>
<p>“Rather than creating new repositories, we’re contributing directly to history. In collaboration with Jason Scott, the well-known digital archivist of Internet Archive fame, we have officially submitted upstream pull requests to the historical source repositories of <em>Zork I</em>, <em>Zork II</em>, and <em>Zork III</em>. Those pull requests add a clear MIT LICENSE and formally document the open-source grant,” says the announcement co-written by Stacy Haffner (director of the OSPO at Microsoft) and Scott Hanselman (VP of Developer Community at the company).</p>
<p>Microsoft gained control of the <em>Zork</em> IP when it acquired Activision in 2022; Activision had come to own it when it acquired original publisher Infocom in the late ’80s. There was an attempt to sell <em>Zork</em> publishing rights directly to Microsoft even earlier in the ’80s, as founder Bill Gates was a big <em>Zork</em> fan, but it fell through, so it’s funny that it eventually ended up in the same place.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is not the first time the original <em>Zork</em> source code has been available to the general public. Scott <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/you-can-now-download-the-source-code-for-all-infocom-text-adventure-classics/">uploaded it</a> to GitHub in 2019, but the license situation was unresolved, and Activision or Microsoft could have issued a takedown request had they wished to.</p>
<p>Now that’s obviously not at risk of happening anymore.</p>

<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>Okay, is the vampire in *this* coffin?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> is the gift that keeps on giving. We've had a countless amount of free updates, expansive paid DLCs, and so much content that it's so easy to lose hundreds of hours to. So, how's about a completely new game?</p>
<p>Yep, Poncle is spreading its wings and today announced a spin-off to Vampire Survivors, called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_crawlers_the_turbo_wildcard_from_vampire_survivors">Vampire Crawlers: The Turbo Wildcard from Vampire Survivors</a> (we'll stick to Vampire Crawlers...) coming to Switch in 2026. The tongue-in-cheek trailer above tells you it isn't a roguelite deckbuilder, but it is in fact a roguelite deckbuilding dungeon crawler. <em>Fancy that</em>.</p>
<p>But, in true Vampire Survivors fashion, it's absolutely nuts. Essentially, as Poncle founder Luca Galante puts it on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/vampire-crawlers-xbox-partner-preview/">Xbox Wire</a>, Vampire Crawlers is "about mowing down hordes of enemies using cards, while you explore dungeons, playing as slowly or as fast as you prefer."</p>
<p>Galante also compares the game to a "blobber", a type of first-person RPG popular in the '80s that often used giant on-screen buttons; instead of the buttons, Crawlers uses cards.</p>
<p>Here's a brief little rundown from the game's Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is Vampire Crawlers about</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Snowballing, turn‑based carnage</strong>: Play cards in ascending mana order to land combos; each step multiplies the next card’s effect. Use Wilds to extend the stack and keep going to 10, 20, 30… Can you reach infinite?</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Pick your pace</strong>: Either take your time and be tactical, or play turns as fast as you humanly can: the outcome is always accurate!</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Deck-Building</strong>: Accumulate experience and level up to gain new cards, headbutt chests for customization gems and power‑ups; chase weapon evolutions and summon survivors to trigger cascade of effects and break the game.</p>
<p><strong>- Dungeon Crawling</strong>: Explore dungeons packed with something seldom seen in Vampire Survivors: functioning walls. And then all sorts of unique treasures and interactions. Find the shovel to dig into the next floor, that will most likely take place in the clouds!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don't worry, this isn't a direct sequel, and Vampire Survivors will still be a thing going forward. But Galante does mention something interesting: "With regards to a sequel to <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, we’re working on <em>something</em>, but we’re not talking about that just yet."</p>
<p>Stay tuned, then...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ho, ho, ho! Happy holidays! Everyone is getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a>‘s first DLC for free because the game needed so much post-launch fixing that Gearbox couldn’t finish the DLC in time, and will make it up to fans who paid for the pack with extra DLC next year.</p> <p>When <a href="https://kotaku.com/12-tips-borderlands-4-guide-help-better-loot-gold-keys-side-quests-tricks-2000626554"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launched in September, it received praise for its open world, improved gunplay, and better-than-ever co-op gameplay. I really liked it! <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">But performance issues and bugs</a> on PC and console derailed some of the excitement, leading to Gearbox having to spend a lot of time fixing, improving, and updating the co-op-focused online looter shooter. In fact, according to Gearbox and 2K, the team spent so much time fixing stuff in <em>Borderlands 4</em> that it screwed up the original roadmap.</p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/GearboxOfficial/status/1991545250532208879">On November 20, Gearbox announced</a> that <em>Borderlands 4′</em>s first post-launch DLC, Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/borderlandsr-4-bounty-pack-1-how-rush-saved-mercenary-day-releases-today-for-borderlandsr-4-players-for-free">will no longer be locked behind a paywall</a>. Previously, the plan was for <em>Borderlands 4</em> to get four smaller DLC drops, known as Bounty Packs, and you’d only have access to this new content if you had purchased the Deluxe Edition or Super Deluxe Edition, or had separately bought the Bounty Pack Bundle.&nbsp; However, things have changed as Gearbox was unable to include as much content as planned in the first DLC due to having to update <em>Borderlands 4</em> so much, as explained in a press release.</p>

 <p>“However, with the continued efforts to improve the <em>Borderlands 4</em> experience, the team ran out of time to stuff as much mayhem-fueled content into the Bounty Pack 1 stocking as originally planned,” explained 2K and Gearbox. “So in the spirit of the season, and as a thank you to the community for their passion and support, 2K and Gearbox are excited to provide Bounty Pack 1…to all <em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>players for free!”</p>

 <h2>What’s included in <em>Borderlands 4′</em>s first DLC?</h2>  <p>In the new DLC, How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, <em>Borderlands 4</em> rebel leader Rush faces off against a new enemy, the miserly Minister Screw. This doofus is in charge of making sure people don’t celebrate the holidays and have fun. So across a series of new missions that make up a new questline, players will celebrate the holidays in defiance and take on Screw.</p>

 <p>Bounty Pack 1 includes a new Vault Card with fresh rewards, 24 new cosmetic items, and new weapons, too. It looks like parts of the map will become Christmas-themed, too, complete with gifts and snow. To start the new DLC, just update your game and head to any major hub in <em>Borderlands 4.</em> There you’ll find a large gift-wrapped present marked on your map, which can be interacted with to start the holiday fun.</p>

 <p>Keep in mind that Bounty Packs are smaller bits of paid content, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pearls-roadmap-takedown-dlc-free-update-2000621708"><em>Borderlands 4</em> will also get two proper, much larger expansions as well as new playable characters next year, too</a>.</p> <p>Also arriving on Thursday <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">is a big new gameplay update for <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> that makes a lot of changes to the looter shooter. Perhaps the most exciting is that Wildcard Missions, which make up the bulk of the FPS’s endgame content, will no longer force you to play through the entirety of missions. Previously Wildcard Missions, which are just normal missions you replay with variables, forced you to sit through all the content, even if it was all tutorial crap. Gearbox is now promising new start points to drop players into the action sooner. And that sounds like a real holiday treat that will make grinding for loot in <em>Borderlands 4</em> a lot more enjoyable and less annoying.</p>

In his latest album, “The Death of Slim Shady,” the rapper attempted to put his other self away, but now Eminem recruits the legendary assassin Agent 47 to put his past away permanently. In a surreal new mission crafted by Eminem in collaboration with IO Interactive and creative director / producer Paul Rosenberg, the level is packed with dreamlike twists that mirror Slim Shady’s unhinged reality. Operatives find themselves in a medical facility in Hokkaido that has been twisted into the Popsomp Hills Asylum. Agent 47 will have to track Slim Shady across multiple areas, such as his broadcasting studio, to take him out without being detected. There are abundant Eminem references in the mission from throughout the rapper’s discography, such as a poisoned plate of the iconic Mom’s Spaghetti and a performance of “Houdini.”</p><p><strong>The Season of Eminem vs. Slim Shady: Live Updates, Free for <em>HITMAN World of Assassination</em>&nbsp;Players</strong></p><p>A new roadmap will start with the Season of Eminem vs. Slim Shady set to bring new content to players, in addition to the new Elusive Target. Players will be able to face two new challenges, two new Featured Contracts batches, as well as three returning Elusive Targets, including The Splitter featuring Jean-Claude Van Damme, and two returning events: Holiday Hoarders and Hokkaido Snow Festival. Two new Twitch Drops will be available to redeem, with the Bomb-Ass Dynamite, and the Solstice Suit, which can be earned by watching thirty minutes of <em>HITMAN World of Assassination</em> on Twitch during specific time periods.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

<p>Update: Here's a new trailer</p>
</section></header><section>
<p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-11-20T20:30:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Thu 20th Nov 2025, 8:30pm</time>]:</strong> Things have been a little quiet on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dave_the_diver">Dave The Diver</a> DLC front. Well, during today's Xbox Showcase, we got a fresh new look at the upcoming content update, along with a new early 2026 release window.</p>
<p>Announced during The Game Awards last year and originally due to launch in 2025, <strong>In The Jungle</strong> takes Dave away from the Blue Hole and onto dry land.</p>
<p>The jungle gives Dave a bunch of new creatures to catch and ingredients to work with in his sushi restaurant. You get a brief look at what to expect from the DLC at the <a href="https://youtu.be/PFbcVdZRKwE?si=J59eXQrcmR4B6Pe9&amp;t=34">34 second mark</a> in the trailer up top, but we've also got a few new screenshots, too.</p>
<p>For more details, check out our original story from last year below. And hey, don't forget about that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dave-the-diver-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, which will be getting a physical version in early 2026 courtesy of Silver Lining Direct.</p>

<hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> <strong>Fri 13th Dec, 2024 11:45 GMT</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dave_the_diver">Dave The Diver</a> has quickly become one of the most bankable titles for an appearance at <em>each and every game showcase</em> since it arrived on PC and console last year, and The Game Awards was no exception.</p>
<p>Developer MINTROCKET popped up at this year's Geoff-fest to reveal the upcoming '<strong>In the Jungle</strong>' DLC, an expansion that will see Dave and co. leave the Blue Hole and set out into greener pastures (literally) to search for their next catch.</p>
<p>We don't have all that much information on what the DLC entails for the time being, though the swanky cinematic trailer did give us a release window of "<strong>Late 2025</strong>", so that's something to look forward to next year — dare we say on 'Switch 2'?</p>
<p>This comes after a stellar year of Dave the Diver content drops, including a whole host of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/dave-the-divers-latest-crossover-update-arrives-today-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">crossovers</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/03/dave-the-diver-catches-new-minigame-in-latest-update-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">new minigames</a> and... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/05/free-godzilla-dlc-storms-into-dave-the-diver-next-week-on-switch">Godzilla</a>? Damn, what a game.</p>
