		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/saber-interactive/">Saber Interactive</a> and Boss Team Games are bringing an iconic horror franchise back to life&nbsp; with Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival, a single-player survival horror action game set in the flesh-ripping world of Hellraiser.&nbsp; They’ve also managed to persuade actor Doug Bradley to return to the role of Pinhead for the first time in nearly two decades.</p>
<p>Hellraiser, or at least the books and the first movie, have always leaned heavily into sex and BDSM where pain also means pleasure, and judging by the trailer Boss Team Games have kept that element as it begins with a very intimate scene.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E_4kAp6gsZE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The fact that the game looks so authentic may have something to do with Clive Barker himself being onboard for Hellraiser: Revival.</p>
<p>“Working on the first true Hellraiser game has been a venture deep into the recesses of my darkest imaginings,” said Barker. “The dedication that Saber and Boss Team Games have shown is nothing short of remarkable. They’ve immersed themselves in the Hellraiser universe, capturing its essence—the seductive pull of suffering, the beauty within the grotesque—and forged a narrative that invites players to step beyond the threshold. I’m eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the Hellraiser mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation.”</p>

<p>Hellraiser: Revival follows Aiden who must unlock the dark powers of the Genesis Configuration puzzle box and save his girlfriend from the clutches of Pinhead himself. The puzzle box is not just the McGuffin for the game, you can use it to unleash hellish powers while you battle the Cenobites.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-tease-horror-game-hellraiser/">Last week,</a> Saber Interactive teased a new horror game that was set to be revealed this morning, and almost immediately, players picked up on it potentially being a Hellraiser game. Well, today we found out that those suspicions were correct, as Saber Interactive and Boss Team Games announced a survival horror Hellraiser game, called Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival.</p>



<p>In an<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/22/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival/"> Xbox Wire</a> post, executive producer on Hellraiser: Revival, Nenad Tomic, describes the game as "<em>single-player, survival horror action game</em>," and as a "<em>story-driven</em>" game where players will step into the role of Aidan. As the trailer teases at the start, when a mysterious puzzle box, the Genesis Configuration, pulls his girlfriend Sunny into the hands of Pinhead, it's Aidan's job to save her, using the box to pull her out of the Labyrinth and bring her home. Presumably so they can continue where they're interrupted in the trailer.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Clive Barker, who fans will recognize as the writer behind The Hellbound Heart, the book that he eventually adapted to the first Hellraiser film, has "<em>been deeply involved with the game from the very beginning</em>," according to Tomic, as Barker has been helping guide Saber's hand "<em>from the visual style and story motifs to the lore and the character personalities, his creative input has ensured that the game remains authentic to the spirit of Hellraiser</em>."</p>



<p>In a press release for the game's reveal, Barker added, "<em>Working on the first true Hellraiser game has been a venture deep into the recesses of my darkest imaginings. The dedication that Saber and Boss Team Games have shown is nothing short of remarkable. They've immersed themselves in the Hellraiser universe, capturing its essence - the seductive pull of suffering, the beauty within the grotesque - and forged a narrative that invites players to step beyond the threshold. I'm eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the Hellraiser mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation</em>."</p>



<p>Regarding Hellraiser lore, Tomic continues that this game borrows from the first two Hellraiser films, but is a new story in the world of Hellraiser, and does not have a direct narrative connection to the films. Fans of the series will however recognize elements of the Hellraiser world, including of course the Genesis Configuration, and the Cenobites.</p>

<p>While Tomic stops short of saying when Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival will be out on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, he does say that "<em>it's closer than you think</em>," and adds that more of the game will be shown later this year. Which means we could be looking at a late-2025 release, and since it's a horror game, there's always the possibility that it is aiming to be out sometime in October. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nvidia-releases-geforce-driver-optimized-for-wuchang-fallen-feathers-killing-floor-3-both-with-dlss-4-mfg/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 577.00) optimized for <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers</a> and Killing Floor 3. Both PC games are scheduled to launch on July 24.</p>



<p>The first one, developed by Leenzee and published by 505 Games, is a soulslike action roleplaying game set in the land of Shu during a fantasy rendition of the late Ming dynasty (seventeenth century). In WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers, the land is plagued by warring factions and a mysterious illness that spawns monstrous creatures. Players take the role of the titular Wuchang, a skilled pirate warrior afflicted with amnesia and the aforementioned horrific Feathering disease, who must navigate the uncertainties of her mysterious past. </p>



<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers features day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, and NVIDIA Reflex. According to NVIDIA, at 4K resolution and max settings, DLSS can boost performance by an average of 5.9X on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, which can enable all of those technologies. More specifically, the RTX 5090 averages 312 frames per second, the RTX 5080 211 FPS, and the RTX 5070 Ti 185 FPS. Stay tuned on Wccftech to read our full review of this new Soulslike game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>On the same day, Tripwire Interactive is releasing <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-optimizes-the-first-descendant-nvidia-dlss-3-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killing Floor 3</a>, the latest chapter in the cooperative zombie-killing shooter series. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the game allows GeForce RTX owners to accelerate performance by activating NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution. Those with high enough frame rates can ditch the latter for improved image quality with DLAA. Of course, NVIDIA Reflex is also available to improve responsiveness.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dlss-191-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>Another Unreal Engine 5 game, the free-to-play cooperative third-person shooter The First Descendant, is receiving an update on July 24 to support NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-optimizes-the-first-descendant-nvidia-dlss-3-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already supported</a> Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, DLAA, Reflex, and several ray traced effects.</p>



<p>Today marks the debut of <a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-qa-were-definitely-thinking-about-joining-game-pass-ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wildgate</a>, Moonshot Games and Dreamhaven's player-versus-player shooter game, which features built-in support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution with the latest transformer model. Lastly, next week Riot Games will upgrade Valorant to Unreal Engine 5, retaining the existing support for NVIDIA Reflex.</p>

<p>Over in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Masters EX</em>, you can look forward to battling Carmine and Sinistcha, and you can log in now to get a 3,000-gem gift.&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Cafe Remix</em>, meanwhile, is getting a very cute Lapras sea captain outfit, which is coming tomorrow.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Sleep</em>, the legendary dog trio from Gen II will be added to the game, so you can look forward to researching Raikou, Entei, and Suicune in September. A new area is also coming to the game in November.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Unite</em>'s fourth anniversary is bringing Latios and Latias into the fray, and Pawmi, Pawmo, and Pawmot are also set to make an appearance in the game soon.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Friends&nbsp;</em>is a cute mobile puzzler</h2>

It's a puzzle game that sees you connecting various things, like tracks, bulbs, or ice paths, to help little critters reach their goals.</p>

<p>You'll gain plushes for solving puzzles, and you can use them to decorate in-game plush rooms. The game is coming to Switch, Android, and iOS later today.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>are getting new Tera Raid Battle Events</h2>

<p>Shiny versions of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</em>'s Ruinous Quartet are coming starting from tomorrow. You can add them to your team, but each Pokemon will need to be defeated a million times (in total, not just by you) to get them.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Champions&nbsp;</em>gets more info</h2>

<p>Next up, we got to learn more about&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Champions</em>, an upcoming battler that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-february-2025-all-reveals-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">revealed back in February</a>. The game is planned for release in 2026 on Switch and mobile devices, and it looks like a fun way to enjoy&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>battling.</p>

<h2>New&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>info revealed</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-dragonite-pokemon-presents-july-2025.jpg?itok=lKEupujN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-dragonite-pokemon-presents-july-2025.jpg?itok=IONpUK-a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look at its little wings! D'awww.</figcaption></figure><p>The last thing we got to see as part of today's presentation was a new look at&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">planned for release in October</a>. Sorry, hopeful&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>fans; doesn't look like you're getting a Gen 10 reveal today.</p>

<p>The new trailer revealed Team MZ, an organization devoted to protecting Lumiose, where the game takes place. The game's day-night cycle was also revealed; you'll explore and catch Pokemon by day, then take part in the Z-A Royale tournament event by night.</p>

<p>This game's villainous team is the Rust Syndicate, headed up by the rather sinister-looking Corbeau. He's got "some kind of business with the members of Team MZ", but you'll have to play the game to find out what that is.</p>

<p>We got a look at a Mega Evolution for Dragonite as well, which is pretty cute. It's got Dragonair-like adornments on its head and tail, and it was shown off as part of a new storyline in the game that involves Pokemon Mega Evolving by themselves.</p>

<hr><p>That's all for today! Join us again whenever the next Pokemon Presents airs, and we'll do it all again!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive spent the last week teasing a big announcement, and now it’s finally been revealed: <em>Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival</em>. The first proper, single-player adaptation of the famous horror franchise showcases the return of Pinhead actor Doug Bradley and includes a red-band version of the trailer you won’t find on YouTube.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Discover the tale of Aidan, who must unlock the dark powers of the Genesis Configuration, a mysterious puzzle box, to save his girlfriend from a hellish abyss,” reads the official description for <em>Hellraiser</em>. “Playing as Aidan, you will harness the box’s infernal abilities in order to survive your pact with the sinister Pinhead and battle against the twisted cult that worships him and his Cenobites. Fail, and your suffering will become a legend, even in Hell.”</p><p>Horror makes me queasy, and I’ve never been able to sit through an entire <em>Hellraiser</em> movie before. So, it didn’t take much for the game’s first official trailer to gross me out. But the real <em>Hellraiser: Revival</em> trailer is actually only hosted on the game’s website. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://hellraisergame.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://hellraisergame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It does not hold back</a></span>. I can’t embed that one, though, so here’s the YouTube version:</p><p>It shows Aiden and his unnamed girlfriend having sex before she solves the puzzle box, summons the Cenobites, and is subsequently ripped apart by chains as the extra-dimensional, sadomasochistic cult is wont to do. Taking the women in refrigerators trope to new hellish depths, we then get a quick sizzle reel of Aiden using melee weapons to beat the crap out of various monstrosities. No release date was teased, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. </p><p> Saber Interactive is making <em>Hellraiser: Revival </em>with Boss Team Games, who it previously collaborated with for<em> Evil Dead: The Game</em>. However, that adaptation, which featured the return of Bruce Campbell but faced mixed reviews over its lack of content, was primarily an asymmetric multiplayer game. <em>Hellraiser: Revival</em> looking like a traditional first-person action adventure should be a lot more reassuring to fans who want another story in that universe rather than another knock-off of<em> Dead by Daylight</em>. </p><p>Saber Interactive confirms this is a brand-new Hellraiser story within the established canon. The most recent film was the 2022 reboot directed by David Bruckner. While no sequel has been announced, one is reportedly in the works. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hellraiser-pinhead-doug-bradley-red-band-trailer-saber-1851786676]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Billionaire video game industry veteran Gabe Newell, the founder of Valve, has shared his thoughts on the role that artificial intelligence could play in the future of technology.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPFctkKv6RM&amp;t=1s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to Zalkar Saliev</a> (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/gabe-newell-says-ai-is-a-significant-technology-transition-on-a-par-with-the-emergence-of-computers-or-the-internet-and-will-be-a-cheat-code-for-people-who-want-to-take-advantage-of-it/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via PC Gamer</a>) from his yacht, Newell said he thinks it's "incredibly obvious" that machine learning and AI systems are going to "profoundly impact pretty much every single business." He said we could be looking at a huge technology transition on par with the arrival of the computer and the internet.</p><p>"So if I had to point to a technology transition to get in front of, it's to figure out how to use AI to do anything better. If you wanna be an accountant, learn AI, if you want to be an attorney, learn AI, if you're gonna be a programmer, you know, make sure that you know how to use the tools that are comfortable with those programming concepts. That all seems super obvious," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPFctkKv6RM" data-width="854" data-height="480" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IPFctkKv6RM?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Newell went on to say that people who reacted quickly when the internet came online years ago reaped the benefits of embracing the new technology, and something similar could happen with AI.</p><p>"On the internet there were the companies and individuals who saw the opportunity and took advantage of those opportunities to create more value either as an individual or as a corporation and they zoomed ahead of everybody else," Newell said. "So essentially AI is going to be a cheat code for people who want to take advantage of it."</p><p>That Newell is a big believer in AI is not a surprise. After all, he is a <a href="https://starfishneuroscience.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">co-founder of Starfish</a>, a neural network company similar to Elon Musk's Neuralink, and Starfish uses AI systems to fuel its research.</p><p>AI has been a major player in the world of technology and video games for some time already, but its expansion seems to be accelerating in part through evolutions of the technology, including generative AI. Nvidia, which supplies some of the hardware used to propel AI advancements, is reaping the benefits of late, recently becoming the <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">most valuable company in the world with more than $4 trillion in market cap.</a></p><p>Exactly how advancements to AI might impact jobs in gaming, and all sectors, remains to be seen, but some have expressed fear about job losses. In fact, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">job losses due to AI are coming</a>, but overall hiring will increase due to the number of new jobs created.</p><p>In related news, the video game voice actor strike recently ended, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-actor-strike-ends-today/1100-6532363/" data-ref-id="1100-6532363">one of the major sticking points being protections against AI. </a></p>

            <p>Last year, The Pokémon Company announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-pokemon-project-in-the-works-with-wallace-and-gromit-maker-aardman">teaming up with Wallace and Gromit maker Aardman for a "special project"</a> and now, thanks to this afternoon's Pokémon Presents broadcast, we have our first peek at the adorably British looking stop-motion animation series.</p>
<p>"We'll be putting some very special Pokémon front and centre, as the heroes of our show," Aardman's creative director Peter Lord said today, "and it will be set in a region that is very close to our hearts. It will give a unique look at the Pokémon world, told from the perspective of Pokémon with the signature sense of Aardman character and comedy and craft."</p>
<p>Lord's words certainly seem to ring true when you watch the first teaser for what is now officially known as Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch'd and Pichu, which along with those two cheeky blighters causing all sorts of chaos in the background also stars a very unphased Wooloo nonchalantly munching on grass and - eventually - a baked apple. You can check out the first teaser for Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch'd and Pichu below.</p>

<p>Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch'd and Pichu is scheduled for release in 2027. Will you be tuning in? I think it looks rather adorable (plus, I am a fan of Wallace and Gromit). </p>

            <p>Pokémon Friends has just been announced at today's Pokémon Presents event. It's a game focused on puzzle solving and plushie collecting, and it's out right now <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000102053">on the Nintendo e-shop</a>.
</p>
<p>The gameplay centres around you solving three randomly generated puzzles in order to collect some special yarn. This yarn can then be taken to the Plush-O-Matic machine. This will then create a cute Pokémon plush, which you can display in an in-game plush room.
</p>
<p>The game also allows you to track all the plushes you collect, and mark each day you log in! All in all, it appears to be a cute little daily puzzle game, aimed to giving you a short burst of brain activity every day.

<p>Announced earlier this year, 22nd July marks the second <strong>Pokémon Presents</strong> of 2025. While you're all jamming along to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsskPQsZRaE&amp;ab_channel=TheOfficialPok%C3%A9monYouTubechannel">DJ-ing Pikachu</a> out there, what do we think we're going to see today?</p>
<p>The stream kicks off at <strong>6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm GMT / 3pm CET / 12am AET (Wednesday)</strong> and looks to be roughly around 25 minutes.</p>
<p>We're sure <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is going to show up, and the usual slate of mobile updates will be coming, but we hope to hear more about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_champions">Pokémon Champions</a>, and perhaps that pair of Pokémon GameCube games on Nintendo Switch 2's NSO service.</p>
<p>Well, no matter what's on the horizon, trainers can gather here and talk about everything we're about to see. We'll be bringing all of the news to you, so we might not be around for the chatter here.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hellraiser-revival-announced</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive and Boss Team Games have announced&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser: Revival</em>, the first ever dedicated video game based on Clive Barker's immensely popular horror franchise.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser: Revival&nbsp;</em>will take the form of a first-person, single-player survival horror game. You'll play as a new protagonist by the name of Aidan, who must rescue his girlfriend from Hell. Now that's a nostalgic plot setup, eh?</p>

<p>Saber's Tim Willits reveals more in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/22/announcing-clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival-horror-that-doesnt-hold-back/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>&nbsp;accompanying the new trailer. In the post, Willits confirms that both melee and ranged weaponry will be available in&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser: Revival</em>, and that the development team consulted with Clive Barker himself to make sure the game is "authentic" to the original<em>&nbsp;</em>novels and movies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hellraiser-revival-club.jpg?itok=1AVTLOIt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hellraiser-revival-club.jpg?itok=CGqRC_M5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hellraiser: Revival&nbsp;</em>is the property's first dedicated video game.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, Aidan will also have access to "the dark powers of the Genesis Configuration" to help him navigate Hell and save his girlfriend. You'll be harnessing the box's "infernal abilities" to avoid the wrath of the iconic Pinhead.</p>

<p>Said character will be played by original actor Doug Bradley, who Saber says is "returning to the role for the first time in nearly two decades". I don't think that's accurate, though; Bradley provided his voice for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-hellraiser-update-arrives-on-test-servers" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s Pinhead Killer</a> back in 2022.</p>

<p>In any case, as revealed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-ever-hellraiser-game-announced-with-doug-bradley-returning-as-pinhead" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, Barker himself seems enthusiastic about&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser: Revival</em>. He says the game captures the "essence" of the property, namely "the seductive pull of suffering" and "the beauty within the grotesque", so if you're a&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser&nbsp;</em>fan, it sounds like you'll be well-served by the game.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser: Revival</em>, which shows off a little bit of gameplay as well as the aesthetic of the game, right here.</p>




<p>We don't yet have a release window for&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser: Revival</em>, but when it launches, it's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1551980/Clive_Barkers_Hellraiser_Revival/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10012313/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/Clive-Barkers-Hellraiser-Revival/9NSWRGZBQ2MC" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

        <p>Revolving around the nature of Stop Killing Games YouTuber Ross Scott's involvment</p>

    </div>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The Stop Destroying Videogames citizens' initiative, the EU petition that's part of the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign, has had an anonymous transparency complaint filed against it.</p>
<p>That's according to Ross Scott, the YouTuber who's become the figurehead of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake">Stop Killing Games</a>, which in case you're out of the loop aims to stop publishers rendering online games unplayable when official support ends. Instead, the movement wants companies to be required to put concrete end-of-life plans in place if they elect to do things like turn servers off.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a video posted to his channel Accursed Farms, Scott said that the Stop Destroying Videogames EU initiative has had an <a href="https://mega.nz/file/W3YTHCqQ#i-D2f_fgILqBILJiavLwX-eh3pUPGnYeaQfdadiFH20">anonymous transparency complaint</a> relayed to it by the European Commission. As the YouTuber makes clear here, this initiative - which is listed as having amassed 1.4 million signatures thus far - has different organisers to the wider Stop Killing Games campaign Scott's become the public face of, despite the latter frequently promoting the former. And, you know, their names being very similar.</p>
<p>The complaint document, which Scott linked in the video's description, accuses the Stop Destroying Videogames initiative of violating the rules for such calls on the European Commission to consider introducing new laws in two ways. It alleges that the initiative's organisers have provided a "false 'no funding' declaration" by leaving the sources of funding section of its <a href="https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000007">listing on the EU site</a> blank, and that there's been "systematic concealment" of major contributions to the campaign.</p>
<p>Both look to hinge on one thing: the nature of Ross Scott's involvement with the initiative. The complaint alleges that the sorts of hours Scott says he's often dedicated to the campaign "far [exceed] any reasonable volunteer threshold". So, the complaint argues that since "professional time investment constitutes quantifiable in-kind contribution under transparency regulations", Scott's involvement  is equal to professional contributions it values at being worth €63,000-147,000.</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQN_ZA5WRpo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>So, to put a bow on things, the complaint's argument is that this sum, which Scott says he very much hasn't been paid because he's been volunteering, should have been declared by the initiative. The complaint also cites Scott frequently being identified as being responsible for or in charge of the EU initiative to back up this claim, to which the YouTuber responded by pointing out that he's not listed among the organisers on the initiative's page and has "no actual authority" over it.</p>
<p>In the video, Scott speculates that this complaint represents "someone...trying to kill the initiative" and implies that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-only-games-prohibitively-expensive-to-create-argue-eu-lobby-group">recent responses to the initiative</a> lead him to think it may be connected to some sort of games industry representative. There's currently no concrete evidence for the latter, given that as the YouTuber says the version of the complaint that's been passed on is anonymous, as is standard protocol with EU transparency complaints. In order to <a href="https://transparency-register.europa.eu/complaint">submit one</a>, you've got to provide details about who you are to the EU, but the body will then "not reveal your identity publicly" unless you ask them to.</p>
<p>Also, when it comes to Scott's fears about this potentially having serious repercussions for the initiative, it's worth noting that <a href="https://transparency-register.europa.eu/faqs-and-contact_en#code-of-conduct-and-complaints">the EU site</a> says the following with regards to what happens to groups who have complaints submitted against their initiatives:</p>
<blockquote><p>If we consider the complaint to be admissible, we will ensure that you receive a copy of the complaint and ask you to provide a reasoned response by a certain deadline.</p>
<p>We may ask you to provide additional information and will treat any information that you indicate to be considered sensitive as confidential. You will be given all possibility to be sufficiently heard before any decision is taken. We expect you to cooperate sincerely and constructively throughout the investigation.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, no talk of any immediate existential threats to the initiative prior to the claims made being thoroughly investigated. Assuming that Scott is being transparent in his arguments above, it seems that the initiative has nothing to worry about from this.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/campaign-asking-eu-to-stop-publishers-destroying-online-games-hit-by-anonymous-transparency-complaint]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Moon Studios, the developer behind the Ori games, will focus on PS5 over Xbox for its forthcoming game No Rest for the Wicked due to "current market conditions".</p>
<p>No Rest for the Wicked is currently in early access on PC, with a console release due in future. But on the <a href="https://x.com/delmontyb/status/1947313884584398874">game's Discord</a>, studio CEO Thomas Mahler stated: "given current market conditions, we might only release on PS5 and potentially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> for the time being - we'll have to discuss things with MS to see what makes sense for Xbox."</p>
<p>It's quite the turnaround, considering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ori-and-the-blind-forest">Ori and the Blind Forest</a> (and its sequel) was first released on Xbox with Microsoft as publisher.</p>

<p>Responding to a further comment on social media, Mahler walked back his statement slightly.</p>
<p>"There's nothing to officially confirm yet," he said. "We want to support consoles and just looking at the numbers, PS5 makes the most sense at the moment. Ultimately we'll ship on all platforms, but likely not at the same time!"</p> <div>

<p>Over on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/no-rest-for-the-wicked-may-be-skipping-xbox-due-to-market-conditions-update-dev-reply-added-to-op.1686511/">NeoGAF forum</a>, Mahler provided a further response that this wasn't a "shakedown" of Microsoft but "common f*cking sense".</p>
<p>"Folks, can we drop the conspiracy theory insanity?" he began, adding that co-op and console support are what the community want the most.</p>
<p>"And in order to get there fast, we'll first support the platform that has the most users purely out of resource reasons," he continued. "We're a comparatively small indie studio, so doing a console port at the quality level we want is not a small task. Porting to Xbox means porting to Xbox Series X and Series S and that'll take more time to optimise compared to porting to PS5 and PS5Pro. So we're most likely going to do PS5/PS5Pro first and launch there in order to make fans happy and supply other ports later.</p>
<p>"That's literally all there is to it. And yes, we'll need to discuss with Xbox and Nintendo what the best strategies are to support their platforms and their features in the best way possible and that'll be an ongoing discussion."</p>
<p>No Rest for the Wicked gets off to a "shaky start", according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-review-a-shaky-start-but-theres-potential">our review of the early access release</a> in April 2024. However the game has received multiple updates since then and sits with a Mostly Positive rating on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1371980/No_Rest_for_the_Wicked/">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Back in March, Moon Studios secured the publishing rights to the game from Take-Two and announced it was a fully independent studio.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ori-studios-focus-on-ps5-over-xbox-for-next-game-isnt-a-shakedown-but-common-fcking-sense-says-ceo]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-webster">Andrew Webster</a> <span>is an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The developers at Boss Team Games have such sights to show you: the studio just announced that it’s taking the terrifying world of the classic <em>Hellraiser</em> films and turning it into a survival horror game. The new title is called <em>Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival</em>, and somehow it’s the first gaming adaptation of the franchise, which has been around since 1987.</p><p>According to the studio, the game will blend “survival horror with a single-player, story-driven action experience.” And, yes, there will be a dark and mysterious puzzle box. There are also some notable names on board. Doug Bradley, the original actor for <em>Hellraiser</em>’s iconic villain Pinhead, will be reprising the role, and series creator Clive Barker is assisting with the game’s story. In a statement, Barker said that “I’m eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the <em>Hellraiser</em> mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation.”</p><p>While this will be the first <em>Hellraiser</em> game, it’s part of a growing trend of classic horror franchises being adapted for the medium. The likes of <em>Friday the 13th</em> and <em>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</em> were turned into asymmetrical multiplayer games, as was <em>The Evil Dead</em>, which was developed by Boss Team.</p><p>Single-player survival horror seems like a better fit for <em>Hellraiser</em>, however, though it’s unclear yet when it might be available. Right now it’s listed as simply “in development.” It’ll be available on the PC, PS5, and Xbox whenever it does launch.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/710637/clive-barker-hellraiser-revival-game-trailer-ps5-xbox]]></content:encoded>

That’s to say nothing of the Disney+ show <em>Ironheart</em>, which felt like it was just unceremoniously dropped on the service with little promotion or fanfare. In righting the ship, Marvel just can’t seem to hit smooth sailing.</p><p>Naturally, then, with the release of the studios newest movie, <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>, there’s bound to be some good old-fashioned hand-wringing about the state of the MCU. On paper, the movie is splashy and full of exciting talent. <em>WandaVision</em>—one of the MCU’s biggest successes of what we’ll call its “expansion era”—director Matt Shakman is at the helm, joined by a quartet of beloved actors in the form of Pedro Pascal as Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as the Invisible Woman/Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn as the Human Torch/Johnny Storm, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as The Thing/Ben Grimm. From a visual perspective, it boasts a <em>Jetsons</em>-like retro-futurism that’s both timeless and an exciting departure from much of Marvel’s recent output. Shakman also committed to a (welcome) sense of practicality, with an “emphasis on practical sets and props,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/fantastic-four-first-steps-space-race-kubrick-exclusive/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/fantastic-four-first-steps-space-race-kubrick-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">per a report from <em>Empire</em></a></span>. All of these signs point to exciting, well, <em>first steps</em> toward ensuring the film is of the utmost quality.</p><p>Yet, <em>Fantastic Four</em> arrives with a healthy dose of concern, under some pretty burdensome circumstances. At once, it’s one of the handful of projects that fell under the great reshuffle, the third reboot of Marvel’s first family in 20 years, and one of the last solo Marvel movies before the release of <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> in December 2026. That last point is especially pertinent, as the lead villain for the upcoming <em>Avengers</em> is none other than <em>Fantastic Four</em> antagonist, Doctor Doom, which means <em>Fantastic Four</em> has to do some more heavy lifting than, say, <em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.</em></p><p>Played by Robert Downey Jr, in a decision that still reads as a desperate attempt at chasing the heyday of MCU years’ past, Doctor Doom <em>is</em> an incredible foe, when done correctly. Doom and Reed’s relationship is richly layered. In comic books, their rivalry dates back to their days at college, where they become bitter rivals with a begrudging respect for one another. They’re mirror images of one another, with Doom isolating himself from others while Reed embraces friends and family. They can’t exist without each other, forged forever in a fire of spite and anger, with Doom refusing to acknowledge that Reed is his superior. This often involves Doom trying to drag Reed down to his level, not unlike the Joker trying to pull Batman into having one bad day.</p><p>The relationship between Doom and Reed informs the backbone of <em>Secret Wars</em>, written by Jonathan Hickman with art by Esad Ribić. After a series of multiversal impacts tear the fabric of reality apart, Doctor Doom manages to salvage the existing universes into a patchwork reality. The culmination of the story involves Reed and Doom facing off, where Doom eventually admits that his tried and true foe would have found a proper way to restore all the disparate universes. Here, at the end of all things, Doom realizes that all his faculties are nothing in the face of Reed.</p><p>With the MCU looking to adapt—either directly or in parts—that very same <em>Secret Wars </em>story in the next two <em>Avengers</em> films, the future of Marvel storytelling hangs on the success of <em>Fantastic Four</em>.</p><p><em>Fantastic Four</em> needs to be a hit. Not only to prove that non-<em>Avengers</em> Marvel movies still have the juice, but to set up the Four and Reed as critical figures before introducing Doom. It’s telling that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZXBFirj6b4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZXBFirj6b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the famed chair video</a></span>, which revealed the expansive cast of the movie, Pedro Pascal’s chair appeared right before Downey Jr’s, seemingly indicating the pair will be critically important to the next <em>Avengers</em> films, a fact confirmed by Shakman who told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/fantastic-four-director-interview-matt-shakman-casting-auditions-1236461087/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/fantastic-four-director-interview-matt-shakman-casting-auditions-1236461087/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Variety</em></a></span> that Reed will be <em>leading</em> the Avengers by the time it’s all said and done. Audiences need to invest in Pascal’s performance as Reed for the emotional throughline of <em>Doomsday</em> and <em>Secret Wars</em> to work. Those <em>Avengers</em> movies may not hit the financial pinnacles of the pre-pandemic success of <em>Infinity War </em>and <em>Endgame</em>, but Disney’s surely counting on them to get as close as humanly possible.</p><p>Every Marvel movie this year has faced some level of concern. But <em>Fantastic Four</em> feels like it has so much riding on it. With such a large gap between this film and <em>Doomsday</em>, a sour note could be the thing that causes the worm to turn on Marvel writ large. But if done right, it’s the buoying force that could sustain a new level of optimism and enthusiasm for the MCU just when it’s needed the most.</p><p>Marvel Comics achieved tremendous success when Stan Lee and Jack Kirby introduced the Fantastic Four in 1961. Now, almost 64 years later, the MCU is looking to four intrepid heroes to do so once again, ushering in a new era of excitement. Will history repeat itself?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-dr-doom-doomsday-avengers-1851786672]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The talent behind Critical Role have previously hinted at their collective desire <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/critical-role-may-expand-into-video-games/1100-6528190/" data-ref-id="1100-6528190">to create a video game</a>. Now, it's finally happening as Critical Role has partnered up with AdHoc, the developer behind the upcoming superhero action-RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dispatch/" data-ref-id="5000-654979">Dispatch</a>.</p><p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/critical-role-first-video-game-development-adhoc-studio-1236463963/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, the new game will be set in Exandria, the world that was created for Critical Role's fantasy campaigns. Critical Role's Travis Willingham also indicated that characters from the Vox Machina, Mighty Nein, and Bells Hells could appear, but the story "would have to be something brand new."</p><p>Willingham was instrumental in bringing AdHoc into co-development on the new game after he was cast in Dispatch. He noted that Critical Role wants to follow Dispatch's template and open up the narrative based on player choices.</p><p>"We're tossing around ideas, what are we thinking about in terms of scope and budget, and some of the things we must have," said Willingham.

            <p>A new development in the troubled history of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/duke-nukem-forever">Duke Nukem Forever</a> has revealed itself. COO of Digital Extremes Sheldon Carter revealed to Eurogamer that while there was an "alternate history" where the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a>-creator took the game under its wing, the studio had its hands full at the time with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">Bioshock</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-darkness-ii">The Darkness 2</a>.
</p>
<p>This conflicts with a May 2022 post by Apogee and 3D Realms co-founder Scott Miller, <a href="https://www.apogeeent.com/devblog/dnf-truth">who wrote a short history of the game</a> after a 2001 build was leaked online. In it, Miller claimed he tried to pass the game onto Digital Extremes.
</p>
<p>Miller stated: "I recognised that DNF was in deep trouble back in 2004 and tried to get the entire game developed by a more experienced studio, Digital Extremes (now famous for Warframe). The owner there was eager to take over DNF from us, and we even had the blessing of our publisher at the time (Take-Two), but this idea was shot down internally. It turned out to be a fatal suicide shot."

<p>But according to Sheldon, Digital Extremes was too busy to take up development of a third game: </p>
<p>"What can I say about this... I mean these are still those stories that are tough, tough to tell. I would say the things that were neat were that we definately got to see it all, and we got to have meetings with George [Broussard, co-founder Apogee and 3D Realms] who was amazing and has always been a cool guy. It was an exciting time for us. I think in the end they ended up being published by 2K right? We were working on The Darkness 2 and Bioshock, both were kind of cranking at that point. So, there's an alternate history [laughs] on how that all worked out. </p>
<p>"But I can't imagine it could have been anything but George's baby to be honest."</p>
<p>When asked if this was the main reason Digital Extremes didn't take on Duke Nukem Forever, Carter emphasised it was moreso the work on The Darkness 2 and Bioshock was taking priority. Carter explained: "I think mainly we were pretty commited with the stuff that we had. <em>My baby</em> at the time was The Darkness 2, that was my obsession.
</p>
<p>"The way our company was structured, we had two games which was really cool, and they were both going at that time with 2K. So it was natural for [3D Realms] to approach, as we were executing two first-person-shooters, but I don't think it ever went to the level that might have been implied. We weren't in a position to aquire it or take it on, it never got to that stage. It was definately cool though!</p>
<p>It turns out this week is a special one for the infamous Duke Nukem Forever. The game took 5,158 days to release since its announcement on the 27th April, 1997. Eventually coming out on 10th June, 2011, 5,158 days later, you've got the 24th July, 2025. How about that! On Thursday, we'll be one Duke Nukem Forever away fron Duke Nukem Forever.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/digital-extremes-coo-claims-digital-extremes-was-too-busy-with-bioshock-and-the-darkness-2-to-take-on-the-troubled-duke-nukem-forever]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Today's the day! The Pokémon Company's next Pokémon Presents broadcast goes live in just under an hour, at 2pm UK time - and you can watch it right here on Eurogamer.
</p>
<p>For anyone watching across in the States, you'll want to tune in at 5am Pacific and 8am Eastern. For Japan, it's a bit later on, taking place at 9pm JST. </p>
<p>Per metadata from the Pokémon YouTube channel, the stream will run for just over 24 minutes (making it one of the longer presentations in recent years).</p>
<p>The livestream was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-presents-livestream-date-reveal-points-to-something-musical-rather-than-simply-an-update-on-pokemon-legends-z-a">teased last week</a> with an image of Pikachu standing in front of a set of speakers and a DJ deck, leading many to think the presentation would announce something music-related.</p>
<p> In actuality, The Pokemon Company <a href="https://twitter.com/Pokemon_cojp/status/1946525436080480353">revealed</a> that the tease was pointing towards a pre-show music stream. At 1pm, an hour before Pokémon Presents, a pre-event show called "Everyone Gather! DJ Pikachu Live" will show the little yellow mouse channeling his inner-Avicii. Fair enough!</p>
<p>Check out the pre-show concert below.</p>

<p>Other than this peculiar and charming development, we can expect updates on a few key Pokémon titles coming over the next few months; I anticipate updates on the next mainline game (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>), some updates on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Go</a>, new content for Pokémon Pocket TCG, and I'm also hoping for more information on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-shown-at-this-years-pokemon-presents">Pokémon Champions</a> - the upcoming strategy video game developed by The Pokémon Works and published by Nintendo.
</p>
<p>So far, we know the game is coming to the Nintendo Switch, Android and iOS. It has no release date at the time of writing, and basically continues the ideas set out in Pokémon Stadium, way back in 1999. The game will connect with Pokémon Home, so you can use your caught Pokémon from the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>, or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-scarlet-violet-walkthrough-tips-9015">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a>. It seems like a tentpole project for TPC, and I'm curious to see what more we learn about the game today.</p>

<p>In a previous Pokémon Presents, we also got confirmation that Pokémon Concierge will return for a second season - I'm hoping we'll get a release date for the beautiful, stop-motion Netflix series beyond the vague 'September 2025' window we currently have. For me, it represents a very deep understanding of the Pokémon brand: welcoming, warm, and with a focus on the creatures themselves. I look forward to learning more about it soon.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-pokemon-presents-here]]></content:encoded>

<p>Blames Star Wars for poor performance thus far...</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Ubisoft CEO, Yves Guillemot, has been answering questions during a recent general meeting about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, which has struggled thus far to live up to expectations, with rather poor sales figures overall.</p>
<p>Now, ask this writer and he'll tell you that Star Wars Outlaws is a genuinely cracking game, really and truly, and we're all very excited for its Switch 2 release here at Nintendo Life. Indeed, it's likely to prove the console's first 'impossible port' of sorts, especially if it manages to arrive in a decent state, so interest is high in this one, for sure, even for non-SW fans.</p>
<p>With regards to the game's current sales issues, and as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/ubisoft-ceo-yves-guillemot-blames-star-wars-outlaws-missed-sales-targets-on-star-wars-itself-being-in-choppy-waters-but-hopes-further-improvements-and-a-switch-2-launch-can-revive-the-open-world-game/">GamesRadar</a>, Guillemot says that he sees Star Wars itself as part of the problem, with fans perhaps feeling done in with constant TV shows which, in 2024 when the game was released, had sort of run out of steam a little. Yes, we didn't like The Acolyte either, Yves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The game suffered from a number of items. First, it suffered from the fact that it was released at a time when the brand that it belonged to was in a bit of choppy waters, said Guillemot, whilst also acknowledging that the game wasn't quite perfect at any rate, "The game had a few items that still needed to be polished...they were polished and debugged in the early weeks after release, but it did affect sales volumes."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily for Switch 2 fans, then, it also seems that the version we'll get our hands on come September 4th will arrive with some added improvements, too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We did heavily improve the game by troubleshooting and debugging. When it will be released on upcoming consoles such as the Switch 2 it will have a new version of the game. Improvements on the game are not finished."</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>GreedFall II&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Steelrising&nbsp;</em>developer Spiders has apparently become the latest studio to be swept up in the ongoing wave of industry layoffs.</p>

<p>According to a LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7353013917415079936/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> by lead animator Erwan Perrin (spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/spiders-greedfall-series-hit-by-layoffs.1249359/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Maxime</a>), Spiders will soon "proceed [with] a layoff plan" which will affect "most of the animation and rig team" at the studio. That's the team that creates character animations and frameworks.</p>

<p>It's not clear exactly how many employees will be hit by the layoffs, but it's not a great sign for Spiders if "most" of an entire team at the studio is being let go.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/greedfall-ii-spiders-layoffs.jpg?itok=VxqRZ1xB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/greedfall-ii-spiders-layoffs.jpg?itok=J_yPZl5h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>GreedFall II&nbsp;</em>developer Spiders is being hit by layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with Spiders, it's a French studio responsible for developing games like the aforementioned&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/greedfall-2-dying-world" rel="nofollow">GreedFall II</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/steelrising" rel="nofollow"><em>Steelrising</em></a>, as well as&nbsp;<em>The Technomancer</em>,&nbsp;<em>Bound by Flame</em>, and other Eurojank-style RPG-adjacent titles.</p>

<p>In many ways, the studio is similar to&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Elex&nbsp;</em>developer Piranha Bytes, which should probably come as more cause for alarm; that studio, which was based in Germany, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">shut down in 2024</a> by parent company THQ Nordic.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>GreedFall II&nbsp;</em>is currently in Early Access, it's not entirely clear what these Spiders layoffs mean for the future of the game. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1997660/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, however,&nbsp;<em>GreedFall II&nbsp;</em>has a 24-hour peak player count of just 13, so things aren't looking great for the studio.</p>

<p>These layoffs at Spiders are part of a wider industry pattern that has seen multiple studios lay off employees, cancel projects, or shut down entirely, and the phenomenon isn't just limited to smaller studios either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/perfect-dark-spiders-layoffs.jpg?itok=21VVRPs5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/perfect-dark-spiders-layoffs.jpg?itok=kDuEuM7e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Studios like Xbox subsidiary The Initiative have also been hit by the ongoing layoff wave.</figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this month, for instance, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">laid off around 9,000</a> of its employees (yes, you read that number right), and as part of that employee cull, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Rare's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Everwild</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">The Initiative's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">Perfect Dark</a>&nbsp;</em>were canceled, with the latter closing its doors for good as well.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what these layoffs might mean for Spiders, but I'm concerned about the studio's future. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Valve recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">changed Steam's rules and regulations</a> to give banks, payment processors, and internet service providers some control over the definition of acceptable "adult content" on Steam, in line with their own respective policies. As Valve suggested to RPS in a statement, it was either that or risk a credit card firm or bank blocking Steam purchases at large. Alongside all this, Valve also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-are-now-removing-a-bunch-of-sex-games-from-steam-to-keep-banks-and-card-companies-happy">delisted a bunch of sexually explicit games</a>, including a number of games that depict incest.</p>
<p>Valve have yet to specify which games they've delisted as a direct result of the policy change, or which particular institutions prompted them to make this rather momentous shift. But it looks increasingly like the result of an anti-violent pornography game campaign directed at Valve, Mastercard, Paypal, Visa, Paysafe Limited, Discover and the Japan Credit Bureau in early July, carried out by Australian pressure group Collective Shout. This is the conclusion offered by Collective Shout themselves, anyway - they've described the Steam delistings as <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1946431955446431970.html">a "victory for child safety campaigners"</a>, while commenting that they are now being sent misogynistic abuse and threats by players in retaliation.</p><!--more-->
<p>Founded in 2009, Collective Shout have long called for the banning or delisting of games they regard as violently sexist, exploitative and abusive, as part of a wider campaign against the sexualisation and objectification of women in media. Much of their campaign is based on the argument that there is a causal relationship between such representations and real-life abuse. On their <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/about">About page</a>, they quote a 2016 <a href="https://discovered.ed.ac.uk/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=cdi_proquest_miscellaneous_1783913257&amp;context=PC&amp;vid=44UOE_INST:44UOE_VU2&amp;lang=en&amp;adaptor=Primo%20Central&amp;tab=Everything&amp;query=null,,1995,%20%C2%A91995">meta-analysis of 135 studies of media sexualisation</a> carried out by L. Monique Ward. I don't have the permissions to access it, but according to the abstract, exposure to "sexually objectifying portrayals" of women is "directly associated with a range of consequences, including higher levels of body dissatisfaction, greater self-objectification, greater support of sexist beliefs and of adversarial sexual beliefs, and greater tolerance of sexual violence toward women."</p>

</figure>
<p>The latest action against Steam appears to have begun on July 11th, when Collective Shout published an <a href="https://archive.ph/o/x5cGQ/https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors">"open letter to payment processors profiting from rape, incest + child abuse games on Steam"</a>. The open letter cites Collective Shout's <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/tags/no_mercy">previous call for the removal</a> of an outright rape simulation game, No Mercy, and states that they have "discovered hundreds of other games featuring rape, incest and child sexual abuse on both Steam and Itch.io". It does not share any details of the games in question.</p>
<p>As a result of this letter, Collective Shout claim to have brought about the delisting of 500 games from Steam, a statement that Valve have yet to corroborate (and which as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/australian-anti-porn-group-claims-responsibility-for-steams-new-censorship-rules-in-victory-against-porn-sick-brain-rotted-pedo-gamer-fetishists-and-things-only-get-weirder-from-there/">PCGamer</a> observe, appears to include a number of duplicate entries). They're also calling for the removal of a further 82 games "tagged with rape and incest", without sharing names.</p>
<p>I think it would be constructive for Collective Shout to specify the games they're referring to publicly, and to articulate the context of the sexual content they're objecting to, given that some of their previous campaigns against "sickening" video games make assumptions that border on misinformation. In 2018, for example, Collective Shout <a href="https://x.com/CollectiveShout/status/964663931439480834">endorsed a petition for a ban</a> on the sale of Quantic Dream's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a> in Australia, declaring that it features "child abuse and violence against women."</p>
<p>I am no great fan of Quantic Dream, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quantic-dream-deny-abusive-working-conditions">have been accused of cultivating sexism in their workplace</a> and who have a track record for <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/detroit-become-human-review-marginalized-struggle/">using sexual violence to define their female characters</a>, but it seems important to insist - as the petition itself acknowledges - that the scenes referred to are, in fact, <a href="https://x.com/BryanDechart/status/939703243956895744">designed to create empathy for the victim</a> as part of a story about social injustice. They are not wish fulfilment for abusers. Collective Shout's endorsing of the petition suggests minimal familiarity with the game they're trying to ban.</p>
<figure>

<p>In 2014, similarly, Collective Shout called for a ban on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s sale in Australia, summarising it as a "video game that encourages players to brutally murder women for entertainment". I think it's fair to say that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a>'s portrayal of women has long been abysmal - this is the series that turns sex workers into health packs and yes, lets you kill them afterwards to recover your fee. I'm interested to see whether <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> changes the record here - it has a female protagonist (and an often-underdressed male co-star), but is also partial to booty shots in trailers.</p>
<p>At the same time, GTA has never been a series designed to indulge fantasies about murdering women and sex workers. The Changelog.org petition in question does not place its allegation in the context of a farcical open world simulation in which it is possible to brutally murder <em>everybody</em>, from pimps to the police. Again, it does not give much indication that Collective Shout and the organisers played the game they're trying to have removed from sale.</p>
<p>Valve's change of policy has prompted an outcry from developers of erotic games and journalists who see this as continuing a pattern of financial institutions using their control of transactions to silence 'taboo' expressions of sex and sexuality - a push for conformity that may accompany a sincere desire to protect children and women from exploitation, or may simply use that professed desire as camouflage for, say, a conviction that trans and queer people are deviants, and that sex work of any kind should be illegal.</p>
<p>The discovery that Collective Shout may have goaded Mastercard and co into demanding changes has fuelled this argument, given Collective Shout's connections to certain fundamentally religious and conservative-leaning organisations such as the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE) and Exodus Cry - both of whom signed Collective Shout's open letter from July 11th.</p>
<p>In an investigation for Vice, Ana Valens dug into the history of these groups, which I'll summarise with a few pieces of information from my own research. Exodus Cry are an American Christian non-profit advocacy organization who seek the abolition of the legal commercial sex industry, from porn to strip clubs and sex work, as well as illegal sex trafficking. In 2013, their founder and CEO, Benjamin Nolot, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/11/melissa-mccarthy-exodus-cry-apology">compared abortion to the Holocaust and described gay marriage as an "unspeakable offence to God"</a>, though he says his views on these subjects have changed since.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>NCOSE, meanwhile, were founded by American clergymen in the 1960s, and have asserted that pornography at large is a "public health crisis". Katherine Cross <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/opinion-illuminating-the-shadowy-group-celebrating-valve-s-latest-censorship-drive">wrote a piece for Game Developer</a> in 2018 about NCOSE's previous attempts to have games featuring "sexual exploitation" removed from Steam, concluding that "what these groups actually want has nothing to do with the dignity of anyone, and everything to do with restoring a traditional gender order that criminalizes both sexual expression and sexual labor."</p>
<p>I'd tell you to read the rest of Valens's piece on Vice, but Vice have since pulled the article and a previous article on Collective Shout, without explaining why. Valens has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.net/post/3lufjdqmhxs2v">claimed</a> that Vice's parent company, Savage Ventures, called for the removal of her articles "due to concerns about the controversial subject matter - not journalistic complaints". She and several other staffers have now resigned from the site in protest. I'll ask Savage Ventures for comment. In the meantime, you can find a copy of Valens' article on <a href="https://archive.ph/x5cGQ#selection-1137.55-1137.118">the Internet Archive</a>.</p>
<p>As for my own take on the situation, I don't think it can be disputed that violent sexualised media contributes to a culture of violent sexualisation, but the extent of that contribution is difficult to identify and as such, needs to be addressed case-by-case. Collective Shout, so far, have avoided going into details - they haven't disclosed which games they consider abhorrent, or explained why these games in particular are in contravention of Steam's existing prohibition against games that promote hatred, violence, or discrimination based on gender, or which "exploit children in any way".</p>
<p>Collective Voice may be sincere in their anger and desire to protect women and children, but it's not enough to say that certain topics are self-evidently unfit for representation in a work of fiction and enlist vast financial corporations as enforcers - particularly when your choice of affiliations suggests you may have ulterior motives, and particularly when you have a track record for getting important details wrong.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The first-ever Hellraiser game is in development as a single-player, survival horror action release, with the team behind it all promising the chance to experience the infamous series "like never before".</p>
<p>It's coming from Saber Interactive and Boss Team Games, and will of course pit players against Pinhead. For fans of the series, the upcoming game - known as Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival - will also see actor Doug Bradley returning to the role for the first time in nearly two decades.</p>
<p>"Discover the tale of Aidan, who must unlock the dark powers of the Genesis Configuration, a mysterious puzzle box, to help his girlfriend from a hellish abyss," reads the official blurb. "As Aidan, you'll harness the box's infernal abilities to survive your pact with the sinister Pinhead and battle against the twisted cult that worships him and the Cenobites. Fail, and your suffering will be legendary, even in Hell. We have such sights to show you..."</p>
<p>You can check out a trailer for Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival below.</p>

<p>"Working on the first true Hellraiser game has been a venture deep into the recesses of my darkest imaginings," said Hellraiser creator Clive Barker. "The dedication that Saber and Boss Team Games have shown is nothing short of remarkable. They've immersed themselves in the Hellraiser universe, capturing its essence - the seductive pull of suffering, the beauty within the grotesque - and forged a narrative that invites players to step beyond the threshold.</p>
<p>"I'm eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the Hellraiser mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation."</p>
<p>Saber head Matthew Karch, meanwhile, called Hellraiser "the quintessential horror franchise", and one which "lends itself perfectly" to a video game.</p>
<p>"Saber has had success with horror IPs in the past, and working alongside Clive to create tense gameplay and a new story that delves into the twisted depths of pain and pleasure has been a real treat," Karch said. "We look forward to opening up the gates of hell."</p>
<p>Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival is available to wishlist now via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>While this will be, in Barker's words, the first true Hellraiser game, it won't be Pinhead's first foray into the world of video game horror. He has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylights-hellraiser-dlc-is-getting-yanked-from-sale-soon">popped up in Dead by Daylight</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/first-ever-hellraiser-game-announced-with-doug-bradley-returning-as-pinhead]]></content:encoded>
