			<p>A new Oblivion Remastered mod now available for download makes the Imperial City more atmospheric and beautiful at night with the introduction of new light sources.</p>
<p>The Rabbit's Real Lights Imperial City, now available for download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/2852?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces over 500 new hand-placed light sources and objects that provide better visibility at night and make the Imperial City more beautiful than ever. So far, new lights have been added to the Arena District, Elven Garden, Imperial Palace, Market District, Talos Plaza, Temple District, Arboretum, and Arcane District, leaving only the Prison District in its vanilla state. This mod is also fully compatible with the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/3100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lumiere - Lights of Cyrodiil mod</a>, which adds light sources outdoors all over Cyrodiil, making the two mods complementary and a must-download for those looking to improve how the game looks at night.</p>

<p>Oblivion Remastered launched late last month after having been rumored to be in the works for a while. Powered by both Unreal Engine 5 and the original engine, the remaster is extremely faithful in terms of gameplay, making the experience instantly familiar to those who have already ventured into Cyrodiil, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review.</a></p>
<p>Oblivion Remastered is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

<p>For those yet to play the game, the number 33 is key to the story. Players control the 33rd expedition on a mission to stop the mysterious Paintress from killing the population. The game then plays on this number in multiple ways - the maximum level for your weapons is 33, for one example.</p>

			<p>Swedish developer MachineGames might have canceled an unannounced project a while ago. Timur222 <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1927629681982915009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> the tidbit of information earlier today while scouring the LinkedIn resume of a former Lead Artist who worked on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and this mysterious project between February 2022 and January 2024.</p>
<p>Needless to say, given the developer's history, Wolfenstein fans are worried that the canceled game is none other than Wolfenstein III. Following the launch of New Colossus in 2017, MachineGames worked on two spin-offs, the co-op game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wolfenstein-youngblood-kids-alright/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Youngblood</a> and the VR game Cyberpilot, neither of which was well received. Back then, Bethesda's VP of Marketing Pete Hines had <a href="https://wccftech.com/pete-hines-confirms-wolfenstein-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that a proper third installment to conclude the series would be made, but the years went on without such an announcement.</p>
<p>We now know that the studio dedicated itself to Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, but it's possible that they had a team working on Wolfenstein III and the project didn't pan out. Whether they will try again now that the Indy project is done remains to be seen. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was highly successful for MachineGames, earning unanimous praise from gamers and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press</a> alike. The game had registered four million players by January 2025, although it's always complex to gauge how many of those were full time sales with Game Pass in the mix. The subsequent launch on PlayStation 5 certainly helped.</p>
<p>Microsoft Gaming head Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-might-get-a-sequel-hints-phil-spencer-though-he-certainly-sounds-more-interested-in-owned-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened up</a> to a sequel in an interview last month. At the same time, he made it quite clear that he'd prefer Microsoft-owned teams to work on owned franchises, which Indiana Jones most definitely is not. Wolfenstein would fall in that category, but will MachineGames, Bethesda, and Microsoft give the franchise another try? I certainly hope so, as B.J. Blazkowicz's story needs a proper ending.</p>

            <p>It looks like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> launch game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> will have a reverse mode for the first time.</p>
<p>Previous games in the series have included Mirror Mode as an unlockable extra, which flips tracks horizontally for a new challenge.</p>
<p>However, characters have been spotted racing in reverse in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5wuhtJfj54&amp;t=51s">Japan-only advert</a> for the new game, suggesting a reverse mode will finally be included.</p>

<p>The advert includes footage of characters racing around the Mario Bros. Circuit in the opposite direction, when compared to footage from Nintendo's Treehouse Live stream (thanks <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/it-seems-that-you-can-play-courses-in-reverse-in-mario-kart-world/">NintendoSoup</a>).</p>
<p>It's unknown yet how racing in reverse will be included in the game - perhaps as a separate option following completion of 150cc - but the footage appears to show a Grand Prix race rather than Knockout Tour, judging by the UI.</p>
<p>Of course, with Mario Kart World being an open world game, players will be able to drive in all directions in Free Roam, so it would make sense Nintendo would make use of this for its Grand Prix.</p>
<p>It's not long to wait now until we'll be able to play Mario Kart World for ourselves. It launches alongside the Switch 2 on 5th June - that's next week!</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-was-first-developed-for-the-original-switch-but-60fps-only-possible-on-switch-2">Nintendo shared an interview with Mario Kart World's developers</a>.

            <p>Two very good skating games are back up for sale on Steam after disappearing for four months. Bright 'n' cheery skateboarding game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/olliolli-world">OlliOlli World</a> and dystopian rollerskate shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rollerdrome">Rollerdrome</a> both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/olliolli-world-and-rollerdrome-have-been-de-listed-from-steam-and-nobody-knows-why">vanished in a cloud of toxic corporate smoke</a> in February this year, some time after the closure of the games' developers Roll7. But it looks like the poisonous fumes have finally cleared, and the games are once again available.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's not clear why the games have been absent. But it is very likely the result of legal and business hullabaloo caused by parent company Take-Two Interactive last year. Come with me now on a dollar-burning trip through the wastes of global financial malignancy, as I tell a tale as old and stupid as time.</p>
<p>The original developers of the games, Roll7, were owned by publishers Private Division, who were in turn owned by merciless corpocolossus Take-Two Interactive. In May last year Private Division were sold off by their business daddy to a private equity firm, and the studio who actually made good games, Roll7, were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skateboarding-studio-roll7-is-reportedly-being-closed-down-by-parent-company-take-two">unceremoniously shut down</a> as a result. The CEO of Take-Two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kerbal-space-program-2-producer-confirms-mass-layoffs-contradicting-ceos-remarks">tried to deny this</a>, but the effect on workers at both Roll7 and other Private Division studios (like the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a> developers) was clear. They were all laid off. </p>
<p>It's a disappointing, if familiar, tale. But the delisting of the games months after the sale and their reappearance this week is a weird afterword. On the Steam page for both games, 2K (Take-Two's publishing moniker) are now listed as publisher. At the time of the sale, Take-Two said they were including all of Private Divisions "live and unreleased" games. But they now claim otherwise. 2K has "confirmed that neither Rollerdrome nor OlliOlli World were included in the Private Division sale, and that it is now the publisher of both games," according to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/olliolli-world-and-rollerdrome-are-back-on-steam-after-being-delisted-4-months-ago-when-2k-sold-off-private-division/">PC Gamer</a>. Weird. </p>
<p>Whatever the dumbass legal reason that caused the games to disappear, it appears to be solved. Now you enter the realm of minor ethical dilemma: buy the games because they are excellent, or ignore them completely because the company who stands to profit fired everyone who worked on said bangers? Of course, other skulduggery is possible, as noted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kimhu.bsky.social/post/3kztixxrogd26">at least two people</a> who worked on the game. Do whatever you like, I can't tell you what's right. What do I know? I'm just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-olliolli-2-welcome-to-olliwood">the 21st best player of OlliOlli 2</a> (on PlayStation 4). </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>In the run up to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s release next week (next week!), Nintendo has released a new video highlighting the changes N64 classics will have on the console's debut.</p>
<p>Those with a Nintendo Switch Online plus Expansion Pack subscription are able to play classic games from the N64 days, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask">Majora's Mask</a>, Pokémon Snap, and a personal favourite, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/goldeneye-007-review">GoldenEye 007</a>.</p>
<p>And soon, those on Switch 2 will be able to play these games, and then rewind them when things don't go quite as planned (what, that has never happened to me), pop on a CRT screen filter and remap the controls. You can check out how this all looks via the video below.</p>

<p>While those on the original Switch consoles won't be able to utilise that rewind feature or the  CRT screen filter, they will be able to remap the controls when this update goes live.</p>
<p>As to when all this is happening, that would be next Thursday, 5th June. That's the day Switch 2 releases.</p>

<p>In the meantime while we wait patiently for next week, you can check out the full run down of games available on Nintendo's subscription service via our handy guide: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-online-games-available-to-play-right-now">All Nintendo Switch Online games available to play right now</a>.</p>
<p>As for the Switch 2, while it is not technically available just yet, some have managed to get their hands on the console early. Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-already-out-in-the-wild-but-needs-a-day-one-update-to-function">footage was shared online of someone unpacking their new console</a>, however they were unable to play it due to it requiring a day one update to function. Nintendo obviously didn't seem best pleased with this video making the rounds online, and soon removed the footage from the internet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-sees-big-decline-over-season-1/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A pretty sharp viewership decline was registered in The Last of Us Season 2 finale on HBO. The widely acclaimed debut season had over 8.2 million viewers in the United States despite airing at the same time as the Oscars ceremony. However, the season that just ended only registered 3.7 million viewers (<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-viewership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via The Wrap</a>), a 55% drop. HBO cautioned that the numbers might increase and reminded everyone that the series has been watched globally by over 90 million viewers, with the second season averaging almost 37 million global viewers per episode.</p>
<p>It's all too easy to imagine the drop could have been caused by a certain character's death that gamers know all too well from The Last of Us Part II. However, HBO has already renewed the show for a third season, which will place a larger focus on Abby. In a press conference dedicated to The Last of Us Season 2 finale, series co-creator Craig Mazin <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-7-ending-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>There is another side to this story that we have yet to really delve into. And there’s no question that Abby is the hero of her story. Where we go next, all I can say is it will always be centering on somebody, whether it’s Ellie and Dina or whether it’s Abby. But really, if you want to boil it down, everything is under the cloud or sunlight of Joel — what Joel did to Abby and what Joel did for Ellie — and that will never change.</em></p>
<p>In other franchise news, The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC was just <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-avowed-and-more-add-support-for-nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a> with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. Last week, series creator Neil Druckmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-iii-will-only-be-made-with-a-story-worthy-of-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the much-requested third installment could be made, but only if he and Naughty Dog as a whole can find a worthy story to tackle.</p>

    <div id="main-content">
  

        <p>but I can't quite put my finger on it</p>

            <p>Reader, I'm getting some serious de ja vu from the the poster for <a href="https://escaperoom.com/venue-game/liberation-escape-rooms-castle-of-conundrums-southaven-ms-usa">Liberation Escape Rooms</a> 'Castle Of Conundrums' experience, but I'm having trouble placing it. I don't <em>think</em> I've been to this escape room before, never having visited the town of Southaven, Mississippi. Perhaps I should go? The <a href="https://escaperoom.com/venue-game/liberation-escape-rooms-castle-of-conundrums-southaven-ms-usa">reviews are</a> positively glowing. "Very exciting and unique escape rooms," writes Anna R. Five stars! "Today's game in the Castle just blew us away," enthuses Tracey S. Five stars again! An unmissable experience by all accounts. And yet, I'd feel woefully unequiped to take on the Castle Of Conundrums if I cannot solve the much more pressing conundrum at hand.</p>

<p>"The king and his knights are on a quest to protect the crown. While they are away, a new and formidable threat appears just beyond the castle walls," reads the lore blurb. Fuck. Shit. Fuck. Worst possible time this could have happened. "Can you prove your worthiness in Merlin’s trials, become a knight, and defend the kingdom?". Wait. What? Why is Merlin holding trials when the castle is in danger from a threat - need I remind you - that is <em>just beyond the castle walls</em>?! There's no time for your classic chicanery, Merlsy! We need knights <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>A familiar set-up, no doubt. But no, no. That's not it. There's something <em>else</em> familiar about the poster for Liberation Escape Rooms Presents The Castle Of Conundrums Recommended for 2-8 players Difficulty 4 out of 5. Why, it's that plaque in the top left, isn't it? The breastplate. The crossed swords. Why, that's definitely Dark Knight Armoury's <a href="https://www.darkknightarmoury.com/product/heraldic-eagle-breastplate-with-two-decorative-swords-wall-plaque/">Heraldic Eagle Breastplate with Two Decorative Swords Wall Plaque</a>! The only problem is that I've never laid eyes on Dark Knight Armoury's Heraldic Eagle Breastplate with Two Decorative Swords Wall Plaque, so it must be something else.</p>
<p>"We have done a handful of escape rooms in the Memphis area and this was by far one of the best!!!!!" writes Alicia B. Five stars again! Can you not see the subterfuge occurring right before your eyes, Alicia? You and your other five star compatriots? Are you so swayed by Liberation Escape Rooms' - by all accounts - unbeatable customer service that you've willingly blinded yourself to the lies contained in the poster for The Castle Of Conundrums Recommended for 2-8 players Difficulty 4 out of 5? Is it left solely to me to unpack its uncanny familiarity; the sole possessor of open eyes in a land where gummy-lidded herds chew mindlessly on opiatic cud like newborn foals?</p>
<p>Hang on. Hang on. It's the bloody font, isn't it? Classic <a href="https://www.fontpalace.com/font-details/bluebeard/">bluebeard</a>. I'd recognise you anywhere. Phew.</p>

You can remap all of the buttons, adjust stick and trigger sensitivities, create deadzones, alter the intensity of the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback, and save all of these settings to custom profiles.

            <p>“The lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne," wrote Chaucer. But you'd trained hard with that crossbow, and let any man in bolting distance try to claim you hadn't mastered it. You never wanted to go to war, but the crops were failing, you'd just lost your seventeenth child to medium-pox, and dark portents swirled on the horizon like curdled goat's milk. Also, the actual goat's milk was curdling.</p>
<p>In that tent, you'd communed with angels, and the righteous fury of all the heavens coursed through every fibre of your being. You'd likely die today, you knew. But you'd die knowing you did all you could to put this fair kingdom to rights. You step outside, breathe deep the morning air, and immediately eat a point blank pump-action shotgun to the torso. Then you lose both your legs to the tank shell. Then someone runs over your corpse with a dirtbike. Bloody typical.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingmakers">Kingmakers</a> made memeish waves when it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingmakers-mashes-the-medieval-era-with-modern-weapons-and-its-trailer-is-a-viral-sensation">first teased last February</a>, and while it'd be easy to write it off as just a one-note joke based on an inherently goofy power imbalance (you have guns and tanks, they have swords and horses), there does look to be a bit more occurring here. It's a four-player co-op action game where you'll be also able to command armies a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade">Mount &amp; Blade</a>, and build fortifications on the fly a la, uh, Fortnite I guess. I estimate the simple joys of shotgun vs pikeman will last for about forty minutes, but assuming the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> layer holds up, I'm still very much into this.</p>
<p>I'm currently playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> on the single-save honour mode, and Kingmakers looks to have its own honour mode of sorts, too, should you fancy it. As mentioned in this <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2109770/discussions/0/4340977379955918858/">dev Q&amp;A</a>, you'll be able to use a sword and shield, so it sounds like you can theoretically ignore the helicopters and grenade launchers and just get stuck in the melee. I'm not sure why you would, mind. Honour is for chumps that didn't bring enough helicopters. Kingmakers releases in early access October 8th <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2109770/Kingmakers/">on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

						<h5>F1 25</h5></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S/X</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>F1 games are ones I've played quite a lot in the past. Most of them, in reality. Having seen Codemasters grow the series and their acquisition by EA, it would always be interesting to see how they progress the series in the future. It was also going to be interesting because, and let's be completely honest, F1 as a motorsport does not change much, so what have Codemasters and EA done in <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-to-support-path-tracing-only-on-pc-improved-facial-animations-with-nvidia-audio2face/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 25</a> to make it stand apart from the rest?</p>
<p>Brad Pitt, that's what they've done. I didn't even know there was a film based on F1 coming out, but now I do, thanks to the game and the fact that I have spent my time on F1 25 playing as Mr Pitt himself.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/F1-25-Review-02-Passing-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>So what is the link? Aside from them both being based on motorsport, Sonny Hayes is one of the drivers with the team from the film that you can take behind the wheel, even running a whole career mode as them rather than creating a different fictional team from scratch. This is what I did most of my time with the game: I played the My Team career mode, controlling APxGP and pushing them from the bottom to the top, all while keeping <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/7/7b/Tylerbetterpicture.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170410170911" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyler Durden</a> front and centre.</p>
<p>As you interact more with the drivers and backroom, the My Team mode feels more responsive and interactive than before. You will keep track of your rating by fans and their current sentiment, driven by your performance on the course. Your finances will be driven by the number of staff in each of your departments and their wages, your sponsorships, and, naturally, linked to your performance on the track. Do better, everything gets better. This is particularly true when you happen to enter a rivalry and beat them.</p>
<p>Between these, you will research and develop new parts that can be attached to your drivers and their cars. You will invest in your HQ, improve different facilities to increase staffing, and train your owner to get even more bonuses. It all creates a good sense of progression as you move from a brand-new team with few resources to a masterclass team with the best car on the track.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/F1-25-Review-03-LIDAR-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, all of this is easier if you're good on the track. If there's one thing to say about F1 25, it's that it's the most realistic venture Codemasters has put out. Several tracks have been scanned using LIDAR (Laser imaging detection and ranging), which means every single centimetre is accurate in width and height. Not all tracks have been created using LIDAR, and some have had new features. Silverstone, for example, allows you to race in reverse.</p>
<p>In addition to improving the circuits, the elements surrounding the track add to the atmosphere. Codemasters gave an example in the build-up to release: the cherry blossoms around Suzuka, in the same place as real life. This adds to the exceptional visual quality and the feeling of being part of the race.</p>
<p>Now, I have to admit that at this point, I'm pretty terrible at the F1 games when I have zero assistance. I don't have everything on, and I don't like feeling railroaded. Still, I do tend to need the help to stop me spinning out and essentially creating a Final Destination moment as my car goes careening off into the spectators, killing dozens. Maybe the next tie-in Codemasters and EA could consider, though?</p>
<p>I find the handling and general racing to feel excellent, particularly when you find that balance where it's manageable for you, without making it too easy by crippling the AI. Added to this are other options that can make the game as sim or arcade as you like, even getting to the point where you can turn off penalties for turning it into Destruction Derby. This will always be a positive in any game, allowing you to play however you want.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/F1-25-Review-04-F1-World-scaled.png"></a></figure>

<p>Now, there are some negatives with F1 25. I'm used to unskippable cutscenes and other annoying elements in your bigger story-focused titles, and they can be annoying. For an F1 game, it wasn't something on my bingo list. The build-up to a race feels a little too realistic, in that you're listening to commentators talk about how your special brand of rubber is the exact one used in a mastodon's condom, which is why it's perfect for corner 9, compared to that of the other teams. Those specific words may not be used, but it feels like they're trying too hard to set the scene, rather than letting me get behind the wheel.</p>
<p>I can't say I'm exactly fond of the microtransactions either, specifically because you can buy XP boosts. If they were <em>just</em> for cosmetic items, of which there are loads, I could live with it. XP boosts, though, I'll never support pay-to-win or pay-to-progress in a full-priced title. Ever.</p>
<p>Back to the positives. The four game modes give you something to enjoy, and while it isn't all out yet, due to the film not being out, I am strangely looking forward to following the story of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/55/Brad_Pitt_as_Louis_de_Pointe_du_Lac.jpg/250px-Brad_Pitt_as_Louis_de_Pointe_du_Lac.jpg">Louis de Pointe du Lac</a>. This is even though I find the Breaking Point mode too railroaded. It seems the inclusion of <a href="https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5cdacd630c67926f7fea3f72/1:1/w_1669,h_1669,c_limit/MCDTROY_EC007.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Achilles</a> is what makes the story interesting.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/F1-25-Review-05-Winner-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The more I play F1 games, the harder it is to talk about them. This is particularly true when the advancements are less noticeable. Codemasters have taken some steps forward with this one, certainly in terms of the accuracy of the tracks and in improving the handling. Still, their most significant step forward for me is expanding My Team. I want to see more, but I'm glad to take what I can for now. All in all, I would recommend F1 25. It's a very good racing game, and it's still the F1 game that will give you the closest F1 experience, warts and all.</p>

						<section>
				<p>F1 25 is a good game, make no mistake about that. With a near flawless presentation, improved my team mode, and additional features, there's a lot to do. There are a few pitfalls here and there, but nothing that takes away from what is another genuinely good release by Codemasters.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Strong handling and car mechanics
</li><li>Excellently presented, and looks fantastic
</li><li>Improved My Team mode, giving more control and a management feel
</li><li>Good links and an additional mode linked to the upcoming F1 movie</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>Breaking point is boring - far too railroaded
</li><li>Sometimes they can focus too much of presentation - with unskippable scenes, dialogue or tutorial
</li><li>Pay-to-win (/progress) microtransactions</li>						</ul>

The N Edition of the Retro R8 was revealed in April, but it was only briefly available to preorder before 8BitDo temporarily paused shipments to the US due to tariffs. But now budget-friendly mouse is readily available with Prime shipping arriving as soon as tomorrow, depending on your location.</p><p>8BitDo's newest mouse matches its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Keyboard-Bluetooth-Swappable-Programmable-PC/dp/B0CCP8KYGG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">N Edition Retro Mechanical Keyboard</a>, which is available in tenkeyless and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Mechanical-Bluetooth-Swappable-Programmable/dp/B0DLFK335P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full-size models with a numpad</a>.</p><p>The N Edition is the second 8BitDo Retro R8 release; the mouse debuted earlier this year with an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMVLD2HC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">officially licensed, transparent green edition</a> inspired by the popular special-edition original Xbox console/controller.</p><div title="6531018 -- 8BitDo Retro R8 Mouse with Charging Dock" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3415" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6531018 -- 8BitDo Retro R8 Mouse with Charging Dock" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F37BTPPH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F37BTPPH?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F37BTPPH?tag=gamespot-promos-20">8BitDo Retro R8 Wireless Mouse with Charging Dock</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F37BTPPH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F37BTPPH?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F37BTPPH?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$50 | Available Now</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F37BTPPH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retro R8 Wireless Mouse</a> has impressive specs and features for the price. Designed as an ambidextrous mouse, you'll find a pair of NES-red buttons on each side. It utilizes Kailh Sword GM X microswitches, which are graded for up to 100 million clicks. The PAW 3395 sensor has six sensitivity levels, ranging from 50 to 26K DPI, and polling rates of 125Hz in Bluetooth mode, 125Hz-4,000Hz when using the 2.4GHz wireless dongle, and up to 8,000Hz when connected via the included USB-C cable.</p><p>The Retro R8 can sync wirelessly to PC, Mac, and mobile devices. It supports 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2 for PC, and we'd expect the device to be added to the macOS version of the app soon. When the Xbox Edition R8 Mouse released earlier this year, you couldn't customize your inputs or settings on Mac either, but that mouse as well as the Retro 87 Xbox Edition Keyboard can be customized on both PC and Mac.</p><p>The Retro R8 Mouse comes with a matching magnetic charging dock, which is a nice perk for a versatile wireless mouse at this price point. It also happens to be one of the nicest charging docks we've used. It has a compartment for the wireless dongle and can be used to extend the wireless signal range. The mouse itself also has a storage slot for the USB-A dongle.</p></div>                      </div><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DMTLLSBN,B0DMVLD2HC,B0DLFK335P,B0DLFS12R4,B0CYSQWYZP,B0CCP6HLZR,B0CCP8KYGG,B0D4QB5HMZ,B0F37BTPPH,B07ZH874DQ,B0D4QC8R4P,B0D4QGX9QB,B0D665WDGF,B0D66NJ3P8&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo's Retro Mechanical Keyboards</a>, particularly the aforementioned matching N Edition models, would naturally complement the R8 Mouse. All of 8BitDo's wireless keyboards offer impressive performance for reasonable prices. Each keyboard supports Bluetooth, 2.4GHz Wireless, and USB-C wired connections. You'll also get a detachable Super Button panel, which features two large microswitch buttons. If you opt for a tenkeyless model, you can pair it with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Mechanical-Calculator-Hot-swappable-Bluetooth/dp/B0D66LV395?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">N Edition Wireless Numpad</a>, if you ever want to expand your setup.</p><hr><p>The Retro R8 technically isn't the first 8BitDo gaming mouse inspired by the Nintendo Entertainment System. The manufacturer's first mouse was the N30, a $30 mouse that eschewed conventional design choices. The 8BitDo N30 Wireless Mouse has a D-pad instead of side buttons, two small buttons on top that resemble the NES controller's face buttons, and a touch panel instead of a scroll wheel. It's a rather peculiar little device that's not nearly as practical as the Retro R8 Mouse.

This one is much smaller than the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-system-update-now-live-adds-virtual-game-cards-switch-2-compatibility-and-more/1100-6531216/" data-ref-id="1100-6531216">20.0.0 update</a> released last month, but it makes some notable visual and audio changes to bring the interface in line with the system's upcoming successor.</p><p>As detailed in Nintendo's <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information#current" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a>, the new 20.1.0 update tweaks the look of the home screen's Parental Control settings button, changing the color from orange to red. On top of that, the sound that plays when launching the Nintendo Switch Online menu has also been changed, now matching the same sound that plays on the Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-already-out-in-the-wild-but-needs-a-day-one-update-to-function<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
With a little over a week to go until <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s arrival, some customers are already claiming to have received their consoles - but anyone hoping to play ahead of release are apparently out of luck, as units reportedly won't function without a day one update.
</p>
<p>
As spotted <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/someone-got-their-hands-on-a-nintendo-switch-2-early-and-the-videos-already-been-taken-down">by IGN</a>, YouTuber Ali Almarzooqi initially uploaded an eight-second video showing them opening their Switch 2 box - or at least a convincing replica - to reveal the console within. Unfortunately, it didn't take long before the video was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpbiOytojJc">yanked as a result of a copyright claim by Web Capio</a>, a company that markets itself as selling "anti-piracy solutions."
</p>
<p>
In a since-nuked comment thread below the video, Almarzooqi (AKA a2dubai) responded to a viewer asking for "more video please" by explaining, "Nintendo locked the Switch 2. It needs [an] update to function, so I'm waiting for June 5th to unlock it.".

<p>
Notably, this doesn't seem to be an isolated incident. Gaming news and deals poster Wario64 revealed they'd received correspondence - seemingly included corroborating images - from another Switch 2 customer who'd received their console early. "I have no permission to post pics," Wario64 <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1927441748923457581">wrote in a post on social media</a>, "but can share that when they try to boot a Switch 1 game, a message prompts 'Please connect to the internet and update your system.' Needs update to boot a game."
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time we've heard word of a big launch-day patch for Switch 2, either. The Game Business' Chris Dring <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-media-outlets-will-not-have">recently reported</a> some press have been told they won't get the console for coverage before release due to a "significant day one patch". This, presumably, is the very same update currently thwarting early receivers from playing their games ahead of schedule. It's currently unclear if the update is simply coming in hot or if it's a deliberate ploy by Nintendo to prevent legitimate gameplay appearing online ahead of launch.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2, of course, arrives next Thursday, 5th June, and you can read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">everything we know about the machine</a> - and its launch day games - elsewhere on Eurogamer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tinybuild-connect-2025-everything-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Indie publisher tinyBuild had their second annual tinyBuild Connect showcase today. IGN streamed the Connect live, and the showcase was packed with reveals of new games and release date announcements. Best of all, you can try almost all of the new games shown today via a playtest or demo — either now, or very soon. If you weren’t able to watch it live or just want a rundown of everything that was shown, we’ve got you covered. Here’s everything we saw during the show:</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Ferocious Is a Survival FPS with Dinosaurs You Can Team Up With</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The showcase opened with a brand-new look at Ferocious<em>,</em> where dinosaurs, mercs, and mechs clash in a lush but lethal survival FPS. The trailer teased the ability to tame apex predators and flip the food chain in your favor. The Steam playtest is live now, so it’s time to find out if you can survive the island’s deadly welcome.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>New Sand Trailer Shows More Desert FPS Action </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">New footage rolled out featuring hulking, customizable “Trampler” walkers stomping across sun-scorched dunes, frantic PvP action, and a confirmation that the extraction shooter will be coming to consoles later this year. A fresh playtest is also on the horizon, so get your squad together and see if you’ve got what it takes to rule the sands.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Trainfort Is a Co-op Survival Game with Guns and Steam Engines</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The world-premiere trailer introduced Trainfort, a co-op survival crafting game where roving dwarf nomads build and drive a steam-powered fortress across a procedurally generated wasteland. The developers are promising that a tactile first-person hand-control system will make every action from chopping trees to assembling your mobile base feel grounded and physical. The playtest for Trainfort also went live right after the show.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Hozy Is a Cozy Living Spaces Restoration Game</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Hozy invites players to restore a forgotten neighborhood, one cozy room at a time. Revealed for the first time during the showcase, the debut trailer showed players scrubbing grime, slapping on fresh coats of pastel paint, and dialing in lighting to turn derelict rooms into homey sanctuaries. Hozy also dropped a public Steam playtest right after the show, so you can already get a taste for its fixer-upper gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>All Will Fall Lets You Build a City That Can Collapse at Any Time</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Physics-based construction meets post-apocalyptic survival in this vertical city builder where every ramshackle tower can topple like Jenga. The team confirmed an open beta for Steam Next Fest on June 9, giving players a chance to stack homes sky-high — or watch them spectacularly crumble. All Will Fall has a demo available on Steam right now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Roguelite Kingdom Builder The King Is Watching Launches This July</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">CarbotAnimations’ tongue-in-cheek trailer revealed a July release window for this unique strategy title, where peasants only work under your royal gaze. Each run tasks you with juggling production, training armies, and adapting to unpredictable events. The playable demo is still available on Steam for those eager to test their royal authority.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Of Ash and Steel Shows Off Its Gothic-Coded Fantasy Open World</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A sweeping world overview trailer showcased sun-bleached fortresses, misty marshlands, and brutal third-person combat that rewards stance-switching finesse. Playtest sign-ups went live alongside the trailer, inviting would-be island wanderers to chart their own, marker-free adventures.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Streets of Rogue 2 Gets a New Gameplay Trailer Where Everything Goes Wrong</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A new trailer proved that everything can go wrong at any moment with this anything-goes sandbox, capping the segment with a confirmation that it hits Steam Early Access in 2025. From hijacking tractors to accident-prone heists, chaos is king in Streets of Rogue 2, and you can check out its demo on Steam right now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Voin Unveils Its Next Major Update Called “Permafrost”</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A new, action-packed devlog unveiled the upcoming “Permafrost” update, promising new frosted realms to carve through and fresh gear to master in this hack-and-slash created by a solo developer. Judging by the slicing, dashing footage, the chill won’t slow the carnage one bit. You can grab Voin with a limited-time discount during tinyBuild’s publisher sale on Steam.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>SpeedRunners 2 Unveils a 64-Player Tournament Mode and Cutthroat Racing Gameplay</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The cult-classic competitive platformer is turbo-charging into the new era. The latest trailer confirmed a massive 64-player tournament mode and showed more cutthroat racing gameplay across some new maps. A Steam playtest will launch this summer, and sign-ups are open now. SpeedRunners 2: King of Speed will launch on PC in 2025, with the console release to follow in 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Duckside Brings Hat-Wearing, Gun-Wielding Duck Extravaganza to Consoles This August</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The new trailer dove onto the screen, confirming that Duckside lands on consoles this August and showing off full-flight PvP mayhem, complete with crafting, base building, hat-wearing ducks, and of course, quack-tical base raids. The game is on sale with a limited-time discount on Steam.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Drill Core 1.0 Releases July 17, Nintendo Switch Version Coming Later This Year</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Become a true Corporate Mining manager in this strategy roguelite builder game. Whether you prioritize profits or workers' safety is up to you! The devs locked in a 1.0 launch for July 17 and surprised Switch owners with a port arriving later this year, but you can hop into the Early Access right now, as Drill Core is currently on sale on Steam.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Hello Neighbor 3 Drops a New Playable Prototype</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Hello Neighbor franchise creator Nikita Kolesnikov popped up in a devlog to give a first look at the eerie living sandbox town of Raven Brooks, where every NPC has its own agenda. Prototype 2 shadow-dropped during the show, so the curious (or the brave) can sneak in and test the new systems right now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Medieval Shooter/RTS Hybrid Kingmakers Sets Early Access Release Date for October 8</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Medieval England never looked so doomed: a frenetic new trailer for the shooter/RTS hybrid finally showed off four-player co-op, with assault rifles mowing through armored knights before revealing an October 8 Early Access launch on Steam and Epic Games Store. Time-travel paradoxes be damned — Kingmakers is ready to bring an attack chopper to a sword fight.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Given it was “developed with information support by The Main Military-Political Directorate of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation,” according to the game’s <a href="https://squad22.online/gameteam/">website</a>, this game should be classified as Russian military propaganda. Furthering this point, the <a href="https://cpd.gov.ua/en/results/rf-en/how-russia-militarizes-youth-through-computer-games/">Ukrainian Center for Countering Disinformation</a> has released two articles discussing this game.</p><p>Squad 22: ZOV is due out this month, but it’s currently listed on Steam as coming soon. The developer said in a recent <a href="https://squad22.online/squad-22-zov-is-now-on-steam/">news release</a> on its website that “it was a long and hard road” to get the game listed on Steam. Considering it is listed on Steam, it must have passed a moderation check of sorts – <em>Game Informer</em> reached out to Steam about this game, its listing, and its self-proclaimed connections to the official Russian military arm, and will update this story if it hears back.</p><p><em>Simulation Daily</em> writes that the X account for SPN Studio includes some “definitely distasteful messaging, like the mention that Ukraine refusing to surrender and give up territory to Russia is an opportunity to ‘have a lot of content to make more missions in our game.’”</p>

<p>As for the game itself, SPN Studio writes on the Steam page that the “tactical action real-time game” was designed “with insights from Russian veterans and active soldiers” and “delivers an authentic and intense infantry warfare experience.” The Steam page also says, “Game is officially recommended by the Russian military for use as a basic infantry tactic manual for cadet and Yunarmy training.”</p><p>The Ukranian Center for Countering Disinformation <a href="https://cpd.gov.ua/en/results/how-russia-militarizes-society-through-computer-games/">says</a> Squad 22: ZOV is “a key element in brainwashing the population, reflecting the Russian government’s version of events regarding the invasion of Ukraine and glorifying military service,” and that “by pushing war propaganda into all areas of life, Russian authorities aim to normalize the concept of war for their citizens and militarize society to minimize resistance to kremlin policies.” The center also says it has previously reported that Moscow is dedicating significant state resources to develop e-sports as a means of spreading propaganda, especially among youth.</p><p>Squad 22: ZOV also features the AI Generated Content Disclosure on its Steam page because “some 2D images in-game were pre-rendered using AI as a base for the work of our 2D artists and later drawn over in order to make them genuine art.”</p><p>Elsewhere on the Squad 22: ZOV, alongside statements that connect this game to The Main Military-Political Directorate of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, it also <a href="https://squad22.online/gameteam/">lists</a> consultants as “Hero of the Russian Federation” and “experienced soldier serving and fighting in SMO region since 2014 and up to Autumn 2024.” In this instance, SMO stands for “Special Millitary Operation,” which is a designation used by the Russian military to describe its invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Earlier this week, one of my industry peers James Bentley (they're over at that other site about PC games, GamerPCs I think it's called) put out a video essay titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/KtqrklovNHI?si=niPEfgfN3OxDxMmF">I Can Guarantee You This Game is Going to be Underrated</a>". Trusting in James as a critic of varied and interesting taste, I clicked through and found that yeah, they're right, it probably will be. However, I also get to write about indie PC games for a living, so I'd like to do my part in telling you about this strange, point-and-click/ <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-visual-novels-on-pc">visual novel</a> called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/decade">Decade</a>.
</p>

I don't think Decade is an easy, or perhaps comfortable game to describe, given its heavy themes. The game follows four children, specifically the four last children on the entire planet, the only survivors after metallic rain killing almost everyone else, the rest of them subsequently killing each other. Somehow these kids manage to get a time machine working, with three of them able to travel back 10 years to try and save the world.

The thing is, time travel or not, aging comes for us all, and these children do in fact grow older across those 10 years. While in the past, they can "investigate documents, technologies, and artefacts to understand history", all the while trying to make decisions that can lead you into several different futures. This, to put it plainly, is a concept that will likely continue to keep me up at night.
</p>
<p>
How much guilt should I feel for leading these children towards a future that might not even be liveable? Will I waste their years away in doing so? Do they get to have a future? These are questions I'm yet to answer myself through playing the game, but I'd like to, and it would be nice if you were interested in trying to do the same.

Developer Last Piscean worked on this solo after losing their job, and they still haven't managed to find one, and with the game releasing today (with a discount that makes it the price of two cups of coffee on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3272360/Decade/">Steam</a>), there's no better time to check it out than now.
