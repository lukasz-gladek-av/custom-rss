The studio will be helping six unique, best-selling TTRPGs in the Italian market from two different publishing companies reach wider audiences worldwide.</p>

<h2>The Ares Games Italian RPG Distribution Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official <a href="https://www.aresgames.eu/36303">Ares Games blog post</a>, the company will be distributing six "Made in Italy" TTRPGs and volumes in the English language. Three of these RPGs were produced by Italian publisher MS Edizioni, the others were made by indie studio Nigredo Press.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/five-days-promo-image.jpg?itok=5E8eBrwr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/five-days-promo-image.jpg?itok=H5uGv1Vi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The three MS Edizioni releases are described as light, self-contained, and highly innovative RPGs set in original settings. The first is Italian best-seller <em>Green Oaks</em>. It is a fast-paced narrative-driven RPG where players take on the rule of quirky elders staying at a haunted, rumor-filled retirement home.</p>

<p>The second RPG, <em>Five Days</em>, is a more somber one. Players play as a family member, either by blood or by experience, whose familial bond has been greatly damaged by past trauma. The game is an intense role-playing experience about navigating the raw pain of loss and fractured relationships but ultimately about coming to terms with tragedy.</p>

<p>The last MS Edizioni release being distributed by Ares Games is <em>Last Resort</em>. It is a cooperative RPG set on a tropical island during a zombie apocalypse. Players must work together if they want to stay alive at this resort.</p>

<p>The three RPGs produced by Nigredo Press are system-agnostic experiences aimed at enthusiasts with an emphasis on visual impact and novel gameplay ideas.</p>

It is an investigative RPG packed with Lovecraftian horror and pulp-storytelling. It even allows players to create their own unique endings by piecing together Clues. In an industry packed with other Lovecraft RPGs like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/call-of-cthulhu-arkham-review-supplemental-strangeness" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Call of Cthulhu</em></a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook-review-this-is-halloween" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Arkham Horror RPG</em></a>, that novelty is notable..</p>

<p>The second book, <em>Flail Kult</em>, is an artbook featuring the work of Arcane Throne. It is a collection of black-and-white illustrations of brutal mythology with spiked weapons.and the endless cycle of time.</p>

<p>Last but not least is <em>Forsaken Scriptures</em>. It is a collection of minimalist word-maps designed for Mork Borg and other fantasy RPGs. It condenses the text visuals of whole dungeons into single images for easy no-prep adventures.</p>

<p>At time of writing, there is no concrete release date for these books.</p>

Told through narration, <em>The Lake House</em> recounts Estevez’s investigation into the titular location, an FBC facility that has gone dark. Like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-night-springs-review-dlc-1851583087&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-night-springs-review-dlc-1851583087"><em>Night Springs</em></a></span>, the first of <em>AW2</em>’s expansions, <em>The Lake House</em> is a bite-sized experience that will take you only two to three hours to complete. That’s perfect, as it lets Remedy tell a more concise story with a clear point of view.</p><p>Despite being more closely connected to 2019’s <em>Control </em>than anything else in <em>AW2</em>, don’t expect <em>The Lake House</em> to play like that supernatural action game. Estevez isn’t packing special powers, just a pistol and a flashlight. As in the base game, you’ll collect a few more weapons along the way (including an entirely new armament) to fight off the now-infected inhabitants of the Lake House. As a conclusion to the AW2 experience, <em>The Lake House</em> clearly wants to challenge you, boasting some tough fights against large groups of enemies made even tougher by a seemingly abysmal amount of resources throughout the facility. If you aren’t careful, you’ll find yourself with an empty clip and no other option than to face your inevitable death and restart with a better plan. </p><figure id="" data-id="788e398a26370b05865facf6924b2149" data-recommend-id="image://788e398a26370b05865facf6924b2149" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="728" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A government agent points a gun and flashlight at a large paint monster" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A government agent points a gun and flashlight at a large paint monster" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="788e398a26370b05865facf6924b2149" data-recommend-id="image://788e398a26370b05865facf6924b2149" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="728" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A government agent points a gun and flashlight at a large paint monster" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The expansion’s titular facility gives <em>The Lake House</em> its own aesthetic identity, one that’s far more in line with <em>Control</em>. This is an FBC building, after all, and as soon as you walk inside its concrete lobby, the sleek brutalist architecture might almost make you feel like you’re back in the Oldest House. The enemies you encounter within the facility, like the weapons you find, are mostly rehashes of what you saw in the base game, a bunch of zombie-like figures who’ve been infected by the Dark Place. There is, however, something else lurking within the Lake House: looming humanoid figures dripping with paint that jump out of canvases to kill you. The Lake House itself is decorated with countless paintings and graffiti across its walls (alongside lots of blood).</p><p>The physical art you encounter around every corner in the Lake House represents the facility’s (and the expansion’s) continued obsession with the artistic process. Unlike Wake himself, and many other important figures in the extended lore of the series, the major players in <em>The Lake House </em>are not artists themselves, yet they are preoccupied with the production of it. The competing co-heads of the facility, whose story <em>The Lake House </em>truly is, conducted experiments in an effort to harness Wake’s ability to reshape reality through art, a path which ultimately plunged the building into chaos.</p><p>As you explore the levels of the Lake House, you’ll read emails and memos about two dueling projects, both of which seek to quantify the emotion of an artistic piece in some objective manner that can then be replicated. One researcher attempts this by dragging in a painter and forcing him to adhere to an inhuman production schedule to create the correct art for triggering a supernatural power like Wake’s. The opposing project believed that it could recreate the outcome of Wake’s writing through observation, measurement, and replication.</p><figure id="" data-id="c3ec9b8a73c4bf9be8fe452607142845" data-recommend-id="image://c3ec9b8a73c4bf9be8fe452607142845" data-format="jpg" data-width="825" data-height="464" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A government agent points her flashlight at a row of automated typewriters" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A government agent points her flashlight at a row of automated typewriters" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c3ec9b8a73c4bf9be8fe452607142845" data-recommend-id="image://c3ec9b8a73c4bf9be8fe452607142845" data-format="jpg" data-width="825" data-height="464" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A government agent points her flashlight at a row of automated typewriters" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the most striking environments in <em>The Lake House</em> is a sprawling open office filled with dozens—maybe hundreds—of automated typewriters trained on pages written by Wake that the FBC recovered. The mechanical whirring of machines and cacophonous clicking of keys produces countless pages of text. In a room off to the side you can find a white board on which researchers graded each resulting page on metrics like tone, style, readability, etc. There is a constant desire to define what makes something “art.”</p><p>It’s a not-at-all subtle takedown of artificial intelligence in tech, specifically products like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-openai-sam-altman-twitch-emmett-shear-1851035956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-openai-sam-altman-twitch-emmett-shear-1851035956">ChatGPT</a></span> that scrape the work of real creators in order to produce empty facsimiles of art that impress only the most unimaginative people. Remedy beats you over the head with the sheer stupidity of both the Lake House experiments and their real-life counterparts. Signs plastered on the walls encourage workers to not decorate their desks and remind them that “art is for analysis.” At one point, a page written by Wake describing the projects within the Lake House reads “art was not art, just content for the experiment.”</p><p><br>That’s <em>Alan Wake 2</em>’s final message to audiences. Art is not content. It’s a word that’s become so much more prolific across cultural discussions in recent years as the proponents of AI push us toward conceiving of every piece of art as simply a product for viewer enjoyment rather than a thing that can challenge your worldview. Games are not content. Writing is not content. Art is not content. Those who create are not cogs in a machine to be used and disposed of or turned into food for an algorithm. <em>The Lake House</em> is Remedy’s clear statement that the push to quantify and replicate art without emotion is nothing short of a horror story. As far as farewells go, it’s a pretty fucking good one. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2 id="h-best-goblin-mk2-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best Goblin Mk2 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Ranger Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag I</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Commando Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs</li>
</ul>



<p>The <strong>Suppressor</strong> will come in handy to hide your position in the minimap, and of course, suppress the gunfire sounds of the AR. The <strong>Ranger Foregrip</strong> will improve the weapon’s accuracy and mobility by enhancing the horizontal recoil control and sprinting movement speed.</p>



<p>Attach the <strong>Extended Mag I</strong> and you will have a few extra bullets in the magazines that will be useful in shooting down some more enemies. The <strong>Commando Grip</strong> will significantly improve the aiming and sprint-to-fire speeds, enhancing the weapon’s handling.</p>



<p>Lastly, attach the <strong>Recoil Springs</strong> mod for some more improvements in horizontal and vertical recoil control.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-goblin-mk2">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for Goblin Mk2</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>For Assault Rifle loadouts, <strong>Enforcer</strong> is the best specialty you can use and it’s no different for the Goblin Mk2. Equip Gung-Ho, Assassin, and Double Time to activate Enforcer and enjoy temporary buffs in movement speeds and health regeneration rates.</p>



<p>Once you unlock <strong>Perk Greed</strong>, keep Dexterity in the fourth Perk slot. This will ensure you face less weapon sway while sprinting, jumping, and sliding your way through enemies.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-goblin-mk2">Best Secondary for Goblin Mk2</h2>



<p>Use the fully automatic pistol, <strong>Grekhova</strong>, as a secondary weapon with the Goblin Mk2.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-goblin-mk2-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock Goblin Mk2 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You need to reach <strong>player level 46</strong> to unlock the Tsarkov 7.62 in BO6.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-goblin-mk2-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the Goblin Mk2 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Yes, the Goblin Mk2 offers great TTK and mobility but fails to be among the meta weapons in BO6 because of its slow fire rate.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-goblin-mk2-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the Goblin Mk2 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The best alternatives to the Goblin Mk2 in BO6 are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-as-val-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AS Val</a>. Both of these Assault Rifles are dominating the meta right now, thanks to their insane TTK, fire rates, and mobility.</p>

<p>100 Thieves made an interesting business move today regarding its franchise spot in the LCS (League Championship Series). The popular esports organization announced it has officially sold its franchise spot while transitioning to a Guest Partner. </p>



<p>What does all of this mean, though?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-100-thieves-transitions-to-guest-partner-in-lcs-after-selling-franchise-spot">100 Thieves Transitions to Guest Partner in LCS After Selling Franchise Spot </h2>



<p>100 Thieves has been a part of the LCS for some time now, being one of the biggest organizations with a franchise spot. However, as the company makes new strategic plans for its investments, it would seem like being franchised by LCS is not in its future anymore. </p>



<p>However, 100 Thieves will still be involved with the league. </p>



<p>“Riot has made the strategic decision to buy back the slot and we have been presented with a unique opportunity to transition as a provisional Guest Partner for the 2025 season,” said 100 Thieves on Twitter.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>So, what does this mean?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-100-thieves-to-become-a-guest-partner-in-lcs">100 Thieves to Become a Guest Partner in LCS</h2>



<p>It is no secret that League of Legends esports was the birthing place for 100 Thieves’s esports program. Hearing them exit the franchise may come as a shock, but it does not mean the team is done competitively with the game.</p>



<p>The team has made it to four of the seven championships ever hosted in the LCS, cementing them as one of the best teams in the league. Now, with its exit from the franchise, 100 Thieves is officially a Guest Partner.</p>



<p>This means that the team will still have a slot in the LCS (now known as the LTA); they will just not be investing in the league like before. </p>



<p>However, this asks many questions regarding the team’s financial status. While 100 Thieves may be one of the biggest esports organizations in the world, having to sell its franchise spot in one of the biggest esports only leads to the belief that the team is struggling financially.</p>



<p>Sure, they are a Guest Partner for 2025, but what about 2026? Will the 100 Thieves League of Legends team even exist at that point?</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged">Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</a>, the newly remastered edition of developer Revolution Software's classic point-and-click puzzle adventure, finally has a Switch release date following its recent delay, and will launch next Thursday, 7th November.
</p>
<p>
Shadow of the Templars first released in 1996 (a Director's Cut remaster arrived in 2009), charting the adventures of American tourist George Stobbart - later with assistance from photo-journalist Nicole Collard - as he becomes embroiled in a global conspiracy after witnessing a bombing on the streets of Paris, perpetrated by a man dressed as a clown. It deftly weaves historical fact and fiction into a thoroughly engrossing, occasionally thrilling whole that quickly earned it fans, and it's been considered a classic of the point-and-click genre ever since.
</p>
<p>
Revolution Software's Reforged edition of the game launched for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation back in September, introducing a variety of upgrades, including "beautiful" re-drawn 4K backgrounds, re-animated sprites, enhanced audio, and other quality of life improvements. Its Switch release, however, got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged-delayed-on-nintendo-switch">last-minute delay</a> in order to "ensure the quality of play remains equally high across all versions of the game".

<p>
Six weeks later, and Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged finally has a release date of 7th November on Switch's eShop, where it'll cost £24.99/€29.99/$29.99. In a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/revolution-software/broken-sword-reforged-collectors-edition/posts/4238562">message shared on Kickstarter</a>, Revolution noted the Switch version will include all fixes and enhancements made to the PC version since launch, with other Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PS5 set to receive them "very soon".
</p><p>
As for what's next, a sixth game in the Broken Sword series, Parzival's Stone, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/broken-sword-parzivals-stone-is-a-new-entry-in-the-classic-point-and-click-adventure-series">announced last year</a>. It sees George and Nico caught up in a terrifying conspiracy featuring Nazi treasure hunters, brutal mediaeval histories, and Quantum Physics, where ruthless technology entrepreneurs, corrupt government agencies, and billion-dollar global energy corporations are battling for possession of a manuscript pointing to the secret location of the mythical thousand-year-old Grail - just perhaps not the one we're used to hearing about. Parzival's Stone was originally due to launch in 2024, but was delayed to an unspecified future point earlier this year.

			<p>If you're getting stuck into the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly released</a> Dragon Age: The Veilguard and want to know who you can romance ahead of time, this guide will tell you everything you need to know. In total, there are six characters you can romance, and a lot of the time, being able to bump up your relationship with them involves completing <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hands-on-preview-rook-takes-queen-checkmate/">certain quests</a>, picking specific dialog options, and the like. It functions the same way it does in most games, where you can romance a companion. This guide will tell you about each character you can romance and some of the best ways to win their favor.</p>
<h2>All Romance Options in Dragon Age: The Veilguard</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>As stated above, there are&nbsp;<strong>six characters</strong> that you can romance. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harding</li>
<li>Neve</li>
<li>Bellara</li>
<li>Davrin</li>
<li>Emmrich</li>
<li>Taash</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to romance the characters, you'll want to make sure that you are checking the&nbsp;<strong>Lighthouse</strong> frequently. This is a hub that shows which characters you can interact with, and this will give you an opportunity to have conversations with them, which can also lead to progress in your bond with them. As you progress your relationship with the companion, you'll also be given the option to take on their personal quests. If you complete them, it also has the option to provide additional context and conversations where you are able to flirt with them.</p>
<p>Should you be undecided on who to romance, you are given the option to flirt with all of the companions for a time until you reach a point in a relationship with one of them where they ask for commitment. Then, it's up to you to decide your next move.</p>
<p>In addition to having conversations with the companions, completing any quest will boost your relationship with the companions that are in your party. If you're trying to romance someone specific, it's generally recommended that you keep them in your party throughout the game to be able to boost their relationship as you go. While quests provide approval boosts with your companions, completing faction-specific quests can also grant approval boosts to the companions in those specific factions.</p>
<p>As an example, if you're fighting off Venatori enemies in Dock Town, this will increase your relationship with Neve but will not increase your relationship with the other companions available.</p>
<p>It's also possible for specific companions to romance each other. It's uncertain at the moment whether it's based on who you pick or if it's just guaranteed to end up that way, but there is the possibility of seeing some of your friends romance each other.</p>
<p>That's everything you need to know about all of the romance options in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p>Who will you be romancing first?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sony-is-furthering-its-monopoly-in-gaming-with-the-latest-layoffs-claims-cwa/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Two days ago, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the closure of two PlayStation Studios: Firewalk, maker of Concord (reported to have cost over $200 million and <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down</a> mere days after its launch), and Neon Koi, which would have attempted to bring some of Sony's prized IPs to mobile.</p>
<p>Now, the CWA (Communications Workers of America) has released a rather scathing statement accusing Sony of furthering its gaming monopoly with the layoffs. They also plan to share their concerns with antitrust regulators. Here's the relevant excerpt from the statement:</p>
<p><em>This devastating news comes on the heels of record layoffs across the video game industry. These decisions by highly insulated video game CEOs are creating perilous working conditions for video game workers by eliminating their job stability. Last month, former Sony Computer Entertainment Europe President Chris Deering suggested that laid-off game workers should “go to the beach for a year,” further demonstrating the lack of respect executives have for their workforce amid layoffs.</em></p>
<p><em>Alongside these layoffs, Sony’s decision to dissolve studios outside their walled garden of PlayStation-exclusive content rather than making games that have to compete in the highly diverse and competitive mobile game market should be a cautionary warning sign of Sony’s interest in furthering its monopoly position in the video game industry. CWA plans to raise the anti-competitive impacts of Sony’s increasing monopoly and monopsony power with the appropriate antitrust regulators, policymakers, and stakeholders.</em></p>
<p>The CWA previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-will-apply-to-activision-blizzard-60-days-after-deals-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed</a> a labor neutrality agreement with Microsoft and favorably <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-x-microsoft-deal-backed-by-cwa-in-ftc-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hailed</a> the company's acquisition of Activision Blizzard (which, however, came with its own heavy cost in layoffs).</p>
<p>Sony is about to launch a new console, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/ps5-pro-everything-you-need-to-know-about-sonys-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, on the market. We've recently interviewed two game developers (<a href="https://wccftech.com/empire-of-the-ants-tech-qa-pushing-visuals-with-ue5-in-an-rts-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tower Five</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-achieves-significant-performance-improvements-says-dev-the-most-impressive-aspect-is-pssr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexon</a>) to hear their impressions on the hardware.</p>
<p>Today, Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/playstation-ceos-hideaki-nishino-hermen-hulst-1236194125/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an interview with Hideaki Nishino, CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment's Studio Business Group. In the conversation, Nishino discussed Sony's vision for the PS5 Pro:</p>
<p><em>We have done Pro in the last generation. We learned a lot from there. When we were selling PS4 Pro, in addition to the PS4, 20% of customers actually got the PS4 Pro. It was high-end, premium tier. There are potential users acquiring those kind of units. Interestingly enough, it was not just about highly engaged users; actually, new users came to PlayStation to get PS4 Pro as well.</em></p>
<p><em>We started working on PS5 Pro even before PS5 launched — it was another five-year project for us. There was a conversation around whether we wanted to do another Pro or not. But the main thing was, there are technologies we can grow up in three years or five years. The innovation and technology advancement is quicker in the modern world. Phones are updating every year, PCs are updating every year. I don’t think we’d go every year updates, but there are things we can package together to bring the greatest things into game console segment range. That’s the vision.</em></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7 for $699/£699/€799.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/no-more-room-in-hell-2-review-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes playing No More Room in Hell 2 feels like actually being in hell. One minute, you're approaching a console to start flipping switches with friends, and the next, you're completely stuck – no keyboard inputs work, you can't equip any of your items, and your teammates have to try and lure a zombie over hoping it will put you out of your misery. Issues like this are part of a large pile of problems that could be excused by its Early Access label on Steam; there's only one map released so far, character models are incomplete, and there are plenty more bugs to encounter. But that grace only goes so far. While No More Room in Hell 2 is technically playable, it's not close to actually feeling Early Access-ready. And even if it weren’t riddled with bugs and light on content, it still doesn't have a distinct identity to differentiate it from being yet another co-op survival horror shooter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No More Room in Hell 2 follows a similar structure to its predecessor's objective-based game mode. Eight players are dropped onto a forest-covered map, and must complete tasks while trying not to get killed by zombie hordes. As is common in survival horror games, you'll have to scavenge for weapons, health items, ammo, and other gear to get a leg up, all of which will be in generally short supply. The first No More Room in Hell took a lot of inspiration from George Romero's Dawn of the Dead with how the zombies (here called "stiffs") function, and that continues to be to its benefit in the sequel: They're slow and shambling, but are huge threats in groups. And the further you get into the map, the more dense the hordes get. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">No More Room in Hell 2 Early Access Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is all pretty standard for a co-op zombie shooter, but No More Room in Hell 2 uses some smart tricks to help you boost both your kit and your team. You'll spawn randomly at one of eight points around the edges of the sole map, called Power Plant, and work your way towards the middle, completing objectives along the way that'll provide you with all-important gear but also up the difficulty as the hordes get bigger. The map isn't huge, but it's large enough that you might not run into another player until the final area at the center – your teammates don't even show up on your HUD unless you're in a party (in which case you’ll also spawn near them), and you'll only hear them through voice chat if they're physically close enough. That does mean a lot of each round involves going out of your way to team up, but it's an excellent added objective that can make things feel more tense. If you fail, you'll be stuck with some poor loot and nobody to help you up if you go down. It also adds a sense of progression that changes up the map as you go, and a great way to make it feel like your actions are rewarded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the key area where No More Room in Hell 2 excels: fostering cooperation. Sure, I may have been trapped in a horrible glitch that prevented me from evacuating successfully with the rest of my team, but at least I got to watch them try everything they could to free me from my prison. As you all descend on the final area, you're cleverly forced to work together, and you form some temporary camaraderie as a result. If you squint through the egregious bugs — clipping through walls, zombies not dying despite taking damage, guns not dealing damage at all — you can see a game that emphasizes teamwork in smart ways. And despite having just one map, it's the perfect place to watch your crew's story unfold. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The key area where No More Room in Hell 2 excels is fostering cooperation.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Power Plant offers plenty of opportunities for grouping up through optional objective locations. Completing them will provide you with loot: guns, bullets, health, and sometimes special items that give passive bonuses. You <em>could </em>potentially make it to the end without stocking up at one of these points, but this is a survival horror game where supplies are scarce, so you will want to get through at least one of these areas. They're also easy to find; you can either navigate towards one with the help of your map and compass, or you'll just stumble upon them. When one of two commanders comes over the radio (one of which is surprisingly voiced by Deux Ex's Elias Toufexis) and tells you that there's a church nearby with supplies or a bar that's been booby trapped, I always wanted to swing on by — and any other player in the vicinity usually did too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gradually, you'll find your teammates at these locations, where you'll have to work together to complete a series of tasks for your reward. Usually that involves things like finding fuses and placing them inside fuse boxes to power up rooms, turning on generators, or connecting wires within wire boxes. Most require basic puzzle solving and timing to complete, but that's infinitely more difficult when you're being hounded by zombies. Additionally, solving these puzzles brings you into a separate menu that you have to exit if you want to fight back. It's times like these where it becomes important to watch your teammate's back. If they can focus on the task at hand, and you somehow defeat all the zombies, you can move onto the next one. There are even tasks that involve having one player read a randomly-generated code to another to unlock a screen or move a process forward. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the time you reach the final objective, everybody still alive will have grouped up naturally. Of course, this is when the difficulty is amped up, all but requiring you to work together and coordinate your moves. It’s a tense finale where you're running around, flipping switches, and entering codes to boot the plant back up — all while trying to avoid the biggest zombie horde yet. You can all split up and handle different parts of this objective, but you will all still be in the same area working toward the same goal, and it's, quite frankly, impossible not to help your teammates at least a little bit since there are so many zombies to kill. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of a few tips (save your ammo, jump on cars to get away briefly, etc.), you won't get any in-depth tutorials when you first launch No More Room in Hell 2, and your first round will likely be stressful and confusing as a result – especially if you run into a game-breaking bug. Since there's only one map, it doesn't take long to figure out how to complete the various objectives and where to go to successfully complete a run, but this is also where things get the most repetitive. The first time you encounter some of these locations, like the Lookout Tower or the Ranger's Station, it can be a tense battle to turn on the power, fill up generators, and hit all the correct buttons before getting overrun by zombies or going through all your supplies. After a few rounds, though, you start running through those areas easily. At least, that is until you run into some unwelcome difficulty spikes depending on if you happen to encounter a teammate or have enough gear. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A few areas that feel too large or unnecessary can lead to getting lost.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You also don't need to approach every zombie encounter by making a decision to shoot or not to shoot. The tools you have in your arsenal and how you use them have an impact, too. You're always equipped with a flashlight, but having it on will alert zombies. Using a shotgun can disperse a group, but will quickly alert even larger groups waiting nearby. There are items that can let you control crowds, such as a radio or a deployable lamp, but they're rare and tough to throw down in late-game scenarios where you're completely surrounded by zombies, making them interesting ideas that aren’t very useful in practice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a sort of immersive sim quality to how you complete each No More Room in Hell 2 run. Beyond how you approach combat, you can take multiple routes to different locations – there isn't a lot of variety, but it's enough that you can run in any given direction and most likely find a path forward. The level design is on its way to being excellent, with strategically placed dirt piles or trucks that let you climb over fences and lead you to alternate routes. That said, there are also a few areas that are too large or feel outright unnecessary to begin with that can lead to you getting lost. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also multiple character types you can choose from before starting a run, each with forgettable names and descriptions like "Football MVP" or "Marine Veteran." They all provide distinct but small buffs to things like two-handed melee damage, stamina, or flashlight battery lifespan. You don't get a choice of character on your first run, but after you die, you'll select between three randomly-generated types each time. As long as you don't die, you can continue building these characters up through experience and supplies collected during a run. If you <em>do </em>die, you lose everything, and you’ll still lose progress if you leave a match early to try and avoid death. It incentivizes you to do well and provides an actual end if you die in-game (and come back as a zombie your teammates can kill). That connection would be more impactful, however, if there were more than the small handful of character models that frequently repeated. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Then there are the bugs — so, <em>so </em>many bugs. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's these cut corners that currently pull me out of what could be a game on track for a standout full release one day. Yes, there's a lot of leeway you can give to an Early Access launch, but many of the pieces of No More Room in Hell 2 aren't even <em>close </em>to complete. For all the things I like about the map, there are also paths on it that quite literally lead to nowhere. While there are plenty of objectives scattered around, they're obnoxiously inconsistent in terms of difficulty; Some feel downright insurmountable in small groups, while crossing a bridge after opening its gates — something that should feel like a huge moment — can be completed by simply running forward and occasionally strafing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there are the bugs — so, <em>so </em>many bugs. Every Early Access game (and most fully released ones, for that matter) has them, but many here are inexcusable. When I first started playing at launch last week, shotguns didn't always do damage. I was clipping through walls into closed off rooms where I quickly became trapped by zombies, some of which didn't die despite constantly being peppered by bullets. Objective markers wouldn't show up on the HUD, which is kind of a problem when you're a newcomer and don't know where you need to go. Sometimes I'd look at a teammate and they'd just be a floating head. It's a mess.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Best games with actual zombies in them</h3><p>These are games with the classic walking undead in them. No Las Plagas here.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">To its credit, developer Torn Banner Studios has been working diligently on hotfixes since launch, and has released some very impactful updates over the course of my review period. Shotguns are now more reliable, map markers consistently show up, and I can actually accomplish puzzles without getting stuck or clicking on a switch multiple times before it responds. There is still a long way to go before it reaches an acceptable state, but prioritizing hotfixes instead of working on the planned content roadmap is the right call in the short term, and has already resulted in some huge improvements.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, those content updates are desperately needed, too, and ideally something in them to help it stand out from the pack. It's been eight years since No More Room in Hell 2 was first teased, and over a decade since the original No More Room in Hell was spun off from a Half-Life 2 mod into its own standalone game. While the sequel follows a similar structure to its predecessor, with the same darkness-drenched atmosphere, scarce loot, and relatively weak characters, it doesn't offer the same ethical dilemmas and tension building. Gone are the child zombies that were much faster than the standard ones and left you understandably uncomfortable about killing them, for example. The goal was to build a world that felt like an actual apocalypse, where your choices mattered beyond just survival. In contrast, No More Room in Hell 2 is on its way to presenting a world that feels like it's falling apart around you, but in terms of tone and the underlying story, it's just another standard zombie shooter with a focus on getting rescued at the end.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">If you pull back the layers of performance issues and bugs, No More Room in Hell 2 has a lot of potential. It plays around with clever ideas about how to get players to work together through some excellent level design, but those concepts aren’t explored enough yet to make it more than just another co-op survival horror shooter with generic guns and scarce loot. No More Room in Hell 2’s Early Access launch at least allows you to team up with friends for a few chaotic and sometimes fun rounds, but with a single available map that gets repetitive fast and a mountain of serious bugs that cause unexpected problems, it needs a lot more time in the oven. With a slew of hotfixes already arriving and more supposedly on the way, hopefully the flames of hell are hot enough to cook it to perfection down the line, but you should probably wait until they do.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Just a week after the launch of Intel's latest generation of desktop CPUs, AMD has fired back with the announcement of the first 3D V-Cache-equipped chip in the company's 9000-series CPUs, with the promise of it being the fastest gaming chip on the market.</p><p>The <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1225/the-gaming-legend-continues-amd-introduces" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a> is the latest in a growing line of 3D V-Cache CPUs, with each one proving to be an essential part of an enthusiast-gaming PC. It's the first to feature AMD's 2nd-generation 3D V-Cache technology, with AMD saying that this latest CPU is on average 8% faster than the previous generation's 7800X3D, widely regarded as the best CPU on the market for gaming performance. Perhaps more telling of Intel's recent woes is the fact that AMD states that the 9800X3D is on average 20% faster than the flagship Intel Ultra 9 285K that launched last week.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMBqNbHUrs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZTMBqNbHUrs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The 9800X3D also increases the base clock speed 4.7 GHz, with a boost of 5.2GHz and a TDP of 120W. All in all, AMD is hoping that this will improve the 9800X3D's productivity performance too, which the series has lacked in the past. It will also be the first X3D chip unlocked for overclocking, letting enthusiasts attempt to squeeze even more out of the silicon with meaningful tweaks.</p><p>The 9800X3D launch is just around the corner, with the chip expected to hit shelves on November 7. This performance comes at a cost, however, with the 9800X3D retailing for $479. That's $30 more than the launch price of the 7800X3D, which can also regularly be found on sale for below $400. Given that both the 7000 series and 9000 series utilize the same motherboard chipset, there's now even more choices if you're in the market for a PC upgrade.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yakuza%E2%80%99s-tv-adaptation-does-the-only-thing-it-can-do.1024581/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/yakuzas-tv-adaptation-does-the-only-thing-it-can-do<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I can see the overarching appeal in turning <em>Yakuza</em>: <em>Like A Dragon</em> into a TV series. It's gotten wildly popular in the West in recent years. There are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Dragon_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> previous adaptations to learn from</a>. And at some level it's a reliable ol' story about a place, a man, his heart and his fists.</p><p>If that's all the thought you wanted to put into this show, and that's all you were looking to get out of it, Amazon's confusingly-named <em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza</em> will be all you ever needed from it. Making the decision to tweak the game's timeline and backstory to better suit the format, it's a show about a group of friends who grew up in an orphanage together, and are now moving to the big city to make a name for themselves. It jumps constantly between 1995 and 2005, the former scenes looking back on their formative years and arrival in Kamurocho (that big city), the latter a group of very changed people a decade after some shit has clearly gone down.</p><p>As a tale of our hero Kazuma Kiryu becoming the man we know him as today, of soap opera drama and fistfights that sometimes border on the comedic, this is everything a superficial adaptation of <em>Yakuza</em> needed to be. From everyone's wardrobes to the streets of Kamurocho itself, nearly every visual cue from the games has been recreated down to the most minute detail, and it's a joy seeing real people wearing real clothes navigating the fake city's all-too familiar streets.</p><p>Once you get past the fact that no actual man could physically fill that suit, Ryoma Takeuchi does a decent job playing Kiryu, the fight scenes are great and the entirety of the show's <em>Yakuza </em>cast are as slapstick and self-deferential as you'd hope. It's a cool TV show! If you have never played the games and just want to sit down and watch something set in Japan that has underworld intrigue, loads of brutal fights and some explosions, then <em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza </em>will absolutely tick all those boxes.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Like A Dragon: Yakuza - Official Trailer | Prime Video" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B4tmmzh2PfA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>If you <em>have </em>played the games, though--<a href="https://aftermath.site/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-spoilers-kazuma-kiryu-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and reader, I know you knew this bit was coming</a>--it doesn't take long for the show to feel a little <em>weird</em>. It succeeds as an adaptation if all you cared about was the show tracing over the game's broadest outlines, but it also fails as an adaptation because the games it's trying to adapt simply cannot be converted to TV, at least in this format.</p><p>What the creators of <em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza </em>have done is look at this sprawling, tonally inconsistent and downright weird series and selectively plucked out the only part of it that could ever hope to be adapted: the main storyline. From a practical standpoint, that's understandable! But whenever you talk to someone who has played these games and ask them why they love <em>Yakuza</em>, nobody ever says it's for the main story.</p><p>It's<em> Yakuza's</em> bizarre, heart-warming and frequently hilarious sidequests that really prop up the series, taking what would otherwise have been a musty story about gangsters and loyalty and elevating it into the realms of the classically absurd. From giant manbabies <a href="https://aftermath.site/yakuzas-ai-mission-throws-chatgpt-into-the-river-where-it-belongs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to AI-powered phones</a> to running a hostess club to talking to chickens, it's this extra, wild shit that defines the experience, and a limited, linear TV show could never hope to address that madness. It's a miracle the games, even taking their 100+ hour playtimes into account, are able to.</p><p>That duality, the straight-laced sitting alongside (and being frequently punctuated by) the absurd, is what makes <em>Yakuza Yakuza</em>. Kiryu isn't Kiryu if he's not splitting his time between grimly serious dialogue and a batting cage. So seeing him portrayed as he is in this TV series, with <em>only </em>the drama, is like seeing yin without yang, light without shadow. He's only half a man, and this is only half a show.&nbsp;</p><p>I think a longer, serialised thing might have been the better play here. We could have a central storyline running through everything, but if we want to have a whole episode about managing a baseball team in a small coastal town, then we could have that too.</p><p>The half that's there is good! And if you didn't know any better, that's great, enjoy it! But this is a video game website and I'm a <em>Yakuza </em>freak, so of course my thoughts on this adaptation are pegged entirely on the nature of its adaptation, more so than the merits of the show itself. And for me, it's impossible to see the man on screen and not see the giant, unspoken holes in his life as well.&nbsp; You can't be <em>that</em> serious, Kazuma Kiryu, I know we just saw you get some bad news about your personal life, but right afterwards (and off camera) you probably went and raced some little toy cars as a palette cleanser, and that shit looked <em>fun</em>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-character-trailer-shows-off-the-kindred-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-character-trailer-shows-off-the-kindred-in-vampire-the-masquerade-%E2%80%93-bloodlines-2.1024554/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-character-trailer-shows-off-the-kindred-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room have released a trailer showcasing the characters from the Camarilla Court in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. If you've been wanting to get a closer glimpse into the characters from the game, this trailer shows you what you can expect from how the Kindred interact with players and how they move around the streets of Seattle. The characters all have drastically different personalities, with Benny being a stern character with a potty mouth. Tolly is a unique character with a big personality; Safia is forgetful and quaint, while Lou is demanding and ever-present.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 - ‘A Betting Man’ Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2cXtEoGx7E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In a short trailer just over a minute, the characters all get a brief showcase so you can see them in action, whether it be in combat or conversation with the characters mentioned. This trailer ties in nicely with Dev Diary 15, which was released in August, and discusses the Dialogue Choice system and how you will be able to interact with the different characters in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2.&nbsp;<span><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-dev-diary-explains-dialogue-choice-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We have already covered</a> this dev diary,&nbsp;</span>and we trimmed it down into bite-size pieces for you to read through.</span> Although the trailer showcases the characters ever so slightly, it doesn't provide much information about them other than their main traits and tiny glimpses into their interactions with others.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-dialogue-choice-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dialogue choice system</a> that The Chinese Room have put in place, it gives you many different options on how you can interact with the characters in front of you and it's mentioned in the dev diary that they wanted to make sure that the choices didn't have any hidden dialogue or choices that may screw over your character unintentionally due to context not being added. This is something that can happen easily in story-based games, as sometimes prompts don't give the entire conversation, or the characters react in a way that seems totally unexpected.</p>
<p>Hopefully, as we get closer to the release date of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, we will get to see more of the Camarilla Court. Additionally, <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-camarilla-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dev diary 16</a> was about the Camarilla Court and provided some additional context which can help you read between the lines from the short trailer that was provided today. The dev diary gives quotes from each of the characters, as well as an in-depth description of who they are and what role they play within the court.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Best Horror Games to Play This Halloween]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-horror-games-to-play-this-halloween/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-horror-games-to-play-this-halloween.1024551/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-horror-games-to-play-this-halloween/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you're looking to get stuck in with the scary season but aren't sure what games to play for <a href="https://wccftech.com/halloween-getting-unreal-engine-5-game-john-carpenter-involved/">Halloween</a>, this list compiles some of the best horror games that you can pick up. The list will include both indie games and triple-A for those who prefer a smaller-scale experience. Hold on to your hats, as this list features some of the best scares you can get on the market right now.</p>
<h2>Silent Hill 2 Remake</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silent-Hill-2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Whether you play the original Silent Hill 2 or the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> that was recently released, you're in for a good time. The Remake did a great job of keeping it authentic and much like the original, but added in some extra scares and puzzles to keep the game fresh. For the best experience, you'll want to play this game with headphones, as Bloober Team knocked the sound design out of the park. From Mary's little gasps to the possible chance of hearing whispering from the original, you're not going to want to miss out on all the easter eggs they've included in the Silent Hill 2 Remake.</p>
<h2>Outlast</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/outlast.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238320/Outlast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outlast</a> is one of the classic horror games that most people play or try to play when diving into the horror genre. If you haven't played it already, you're missing out. Having to explore an abandoned asylum where the lights don't seem to work very often adds to the atmosphere. Combine that with having to use your video camera to be able to navigate and see your surroundings; it can get pretty intense.</p>
<p>Be warned, there is a ton of nudity and a lot of gore, so it may not be the horror game for you if you're the squeamish type.</p>
<h2>Crow Country</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/crow-country-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1996010/Crow_Country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crow Country</a> was released earlier this year and took the gaming world by storm. This was the perfect game to bridge the gap while waiting for the Silent Hill 2 Remake, as it takes place in a theme park, much like some of Silent Hill 3. It also features amazing PS1-style graphics, which are perfect for those who are looking for a hit of nostalgia in their horror. The style of the game is great for those who want to feel on edge and have a little bit of fear running through their veins but don't want to experience the realistic jumpscares that are found in more modernized horror games.</p>
<h2>Phasmophobia</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/phasmophobiaHD.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you're looking for an all-around comedic time with some friends, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phasmophobia</a> is the way to go. Of course, just because you're with friends doesn't at all mean you're safe, and you may find yourself getting jumpscared a fair few times. The game is quite goofy and is a lot of silly fun, but sometimes the silence is so thick it puts you on edge, especially if you're hunting ghosts by yourself. Make sure not to get killed by the ghost, and everything will turn out fine. Luckily, Phasmophobia just came out on console, so you can now play with your friends on PlayStation and Xbox if you're on PC!</p>
<h2>Alan Wake 2</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>It's pretty recommended to play the original Alan Wake games before jumping into <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>, but you're in for a wild ride when you do get around to it. Not only are the graphics absolutely stunning, but there are more scares than ever. If you're a fan of survival horror, Alan Wake 2 is a great game to get stuck into. On top of that, it's perfect for those who love a twisty story, as there is certainly plenty of that.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-whos-the-real-monster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Lake House DLC</a> just came out for Alan Wake 2 as well, so it's a perfect time to get stuck into the game with all of the DLC available. It will also get you excited for the upcoming title, Control 2. You can't go wrong with any of the Remedy Entertainment games, but Alan Wake 2 is certainly one you don't want to miss out on.</p>
<h2>Dead by Daylight</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead by Daylight</a> is another perfect game to play with friends or family. Whether you're the killer and you're hunting them down, or you choose to survive along with your friends (or strangers), there's plenty of fun to be had. You're likely to spend the entire time on edge while trying to fix generators, only for the adrenaline to really get pumping if you miss a skill check on the generator.</p>
<p>On top of that, there are many iconic killers that you can find yourself running away from, including the beloved Xenomorph, Pyramid Head, and even Michael Myers. Dead by Daylight is highly accessible, too, as it's on every platform and is cross-play, allowing you to play with your friends who may be on a console while you're on PC.</p>
<h2>Alien: Isolation</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Alien-Isolation-2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/214490/Alien_Isolation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alien: Isolation</a> is one of the most iconic horror games from modern-day gaming. First released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, the graphics were really ahead of its time. Even now, the game looks absolutely phenomenal, and you will be on edge as you explore the ship. There are plenty of moments for a false sense of security, and the Xenomorphs aren't the only thing you have to worry about on the ship with you. By the way, did you know a sequel has just been <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-isolation-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be in development?</p>
<h2>Still Wakes The Deep</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFstillwakesthedeep2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/still-wakes-the-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Still Wakes The Deep</a> is one of the more recent horror games to be released, and it certainly lived up to its name this year. If you're looking for a Halloween horror, this stunning and horrifying game is perfect for you. Taking place on an oil rig, you have to try and survive while dealing with the otherworldly creature to try and save yourself and your crew mates from certain death. If you have a fear of the ocean or deep sea creatures, you may want to avoid this one.</p>
<h2>Mouthwashing</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mouthwashing.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2475490/Mouthwashing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mouthwashing</a> is a recent release and is the perfect game to play for Halloween if you're looking for a game that is tense and confusing and has that PS1 surrealist vibe to it. It will leave you on edge and also feeling very confused about what's going on as you slowly uncover the story of the crewmates on the spaceship named Tulpar. The crew mates descend into madness, and you aren't far behind.</p>
<h2>Visage</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>If you're looking for a game that has a P.T. feel to it,<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/visage-terrifying-mystifying-satisfying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Visage</a> is the perfect game. Not only are there episodic stories for you to work through, but there are also puzzles and great sound design that will torment you long after you've completed the game. Visage is quite jumpscare-heavy at times and tackles a lot of difficult themes, but it is absolutely worth playing if you've got the time this Halloween.</p>
<h2>Little Nightmares</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/little-nightmares.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/little-nightmares-ship-of-horrors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little Nightmares</a> is the perfect horror game for those who are a bit sensitive to jumpscares and other elements you'd typically find in horror. It's scary without their heavy jumpscares and relies on great character design, storytelling, and puzzle-solving to keep you on edge. Little Nightmares also has some great DLC to accompany it, as well as a sequel if you find that you have enjoyed what's on offer from this title.</p>
<h2>Resident Evil 7</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>While a lot of the Resident Evil games focus on killing zombies and trying to fight for your survival against hordes of enemies and the like, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-7-survival-horror-king/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resident Evil 7</a> goes down a more stereotypical horror route. You have to explore the grungy southern farmhouse and uncover a ton of horrifying secrets. The family you meet are not what they seem, and they are bound to have you on edge. If you enjoy Resident Evil 7, Resident Evil Village ties in nicely to 7 to finish the story.</p>
<p>That concludes our list of horror games to play for Halloween. What will you be playing tonight?</p>

It almost seems like with every new entry of late the series has strayed from the desires of its outsized and fairly casual audience. <em>Call of Duty </em>is, after all, one of those games that most people pick up once a year and play till the next one comes along, much like a sports game. Folks who play those games tend to want refinements of core principles rather than drastic or convoluted reinventions.</p><p>All of which is to say, <em>Black Ops 6</em>’s return-to-basics approach was a welcome bit of news among the cacophony of showcases, directs, and overbearing blog posts about why <em>this </em>game would be the best <em>Call of Duty </em>ever. After <em>MWIII</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-3-call-of-duty-single-player-campaign-1850991005&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-3-call-of-duty-single-player-campaign-1850991005">flop of an open-ended campaign</a></span>, <em>Black Ops 6 </em>doubled down on having a cinematic, blockbuster story mode like the best in the series have offered. Its iteration on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-impressions-xbox-1851681562&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-impressions-xbox-1851681562">Zombies feels like a healthy mixture of new and classic features</a></span> and mechanics. Even the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800">multiplayer feels sensibly pared back</a></span>, and it restores tenets that fans have missed, like the prestige system. Treyarch and Xbox clearly want us to think that <em>Call of Duty </em>is “back,” but is it really?</p><p>According to the reviews that <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is accruing on Steam, the answer’s a bit more complicated than a simple yes or no. Fans seem to generally agree that the campaign here is better than average, and some are even calling it the best story mode in a <em>COD </em>game in years. And of course there are players who have cherished the simplified renditions of both the competitive multiplayer suite and the cooperative Zombies mode, myself included. As is always going to be the case with a series this big and this polarizing, though, the more you look, the more people you’ll find who are disappointed in some of the game’s features.</p><p>One of the biggest problems many seem to have with <em>Black Ops 6 </em>actually has little to do with the game itself and more to do with the packaging, specifically the launcher, <em>Call of Duty HQ</em>. While the tool has been reworked since its initial release, it isn’t significantly better, and it seems to be even worse on PC, where fans of the series <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-launcher-sucks-bad-awful-review-1851684502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-launcher-sucks-bad-awful-review-1851684502">seem to hate it more than I do</a></span>! One review joked that <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is actually a “game is updating simulator.”</p><p>Elsewhere, <em>Black Ops 6</em>’s various modes are causing division. Some are appreciating their time with the competitive multiplayer suite, but there are also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-duty-black-ops-6-spawn-bug-blops-cod-1851682799&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-duty-black-ops-6-spawn-bug-blops-cod-1851682799">repeated mentions of terrible maps and spawns</a></span> throughout the reviews. Having played the beta extensively, as well as jumping in after launch, I can kind of agree that there don’t seem to be any unilateral winners among the crop of multiplayer arenas available right now. Zombies has enjoyed a more positive reception than multiplayer, but still there are players who are unhappy with the settings and crying out for more ambient (spookier) maps in the future.</p><p>Overall, <em>Black Ops 6 </em>seems to be earning its “Mixed” reception on Steam. It isn’t the greatest game, but it’s a perfectly fine and fun middling title, and that’s about all I need from it to have a great time. The divisiveness surrounding the game is at least producing some good material in the Steam reviews page, though, so read it and weep. </p><figure id="" data-id="04c1101de713e705ef1158eb55109f2e" data-recommend-id="image://04c1101de713e705ef1158eb55109f2e" data-format="png" data-width="1258" data-height="314" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Steam review reading, &quot;You spend more time loading up between Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies than actually spending time in those modes.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Steam review reading, &quot;You spend more time loading up between Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies than actually spending time in those modes.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Valve</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="04c1101de713e705ef1158eb55109f2e" data-recommend-id="image://04c1101de713e705ef1158eb55109f2e" data-format="png" data-width="1258" data-height="314" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Steam review reading, &quot;You spend more time loading up between Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies than actually spending time in those modes.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="f9fc45049d661aab0a47ebd327a229e1" data-recommend-id="image://f9fc45049d661aab0a47ebd327a229e1" data-format="png" data-width="1248" data-height="480" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Steam review reading, &quot;Campaign is pretty good and zombies is like Cold War with Classic features mixed in.

<p>Call of Duty players are already chomping at the bit, as they can’t wait for Ranked Play in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/">Black Ops 6</a>. Unfortunately, the competitive mode hasn’t been available at launch, but Treyarch have confirmed that the game will have it. That said, its absence and the recent trend in previous CoD titles to introduce the mode late has left the community wondering when it will arrive.</p>



<p>Here’s everything we know about when Ranked Play is coming to Black Ops 6.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-black-ops-6-ranked-play-release-date">Black Ops 6 Ranked Play release date</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-does-ranked-play-work-in-black-ops-6">How does Ranked Play work in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-what-modes-are-in-black-ops-6-ranked-play">What modes are in Black Ops 6 Ranked Play?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-will-black-ops-6-have-ranked-play-rewards">Will Black Ops 6 have Ranked Play rewards?</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-ranked-play-release-date">Black Ops 6 Ranked Play release date</h2>



<p>Ranked Play will arrive in Black Ops 6 on<strong> November 14, 2024</strong>, which is also when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-battle-pass-release-date-season-one-pass-details/">Season 1</a> begins. As soon as the first season update lands for Black Ops 6, players will be able to dive in and start their competitive journey, where they’ll be progressing through ranks and playing against similarly skilled enemies.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-ranked-play-work-in-black-ops-6">How does Ranked Play work in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.treyarch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Treyarch</a> will likely follow the same format as previous Ranked Play modes, with teams of 4 battling it out on a pool of carefully selected <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/">maps and modes</a>. Players will have to build their loadout, working around restricted weapons, Perks, and Equipment in the Gunsmith. </p>



<p>The restrictions and rules are based on the Call of Duty League (CDL), the esports scene for the iconic FPS franchise. Players will climb <strong>Skill Divisions</strong>, which could be the same ones found in MW3, Bronze to Iridescent. As you win games, you gain Ranked Points that move you up these divisions, while if you lose the opposite happens.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-modes-are-in-black-ops-6-ranked-play">What modes are in Black Ops 6 Ranked Play?</h2>



<p>We expect Black Ops 6 to have <strong>Hardpoint, Control, and Search and Destroy</strong>, but Treyarch are yet to confirm the modes. This is based on the modes that were available in MW3’s Ranked Play, which we expect to be similar to BO6’s.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-black-ops-6-have-ranked-play-rewards">Will Black Ops 6 have Ranked Play rewards?</h2>



<p>We haven’t got much information regarding Black Ops 6’s Ranked Play just yet, but <strong>we assume that the mode will come with a reward system</strong>. Players will likely receive various rewards based on the Skill Division that they reach, the higher up the ladder they climb, the better the rewards. </p>



<p>If the rewards are similar to previous iterations of Ranked Play, you can expect to earn Calling Cards, Emblems, Weapon Skins, and more.</p>

                <p>In 2008, Liam Neeson reinvented himself as an action star in Taken, a story about a former CIA officer who went to great lengths to rescue his abducted teenage daughter. That movie appears to be one of the primary inspirations behind Indifferent Penguin's upcoming game, Tackle for Loss. But the unnamed hero of this game has his own set of unique skills to unleash on the people who dared to kidnap his daughter in Tackle for Loss' reveal trailer.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq_EOKUhVYY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Bq_EOKUhVYY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>One of the other inspirations for the game seems to be chronic traumatic encephalopathy--or CTE-- a neurological disorder that is often associated with concussions suffered by American pro sports athletes, especially football players. The lead character in Tackle for Loss is aware of his condition, and the violence that it brings out of him. There's also a touch of tragedy to his story, as he admits to not being able to remember his daughter's name. All he knows is that he loves her, and he'll get her back no matter how many bad guys he has to pulverize.</p><p>Tackle for Loss has a very retro visual style that seems reminiscent of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hotline-miami-review/1900-6410681/" data-ref-id="1900-6410681">Hotline Miami</a>. The game does include some strategy by allowing players to unlock moves and upgrade their attacks as they progress through the story. Along the way, players will discover the truth behind the daughter's abduction and uncover a deeper conspiracy connected to the criminal underworld that took her.</p><p>German game developer Daniel Wichterich created Tackle for Loss by himself for his company, Indifferent Penguin. The game doesn't currently have a release date, but it is available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2930270/Tackle_for_Loss/?curator_clanid=44965716" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Steam's wishlist</a>.</p>

                <p>The debut of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Game Pass seemingly had a noticeable effect on engagement on Xbox, while the PS5 edition of the game saw a big jump as well in terms of active users. According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l7swcxzmmr2l" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Circana analyst Mat Piscatella</a>, the Call of Duty HQ app--which includes Black Ops 6, Warzone, and Modern Warfare III--was played by 52% of active Xbox Series X|S users and 34% of active PS5 players on October 28. That compares to 19% and 18% on October 23 for Xbox and PlayStation, respectively.</p><p>The 52% for Xbox and 34% for PlayStation figures represented all-time highs for Call of Duty HQ, according to Piscatella, who was citing Circana's own Player Engagement Tracker.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 Campaign Review</p>
      </div>
<p>The previous highs for US daily active player engagement for Call of Duty HQ on Xbox Series X|S was 34% (August 31, 2024) and 27% on PS5 (September 7, 2024).</p><p>What does this all mean? Piscatella wants to see more data before drawing conclusions, but for now, he said it supports the idea that Black Ops 6 coming to Game Pass "very likely helped" improve engagement results on Xbox while also not significantly detracting engagement statistics on other platforms. "Still early, needs more data," Piscatella said.</p><p>"(And btw... over HALF of all daily active players on a platform playing one game [Call of Duty HQ] is bonkers engagement)," Piscatella said.</p><p>Microsoft and Activision previously announced that Black Ops 6 had the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">"biggest" three-day opening weekend in franchise history</a> for total number of players, hours played, and matches. It was also recently confirmed that Activision has now sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">more than 500 million Call of Duty games.</a></p><p>During an earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said Black Ops 6's release on October 25 set a record for new Game Pass subscriber additions on launch day, though he didn't offer a specific figure. Nadella <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1851744627226734807" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">went on to say</a> that Black Ops 6 sales on PlayStation and Steam were up "over 60% year-over-year" compared against 2023's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.</p><p>Black Ops 6 expands this week with the launch of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-iconic-nuketown-map-arrives-to-black-op-6-this-week/1100-6527448/" data-ref-id="1100-6527448">highly anticipated Nuketown multiplayer map on November 1</a>. After that, Black Ops 6 Season 1 begins on November 14, and this also includes the introduction of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-season-1-start-date-confirmed-and-its-very-soon/1100-6527474/" data-ref-id="1100-6527474">Call of Duty: Warzone's newest map, Area 99.</a></p><p>For more, you can check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Black Ops 6 campaign</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review/1900-6418309/" data-ref-id="1900-6418309">multiplayer reviews.</a></p>
