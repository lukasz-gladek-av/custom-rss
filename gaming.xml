This new edition expands the book with two additional chapters and a new chili recipe written by Rogers.

                <p>Nearly a year ago, Rockstar Games debuted the first trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2025-release/1100-6518649/" data-ref-id="1100-6518649">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which marks the franchise's first sequel since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-6414475/" data-ref-id="1900-6414475">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> in 2013. Fans had been hoping that today's fiscal report for Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, would include a new GTA 6 trailer. While that didn't happen, Take-Two did confirm that the GTA sequel is still on track for a fall 2025 release.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/17/take-two-ceo-on-gta-vi-release-upswing-in-mobile-gaming.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick acknowledged that some of the company's previous games have slipped from their originally announced release dates. However, he expressed his confidence that GTA 6 would make its release window. Zelnick also stressed that the extended development of the game is more centered on enhancing the experience rather than ironing out bugs.</p><p>"In the case of an extraordinary title, for which there are extraordinary expectations, it's not really about bugs, it's about creating an experience that no one's seen before, and Rockstar Games seeks perfection in what they do," explained Zelnick. "And perfection is indeed hard to measure, it really is more subjective than objective."</p><p>The company noted in this year's fiscal statements that GTA 5 has sold 205 million copies to date across all platforms, while Red Dead Redemption 2 had 67 million copies to its name. Take-Two also revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-announced-during-opening-night-live-coming-2025/1100-6525977/" data-ref-id="1100-6525977">Borderlands 4</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mafia-the-old-country/" data-ref-id="5000-640433">Mafia: The Old Country</a> are set to be released during the company's fiscal 2026, which should fall between April 1, 2025, and March 31, 2026. The other upcoming titles mentioned by name, CSR Racing 3 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-successor-judas-is-a-procedurally-generated-roguelite/1100-6522180/" data-ref-id="1100-6522180">Judas</a>, don't have release windows yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/take-two-sells-private-division-gta-vi-on-track-for-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In the <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/take-two-interactive-software-inc-reports-results-fiscal-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new financial report</a> for the second quarter of Take Two's fiscal year 2025, they have announced that they've sold Private Division,<a href="https://wccftech.com/private-division-is-likely-to-be-sold-or-closed-down-by-take-two/"> the company</a> behind games like OlliOlli World and, more recently, No Rest for the Wicked, which was only released in Early Access on PC in April 2024. At the moment, the buyer of Private Division is completely undisclosed, and it remains a mystery as to who could have bought them out. However, Take-Two Interactive has stated that they have purchased "substantially all of Private Divisions live and unreleased titles." This message comes with the confirmation that support for No Rest for the Wicked will continue, and the support will be continued by Take-Two themselves.</p>
<p>The stated reason for selling Private Division is that the company now wants to focus on the "core and mobile businesses for the long term." Management of Take-Two has stated that the company remains "exceedingly well-positioned for the long-term," which a clear vision in mind, and has "one of the strongest portfolios of owned intellectual property in our industry."</p>
<p>When it comes to finances, Take-Two has mentioned that they have made $1.47 billion in Net Bookings with outperformance from both the Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands franchises. GTA VI is a game that is highly anticipated by fans of the franchise, with the first trailer being shown earlier this year. However, since that trailer, there have been very few details about the game. Additionally, this year saw the release of the Borderlands movie, which didn't exactly perform as they had hoped.</p>
<p>"I am pleased to report that we delivered strong second-quarter results. Our Net Bookings of $1.47 billion were at the top of our guidance range, driven by the continued success of the Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands franchises, and our operating results surpassed our plans, largely due to a shift in the timing of marketing expenses within the year," says Strauss Zelnic, Chairman and CEO of Take-Two Interactive.</p>
<p>With this in mind, they have reiterated that they are expecting a massive increase in Net Bookings for the fiscal year 2025 and have hoped to make $5.55 to $5.65 billion. The report also states the upcoming release dates for Take-Two's future lineup, including Civilization VII, WWE 2K25, and, of course, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-sales-not-affected-by-launch-window-take-two-ceo-believes-expects-game-to-move-consoles-aplenty/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, which is due out in the Fall of 2025.</p>
<p>What remains to be seen is whether selling Private Division will lead to layoffs within the company. Unfortunately, this is a typical cycle when companies are sold or acquired by others in the industry.</p>

            <p>
Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> has announced the sale of its indie-focused publishing label Private Division. Additionally, the company has finally confirmed the closure of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/olliolli-world">OlliOlli World</a> developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/roll7">Roll7</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a>'s Intercept Games, six months after CEO Strauss Zelnick insisted, "We didn't shutter those studios."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidians-new-rpg-is-being-published-by-take-twos-new-label-private-division">announced the formation of Private Division</a> back in 2017, specifically to publish games from smaller independent teams. Since then, it's released the likes of Obsidian Entertainment's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> and Moon Studios' No Rest for the Wicked, set up a new development team - Intercept Games - to create a sequel to Kerbal Space Program 2, and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-division-buys-olliolli-developer-roll7">acquired Roll7</a>, which later released OlliOlli World and Rollerdrome.
</p>
<p>
However, 2023 brought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-confirms-layoffs-reported-to-affect-private-division-and-more">word of layoffs at Private Division</a>, and a flurry of reports this May suggested a major shift in strategy for the label. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloober-team-is-working-with-take-two-to-develop-a-brand-game-based-on-a-new-ip">previously announced publishing agreement with Silent Hill 2 Remake developer Bloober Team</a> was cancelled, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kerbal-space-program-2-studio-reportedly-shut-down-by-take-two">mass layoffs were reported at Roll7 and Intercept Games</a>, as part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-laying-off-550-people-weeks-after-saying-it-had-no-current-plans-to-do-so">five percent reduction in staff</a> company wide, effectively bringing an end to the studios. That's despite CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-boss-claims-publisher-hasnt-shut-down-olliolli-and-kerbal-space-program-2-studios">later insisting</a>, "We didn't shutter [them]". Shortly after, it was reported Take-Two was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-is-reportedly-set-to-close-roll7-and-intercept-and-sell-off-private-division">looking to sell Private Division</a> amid word only a skeleton crew was left at the label to work on No Rest for the Wicked.

<p>
And now, as part of its Q2 2025 earnings report, Take-Two has confirmed the sale of Private Division. "We recently made the strategic decision to sell [the] label to focus our resources on growing our core and mobile businesses for the long-term," Zelnick said in <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e938f73a-cfd7-46ac-b308-3f5b55acaeb7">prepared remarks</a>. "As part of this transaction, the buyer purchased our rights to substantially all of Private Division's live and unreleased titles." However, Take-Two - which hasn't revealed Private Division's buyer - will continue to support No Rest for the Wicked despite the sale.
</p><p>
"The team of Private Division did a great job supporting independent developers and, almost to a one, every project they supported did well," Zelnick said in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zelnick-on-private-division-sale-those-projects-were-smaller-were-in-the-business-of-big-hits">separate comments made to GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "However, the scale of those projects was, candidly, on the smaller side, and we're in the business of making great big hits." Additionally, a Take-Two spokesperson confirmed that Roll7 and Intercept Games were closed prior to the sale of Private Division.

And last year, we only had our WWE title.”</p>



<p>No other information was given about the next game in the franchise. It’s also unclear if this was an announcement that was supposed to be made or just a slip of the tongue.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Mike Straw had been reporting that the next game was well in development and was expected to release in 2025. Wednesday’s call seemingly confirmed that information.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Take-Two for more direct comment on the reveal from the earnings call. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

<p>Publisher Take-Two Interactive unveiled sales data for several of its big titles and franchises, including the entire Red Dead Redemption series, as part of its earnings call. You know, we’ve been quite curious about the Red Dead Redemption sales over the years, especially considering the sequel is often called one of the greatest single-player video games of all time. Well, now we know!</p>



<p>According to the earnings report, the entire Red Dead Redemption series has sold more than 92 million units to date. Red Dead Redemption 2, as expected, accounts for the vast majority of series sales, with more than 67 million units sold since launch.</p>



<p>As part of its announcement, Take-Two shared a few stats:</p>



<ul>
<li>Red Dead Redemption 2 is the second best-selling title in the U.S. in the past six years.</li>



<li>Red Dead Online launched as a standalone in 2020 but was included with every copy of Red Dead Redemption 2.</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare were re-released on PS4 and Nintendo Switch in August 2023 and PC in October 2024.</li>
</ul>



<p>Despite these obviously impressive sales numbers, we still have yet to hear about Red Dead Redemption 3. Is it happening? When?!</p>



<p>In the comments below, let us know how badly you want a new RDR. Or, visit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a> to discuss the franchise, share screenshots of Strawberry, or find a group to play online with!</p>

Often times, you can scoop up the console at a discount, or purchase limited-time bundles that include additional games, Xbox Game Pass trials, accessories, or in-game content.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Trade in Your Old Xbox</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to trade in your old Xbox consoles, you can do so at select retailers in-store and online. Often, the most widely available retailers are <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/trade/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameStop</a> and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/services/best-buy-trade-in/pcmcat133600050011.c?id=pcmcat133600050011" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Buy</a>. However, you can also trade your used devices online at retailers such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/l/9187220011" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/microsoft-trade-in" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some retailers will offer you cash for your used goods, while others may provide you with a gift card that can be used in-store and online. This is a great way to offload your old gaming gear and get some money that you can put towards a newer console and games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While trading devices in at retailers will often net you the lowest amount for your used consoles, there are also online marketplaces such as eBay, Craigslist, and OfferUp that may fetch higher prices, but you'll often be responsible for packing and shipping costs, or be required to meet someone in person for the transaction, the latter of which poses its own risks.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Trade in Xbox Games</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to Xbox console trade ins, you can also trade your existing games in at specific retailers. The most widely available retailer accepting used video games is <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/trade/?cgid=video-games&amp;tileView=list" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameStop</a>, but they are notorious for giving you pennies on the dollar for your pre-owned titles. However, if you're looking for an easy way to offload some of your library for cash or in-store credit, this is a convenient option. You can always look up the expected trade-in value on GameStop's website before heading into a store, so you know exactly how much you'll receive. Additionally, you can trade in your used games online through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/l/9187220011" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> in exchange for an Amazon gift card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matthew Adler is a Commerce, Features, Guides, News, Previews, and Reviews writer for IGN.

At least projects like <em>Bloodborne Top Down Arena </em>are continuing to keep the hype alive in the meantime. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-video-games-to-play-with-family-at-christmas/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Holidays are just around the corner, and with Christmas cheer comes family gaming time. Everyone loves to sit around an open fire and play video games with the family, but which games are best to play this Christmas?</p>



<p>Here are the top five best games to play with family at Christmas.</p>



<h2 id="h-top-video-games-to-play-with-family-at-christmas">Top Video Games to Play with Family at Christmas</h2>



<p>Do not get this list confused with the best Christmas games to play. This list solely is made up of the best multiplayer games to play with your family this Christmas.</p>



<p>While so many titles are out there waiting to be explored, there are a specific few that really hit the mark when looking for a family-fun game to play this Holiday season.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-all-lego-games">5. All LEGO Games</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>There are many different LEGO games out there, making it incredibly difficult to choose just one. However, all LEGO video games have a co-op mode, meaning you can explore the plot with another player.</p>



<p>And guess what? They are all family-friendly too! LEGO Star Wars, LEGO Batman and more all fit the bill as being some of the best games to play with family at Christmas. Whether you are looking for a galactic adventure or something else to sit down with your kids and play, any LEGO game should suffice.</p>



<p>LEGO games are also available on all consoles, including PlayStations, Xboxes and Nintendo Switches.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-4-minecraft">4. Minecraft</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another great game for the family to explore together is Minecraft. Not only is this game cheap, but it allows parents and kids to sit down and build entire worlds together. Explore your creativity with this game, building different landscapes the ways you want them.</p>



<p>Minecraft has been around for over a decade now, and still stands as one of the best multiplayer games out there, whether it is with friends or family.</p>



<p>This Christmas, though, anyone with a PC, Switch, Xbox or PS5 will be able to sit down and play this popular game together, making it the perfect video game for the Holidays.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-3-super-smash-bros-ultimate">3. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Need a game with a bit more action? Super Smash Bros. Ultimate takes all the famous Nintendo characters, allowing players to fight each other with them. Smash Bros has been around since the N64, being one of the most popular competitive games out there. The game is a Nintendo exclusive, though, so will only work on the Switch.</p>



<p>Still, this game is great for anyone, as you do not need too much knowledge to actually enjoy the fighting process. With maps resembling your favorite Nintendo character’s world, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will have any gamer excited.</p>



<p>While the game includes fighting, it is still toon-animated, meaning there is absolutely no blood or gore.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-2-mario-kart">2. Mario Kart</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Can’t have a list of games to play at Christmas with the family without including Mario Kart. With Mario Kart 8 Deluxe being the current Nintendo racing game on the Switch, families can jump in a vehicle and race each other just like back in the ’90s when the N64’s version was released.</p>



<p>The game even has a plethora of classic maps too for those who have not played the game in years to explore. Mario Kart has always amped up the action in every title Nintendo has released, making it one of the most popular multiplayer games in the world.</p>



<p>Mario Kart is perfect for anyone looking for a fun game to play with family during Christmas.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-1-mario-party">1. Mario Party</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>With the Nintendo Switch having a few versions of Mario Party for families to play, it is easily the best game to play with your loved ones this Christmas. With mini-games and more, this game is accessible to just about anyone, making it well worth the purchase if you do not have it yet.</p>



<p>With classic maps and new ones, Mario Party is basically a board game using classic Mario characters and more. At the end of each round, players compete against one another in different mini-games. Mario Party is just as much fun as it is competitive, making it the best game for families to play together at Christmas.</p>



<p>What game will you be playing this Christmas with your family?</p>

Those include “social hangouts,” where the primary purpose is to communicate with others over text or voice chat, and “free-form 2D user creation” experiences, where players can do things like draw on a chalkboard or whiteboard. This change goes into effect beginning November 18th.</p><p>Another change stops kids under 13 from playing, searching for, or being able to discover unrated experiences. This change goes into effect after December 3rd. If a creator wants to let a player under 13 access their game, they will have to complete a questionnaire and make sure that all of the information regarding their experience meets Roblox’s requirements for its current All Ages or 9 plus ratings. Roblox says it will start enforcing those requirements “next year.”</p><p>There have been multiple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24265145/roblox-hindenburg-reseach-dau-child-safety-short-seller-report">recent stories</a> about Roblox’ allegedly poor protections for children, including <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?srnd=undefined">a <em>Bloomberg</em> article</a> titled “Roblox’s Pedophile Problem.” In October, the company announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277992/roblox-pre-teen-children-parent-accounts-default-settings">changes for pre-teen users</a> and a new type of account to let parents manage their kids on Roblox.</p><p>“We’re constantly strengthening our safety systems and policies — we shipped over 30 improvements this year and we have more to come,” spokesperson Juliet Chaitin-Lefcourt says in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “As a company that’s transparent with our community of developers, we needed to share key information about the upcoming changes prior to launch. The&nbsp;DevForum&nbsp;has all the information on the upcoming changes that we’re sharing at this time. It’s important to know that at Roblox, we’re constantly innovating Safety and we’ll never STOP.”&nbsp;(Emphasis Chaitin-Lefcourt’s.)</p><p><em><strong>Update, November 6th</strong>: Added statement from Roblox.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But we’re not gonna delve into anything that actually happens in the game here. So don’t worry about that. But there are pages of concept art for hypothetical party members that didn’t end up in <em>The Veilguard</em>. Some of them would have been new characters that don’t have names, such as a qunari mage dressed in chains and tattoo-covered Antivan Crow. But there is one character in the book who would have been a returning character from 2014’s <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. However, she wasn’t an ally. In fact, you could kill her in your playthrough depending on your choices. This was magister Calpernia, who once led the Venatori mages against the player in one of <em>Inquisition</em>’s routes.</p><p>According to the art book, Calpernia was a potential party member at some point in <em>The Veilguard</em>’s development. She’s shown in the concept art in some regal armor, notably with a prosthetic leg. Neve, one of the party members who made it into the game, is a mage with a prosthetic leg, so it seems like some of those concepts may have been adapted for that character.</p><p>Logistically, it makes sense that BioWare would scrap this idea because Calpernia exists in so many different quantum states depending on player choice. But that hasn’t stopped fans from being upset about an underrated fan-favorite villain not making it into <em>The Veilguard</em>.</p><p>Personally, I have little attachment to Calpernia because I never encountered her in my <em>Inquisition</em> playthrough. The only way to get her to show up is by recruiting the templars in the game’s first act, and I’m a career mage who was trying to smooch Dorian. So Calpernia and I never crossed paths. But it’s always fun to know who might’ve joined the party sometime down the line. I mean, unless it upsets you to know this information. But Calpernia could still show up in a future <em>Dragon Age </em>game, assuming BioWare allows players to import choices on what happened to her.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Well, according to her it was due to her other, more family-friendly projects. <br></p><p>“So, when we recorded, [David Hayet] and I were in the studio together back in 2003,” said Benson. “Just, the various projects that I am affiliated with in my career are sort of family-based, children-based, things like that.

And according to Benson, at least one fan directly confronted her about the role back in 2017. </p><p>“Seven years ago, at various conventions where we meet and greet with wonderful fans, somebody slipped one of these wonderful games to my table,” explained Benson. “And I said, ‘Why are you bringing me that?’ and he [said] ‘Because you’re in it’ and I said ‘Do you know?

<p>Dota 2 is arguably the biggest esports in the world. With The International giving out millions of dollars every year, we have seen many new Dota players emerge into the scene. Dreaming of being one of those players? Well, you better start off playing ranked. </p>



<p>Here is a list of all the Dota 2 ranks.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-dota-2-ranks">All Dota 2 Ranks</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Herald</strong></li>



<li><strong>Guardian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Crusader</strong></li>



<li><strong>Archon</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legend</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ancient</strong></li>



<li><strong>Divine</strong></li>



<li><strong>Immortal</strong></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up-in-dota-2-matchmaking-rating-mmr-explained">How to Rank Up in Dota 2 | Matchmaking Rating (MMR) Explained</h2>



<p>Hitting the rank of Immortal in Dota 2 is incredibly difficult for any competitor, even the best. The game’s ranking system follows a Matchmaking Rating (MMR) system, which grants players MMR as they progress through the ranks. </p>



<p>To rank up, players will have to participate in ranked matches, winning games and more. </p>



<h4 id="h-all-dota-2-ranks-and-their-mmr">All Dota 2 Ranks and Their MMR:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Herald:</strong> 1 – 769 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Guardian: </strong>770- 1539 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Crusader:</strong> 1540 – 2309 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Archon:</strong> 2310 – 3079 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Legend:</strong> 3080 – 3849 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Ancient:</strong> 3850 – 4619 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Divine:</strong> 4620 – 5620 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Immortal:</strong> 5620+ MMR.</li>
</ul>



<p>When first beginning to play ranked, new accounts will have their MMR calculated after playing a series of matches. They will then be put into rank and awarded their first medal. </p>



<p>No one, however, will start in Immortal. With each loss, you will lose MMR, potentially dropping in rank. However, those playing core roles in matches (carry, mid-lane) will receive more MMR per win than those playing support roles (off-lane, soft support, hard support).</p>



<p>All Ranks, excluding Immortal, are split up into five parts. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-ranked">What is ranked?</h2>



<p>Ranked play is a special competitive mode in Dota 2 (and many other games) where players compete against one another, climbing a specialized ranked system. While the actual ranked system does not reward players outside of in-game rewards and bragging rights, many pro players still make sure to flex their high ranks amongst others.</p>



<p>With Dota 2 having such a large skill gap, it can be incredibly difficult and daunting for new players to attempt an Immortal run, but it is still entirely possible.</p>



<p>Will you be attempting to hit the Immortal rank in Dota 2?</p>

<p>By now, we’ve all heard or witnessed the atrocity that they’re calling the Borderlands movie. It receives staggeringly low reviews from critics and viewers alike, with low single-digit ratings for the most part. But apparently, it wasn’t all bad. According to Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick, the live-action film didn’t hurt the video game franchise, but it actually helped significantly.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-borderlands-movie-was-disappointing-but-didnt-hurt-at-all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Zelnick said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Obviously that movie was disappointing. That said, it actually sold more catalog. So, I don’t think it hurt at all, if anything I think it may have helped a little bit. It does highlight something that I’ve spoken about many times which is the difficulty of bringing our intellectual property to another medium.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now, by “catalog,” Zelnick refers to the collection of video games within the franchise, such as Borderlands 2, Tales From the Borderlands, and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. Essentially, the hype surrounding the film and people actually viewing it in theaters caused a significant rise in video game sales. People saw the movie, wanted more of the genuine article, and went to play the video games instead of re-watching the bomb film a second time. </p>



<p>If you saw the film and were one of the many who decided the video games were more your style, welcome! You should start by playing Borderlands 2, as it’s universally considered one of the best titles in the franchise. I didn’t mind the gameplay in Borderlands 3, but the writing and dialogue left me cringing more frequently than I’d typically like.</p>

<p>Take-Two Interactive held its earnings call for Q2 2025 on Wednesday, and with it came an update on the development of Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6.</p>



<p>In its <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/9aa55113-4f45-4264-8ff6-822353eddcd8">press release</a> for the earnings, it was said, once again, that the game will release in fall 2025. </p>







<p>The small update, which many won’t view as much of an update at all, continues the regular messaging from the company on the state of GTA 6. Over the last few months, Take-Two has continued to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-reaffirms-fall-2025-release-date-for-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaffirm people</a> that GTA 6 is scheduled for a fall 2025 release date. </p>



<p>As far as when a new trailer could be revealed, more details on the game’s features, or a more concrete release date announcement, the release didn’t mention that. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick didn’t provide any additional comment or context regarding the game’s release date or announcement plans during the actual call.</p>



<p>The first reveal of GTA 6 came <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-releases-gta-6-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly a year ago</a> when the first trailer was released. Since then, however, there’s been no update for a game that’s said to be a year away.</p>



<p>Do you still think GTA 6 will release in 2025? Join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>Following the closure of Roll7 and Intercept Games, Take-Two also revealed they sold off indie game publisher Private Division, but didn’t specify the buyer. Along with the sale of the company itself, Take-Two also sold off the publisher’s entire catalog of live and unreleased titles. However, they stated they would continue supporting No Rest for the Wicked, the recent Private Division-published action RPG from developer Moon Studios.</p>



<p>The publisher’s sale comes as part of the Take-Two earnings results, in which they said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are grateful for the contributions that the Private Division team has made to our company and are confident that they will continue to achieve success in their new home.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Supposedly, while the buyer remains unknown, a private equity firm did show interest in Private Division beforehand.</p>



<p>Private Division, as a publishing company, was behind multiple hit releases and upcoming games we had on our radar, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>No Rest for the Wicked</strong></li>



<li><strong>Tales of the Shire</strong></li>



<li><strong>The Outer Worlds</strong></li>



<li><strong>Kerbal Space Program 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>OlliOlliWorld</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hades</strong></li>
</ul>

            <p>
Sega's legendary <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter">Virtua Fighter</a> series is set to make a return, the publisher has confirmed, some 18 years after the launch of its most recent numbered instalment, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5">Virtua Fighter 5</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since then, there've been numerous updated releases of Virtua Fighter 5 (culminating with 2021's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a>, itself a remaster of the earlier Final Showdow), alongside mobile instalments, and even a arcade update for Virtual Fighter 3. What series fans <em>haven't</em> had, though, is a brand-new game.
</p>
<p>
But now, Sega's new global head of transmedia, Justin Scarpone, has offered some hope in an <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/why-sega-is-reviving-classics-like-shinobi-and-jet-set-radio-across-games-film-and-tv/">interview with VGC</a>. "So we have a suite of titles in development right now that fall into that legacy bucket," he explained, "which we announced last year at The Game Awards; <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a>, Streets of Rage, Shinobi."

<p>
Then came the bombshell. "And we have another Virtua Fighter being developed," Scrapone added, before glossing over the revelation completely, "And then in certain instances, we're also doing animation series, or live-action films to augment that and be part of those roadmaps." It's not, then, confirmation a new mainline Virtua Fighter instalment is on the way <em>exactly</em>, but it's something to chew on at least.
</p><p>
Despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-flurry-of-projects-including-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi">announcing a flurry of legacy game revivals</a> last year - including Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, Streets of Rage, Shinobi, Golden Axe, "and more" - details remain limited. Sega has shared a little about its Crazy Taxi update - calling it an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-new-crazy-taxi-game-will-be-open-world-and-massively-multiplayer">open-world, massively-multiplayer game</a> that's "AAA" in scope - but it's yet to talk launch windows, other than saying it'll "release these projects in the coming years."

The world's largest digital TTRPG distribution has implemented a new browsing option, allowing consumers to search for games and supplements made by human hands.</p>

<h2>The DrivethruRPG AI-Content Filter Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an update on <a href="https://help.drivethrurpg.com/hc/en-us/articles/26794784634007-Customer-Experience-with-AI-Generated-Content-Within-Titles#h_01J97G88WDYDR5K4EXEH739R99" rel="nofollow">their official website</a>, the DrivethruRPG AI-Content filter lets users toggle how much content made by generative AI they see on the platform.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/drivethrurpg-ai-content-filter-screenshot.jpg?itok=oPGuF4nO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/drivethrurpg-ai-content-filter-screenshot.jpg?itok=A0JdXQD9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In a User Account Settings under Additional Preferences, users can choose one of three options under "Creation Method." Handcrafted is for those who want games made by flesh and blood human beings. The worldbuilding, the text, the mechanics, and the artwork; all human-made.</p>

<p>Conversely, the Contains AI-Generated Content option is for those who are fine with products containing material made from generative AI programs. The product in question cannot be entirely AI-generated due to an official content policy by the platform. The third option, Creation Method Not Chosen, is the default.</p>

<p>If you are using the more recent version of DrivethruRPG, the AI-content filter is a simple on/off toggle alongside adult content.</p>

This is due to its current use across multiple tech companies <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/04/generative-ai-has-an-intellectual-property-problem">actively stealing</a> work from users to train their programs.</p>

<p>This practice has also led to widespread energy usage and resource drainage. This is exemplified by Microsoft negotiating a deal to r<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/20/nx-s1-5120581/three-mile-island-nuclear-power-plant-microsoft-ai">eopen Three Mile Island</a> in the US as a power source for their own cloud and AI power usage.</p>

<p>It is a subject that hasn't just lead to greater scrutiny of material used in large productions, and it has lead to several publishers and creatives to take stances on their use.</p>

<p><em>Tales of the Valiant</em> designer and publisher Kobold Press <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/kobold-press-ceo-says-no-to-generative-ai" rel="noopener" target="_blank">is proudly anti-AI</a>. Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks has <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks-expresses-support-of-ai-in-dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vocalized support</a> of the use of AI in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, which lead to their communications director, Greg Tito, leaving the company. And recently the streaming service platform Netflix has announced they are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">going all in</a> on generative AI for their gaming division.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/foxhole">Foxhole</a> is one of my favourite games to read about, even if I don't play it. It's a massively multiplayer World War 2 game, viewed from above, where battlefield logistics matters as much as aiming and flanking. Its developers have just announced a major new update coming next summer, Foxhole: Airborne, which adds planes to the game for the first time.
</p>
<p>Planes, in a topdown MMO? It makes a little more sense if you watch the trailer.

<p>Dropping bombs on the world below? I get it. Delivering paratroopers behind enemy lines? I love it. I'm less clear on how air-to-air combat works. There's a shot in the trailer of two nimble fighter planes diving and shooting down some bombers operating at a lower height, but I'm struggling to work out how that actually functions as a player action.
</p><p>Otherwise air combat plugs into Foxhole's vast battlefield is obvious ways. It expands the logistical side of the game, as players will need to work to support aircraft production and supply, and "every pilot is a player", as the trailer says, with players also able to play a gunner role onboard. 
</p>
<p>Foxhole Airborne follows on from Foxhole: Naval Warfare, which added ship-to-ship combat and beach landings <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/foxholes-massive-naval-warfare-update-is-out-now-adding-gunboats-and-subs-to-its-persistent-battlefield">in October last year</a>. It means that the game will now feature land, sea and air combat all on the same persistent battlefield.
</p>
<p>Lest foot soldiers feel they're being neglected, an infantry update will arrive later this month on November 18th. It aims to revamp combat, with new anti-tank weaponry, close quarters combat, medic changes, and a stamina and suppression overhaul, among others. It sounds like a robust set of changes. You'll find screenshots of that, and of more planes, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/505460/view/4438953498491486592">in a developer news post over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I need to remember that fascism is a loser ideology and that it can be dismantled, and I will gain all of this by replaying Bethesda and MachineGames’ <em>Wolfenstein </em>games and literally tearing men-turned-monsters to pieces. <strong>If I can’t have the real thing, I want to virtually preside over the rotting husk of fascism in </strong><em><strong>Wolfenstein</strong></em><strong>, which is widely available on platforms but is specifically on PlayStation Plus’s Games Catalog (at the Extra tier or higher), Xbox Game Pass, and, by extension, PC Game Pass.</strong></p><p>In case you don’t know, <em>Wolfenstein </em>is a series of first-person shooters following B.J. Blazkowicz, an American soldier who effectively goes missing during World War II. In <em>Wolfenstein</em>’s version of history, the Allied Powers lose the war and the Nazis conquer the world. Their ineptitude and hate creeps into every facet of life as far as the eye can see. Though the first game in this rebooted series, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-makes-wolfenstein-the-new-order-so-great-1797195901&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-makes-wolfenstein-the-new-order-so-great-1797195901"><em>The New Order</em></a></span>, largely takes place on the European front, the sequel shifts focus to America and beyond and interrogates how such an ideology could fit a country that once swore to combat it.</p><p>Nazis have been the de facto villains of a lot of stories both inside and outside of games, but the <em>Wolfenstein </em>reboots were the first games I played to take them deathly seriously. Perhaps <em>The New Order </em>was just a little ahead of the curve, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-the-kotaku-review-1819979622&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-the-kotaku-review-1819979622"><em>The New Colossus</em></a></span><em> </em>landed in 2017—mere months after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville—and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-ii-six-months-later-1825582710&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-ii-six-months-later-1825582710">met the moment head-on</a></span>, depicting fascism in our country as though it were baked into our very being. Who am I to argue with that assessment now?<br></p><p>Besides its lofty interrogations of Nazism though, the <em>Wolfenstein </em>series is also well known for its gritty gameplay. Like its earliest incarnations, these shooters did <em>not </em>feature regenerating health, instead offering armor and health as pickups to be found around the map or in combat. Much like the <em>DOOM </em>reboot of 2016, this inspired players to push forward and be aggressive in order to survive, a tactic that sounds all too good right now. <em>Wolfenstein </em>forces you to be scrappy, and the skirmishes that arise from the tension of scrambling under such duress are among some of the genre’s best.<br></p><p>I’ve always described <em>Wolfenstein</em>’s action and gunplay as punchy. Its guns have a tremendous kick to them. They communicate an overwhelming, almost frightening amount of power, which makes it oh-so-good to point said weapons at literal Nazis. Over the course of the games, B.J.’s armory expands, but he also becomes a proper Nazi deterrent. Through means that I won’t entirely spoil, the man essentially becomes a hulking tank capable of smashing, slashing, and otherwise ripping fascists to shreds. Describing it now, I’m almost giddy to jump back into the games in the days to come.</p><p>I don’t know, y’all. That’s all I’ve got for you right now. I’m a ball of pure seething anger, and I can only really safely project that into a false reality by playing <em>Wolfenstein </em>at the moment. Otherwise, I’m feeling as defeated as many of you. The rest of my life was just decided for me overnight, and I could do little to stop it. Things are going to happen, exceptionally bad things, and I’ll be helpless to stop most of it. But I can shoot some Nazis in <em>Wolfenstein</em>, rally, and get back to the real fight as soon as I can. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After 11 years, Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 5 continues to do well with players. Not only is it the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-stream-most-popular-in-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most popular game on stream</a>, but GTA 5’s sales continue to reach milestones.</p>



<p>During its <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest earnings call</a> on November 6, Take-Two Interactive announced that GTA 5 sales have passed 205 million copies in its 11-year lifespan. That total is up by five million from the 200 million copies announced during the company’s Q1 2025 earnings.</p>







<p>As a whole, the GTA franchise has sold over 435 million copies.</p>



<p>In addition to the sales success of GTA 5 and elsewhere, Take-Two praised GTA Online, which continued to be a major point for the company despite its age. According to the company, GTA Online continues to be one of the “largest contributors” to their net bookings despite expectations of a decline.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-interactive-gives-update-on-gta-6-development/">Take-Two Interactive Gives Update On GTA 6 Development</a></h6>



<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said that GTA Online has continued to “outperform expectations” thanks to updates and “sustained engagement”.</p>

And there's one card that everyone seems to agree they hate, whether they're using it or facing an opponent with it: Misty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Misty is a Supporter card, essentially a type of card that can be played once per turn to give yourself an advantageous effect. Misty is explicitly designed for use in decks featuring water-type Pokemon, and comes with the following effect: "Choose one of your water-type Pokemon, and flip a coin until you get tails. For each hads, take a water-type Energy from your Energy Zone and attach it to that Pokemon." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon need energy to use attacks on opponents, but typically you can only attach one energy to one Pokemon per turn. So the idea behind Misty is to quickly power up a single water-type Pokemon so it can use an Energy-intensive attack right away, rather than having to wait two, three, four, or more turns to blast away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, Misty's efficacy depends entirely on coin flips, meaning she can either be completely useless (if you flip tails right away) or so overpowered as to be ridiculous (if you flip more heads than you need). So of course, people who are using Misty in their decks are complaining about constantly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1fu4o9f/misty_card/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flipping tails </a>right away, and people who are facing Misty are posting...well, this:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/06/screenshot-2024-11-06-130544-1730919966599.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: u/Money_Tap2401 on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gi1rlo/ok_misty/">https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gi1rlo/ok_misty/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The frustrations with Misty's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gc6uyu/misty_is_a_lie/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">luck-heavy</a> potential are resulting in a lot of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1fw52i6/is_misty_badly_designed/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussions</a> as to whether or not the card design needs to be changed.

The biggest issue players are citing apart from her luck-heavy mechanic is that if a Misty-user gets luck and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gi9jex/how_are_you_supposed_to_come_back_against_a_turn/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">draws her turn one</a>, they can then use her to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1fw3zl8/misty_lets_you_attack_t1_and_its_bs/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potentially attack their opponent on turn one</a>. Typically, players are not able to attack on the first turn due to the game prohibiting attaching an energy on turn one, a fairness mechanic intended to ensure going second isn't a massive disadvantage.
