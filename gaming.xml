            <p>
The layoff train has come for BioWare. A number of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> staff are leaving the celebrated RPG company in the course of plans to become "a more agile, focused studio", as BioWare move ahead with the next <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> game. Posting on Bluesky, senior systems designer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kaieta.bsky.social/post/3lgvksfm67k2v">Michelle Flamm</a>, producer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jencheverie.bsky.social/post/3lgw5mb2srs27">Jen Cheverie</a>, editor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/karinww.bsky.social/post/3lgw2z5u3js2z">Karin West-Weekes</a>, lead writer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trickweekes.bsky.social/post/3lgw2zbjhfc2v">Trick Weekes</a> and narrative designer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ryancorm.bsky.social/post/3lgw7ga2li22x">Ryan Cormier</a> have all announced that they're looking for work.
</p>
<p>
All of which feels like it warrants a mention in general manager George McKay's recent blog about BioWare's future, but he comments only that they're "taking the opportunity to reimagine" how BioWare operate between projects, and "have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit." Which is a very slippery way to say that you're making a load of people redundant. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"Today, we are turning towards the future and preparing for the next chapter in BioWare's story," reads the full post from McKay, which was <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/01/29/bioware-studio-update/">published yesterday</a>. "As we announced in August 2023, we are changing how we build games to meet the needs of our upcoming projects and hold ourselves to the highest quality standards."
</p>
<p>For context, the August 2023 announcement was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-lays-off-around-50-employees-as-work-on-mass-effect-and-dragon-age-dreadwolf-continues">this one</a>, in which McKay revealed that BioWare would chop 50 roles in the course of "reorganizing our team to match the studio’s changing needs."</p>
<p>
BioWare are now doing some more reorganising, after ending production of a massive RPG. According to McKay, a "core team" led by Mass Effect trilogy veterans, including Mike Gamble, Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts and Parrish Ley, are currently working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>, or whatever they end up calling it. Other people have been transferred to other EA projects, with the quiet part being that they face redundancy if suitable roles are not to be found.
</p><p>
"In keeping with our fierce commitment to innovating during the development and delivery of Mass Effect, we have challenged ourselves to think deeply about delivering the best experience to our fans," McKay continues in this week's blog post. "We are taking this opportunity between full development cycles to reimagine how we work at BioWare.
</p>
<p>
"Given this stage of development, we don't require support from the full studio," he continues. "We have incredible talent here at BioWare, and so we have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit."
</p>
<p>
Our fellow Zifflings at Ian Games have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams">asked</a> BioWare and EA how many people have been laid off or retained in the course of the above "reimagining". According to a spokesperson, "while we're not sharing numbers, the studio has the right number of people in the right roles to work on Mass Effect at this stage of development." Which, again, is a very slippery way to say that a bunch of people are now unemployed.
</p>
<p>
Some more context for these decisions. Firstly, Dragon Age: The Veilguard hasn't sold enough for EA. The RPG "engaged approximately 1.5 million players" in the publisher's <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx">last reported financial quarter</a>, which was "down nearly 50% from the company's expectations". The game's most recent update was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-just-received-its-final-major-update">worded in such a way as to suggest there wouldn't be any more</a>. Game director Corinne Busche left BioWare earlier this month, though she has said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-game-director-leaving-bioware">this departure was voluntary</a>.
</p><p>
Secondly, the fourth main <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> game appears to have been quite a complicated production, even by blockbuster RPG standards. It began life in 2015 as a smaller, narrative-focussed project called "Joplin". Then EA and BioWare tried to turn it into a live service game, based on the code for ill-fated mechsuit bonanza Anthem. When Anthem flopped, they dumped the new Dragon Age project's multiplayer elements. That's around 10 years of decisions and indecisions, with key staff leaving in the interval - Joplin's original team lead Mike Laidlaw is now founder and director of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eternal-strands">Eternal Strands</a> developers Yellow Brick Games.
</p>
<p>
You can understand why EA and BioWare might want to avoid such a situation again. And while it may not be defensible - EA earned billions of dollars last year, and appear to be profitable - it's sadly not unusual for studios to scale back once they've shipped a big game, even when it has sold relatively well. I don't particularly doubt McKay's assertion that sincere efforts have been made to place people elsewhere. Still, if you're going to let a bunch of people go, you could at least do them the courtesy of saying that out loud.

Path of Exile 1's last league release was Settlers of Kalguur in July 2024. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://youtu.be/wF4rqnPoo80?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video message</a>, Path of Exile 2 game director and GGG co-founder Jonathan Rogers explained that the studio brought the Path of Exile 1 team across to help get Path of Exile 2’s endgame into shape ahead of the December launch, but thought that they would be able to return to get 3.26 ready for its mid-February launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It turned out that was impossible, given the myriad problems Path of Exile 2 has. “We were fooling ourselves,” Rogers admitted. Not only was Path of Exile 2 itself delayed a few weeks, but it suffered from crashes and balance problems that needed to be addressed immediately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“How could I justify taking some of the most experienced developers we have off PoE2 when it’s on fire?” Rogers said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is the Path of Exile 1 team is still working on Path of Exile 2, and will continue until Path of Exile 2 0.2.0 has shipped and probably a couple of weeks after that. “Unfortunately, I just can’t promise a date right now,” Rogers added. Path of Exile 2 is currently at 0.1.1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m really sorry for how this went down,” he continued. “Honestly, I should have predicted the fact that taking the Path of Exile 1 team off Path of Exile 1 would lead to this outcome, and I probably should have resisted doing it. But at every stage I just kept thinking, we still have time, we still have time. And then we didn’t have time any more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We still have a lot to learn about how to run two games simultaneously. We were overconfident. We still need to work out how to structure our studio to make this possible. But we do have a solid plan for what we want to do with 3.26.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The long wait for the Path of Exile 2 early access launch finally came to an end when it released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on December 6, 2024.

            <p>
The Japanese Nintendo eShop and My Nintendo Store will stop accepting card payments and Paypal from foreign accounts next month.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo made the announcement today, and said the decision had been taken "in order to prevent fraudulent use". 
</p>
<p>
As of 25th March, overseas customers who wish to continue using the Japanese eShop or My Nintendo Store will need to use an alternative payment method.

<p>
"Thank you very much for your continued patronage of our products," Nintendo wrote in a <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2025/0130.html">statement</a> on its customer support website.
</p>
<p>
"For customers who have previously used overseas-issued credit cards or PayPal accounts opened overseas, we ask that you please use other payment methods, such as credit cards issued in Japan, from now on."
</p>
<p>
The removal of foreign cards and Paypal payments makes for a significant barrier for anyone wishing to make purchases from the Japanese eShop - for instance to buy a game not released elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo may be looking to cut down on the number of people with multiple accounts on their console, with the ability to then browse different country's eShops and compare prices, ahead of the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
An easier option than obtaining a Japanese credit card remains the ability to purchase pre-paid Nintendo eShop vouchers - although these will need to also be for use in Japan.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-loses-trademark-fight-against-super-mario-supermarket">Nintendo had failed to stop a supermarket named Super Mario</a> from officially registering its name.

						<h5>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Founder's Edition</h5><p><span>January 30, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Type</h5><p><span>Desktop Graphics Card</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>In just a few hours, NVIDIA will officially launch its next flagship graphics card, the GeForce RTX 5090 Founder's Edition. There might well be shortages or price hikes, but that's another matter entirely. Hardcore PC gamers have been waiting for more than usual (the GeForce RTX 4090 launched in October 2022) to get a new GPU, and they're eager for it despite the high price (the graphics card's official MSRP is $1,999), as shown by the queues that have already started forming outside some stores. Should you be paying that much, though, even if you can afford it? In this article, I'll tackle that question after testing the graphics card strictly from a gamer's point of view.</p>
<p>First of all, some pictures of the hardware component and the package it came in. The GeForce RTX 5090's design is certainly very sleek, and I appreciate that it takes up two slots rather than three.</p>

<p>If you're a regular Wccftech reader, you're probably well-informed on all the specs and features of the GeForce RTX 5090 through <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5090-suprim-soc-32-gb-gpu-review-enter-the-realm-of-ai-charged-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our hardware coverage</a>. Still, a quick recap is in order. This is a monster GPU with 21760 CUDA Cores, 32 GB GDDR7 VRAM, 512-bit memory interface, 3352 AI TOPS for Tensor Cores operations, and 318 TFLOPS for Ray Tracing operations. With all that, it's no wonder it requires 1000W of system power, drawing up to 575W for itself.</p>
<p>On the productivity side, the RTX 50 Series includes hardware support for encoding and decoding the 4:2:2 pro-grade color format, as well as 9th Gen NVENC video encoders and a 6th Gen NVIDIA decoder. NVIDIA also added support for the latest DisplayPort 2.1b UHBR20 specification, which can go up to 8K@165Hz with Display Stream Compression (DSC).</p>

<p>The GPU is the pinnacle of the brand-new Blackwell architecture, which NVIDIA says is optimized for neural rendering. Doubling down on AI, NVIDIA has created the so-called RTX Neural Shaders (part of the larger <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-shows-how-neural-rendering-will-power-the-next-visual-leap-in-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Kit suite</a>), small neural networks that can be embedded into programmable shaders. An RTX Neural Shaders SDK lets developers train their game data and shader code on an RTX AI PC and accelerate their neural representations and model weights at run-time with NVIDIA Tensor Cores.</p>
<p>So far, NVIDIA has identified three key applications: RTX Neural Texture Compression, RTX Neural Materials, and RTX Neural Radiance Cache. However, all those will require support from the graphics APIs; Microsoft has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-directx-neural-rendering-ai-focused-graphics-nvidia-rtx-50-tensor-core-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the Cooperative Vectors are coming soon to DirectX 12. The Khronos Group will undoubtedly come up with a similar solution for Vulkan. Afterward, though, it will be up to game developers to implement these features in their games. Long story short, it might be a while before we see RTX Neural Shaders applied to actual games, making it automatically not a focus of the GeForce RTX 5090 launch reviews.</p>
<p>The same goes for NVIDIA Reflex 2; the new Frame Warp technology promises to cut down PC latency by up to 75% (the original Reflex reduced latency by up to 50%), which sounds great, especially for Multi Frame Generation since it slightly increases latency. But Reflex 2 isn't available yet - and it won't be exclusive to RTX 50 graphics cards anyway.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/21-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>What is necessarily at the front and center of every conversation surrounding the new RTX 50 GPUs is, of course, NVIDIA DLSS 4. Now, there's two parts to that: on one hand, NVIDIA has released a new, more advanced upscaling model based on vision transformer technology. So far, DLSS has been based on traditional CNN (convolutional neural network) models. According to NVIDIA, though, these models simply aren't smart enough to make the best choices, which sometimes translates into visual artifacts or ghosting. The new DLSS 4 transformer models are trained on twice the amount of parameters and, according to NVIDIA, already provide better results than CNN models, not to mention they can be further improved over the coming years, whereas CNNs have pretty much reached their maximum capabilities.</p>
<p>The new Ray Reconstruction model already improves image quality, while the Super Resolution model is being released as a beta.</p>

</figure>


<p>The new models are available to every GeForce RTX user. Similarly, the new Frame Generation model<span>, which&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-boss-doesnt-rule-out-possible-frame-generation-support-for-rtx-30-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaces the hardware Optical Flow accelerator</a> with a faster and more efficient AI-based model,</span>&nbsp;is available on both RTX 40 and 50 GPUs.</p>
<p>What's exclusive to Blackwell architecture graphic cards like the GeForce RTX 5090 is DLSS Multi Frame Generation. According to NVIDIA, there's a number of hardware advancements making generating multiple frames possible. The main one is the 5th Gen Tensor Cores, which reportedly offer up to 2.5X more AI processing performance. Moreover, the new graphics cards have been enhanced with hardware Flip Metering capabilities for optimal frame pacing. Previously, Frame Generation relied on traditional CPU-based pacing, which can introduce variability that affects smoothness. With the arrival of DLSS 4, NVIDIA has updated Frame Generation and Multi Frame Generation to use Flip Metering instead of CPU-based pacing, allowing the display engine for 40 and 50 Series GPUs to precisely control display timing.</p>
<p>With DLSS Multi Frame Generation, NVIDIA is promising absolutely massive performance gains of up to 8x in the heaviest games, like Alan Wake 2, Black Myth: Wukong, and Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-up-to-8x-faster-performance-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>However, those best-case scenario frame rate uplifts are measured with the DLSS Performance Mode; in this review, I've instead put the GeForce RTX 5090 through the grinder when using the highest quality DLSS setting available in any game, DLAA or, if that's not an option, Quality Mode.&nbsp; In all cases, I've enabled the maximum in-game settings without resorting to out-of-game tweaks or mods. 4K resolution has been selected in all instances.</p>
<p>The testing rig is:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D</li>
<li>MSI MAG B650 TOMAHAWK WIFI</li>
<li>32GB DDR5 6000 MHz</li>
<li>2TB NVMe SSD Western Digital Black SN850X</li>
</ul>
<p>Before starting, it's worth clarifying that all testing was conducted with the latest (not public yet) version of NVIDIA's FrameView software. There's a very good reason for that, as it is presently the only benchmarking software that accurately reports the MsBetweenDisplayChange metrics. With the aforementioned new Flip Metering, NVIDIA says that MsBetweenDisplayChange, rather than MsBetweenPresents, is the best metric to represent what the user actually sees. That's because it is reported near the end of the render pipeline after flip metering has occurred, whereas the measurement of MsBetweenPresents takes place earlier when flip metering hasn't yet paced the frames.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/86-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>As advised by NVIDIA, I exported FrameView data to be visualized with <a href="https://www.gpureport.cz/windows/FLAT/flat.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FLAT</a> (Frame Latency Analytics Tool), which was then used to create the frame time pie charts.</p>

				<p>With the release of the GeForce RTX 5090 Founder's Edition, NVIDIA has once again proved why it's the leader in the desktop GPU segment. The new graphics card features potentially groundbreaking new future-facing technologies like RTX Neural Shaders, but even in the here and now, it delivers extremely high performance even when testing the most taxing PC games with the maximum settings. DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation is another great advancement that is sure to keep the upscaler well ahead of the increasing competition, though perhaps the most impactful improvement is the hardware flip metering that greatly improves frame pacing and, therefore, smoothness. 

Once again, the only real downside is the pricing, which has received a sizable bump over the Ada generation, when the RTX 4090 cost $1,599. If money is no object, though, this is the GPU to get to realize all your 4K@200+Hz path traced gamer's dreams.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>The GeForce RTX 5090 delivers excellent performance in all tested PC games, even without DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation
</li><li>The hardware Flip Metering is a game-changer for how much it improves smoothness
</li><li>The RTX Neural Shaders ensure the graphics card will remain relevant for years to come</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>

            <p>
A TV series based on Quantic Dream's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/beyond-two-souls">Beyond: Two Souls</a> is in development, with Elliot Page's production company attached.
</p>
<p>
Despite the swathe of film and TV projects based on video games in the works right now, this one is something of a surprise. 
</p>
<p>
First released for PlayStation 3 way back in 2013, Beyond: Two Souls is another stylish but somewhat nonsensical narrative adventure by the maker of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/heavy-rain">Heavy Rain</a> and, later, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a>.

<p>
Page starred in the game as Jodie, a girl with special powers and a mysterious connection to a ghostly presence, alongside Willem Dafoe, who plays a creepy government researcher/father figure.
</p>
<p>
Behind the scenes, Page's time working on the project was notable for the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ellen-page-explored-legal-action-154256357.html">legal action lodged in response to Beyond: Two Souls' gratuitous shower scene</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Upon the game's launch, it was discovered that Quantic Dream had made a detailed nude model of Jodie's character for use in this scene (to the apparent surprise of Page, as the scene itself does not show any actual nudity). 
</p>
<p>
The model was quickly found  within the game's files and then spread online, prompting Page to explore the possibility of a lawsuit. Sony, the game's publisher, later sent takedown notices to websites hosting images of the character model.
</p>
<p>
"Filming the game was one of the most challenging and fulfilling acting experiences of my career," Page said in a fresh statement to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/beyond-two-souls-video-game-television-series-elliot-page-pageboy-1236267129/">Deadline</a>, which was first to report news of the game's TV adaptation. 
</p>
<p>
"The story's rich narrative and emotional depth offer us a fantastic foundation. We want to create a unique vision of the characters and their journeys that resonates with fans and newcomers."
</p>
<p>
Beyond: Two Souls writer and director David Cage said he was "absolutely thrilled to collaborate again" with Page. "I know that Elliot has all the talent and instinct to make it something really unique on TV," he added.
</p>
<p>
"Beyond has epic scope, preposterous premise and high-octane action," former editor Oli Welsh wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-two-souls-review">Eurogamer's Beyond: Two Souls review</a>. "But perhaps what David Cage and his dream need are limitations - limitations that Sony's blank cheque has singularly failed to impose on this sprawling, over-reaching game."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/30/space-marine-2-february-update-brings-the-datavault-tyranid-biovore/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The next big <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> update has been previewed ahead of its February release, with Patch 6.0 set to introduce a new PvP map, Datavault, Tyranid Biovore and more.</p>
<p>There’s also the dangled thread that support for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> could continue after the end of the current roadmap. As we head into Season 3 of content for Winter 2025, there’s just Season 4 and Spring 2025 left to come, but the team writes, “Worry not, even if this roadmap ends in 2025, that doesn’t mean the game will not receive new content after that!”</p>


<p>But back to the (almost) here and now, the 6.0 update has got a fresh batch of new content for players to take on:</p>
<ul>
<li>New PvP Map – Tomb</li>
<li>New PvE Enemy – Tyranid Biovore</li>
<li>New Battle Barge Feature – Datavault</li>
<li>Aboslute Difficulty</li>
<li>Perks Rework</li>
<li>FoV Slider for PC</li>
<li>Season Pass Cosmetics – Salamander Champion</li>
<li>Season Pass Cosmetics – Raven Guard Pack</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s dig in a little deeper.</p>


<p>The new PvP map, Tomb, takes place under the surface of Demerium, digging into the creepy environs of a Necron tomb. It’s a map that is closed off with narrow passages, so there’s plenty of blind spots to be aware of, though there is also a more open arena for a change of combat range.</p>
<p>In PvE, the Tyranid Biovore can now appear in all Operations featuring the Tyranids. This is an Extremis enemy that shoots out Spore Mines that you need to dodge and destroy before they impact, but it can also be deadly at close range.</p>

<p>The Datavault on the Battle Barge is a new area to give unlockable information on different parts of the game and cosmetic rewards. You’ll nead to earn special currency from completing the in-game Ordeals achievements across all modes. These could be thinks like making a Carnifex stun itself, knocking back Spore Mines to kill Tyranids, or completing missions in Operations at specific threat levels.</p>
<p>Through the rest of the update, there will be a perks rework, though Saber didn’t go into details here, an FOV slider on PC – useful for ultra-wide monitors – an Absolute difficulty level, and the following smaller improvements and additions:</p>
<ul>
<li>New finisher animations on Zoanthropes, Scarab Occult Terminators and Rubric Marines.</li>
<li>A new functionality will be added, allowing you to upgrade your Master-Crafted and Artificer Armoury Data to Relic by trading them. You can also sell your Armoury Data to get Requisition Points.</li>
<li>Absolute Difficulty (unlocked after completing 1 Operation in Lethal Difficulty) will unlock a bloodstained Knife Combat and a new pauldron.</li>
<li>Base Decals available for Right Pauldrons</li>
<li>A new option to share your skin between PvE and PvP modes will be added. This option also allows you to share your patterns between classes.</li>
<li>PvP Crossplay Toggle On/Off: allows console players to play with PC players. You now have the option to be matched with either PC players or Console players independently.</li>
<li>New Emotes – Strengthen the bond with your fellow Brothers with the new emotes! So go ahead and use them without moderation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rounding things out for Season Pass holders, the Salamanders Champion will be available for the Sniper class, and the Ravens Guard cosmetic pack will bring the classic MK VI ‘Corvus’ helmet design, a fan-favourite beaky look that dates back to the earliest versions of Warhammer 40,000.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI and Grand Theft Auto Online will be sold separately at launch, with a potential upgrade for the full game available for those who only purchase the online component of the next entry in the Rockstar series, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1000113-gta-vi-speculation-discussion-part-%E2%88%9E-the-leonida-drought/page/73/#findComment-1072491760" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTA Forums</a>, known Rockstar leaker Tez2 said that the release of the sixth main entry in the series will coincide with the first time the full package and the online component will be sold separately at launch. According to the leaker, Rockstar Games will have to factor the price of the online component into the total cost of the game, but could benefit from pricing the online standalone lower to provide access to players who cannot afford the full price, who could, eventually, upgrade to the full game including the main story campaign. At the same time, if the online component is priced low, it could help Rockstar Games keep the price of the full experience low, which is something many in the industry wouldn't want to see, as there are expectations that a potential $80 price tag for Grand Theft Auto VI could <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-growth-engine-pricing/">normalize video game pricing</a>, which hasn't increased much in the past few years despite rising costs.</p>
<p>The rumors of Grand Theft Auto Online possibly being sold separately from the full Grand Theft Auto VI package isn't the only news related to the highly-anticipated game that's come in the past few hours.&nbsp;<span>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-6-will-run-at-30fps-on-console-former-gta-5-and-red-dead-redemption-2-animator-expects-and-your-best-shot-at-60fps-may-be-hoping-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesRadar</a>, former Rockstar Games animator, Mike York commented on what console players should expect in terms of performance, saying that the developer is likely going to go for a steady 30 FPS, optimizing the game as much as possible to make sure it will never dip below the target.</span> On PlayStation 5 Pro, using the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, the game could hit 60 FPS, according to the former Rockstar developer, but 60 FPS shouldn't be expected on base hardware at launch. From their experience, the former animator is sure Rockstar is going to squeeze as much performance from consoles as possible to make the game run at 30 FPS, and then later optimize for 60 FPS, as the higher framerate is not as important as making the game amazing at 30.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later this year. A precise release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <p>Looks like they finally got the message. "An account for PlayStation Network will become optional for these titles on PC," said PlayStation in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/">a short and quiet blog post</a> that includes the upcoming PC release for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2">Spider-Man 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last Of Us Part II</a>. It's been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, and later <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-has-received-100000-negative-reviews-since-announcing-players-must-link-steam-to-a-psn-account">a rough review-bombing</a> but the company didn't seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they've now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The post itself is brief and plain, and spins the decision as a way for PlayStation to offer "in-game content incentives" to any PC player who decides to sign in not as a requirement but as an option. "Players who still opt to sign into a PlayStation Network account will also enjoy added benefits like trophies and friend management," they say, before showing a table of the extra goodies account linkers will get for each game.</p>
<p>This is similar to what the company did for open world sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Zero Dawn: Forbidden West</a>, which offered players a bonus outfit and spear for protagonist Aloy if they linked their Steam and PSN accounts. It looks like that may be the approach from now on. Although PlayStation don't explicitly say so outright. They only say that all the games which so far required the account are having that requirement dropped. I guess we'll see when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> comes out. </p>
<p>The whole saga has been quite stupid. PlayStation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">dropped the requirement for Helldivers 2</a> after players (and the game's developers) got supremely annoyed with the decision, but the hullaballoo resulted in a community manager <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disgruntled-helldivers-2-fans-start-petition-to-bring-back-fired-community-manager">losing his job</a>. Following that, the account requirement was instituted on the above mentioned games, which many players pointed out were single player adventures, with no requirement to be online (aside from unspoken DRM reasons, that is). </p><p>The decision made the games unavailable to PC players in over 100 countries where it is currently not possible to sign up for Sony's service (not to mention slightly annoying anyone else who doesn't even own a PlayStation console). Most recently, they said the account <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-will-require-a-psn-account-to-play-on-pc-making-it-unplayable-in-over-100-countries">would be required on the upcoming PC release of Last Of Us Part II</a>, due out in April. But now that too won't need a PSN account. Instead, if you sign on optionally, you'll get an in-game jacket inspired by Naughty Dog's new upcoming sci-fi adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. </p>
<p>God, let this be the end of it. It was a stupid decision, irritated a ton of players, and probably only benefited some number crunchers in a department buried deep in Sony's corporate bowels. Now that it's just an option, we can all get back to deciding if the games are actually good or not.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Marvel's Spider-Man 2 PC system requirements have been confirmed ahead of today's launch, detailing what system configuration the user will need to achieve certain resolution and performance targets.</p>
<p>Unlike some other recent games, the PC version of the second entry in the series developed by Insomniac Games will not require a ray tracing capable GPU to run even at the lowest resolution and frame rate, as old GPUs like the NVIDIA GTX 1650 or AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT will be able to run the game at 720p, 30 frames per second with the very low graphics preset. To enjoy the game at its very best at 4K resolution, 60 frames per second, and Ultimate Ray Tracing, however, an RTX 4090 will be required. The full requirements for other resolutions and frame rate targets can be found below.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft is celebrating having the best-selling game on both Xbox and PlayStation platforms over the last quarter, thanks to its new ownership of the Call of Duty franchise.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> launched last October and has been a success for Microsoft, which namechecked the title during its latest financial results.
</p>
<p>
"Black Ops 6... saw more players in its launch quarter than any other paid release in franchise history," Microsoft boss Satya Nadella boasted during a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q2">call</a> with investors.

<p>
"We also continue to see strong momentum for Xbox Cloud Gaming, with a record 140m hours streamed this quarter," he continued.
</p>
<p>
Nadella also called out the brilliant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, and gave our first indication of how well MachineGames' globe-trotting adventure is doing.
</p>
<p>
"We saw rave reviews of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which has already been played by more than four million people," Nadella said.
</p>
<p>
Both of these statistics will reflect players who bought either game outright, as well as those who have played via Game Pass on both PC and Xbox.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, of course, the PS5 launch of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is still to come - sometime in the first half of this year.
</p>
<p>
Revenue for Xbox's gaming and content division, which includes Game Pass, rose two percent over three months of 2024 thanks to a surge of subscribers on PC. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-hardware-sales-slump-but-game-pass-is-surging">Microsoft's wider gaming revenue was still down year-on-year overall, offset by the continued slump of Xbox hardware sales</a>.

            <p>
Microsoft has announced mixed results for its latest financial quarter, with strong growth for Game Pass offset by the continued decline in Xbox hardware sales. 
</p>
<p>
Overall, revenue for Microsoft's gaming division was down seven percent year-on-year for the three months ending 31st December 2024, with a 29 percent drop in Xbox console sales largely to blame. 
</p>
<p>
But the quarter also saw a significant boost to Game Pass, which made more money in the last three months of 2024 than in any previous quarter, and also saw a significant uptick to its subscribers on PC.

<p>
"We are focused on improving the profitability of the business, in order to position it for long-term growth, driven by higher-margin content and platform services," Microsoft boss Satya Nadella said in a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q2">call</a> with investors. "And we are delivering on this plan.
</p>
<p>
"All-up, Game Pass set a new quarterly record for revenue and grew its PC subscriber base by over 30 percent, as we focus on driving fully-paid subscribers across endpoints."
</p>
<p>
It's clear that Game Pass subscriptions will have been boosted by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s launch in October. The latest launch in Activision's long-running shooter franchise was the first to arrive on Game Pass on day one - provided you had PC Game Pass or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate on consoles.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Black Ops 6 saw more players in its first couple of months than any other game in the series to date, Nadella said.
</p>
<p>
Its inclusion on Game Pass also does not appear to have dented its sales, either. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was "the top-selling game on Xbox and PlayStation" last quarter, Nadella said, before also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-the-top-selling-game-on-xbox-and-playstation-last-quarter">revealing the number of people who have played the brilliant Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.

		<p>Microsoft’s Q2 earnings call has provided a number of highlights for the Xbox gaming division, including strong game and Xbox Game Pass performance, but the most important statistic is that the company saw a 7% revenue decline, year-on-year, in large part because of a huge 29% drop in Xbox hardware revenue through the final few months of 2024.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the good news. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> has brought in over 4 million players across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PC and through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> subscribers. We never get actual sales figures for Microsoft games anymore, but this is an encouraging amount of reach, and we’ll certainly see a big bump when the game arrives on PlayStation 5 in the first half of this year.</p>


<p>Microsoft CEO <a title="People > Satya Nadella [120 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/people/satya-nadella/">Satya Nadella</a> also touted <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> as having a record breaking launch quarter, as it topped sales charts for both Xbox and PlayStation, showing the value in multi-platform releases for Microsoft going forward.</p>
<p>Both of these launches fuelled a 30% growth in Game Pass subscribers on PC, which also indicates the potential of this subscription service, after a few years of slower growth than Microsoft had wanted. This helped Game Pass set a new quarterly revenue record, with the overall Xbox content and services revenue growing 2%.</p>
<p>However, in the quarter ending on 31st December 2024, the gaming division made $6.6 billion in revenue, which was a drop of $530 million year-over-year. That’s quite significant and revealing, as 2023’s figures had the massive bump of acquiring <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/13/microsoft-now-owns-activision-blizzard/">Activision Blizzard in October 2023</a>, flooding the financial report with all the sales of Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Overwatch and Diablo revenue. That helped to mask whatever else was going on with Microsoft’s gaming business through 2024’s quarterly reports, but we’re now seeing a meaningful comparison once again.</p>

<p>It’s really looking like Xbox’s decline as a console manufacturer is now irreversible, and little in Microsoft’s new multiplatform release plan is going to arrest that slide. The company has a huge deficit to PlayStation this generation, without the impetus of exclusive games, there’s little reason for gamers to really consider jumping to Xbox in future. Things could slide even further as the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">Nintendo Switch 2 releases later this year</a>…</p>

			<p>Just yesterday, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-top-publisher-december-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Microsoft ranked as the top games publisher in the world last month. And yet, their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q2/press-release-webcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second quarter, fiscal year 2025 financial report</a> doesn't exactly paint a rosy picture of the gaming division. Sure, CEO Satya Nadella boasted about a few records for Xbox Cloud Gaming, Game Pass, and successful games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-the-biggest-ever-says-activision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>:</p>
<p><em>We are focused on improving the profitability of the business in order to position it for long-term growth, driven by higher-margin content and platform services. </em><em>And we are delivering on this plan.</em></p>
<p><em>Black Ops 6 was the top-selling game on Xbox and PlayStation this quarter – and saw more players in its launch quarter than any other paid release in franchise history. </em><em>And we saw rave reviews of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which has already been played by more than 4 million people.</em></p>
<p><em>We also continue to see strong momentum for Xbox Cloud Gaming, with a record 140 million hours streamed this quarter. </em><em>All-up, Game Pass set a new quarterly record for revenue and grew its PC subscriber base by over 30%, as we focus on driving fully-paid subscribers across endpoints.</em></p>
<p>When you look closer at the numbers, though, overall Xbox content and services revenue increased only 2%, albeit Microsoft said that's above expectations thanks to higher-than-estimated performance from Activision Blizzard, chiefly Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. The growth was this small because gaming revenue specifically was down 7%, dragged by the collapse of Xbox hardware revenue (-29%). Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood admitted in the earnings call:</p>
<p><em>In Gaming, revenue decreased 7% (8% in constant currency) as content and services growth continued to be offset by hardware declines.</em></p>
<p>There is seemingly no end in sight for these Xbox hardware declines, which have been constant for several quarters now. Partly, it might even be due to Microsoft's own multiplatform strategy. Some gamers undoubtedly see no reason to purchase an Xbox when they can get their games not only on PC but also on PlayStation or Nintendo platforms. Microsoft certainly believes the switch toward multiplatform, <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-keeping-games-off-other-platform-xbox-series-s-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> yet again by gaming CEO Phil Spencer just a few days ago, will be worth it in the end; for now, however, the struggles continue. Could this lead to the abandonment of Xbox hardware as a whole? At the time being, Microsoft still believes it can turn this around by making its hardware more alluring on its own rather than relying on exclusive games. In a recent interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KK8xil5Uy0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Destin Legarie</a>, Phil Spencer stated:</p>
<p><em>I want us to innovate and make hardware the differentiator. We've got into this space where the differentiation on the hardware has gone down, and it's really been 'locked games' that have become the identity of the hardware. I love when I see handhelds, when I see unique things that hardware manufacturers do. I want our hardware to compete on power and on innovation. So let's have our platform continue to innovate with services and the hardware work that we're doing — whether it's controller, power, or mobility.</em></p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/assetto-corsa-evo-early-access-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assetto-corsa-evo-early-access-review.1095675/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/assetto-corsa-evo-early-access-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Assetto Corsa Evo is easily one of the most exciting racing games of 2025. The huge open-world map of German countryside surrounding the famous Nürburgring Nordschleife that developer Kunos Simulazioni is currently crafting for it should make it one of the biggest in the genre. Literally, that is. The map is going to be 1,600 square kilometres in size. That’s about 15 Forza Horizon 5s. However, we’ll need to be patient for that, as the first chunk of it isn’t set to arrive in Evo’s evolving early access version until mid-year, and then grow from there. For now, at least, we get five tracks and 20 cars to noodle around in. The good news is that the driving feel is unsurprisingly fabulous, right out of the gate. At this point, however, that’s… essentially it. It’s hard to argue Evo makes a strong case as an immediately <em>crucial </em>purchase in this early state if you’re not especially keen on taking some warm-up laps before the main event kicks off.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’d be unfair to haul Assetto Corsa Evo over the coals too severely for its current technical blemishes. Yes, I’ve had it hitch up and drop frames occasionally and, yes, it’s crashed or frozen on me several times following its launch – although I’ve certainly had lengthy stints on-track where it’s been entirely cooperative on my current high-powered PC setup (RTX 4080, Intel Core Ultra 9 185H). Overall, it’s admittedly not running on all cylinders right now, but that’s the nature of ‘Early Access’ as a concept. We obviously need to be prepared for it to be a little more <em>Alpha</em> Romeo than Alfa Romeo at this point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And while five circuits and 20 available cars is modest, it does make for a decent amount of combinations to experiment with – and that’s without factoring in the adjustable wet weather options that obviously have very real effects on handling. If you think you’ll be happy to simply hotlap solo around the initial tracks (which include Mount Panorama, Brands Hatch, Imola, Laguna Seca, and Suzuka), Evo’s early access version may keep you busy for at least a few days. It’s certainly worth remembering the early access program for Evo’s immediate predecessor, Assetto Corsa Competizione, launched with just <em>a single car and a single track</em> – the Lamborghini Huracan GT3 race car and the Nürburgring GP circuit. By comparison, Evo’s launch is at least a considerably chunkier one.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The first salvo of circuits includes a track from the US, Japan, the UK, continental Europe, and Australia. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Moreover, it’s a well-curated one. Notice, for instance, the first salvo of circuits includes a track from the US, Japan, the UK, continental Europe, and Australia. That’s a thoughtful mix that I don’t doubt was deliberate. Similarly, the short but sweet car list includes a spectrum of vehicles, ranging from front-wheel drive hatches to purpose-built race models. The feel of the cars I’ve tested so far has been top notch. I won’t pretend to be able to gauge the accuracy of the tyre model with the kind of insight you might glean from a professional racing driver, because I’m not one; I’m a car nerd journalist with a handful of trackdays in my past that I’m skeptical I’ll ever be able to afford to repeat. What I can say is the sensation of grip is excellent and I was instantly confident to push hard across the top of the mountain at Bathurst. Things always get a little murky when I’m comparing experiences gleaned many years ago using totally different racing setups (I personally migrated from a Thrustmaster TS-XW racing wheel to a direct drive Moza R12 some years ago), but Evo already seems to have nailed that feeling of being able to overdrive a car but still snap it back under control, because the grip will return as long as you wrestle it back into the window. That always suits me, as I’m a bit more of a butcher than a surgeon when it comes to racing sims these days. Forget the whole world turning into ice the second you slip into a slide; Evo is wonderfully intuitive.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to ACC, race cars also feel a little less punishingly stiff and cling to the track more tenaciously, even while clattering over bumps or kerbs. In ACC, I generally felt like I was going as fast as I could without losing control. In Evo, I’ve found I feel like I <em>could </em>probably push faster. If I had the skill, that is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a really great feeling of balance, especially as cars squirm under braking, and the feel of the front end becoming lighter and heavier based on elevation changes is nice and pronounced. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So yes, in the tradition of the original Assetto Corsa and ACC before it, Evo is already a genuinely terrific driving experience. But does that make this first taste a must-play?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, no. Not really. If you get it today you’re essentially just pre-ordering the final game at a slightly discounted price. That alone could be reason enough for you to grab it, and it’s a totally fair argument. However, other than confirming it feels good, there’s just not really much more joy to extract from Evo for the time being. As a man who peeled countless demo discs from the front of magazines back in ’90s, I’ve certainly got nothing against what’s essentially a hefty demo, but it’s not one I really want to keep playing anymore after seeing all of its tracks. But I’ll definitely be back for more when it’s available and some of the more annoying aspects have been resolved. </p><div id="rank-todays-top-racing-simulators" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank today's top racing simulators</h3><h3>Rank today's top racing simulators</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Simply put, the racing itself just isn’t that robust at the moment, and it’s tedious being punted off track by computer-controlled opponents who simply try to drive through you around corners. I don’t know what the answer is, but the AI certainly still needs work. There have definitely been times when other cars seemed to be deliberately giving me racing room, and others where they’ve made unscripted mistakes. That’s good, because it creates the illusion they’re not just machines. It’s also true that getting speared into from behind is an unfortunate reality in real racing. Incidents happen, sure. But it’d be something that would happen to you quite irregularly in reality, whereas it’s far too common in Evo for racing to remain fun. If I wanted to get rear-ended for kicks, I’d brake-check Lance Stroll in a drive-thru.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If I wanted to get rear-ended for kicks, I’d brake-check Lance Stroll in a drive-thru.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a pretty big problem when these races are largely all Evo offers in its current condition. There were supposed to be some other modes available, based on what was announced when the early access version launched, but ever since I started playing Evo has been stuck in ‘Offline’ mode. Evo’s Driving Academy mode and Special Events are currently inaccessible to me. All I can do is generate custom practice or race sessions. Tying functionality to an always-online caveat is very concerning, and I cannot fathom why it’s necessary for single-player content. Fortunately, there’s still plenty of time for Kunos to tweak that on the road map ahead.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Assetto Corsa Evo already feels absolutely fantastic behind the wheel but, with aggravating AI opponents slamming into you every which way and hamstrung as it is by online-only features that are currently inaccessible, it doesn’t feel like an essential early access purchase. The handling may be excellent, but I’ll be parking it up and waiting for the finished product – including the promised epic-sized map of Germany – before I put the keys back in the ignition.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Tokyo Xtreme Racer Is Back After 20 (!!) Years, And It Rules]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/tokyo-xtreme-racer-impressions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tokyo-xtreme-racer-is-back-after-20-years-and-it-rules.1095603/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/tokyo-xtreme-racer-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in the mid-90s, Japanese studio Genki were responsible for a series of games called <em>Shutokō Battle</em>, known (mostly) in the West as <em>Tokyo Xtreme Racer</em>. From 1994-2006 these games landed on the Super Famicom, PlayStation, Saturn, Dreamcast, PS2, Xbox 360, PC and even portable systems, then they just...disappeared.</p><p>The last main game in the series came out in 2006, and that seemed a pretty fitting time for it to bow out. In the West we were well into the age of <em>Forza</em>, <em>Project Gotham</em> and <em>Burnout</em>, and <em>Tokyo Xtreme's</em> obsession with hard numbers and grinding--not to mention its relatively limited roster of cars and locations--made it seem almost quaint by comparison.</p><p>But hey, times change! We're now in 2025, we're exhausted with AAA racing games, we're tired of the same old franchises doing the same old things, and it's time for something new! And by something new I mean something very old, because here comes a new <em>Tokyo Xtreme Racer </em>game like nothing happened.</p><p>Look at this series’ release timeline. This is the video game equivalent of a cat going missing for nine years then just walking back into your house like nothing happened. Only instead of nine years it's <em>19</em>. And instead of walking, the cat drifted in sideways like a sick, modified Subaru Impreza.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Wikipedia</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is great! This new game is, I'm told, largely unchanged in terms of structure from its decades-old predecessors; you drive around Japanese motorways challenging people to races, which are decided not by clocks or flags, but by a "spirit meter" that drains if you're behind your opponent. There's also loads of grinding and tinkering to do in order to level up your car and be able to defeat more powerful rivals. About the only thing that's changed significantly is that it looks nicer.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="【Tokyo Xtreme Racer】#8：Full PV" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/umlztIQ7HeE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Which is fine, because going back to the well is maybe my favourite broad trend in video games right now.<a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-palworld-helldivers-manor-lords-aaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> AAA gaming has gotten so risk averse, and its release calendar has become so sparse</a>, that these mid-tier kinds of games--once beloved by millions, but crowded out over the past decade by an industry that thought it was moving past them--are coming back.</p><p>Turns out we weren't moving past anything. We <em>thought </em>we were, but all we've ended up doing over the past two decades is see racing games--like so many other genres--become bloated beyond almost all recognition as they've chased realism, more cars, more features, bigger tracks, more, more more. Or, on the flipside, they've retreated the other direction and become incredibly simple, casual affairs (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/550320/art_of_rally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like the excellent <em>Art of Rally</em>!</a>)</p><p><em>Tokyo Xtreme Racer</em> (2025), then, is a welcome reminder that for many people racing video games were at their best when they were somewhere in between; when they were just video games about racing cars, not swollen attempts at simulating the act of driving. This is a game about menus, about tinkering with engine values, unlocking old Nissans and just driving around to have some fun. It's returning at a time when we've learned to appreciate that maybe we never had to move past these kinds of games at all.</p><p>Time now to confess that I'm a newcomer to the series, and one thing I love from playing this new release is the 1v1 aspect of the game. <em>Tokyo Xtreme Racer </em>works by just letting you drive around the motorway until you find a rival, then when you want to challenge them, you flash your headlights a couple of times and a race triggers.</p><figure><figcaption>Pictured: me coming up on my next opponent</figcaption></figure><p>You're supposed to challenge other drivers in fancy sports cars, who are clearly noted on the map as rivals, but turns out you can also just challenge <em>anyone </em>driving on the motorway. Guy driving a Dyna work truck? You can race them. Someone behind the wheel of a little Suzuki? Take them on. You don't get many points (needed to upgrade your car and buy stuff) for doing so, but it's <em>incredibly </em>funny the first 90-100 times you do it.</p><figure></figure><p>Being new, I was also unaware that the game, which mostly takes place with a very racing game tone and presentation, also has intros like this? I'm driving a Mazda on a motorway, but this looks like the intro to a game about mystical ninjas on PS2? Incredible stuff.</p><p>I'm glad this series is back, and I'm sad I missed it the first time around. We all need more video games in our lives where we can race against cab drivers in a 1987 Toyota Corolla, while a rousing eurobeat soundtrack plays in the background.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/brownville-deer-pantry-youtube"><h3>Bad Day?

She has no memory of her past, nor why she is here.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Who is she? Where did she come from? Is the AI offering her advice an ally or an enemy?</p><p>After surviving life-or-death battles against mechanical weapons, what lies ahead for Willow?</p><p><strong>■ Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Willow Martin</strong> (voiced by Fairouz Ai) – The protagonist who has no memory of her past. Although she can’t remember anything, she gets caught up in battles against mechanical weapons. Her body moves instinctively, and she displays exceptional combat skills. Will she be able to escape her confined space and recover her lost memories?</li><li><strong>AI</strong> (voiced by Junichi Suwabe) – A mysterious entity that suddenly starts speaking to Willow through her intercom. Despite sensing some hidden agenda in the voice calling itself “AI,” Willow ends up hearing it out. Who is this being, and why is it helping Willow?</li></ul></blockquote><div id="carousel_941282"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>■ System</strong></p><p>Escape from the loop of repeated death.</p><p>With a high difficulty that even advanced players will find challenging, death is not the end.</p><p><strong>Willow Awakens in a Mysterious Research Facility and is Attacked by Armed Machines</strong></p><p>When Willow dies, she loses her weapons and must restart the stage from the beginning. Evade the relentless bullet barrage, gather powerful weapons, and launch your counterattack.</p><p>Enemies are armed machines. Fight off the numerous mechanical weapons that attack you.</p><p>Each enemy has its own method of attack, so determine the right strategy to avoid taking hits.</p><p><strong>The Further You Progress, The Stronger the Enemies Become… Including Huge Biological Weapons</strong></p><p>Use actions to gain the upper hand:</p><ul><li><strong>Mirage Shift</strong> – An ability that breaks down the body into data and transports it to a separate space. In addition to passing through attacks, it can be used to quickly move short distances or through the air.</li><li><strong>Striker</strong> – A weapon mounted on your armor’s fist. Upon activation, it charges toward the target, dealing significant damage upon impact. It requires close proximity, making it risky, but the damage dealt is substantial.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer and a set of gameplay videos below.
