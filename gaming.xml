            <p>Mob Entertainment has announced that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a> Chapter 4 will be making its unsettling way onto consoles later this month.</p>
<p>The latest chapter in the series is set for release on Nintendo Switch, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10012036">PlayStation</a> and Xbox on 25th June. It will retail for $19.99, the PR has said. I have asked for clarification on its UK pricing, though the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/poppy-playtime-chapter-4/9n31k5cww4k8">Microsoft Store here in Blighty</a> has it listed for £16.74, so assume this will be the same on other platforms.</p>
<p>"Brace yourself for the darkest chapter yet in the epic Poppy Playtime saga," reads the official blurb, adding that players will be "pushed deeper into the undiscovered depths of the Playtime Co. factory, far below anything the world knew". You can check out a trailer for Poppy Playtime Chapter 4 below.</p>

<p>The latest chapter in the Poppy Playtime series promises players "terrifying" new threats, along with "shocking" revelations.</p>
<p>"Can you outwit the unnatural new creations lurking in the shadows? Can you survive here long enough to eventually unravel the mysteries behind the experiments? Every step will test your courage, every puzzle will challenge your mind, and every corner may be your last," the studio teases.</p>
<p>Poppy Playtime Chapter 4 previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-chapter-4-release-announced-for-pc">arrived on PC back in January of this year</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in May of last year, the studio announced a Poppy Playtime film adaptation was in the works with Legendary Entertainment and Angry Films.</p>
<p>"When we first started this journey, we followed our passion and created a series of games and brands with the purpose of inspiring and entertaining. We've always dreamed big and are thrilled to have created something that has captured the hearts of tens of millions around the world," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-the-cult-horror-game-is-getting-a-film-adaptation">Mob Entertainment co-founders Zach Belanger and Seth Belanger said at the time</a>.</p>
<p>"This movie deal is a great logical next step in the growth of our transmedia entertainment company."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> has received an update that offers visual improvements when played on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>, a nice bonus for fans who want to pick up and play the RPG on the new console.</p>
<p>These improvements include graphic enhancements such as new shadow and reflection efforts, as well as an extension to the distance objects are rendered at. For example, you can now see a forest off into the distance clearly, whereas before it may have looked like a low-poly blur of green shrubbery.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/patchnote/ver_1_3_0/">In the official update blog post uploaded to the games' official website</a>, we see that exact example in a side-by-side comparison, as well as a pair of screenshots showing water effects on the Switch vs the Switch 2. Water now has lovely reflections of light on it. A little thing for some, but a little boost for those willing to make the leap to a new console, cosy RPG in hand.</p>

<p>Other features of this update include an automatic lock-on feature that should make combat a little easier, as well as an adjustment to the Hagram build feature allowing players to press the cancel button and return a moved object to its original position.</p>
<p>God's Touch was adjusted too! It can now be cancelled by attacking or dodging, plus the button assigned to activating God's Touch has been relocated on the game pad. Game pad users also have an increased selection of key configurations, and all players can benefit from a new depth of field graphical option.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> has been updated to version 10.0.0, bringing with it a whole bunch of new content, but also improving the game's visuals and performance for those playing on Switch 2.</p>
<p>But how has it been improved, exactly? Well, the above video should clear things up quite nicely for you. We're mainly looking at bumps in resolution and frame rate, and this is perhaps most obvious within the Splatsville hub area, which notably at a stable, albeit sluggish 30fps on the Switch.</p>
<p>This has been increased significantly on the Switch 2, and the smooth gameplay looks like a real treat on Nintendo's new console.</p><p><figure data-videoid="Z3qjATCE2dk" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3qjATCE2dk"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3qjATCE2dk">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>We also see gameplay from the standard Turf War battle along with the Salmon Run mode, so there's plenty to dive into here to see exactly how the game has been improved from Switch 1.</p>
<p>In other news, it's also been confirmed that a Splatoon spin-off game, titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, will be making its way to the Switch 2. Very little is known about the project so far, but it looks to be a single-player story-focused experience in which you take on the role of a mechanic investigating a mysterious island alongside Deep Cut.</p>

As yet another <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>-style roguelite hybrid emerges raging from the volcanic portals of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest">Steam Next Fest</a>, as the smaller-scale gamedev scene at large threatens to melt into a soup of RNG and deckbuilding, I want you to picture me leaning over you like Samwise Gamgee leaning over Frodo, trying through his tears to remind the Ring-bearer of life back in the Shire, before the horror of Mordor.

"Do you remember the taste of strawberries?" Sam whispers. I do not want you to remember the taste of strawberries. I want you to remember how good it felt to sneak a ball behind the blocks in Breakout. It is the only thing that will save you now.

Ball X Pit isn't just a roguelite hybrid, but a Vampire Survive 'em up to boot. The setup is that a meteor has wiped out the city of Ballbylon (*smiles wanly at camera*) and left a massive hole full of monsters and treasure. You are a treasure-hunter, and the way you gather treasure is to proceed down a slowly scrolling shaft against a wall of block-shaped undead, shooting cannonballs that ricochet from foe and terrain alike.</p>
<p>After breaking enough monsterblocs, you get to choose from power-ups that include weirder, more powerful kinds of ball and a few shmuppy supporting acts, such as little gun-toting NPC statues. There are bosses too, some of which take things in almost a bullet hell direction, with arrows all but filling the screen.
</p>
<p>
I played the now-available Steam demo at a Devolver joint in London the week before last, in a desperate bid to claw back some precious naptime from my SGF schedule. I was dismayed by the rogueliting at first - in case I haven't sufficiently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-train-2-review">spelled it out by now</a>, I am really ready for this trend to be over. It's not that Ball X Pit in itself is badly made, it's that everytime I read the word "roguelite" in a press release, I can feel the very substance of my soul dribbling through my fingers. I'm naked in the dark, with nothing, no veil between me and the gameloop of fire.
</p>
<p>
But then I successfully snuck a ball behind the tide of four-cornered fiends, and was Samwisely suffused by recollections of shareware Breakout clones on Apple Macintosh in the 90s. Watching the ball bounce repeatedly between the blocks and backwall, racking up a high score without you having to lift a finger, is the nearest many of us will ever get to nirvana. It may not be enough for me to play/recommend the full thing, but it's enough for me to suggest that you <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3651790/BALL_x_PIT_Demo/">try the Ball X Pit demo yourself on Steam</a>.

Well, wonder no more, as one YouTuber has taken the mask off and shown the little details hiding underneath the coverings of Elden Ring Nightreign's cast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaiC0doOclE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zullie the Witch</a> posted a behind-the-mask look at Nightreign's cast on June 5. All of them have distinct models, with some surprising details under the hood.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are just little curiosities, like Ironeye's face being fully modeled from the front. Zullie also notes that the Nightfarers' eye colors change depending on their skin. Other characters have some fun ties to other FromSoftware games, like the Duchess' similarity to Dark Souls 3's Firekeeper.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Revealing the face of characters like Ironeye or Executor is neat, but the real question I'm sure you're asking is whether the avian Guardian is truly a bird, or if he has a human face underneath? Well, the answer is that yes, he is truly a bird. The Revenant also hides a skull beneath her porcelain facade, though, so there are still some surprises in store for those who haven't seen them in-game yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there aren't any profound lore discoveries to be made here, they do add a little extra character to each of the Nightfarers, and show off FromSoft's attention to detail, even down to the tiny things that would probably go unnoticed in most players' runs of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The one strange note is Wylder, who does not seem to have a face model at all. This might just be a design quirk, but it's interesting to imagine there might be some deeper lore reason for his under-armor presence remaining a mystery.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign players are slowly getting to grips with the game, and some are already completing impressive challenges.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/hershey-teams-up-with-pokemon-for-new-collectable-chocolates<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Hershey Pokémon 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/89426dbe74728/hershey-pokemon-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Hershey Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hershey, the American confectionary company, has teamed up with The Pokémon Company to launch <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/hersheys-and-pokemon-team-up-for-collectible-chocolate-bars-and-kisses">a new range of Hershey's Kisses</a>.</p>
<p>Based on the original 151 Pokémon from the days of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Red and Blue</a>, the Kisses will be wrapped in special collectable foil that kind of, sort of look like Pokéballs. Underneath, you'll find an image of one Pokémon from the original line-up per chocolate.</p>
<p>Ashley Reeb, Senior Associate Brand Manager at The Hershey Company, said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our collaboration with Pokémon combines the timeless appeal of <em>Hershey's Kisses</em> chocolates with the joy of discovery and collecting — making it more than just a treat. The special-edition foils may spark a little friendly competition but also unite fans around their love for milk chocolate and Pokémon."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So what's the deal here, exactly? Is Hershey essentially encouraging folks to keep the chocolates as they are, fully wrapped and never to be eaten? Or can you carefully unwrap them and keep the foil intact? Hmm... Quite bizarre, if you ask us.</p>
<p>Well, it sounds like some might like to keep the chocolates completely unopened, as Hershey is also launching a special, limited edition case in which to house your collection. These are to be sold on a first come, first served basis, and it sounds like you'll need both a 'Hersheyland' account and Pokémon account to nab one (because we need accounts for everything these days, right?).</p>

<p>If the Kisses don't appeal, Hershey is also launching Pokémon-themed chocolate bars, with 12 designs available for the full-size bar, and 18 available for the snak-size bar.</p>
<p>Over on the new Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> received a free update to bring the games' performance up to a more acceptable standard. One could argue that it still looks a bit rubbish, but they at least run much better now.</p>

            <p>Sony have confirmed the cancellation of a live service project amid mass layoffs at Sony Bend, the team behind open world zombie biker <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Bloomberg <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lrbil2zvis2q">reported</a> that Sony Bend were doing away with about 40 people, following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-put-the-axe-in-a-live-service-god-of-war-game-alongside-a-project-from-the-days-gone-studio">the nuking of an unannounced live service game</a> earlier in the year. Amongst the people affected is former senior animator Robert Morrison, who <a href="https://x.com/RobertAnim8er/status/1932522033335906343">announced</a> his departure on Xitter. </p>
<p>The studio's social media account acknowledged the layoffs, without sharing exact numbers, adding that Sony Bend "remain committed to building the future of Bend Studio with creativity, passion, and innovation in the titles we craft."</p>
<p>Now, Sony have confirmed the departures in an email to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-studio-sony-bend-announces-layoffs-following-live-service-cancellation">Eurogamer</a>. "Earlier this year, Bend Studio wrapped development on a live service concept," it reads. "After careful consideration, we chose not to move forward with it. As the team shifts focus to its next project, we've made strategic changes to better position the studio for long-term success." </p>
<p>"As part of this transition, a workforce reduction has taken place at the studio," the statement goes on. Again, no hard numbers. According to Bloomberg, Sony Bend now have a new game in the works.</p>
<p>All this continues Sony's on-going <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despair-at-prospect-of-new-playstation-live-service-game-lifted-by-mysterious-mention-of-frogs">partial</a> retreat from blockbuster live service productions, which has seen them cancel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/naughty-dog-cancel-the-last-of-us-online-while-teasing-new-single-player-projects">The Last Of Us Online</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alleged-leaked-spider-man-the-great-web-trailer-shows-off-insomniacs-cancelled-co-op-spin-off">co-op Spider-Man</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-put-the-axe-in-a-live-service-god-of-war-game-alongside-a-project-from-the-days-gone-studio">new God Of War game</a> despite 2022-era plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">launch more than 10 of the things by March 2026</a>. As Brendy wrote in January, when news of the Bend project's abandonment first surfaced, Sony appear terrified by the failure of last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, which they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">shut down mere weeks into its shelf life</a> after it failed to accrue figures of sufficient bigness at launch.

</p><p>To quote Arrowhead Games Studio CEO Shams Jorjani from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-ceo-slams-the-games-industry-layoff-wave-saying-that-bosses-are-making-regular-devs-pay-for-their-screw-ups">an interview in April</a>: "Who among these executives is stepping down? Or slashing their salaries?" Best of luck to all affected.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?compare=1151640,1659420,1817070,1817190,1888930,2322010,2531310,2561580,2651280,3489700">SteamDB</a>, Stellar Blade has already welcomed a peak player count of 99,980, less than 24 hours since its release on PC. This means it currently has the highest peak concurrent player count for a PlayStation published single player game on the platform.</p>
<p>To compare, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered has a peak player count of 66,436, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Complete Edition has a peak of 56,557. Meanwhile, The Last of Us Part 1 has a peak of 36,496 and its sequel - The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered - has a peak of 30,690.</p>

<p>As for what players are saying, right now Stellar Blade is sitting quite happily with an "overwhelmingly positive" Steam review average. "In a world full of unoptimised slop it really is great to see a game run so smoothly," reads one such review.</p>
<p>So, yes, things are going well for Stellar Blade's PC release. Back in February of this year, Shift Up stated in a financial report it expects <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-pc-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-says-shift-up">the PC version to exceed console sales</a>.</p>
<p>"In the AAA game market, PC devices have a higher market share than consoles, so we expect the performance of the PC version to exceed that of the console version," the company said at the time. "We are particularly observing trends such as the significant expansion of the single-player action game market in the Asian gaming industry."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/asus-explains-why-the-rog-xbox-ally-doesnt-have-an-oled-screen/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the Xbox Games Showcase 2025, Microsoft and ASUS finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> their joint Xbox handheld projects: the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. However, neither of the handhelds is equipped with an OLED screen, much to the chagrin of those who'd love the infinite contrast provided by the cutting-edge displays.</p>
<p>Why, though? Well, ASUS Senior Manager of Marketing Content for Gaming Whitson Gordon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6j1TYbHggfk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that clearly in a recent stream: essentially, it has to do with drawing more power when coupled with variable refresh rate, a tradeoff the company wasn't willing to make.</p>
<p><em>We've gone hard on OLED with our desktop monitors. It is no secret that we love OLED at ROG, right? But on the Ally, the calculus is different. We talked about this in more detail last year in our Q&amp;A and so I won't go quite as deep today, but we're in a similar boat. We did look at OLED again this year. We did some R&amp;D and prototyping with OLED, but it's still not where we want it to be when you factor VRR into the mix and we aren't willing to give up VRR. I'll draw that line in the sand right now. I am of the opinion that if a display doesn't have variable refresh rate, it's not a gaming display in the year 2025 as far as I'm concerned, right? That's a must-have feature, and OLED with VRR right now draws significantly more power than the LCD that we're currently using on the Ally and it costs more.</em></p>
<p><em>When we look at what people are buying in the handheld market right now, both in terms of the sales of our devices and what we see from competitors, it's pretty clear what price bands people are willing to buy a device like this in, because remember, it's a secondary device for a lot of people. It's not their primary device. I see a lot of people in feedback saying that they want this exact thing. They say, "I don't want to pay an arm and a leg for this." Well, yeah, we don't want that</em><br>
<em>either. That's why we're trying to avoid having it cost an arm and a leg by not putting things in that the vast majority of users don't need. We're trying to hit a reasonable price point on these.</em></p>
<p><em>That's all I'll say about price. You have to align your expectations with the market and what we're doing here. Adding 32GB, OLED, Z2 Extreme, and all of those extra bells and whistles would cost a lot more than the price bracket you guys are used to on the Ally, and the vast majority of users are not willing to pay that kind of price.</em></p>
<p>When it comes to specifications, the display is identical between the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X: a 7-inch FullHD IPS screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and AMD FreeSync Premium. However, the ROG Xbox Ally X has more storage (1TB versus 512GB), more RAM (24 vs 16GB), a more powerful processor (the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-z2-extreme-apu-next-gen-handhelds-16-rdna-3-5-gpu-8-zen-5-cpu-cores/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryzen Z2 Extreme</a> vs the Ryzen Z2), and the impulse triggers for controls. The pricing of each model hasn't been revealed yet, but we do know that ASUS is planning to launch both handhelds this holiday, so more details are forthcoming.</p>

			<p>A couple of days ago, Epic Games <a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/58476593/Epic_Games,_Inc_v_Atas_aka_Sincey_Cheats_and_Vanta_Cheats_et_al" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed</a> a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the eastern district of North Carolina against Ediz Atas, also known as Sincey Cheats and Vanta Cheats, a maker of Fortnite cheats.</p>
<p>Epic Games alleges that Ediz Atas, also known as Sincey and Vanta Cheats, has made money from developing and selling cheat software for Fortnite since at least January 2023. According to the firm, the software gives players an unfair advantage over those who don't cheat and is therefore in violation of its EULA due to its circumvention of Fortnite's anti-cheat software. Epic also claims widespread cheating could put legitimate players off, potentially translating into a loss of sales of season passes and cosmetics. In its lawsuit, Epic said it was forced to ban tens of thousands of Fortnite accounts using Sincey Cheats software, including over 15K bans against accounts in the United States alone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the lawsuit claims that, after Epic Games submitted DMCA takedown notices to YouTube to remove videos featuring the offending cheating software, Sincey Cheats sent multiple emails to YouTube's designated copyright agent, impersonating an Epic employee and falsely claiming that Epic wanted to “formally reverse its claim of copyright infringement” by spoofing Epic Games email addresses. You can see an example <a href="https://x.com/SinceyCheats/status/1872973112892928458" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also targets five unnamed defendants who have been reselling Sincey Cheats's software through various channels. Predictably, Epic Games is seeking compensatory and statutory damages, as well as covering attorney costs and other lawsuit-related costs.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time a game developer has sued a cheat maker. Bungie did it a few times recently against Destiny 2 cheat makers and even won against both <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-cheat-seller-lavicheats-is-hit-by-6-7m-lawsuit-from-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LaviCheats</a> (getting a multi-million dollar compensation) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-wins-lawsuit-against-destiny-2-cheat-makers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AimJunkies</a>. Whether that will be enough to discourage cheat makers remains to be seen.</p>

		<p>The launch of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> has brought a smattering of new exclusives, but it’s also relied on a raft of ported hits to fill out its roster. Chief amongst them, and sitting just behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> as the game of choice for new Switch 2 owners, is Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition. This release brings the immense futuristic open-world, and its stark hyper-violence and decidedly adult content to Nintendo’s brand new handheld, and in a lot of ways, this is the technical showcase for the console and its impressive abilities.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2 is a handheld marvel" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GS_gxBWLuak?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is an interesting title to show off your new console, not least because of the way the original game launched back in 2020. The original console versions of the game, particularly the PlayStation 4 edition, performed so poorly that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/12/18/cyberpunk-2077-psn-refund-form-remove-psn-cdpr-ps4-ps5/">Sony pulled the game from the PlayStation Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/21/cyberpunk-2077-is-back-on-the-playstation-store-base-ps4-performance-issues/">CD Projekt Red spent the next two years rebuilding their brand</a>, while having to work to regain gamers’ trust.</p>


<p>That trust seemed to be wholly won back by the time <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/14/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-xbox-upgrade-release/">the upgraded PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S version arrived</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/06/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-dlc-not-on-ps4-xbox-one/">Phantom Liberty expansion</a>, which only launched for the more powerful hardware. The fact that the Nintendo Switch version is launching with the entire base game and its DLC is a statement of intent, for both Nintendo and CDPR. The new handheld can be considered a true current gen console, and this is the game to prove it.</p>
<p>We’ve spent the past week revisiting Night City, and exploring just how impressive this port is. Where the original Switch managed a number of ‘impossible’ ports, including CDPR’s own <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/14/the-witcher-3-switch-review-switcher-performance-analysis/">The Witcher 3</a>, these were heavily compromised visually in order to run on the hardware. Straight away, the Switch 2 version of Cyberpunk 2077 impresses with just how good it looks and performs on the console, both in docked and handheld mode.</p>


<p>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition boasts a choice of graphical modes, with Quality targeting 1080p and 30fps, while Performance mode increases the frame rate target to 40fps at the cost of graphics fidelity and resolution – this works natively on the Switch 2’s screen, but requires a 120Hz display when docked. You can set your choices separately for handheld and docked mode, which is a nice touch, as well as alter the graphical effects like Film Grain and Chromatic Aberration.</p>
<p>We’re sticking to the Quality mode for our comparison and capturing the game docked, putting the Switch 2 up against the most recent version on PS4 – which is missing numerous gameplay overhauls at this point – and the Xbox Series S (note: we seem to have captured XSS with HDR turned on, tonemapped via to elgato with some unusual colours from this).</p>

<p>Going back to PS4 and… well, there’s a reason that the game was so maligned at launch in 2020, and while CDPR did improve things, it’s still pretty bad with performance that can’t ever really hang on to 30fps and looks pretty shonky in the process. The Nintendo Switch 2 easily outstrips the base PS4 in every way, there’s just no two ways about it.</p>
<p>Xbox Series S, meanwhile, provides a much more intriguing point of comparison. Microsoft’s budget console is able to top out at 1440p30 with its dynamic resolution, and even offers a 60fps mode, albeit at a 1080p target and with a significant number of graphical compromises to get there.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 strikes a good middle ground when docked with its 1080p30 target. This game looks genuinely good on the new generation hybrid and performs very, very well in holding to that 30fps target.</p>
<p>The secret sauce, though, is DLSS. The Switch 2 version of Cyberpunk 2077 is able to use Nvidia’s machine learning model to provide temporal anti-aliasing, instead of the version that CDPR shipped for PS4 and Xbox Series S. This isn’t Nvidia’s latest DLSS model, and it’s dealing with low internal resolutions, but the results are still impressive. There is some minor shimmer to background details, but DLSS completely stamps out the ugly ghosting that could trail behind motion in the game on PS4 and Series S, the latter of which currently uses FSR 2.1 on consoles.</p>

<p>Handheld mode is similarly excellent – it’s genuinely remarkable to have this game in your hands like this. I thought Quality Mode was a great way to play, offering a near-seamless experience in both docked and handheld modes, with very few noticeable dips in performance below 30fps.</p>
<p>Handheld Performance Mode is the one place where you really start to feel the limitations of the Switch 2, as the chipset steps down to a lower power mode. This can only target 720p while the 40fps comes with the help of VRR, and through this it feels much more like a classic Switch port, where the compromises are very clear to see. The world and its visual design is still deeply impressive,</p>

<p>Yes, you’ve been able to play this title on Steam Deck and other PC handhelds, but this is a version that just works out of the box. Choose your graphical setting and off you go. Being able to dip into the story, complete a few missions, or even just work your way through some of the different dialogue and interactions, is brilliant, and there’s zero sense that you’re getting a cut-rate experience when you’re playing handheld.</p>
<p>While Cyberpunk looks fantastic here, the Nintendo Switch 2’s other features have also been used, most importantly the all-new mouse mode, which brings the experience closer to PC than any console has before. Besides that, there’s a Joy-Con aiming option, reminding me of the incredible Resident Evil 4 port on the Wii, and you can also use the gyro motion controls to fine tune your aiming. This is really helpful, because I genuinely suck at shooting in Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

<p>All of this combined makes Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition an incredible package for Nintendo Switch 2, letting console players experience the game in a way they never have before, and highlighting just how special Nintendo’s new platform is.</p>

<figure><a title="Vampire Survivors" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3e97ee28083c0/vampire-survivors.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Poncle</em></figcaption></figure><p>Just in time for the arrival of the Switch 2, the award-winning and highly addictive roguelike bullet shooter <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> has received a Nintendo platform update.</p>

Here are the other updates included in this latest Nintendo patch (<a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/49638-vampire-survivors-updated-to-ver-1-13-111-cross-saves-and-more">via GoNintendo</a>):</p>

<hr>
<p>The cross-save feature was originally teased and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/vampire-survivors-teases-new-free-update-probably-the-biggest-one-ever">released on other platforms earlier this year</a>, so it's nice to see it's now available on the Switch systems as well.</p>
<p>If we hear about a dedicated Switch 2 update for Vampire Survivors or anything similar in the future, we'll let you know. For now, though, it's fine to play the game in its current state on Nintendo's new hardware. It's also available for just <strong>$4.99 / £3.99</strong> (<em>or your regional equivalent</em>) on the eShop.</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7ad062caaa12f/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Video game media has now been tearing up the track in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> for the past week – so what's the final verdict?</p>
<p>This new entry, including a whole world to explore and the new Knockout Tour, is currently sitting on a critic rating of 87/100 on Metacritic, with "generally favorable reviews". And on OpenCritic, this "mighty" new game has an average critic score of 86/100.</p>
<p>Starting with our own review here on Nintendo Life, we've given this title a final score of 9/10 – calling it the perfect introduction to Nintendo's new console generation:</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182523 @ 1749725361 -->
<p>So, what did other sites have to say? The team at <a href="https://www.vooks.net/mario-kart-world-switch-2-review/">Vooks</a> gave the game 5/5 and called it "peak" Mario Kart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We’ve never seen <em>Mario Kart</em> look, run, and sound this good. <em>Mario Kart World</em> is peak <em>Mario Kart</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The folks at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">IGN</a> awarded the game 8/10 but weren't quite as taken with the open-world aspect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mario Kart World may not make the most convincing case that going open-world was the boost the series needed, but excellent multiplayer racing, incredible polish, and the thrilling new Knockout Tour mode still more than live up to its legacy."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.siliconera.com/review-mario-kart-world-is-a-perfect-welcome-to-switch-2/">Siliconera</a> called World the "perfect welcome" to Switch 2, also awarding it a score of 9/10:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s fantastic in more traditional modes like Grand Prix and Battle or new ones such as Knockout Tour and Free Roam. It pays tribute to past games, but feels totally different and innovative in some fun ways."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/71382/mario-kart-world-switch-2-review">Nintendo World Report</a> dished out 8/10, even though it was hoping for more from the game's open-world component:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If there’s one part where the Free Roam loses the plot, it’s by not offering any kind of split-screen option aside from a low-key hack in the Local Wireless lobby. The fact that players can’t explore the world together with multiple kart racers fooling around at once is a huge miss."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The team at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">Eurogamer</a> gave Mario Kart World a score of 4/5 stars – labelling it "entertaining, snackable, fun" but was also left wanting more from the free roam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Free Roam had the potential (and probably still does, depending on how Nintendo chooses to update the game) to consume me, but some rather typical Nintendo quirks mean it's at its best when you're dipping your toes in rather than going for a full-on dive."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/nintendo/mario-kart-world-review">Tom's Guide</a> encountered some speed bumps during its review and gave it 3.5/5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Overall, it's another solid effort in Nintendo’s enduring kart-racing series, with the fantastic Knockout Tour mode a highlight. However, this Rainbow Road isn’t without some bumps. The new Free Roam mode is undercooked, and it’s frustrating that it bleeds into franchise staple offerings, making them worse."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And going out with a bang, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-world-review/1900-6418371/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">GameSpot</a> served up another 9/10 – calling the overall experience of Mario Kart World "incredibly fun and rewarding" and a "worthy marquee title" for the new system's launch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It will be shocking if this game doesn't enjoy the same long-term success of its predecessor, because it's among the best in the series and a worthy marquee title for the launch of a new Nintendo console."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p dir="ltr">The update also adds a range of new weapons as part of the "Splatlands Collection." 30 weapons in total are now available in the Ammo Knights shop. The classic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/splatoon/" data-ref-id="5000-285311">Splatoon 1</a> stage Urchin Underpass has been added as well, bringing the total number of multiplayer maps to 25.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, the update makes a range of balance adjustments to certain weapons and specials. Among the changes, both the '91 and '92 variants of the S-Blast now consume more ink, while the Wave Breaker's durability has been improved.

</li>
<li>Added a Series Weapon feature to Anarchy Battle (Series) for Rank S and higher.
<ul>
<li>In Anarchy Battle (Series) for Rank S or higher, Series Weapon Power will be measured for each weapon players equip. They will be matched with other players whose Series Weapon Power is similar to theirs for the currently equipped weapon.</li>
<li>Series Weapon Power is the same for all four modes.</li>
<li>Players can check their current Series Weapon Power for each weapon by pressing the ZL Button on the Equip screen to display the weapon's details.</li>
<li>Series Weapon Power resets each time the season changes, but the highest value players have achieved will be recorded in SplatNet 3.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Anarchy Battle (Open), increased the amount of change in Rank Points per battle by approximately 2.5x.</li>
<li>Made it so that call signs, which are automatically determined using factors such as equipped gear, will display in X Battles in place of nicknames.
<ul>
<li>After the battle ends, you can check players’ actual nicknames and IDs (the string of numbers and letters starting with #) on screens for checking results, such as the match menu and the lobby terminal.</li>
<li>For X Rankings, players’ actual nicknames and IDs will display.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Changes to SplatNet 3</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Players’ Best Nine will now display.
<ul>
<li>“Best Nine” indicates the nine weapons with the highest Series Weapon Power out of all the weapons a player owns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Best Nine rankings will now display.
<ul>
<li>Best Nine rankings are rankings where players compete for total Series Weapon Power for their Best Nine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Notifications from SplatNet 3 will now display in the notifications box within the Nintendo Switch App.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increased the maximum value for weapon Freshness to 10★.
<ul>
<li>Players can earn new badges for weapons by achieving Freshness 6★ to 10★.</li>
<li>Once the update has been applied, weapons that had received XP beyond the maximum value before applying the update will have their Freshness increase after one battle by an amount proportionate to the amount of XP received up to this point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added new badges players can acquire based on the number of weapons with Freshness ★★★★ or higher.</li>
<li>Made it so that other players a player has battled with in Anarchy Battle (Series) and Splatfest Battle (Pro) will not display in the Users You Have Played With system feature of Nintendo Switch/Nintendo Switch 2 consoles.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a bonus update, in this update we added weapons and a stage, increased the maximum Freshness, implemented a Series Weapon feature for Anarchy Battle (Series), added a call sign feature to X Battles, and performed optimization of operations on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>For Anarchy Battle (Series), we implemented a new Series Weapon feature targeted toward players Rank S or higher.</p>
<p>With this feature, the Series Weapon Power will be measured for each weapon currently equipped, and players will be matched up against others with similar levels of power.</p>
<p>We implemented this feature in hopes that players will enjoy battling using a variety of weapons, including the Splatlands Collection - Barazushi / Emberz weapons added in this update.</p>
<p>Additionally, we made balance changes to multiplayer battles.</p>
<p>For S-BLAST ‘92 and S-BLAST ‘91, we have made adjustments to give players fighting against them more room to counter because, from the opponent's point of view, there seemed to be no openings at any distance.</p>
<p>For the Crab Tank, we lowered the maximum damage of the cannon to decrease the frequency that the person being attacked is defeated without any opportunity to evade. We also made it easier for other special weapons to fight against the Crab Tank.</p>
<p>For Toxic Mist, we have reduced the amount of ink consumed to make it easier to fight in combination with main weapons. On the other hand, we have simultaneously extended the time before ink begins to recover so that this change does not lead to tactics where players simply continuously throw their sub weapons.</p>
<p>The next update will focus on multiplayer balance based on analysis of changes to the situation that come with these weapon additions.</p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixes to Player Controls</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue on Nintendo Switch 2 where players were sometimes able to Squid Roll in places not inked by their own ink.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on Nintendo Switch 2 where, when a player in swim form landed from a high place in a place not inked by their own ink, sometimes the landing point would get inked.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when a player attempted to use the A Button or L Button to throw a clam, power clam, Fizzbang, or Golden Egg during the brief period where sub weapons cannot be used immediately after finishing a splatana swing, the line indicating the predicted impact location displayed even though it was not actually possible to throw.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when performing a charged slash with a Grizzco Splatana, the reticle would switch to the crosshairs for a horizontal slash before the charged slash was initiated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixes to Multiplayer</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in certain stages where, when Super Jumping from certain positions to certain other positions, sometimes players were unable to land at the intended position.</li>
<li>Made changes to ease an issue where game operation slowed down when players exploded things like the Reefslider at certain locations in Scorch Gorge.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with Marlin Airport where, when a player hit a propeller with the explosion from Explosher or Custom Explosher, the propellervator’s movement was less than intended.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Lemuria Hub where, when using the Ultra Stamp, players could sometimes enter their opponent’s base in unintended ways from the moving terrain in the center.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixes to Side Order</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when the player skipped animations at certain timings, sometimes unintended screens would display.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Other Fixes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when the player plays a battle replay for a battle where the Big Bubbler was used and moves the replay position, sometimes the player’s equipped weapon and the Big Bubbler would not display properly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-the-veilguard-electronic-arts-sales-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While <em>Dragon Age</em>: <em>The Veilguard</em> has its fans, it's not a scalding take to say that the latest--and likely final for a very long time--entry in the series did not hit like it was supposed to. And while everyone has had six months to try to pin the blame on someone or something, from writing to *spooky voice* diversity,<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-11/inside-the-dragon-age-debacle-that-gutted-ea-s-bioware-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a new report on Bloomberg<em> </em>points the finger</a> at a familiar culprit: gross mismanagement from upstairs.</p><p>In news that will shock absolutely nobody, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier says that <em>Veilguard </em>began life as a singleplayer RPG, was then transformed into an online multiplayer title once EA's leadership saw the kind of money games like <em>Destiny</em> were making (despite Bioware already working on <em>Anthem</em>!) and then, when <em>Anthem </em>tanked, it became a singleplayer RPG once more.</p><p>That's disastrous, reactionary management, which even at the best of times would have resulted in enormous costs as teams rotated through staff and rebuilt systems. These weren't the best of times:</p><blockquote><p>In theory, the reversion back to&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>’s tried-and-true, single-player format should have been welcome news inside BioWare. But there was a catch. Typically, this kind of pivot would be coupled with a reset and a period of pre-production allowing the designers to formulate a new vision for the game. Instead, the team was asked to change the game’s fundamental structure and recast the entire story on the fly, according to people familiar with the new marching orders. They were given a year and a half to finish and told to aim for as wide a market as possible.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Compounding the game's woes were internal politics between the <em>Dragon Age </em>and <em>Mass Effect</em> teams (the latter were brought on to assist in the final months), strict limitations placed on the singleplayer game's structure because of its multiplayer roots and some emergency rewrites that led to huge tonal inconsistencies throughout the game.</p><p>It's a miracle the game came out at all. Beset by so many problems, it's easy to say the game was simply in development hell, but it's a hell of EA's making: The publisher bought Bioware in 2009 because the studio could make hit RPGs, yet under EA's leadership there hasn't been a smash Bioware game in over a <em>decade</em>. And with decisions like these impacting the teams--every hurdle the game's final iteration had to overcome was a result of EA's earlier strategic blunders--it's no wonder <em>Veilguard</em> couldn't buck that trend.</p><p>Here's an idea, EA:<a href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-layoffs-ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> whatever is left of Bioware, a studio famous for singleplayer RPGs</a>, maybe just leave them alone and let them make a singleplayer RPG in peace.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-lost-save-game-pass"><h3>My Lies Of P Save File Is Dead And I Am Full Of Regret</h3></a><p>I love Lies of P, but trying to play Lies of P: Overture became a cautionary tale about Game Pass and personal data archiving.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>After a decade of anticipation from Dragon Age fans, the most-recent sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, arrived last fall and was promptly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-reacts-to-dragon-age-the-veilguard-coming-up-short-and-explains-what-happened/1100-6529252/" data-ref-id="1100-6529252">labeled a disappointment by EA</a>. Despite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review/1900-6416222/" data-ref-id="1900-6416222">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> winning several game of the year awards 10 years earlier, The Veilguard simply wasn't as well-received among fans. Now, a new report is shedding light on The Veilguard's troubled development and why it failed.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-11/inside-the-dragon-age-debacle-that-gutted-ea-s-bioware-studio" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> has offered a comprehensive look back at Dragon Age: The Veilguard, but perhaps the most surprising thing is how much of the story was already known. One of the most common refrains in the report is that BioWare was hamstrung by the initial plans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-boss-discusses-ditching-live-service-and-multiplayer-focus-for-the-veilguard/1100-6527540/" data-ref-id="1100-6527540">to make The Veilguard a live-service title</a>. Even switching back to a single-player game didn't allow the team to recapture the fully-realized stories and options that the previous titles had.</p><p>The report also appears to confirm the account of former Dragon Age series lead writer David Gaider, who previously spoke about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/veilguard-and-mass-effect-teams-didnt-get-along-at-bioware-dragon-age-creator-says/1100-6530858/" data-ref-id="1100-6530858">tension between the Dragon Age and Mass Effect teams</a> at BioWare. Even when the two teams were brought together for The Veilguard, the tribalism remained.</p><p>"As the Mass Effect directors took control, they scoffed that the Dragon Age squad had been doing a shoddy job and began excluding their leaders from pivotal meetings," states the report. Bloomberg also notes that the Dragon Age team was infuriated when the Mass Effect team were allowed to make "big, ambitious swings," while the former was told there wasn't the budget or time to do so.</p><p>"It always seemed that, when the Mass Effect team made its demands in meetings with EA regarding the resources it needed, it got its way," Gaider told Bloomberg. "But Dragon Age always had to fight against headwinds."</p><p>In the aftermath, BioWare <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/" data-ref-id="1100-6529105">laid off staff and reassigned some developers to other teams inside EA</a>. A much smaller team at BioWare is currently working on the next Mass Effect game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lumines-arise-is-going-to-be-your-chill-out-game-of-the-year.1216143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/lumines-arise-is-going-to-be-your-chill-out-game-of-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As soon as I saw <em>Lumines Arise by Enhance</em> make its debut at the State of Play, I was excited. While I haven't played Lumines titles in the past, I was one of the millions to get hooked into the gameplay-audio-visual experience that was <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="afa641fb-5d53-43f0-b390-fc3bc40fea45" href="https://techraptor.net/games/tetris-effect" rel="nofollow"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a>. Lucky for me <em>Lumines Arise</em> was also at Summer Game Fest where I was able to check out the first three levels of the game.</p>

<p><em>Lumines Arise</em> is a block-dropping game where your aim is to destroy enough blocks to be able to complete a level.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In <em>Lumines Arise,</em> you're always dropping a 2x2 cube made up of two different types of shapes. Much like in <em>Tetris Effect,&nbsp;</em>as you progress through different levels and songs what you're dropping will pretty much always be changing. Even across the few levels I played I saw the blocks include coins, spherical wind effects, a nut (as in 'nut and bolt'), and what seemed to be AC Compressors.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lumines-arise-seahorses.jpg?itok=BZknXJxz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lumines-arise-seahorses.jpg?itok=7r1738qj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As you're dropping your 2x2 cube of differing units, your goal is to create squares out of the pieces that have already been dropped. When you have a 2x2 cube of a single shape that's easy enough, but sometimes they'll be one shape on the left and one on the right, or opposite corners from one another. Create a 2x2 cube, 4x4 or even larger cubes to earn points.</p>

<p>A major difference to a title like <em>Tetris Effect</em>, where when you achieve a line it disappears, the squares you make in <em>Lumines Arise</em> only disappear once the line that is continuously moving from left to right passes over it. This opens up fast gameplay to creating combos, and even setting up additional cubes for when one set disappears.</p>

<p>The further you progress the faster the game plays, you'll need to work even harder to ensure you're spinning boxes appropriately, making quick matches, and giving the line enough time to clear out the groupings you've made.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lumines-arise-06.jpg?itok=bTW1W9_m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lumines-arise-06.jpg?itok=QSOFZLh5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While it wasn't on display at Summer Game Fest <em>Lumines Arise</em> will also support PSVR2 and PCVR for those who REALLY want to get in on the relaxing gameplay.</p>

<h2>The Audio-Visual Feast Of <em>Lumines Arise</em></h2>

<p>At time-limited gameplay appointments it's key to be able to talk about a game while playing it, maximizing your chance to not only experience the game but hear from an expert near you about what the game will entail and why excited gamers will want to play it. That was not the case for me at <em>Lumines Arise</em>.</p>

<p>Sitting there with headphones on, watching the colorful blocks spin, strange chameleons dance, and the score rising I took 15 minutes to get through the provided levels and it was one of the most relaxing and focused experiences of the show for me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Game For Many Experience Levels</strong><br>
After my completion I was advised that what took me 15 minutes took some returning players 7 minutes, and others 22.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much like Tetris Effect, each level of the game has a unique soundtrack, effects, and symbols. Each of these isn't just a repetition, a song on loop, but also speeds up, and slows down with the game pairing together all elements of the game to be in sync in an incredibly satisfying way.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lumines-arise-chameleons.jpg?itok=KQxRqQz_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lumines-arise-chameleons.jpg?itok=XgCloVOj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There will also be playlist options so while you're playing, you can jam out to your favorite tracks.</p>

<h2><em>Lumines Arise</em> Confirms Multiplayer And Campaign</h2>

<p>In talking with CJ, Product Manager at Enhance, about the gameplay options when <em>Lumines Arise</em> releases on Steam and PS5 later this year he indicated that it would come with a full Journey mode, taking players through keenly curated levels, but that it would also have an Endless mode to zone out and try for your highest score.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"At it's core it's about forming two by two squares, but the skill ceiling is so huge" - CJ, Product Manager at Enhance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, <em>Lumines Arise</em> will have multiplayer modes, though he wasn't able to tell me more about those at this time. Whatever those multiplayer modes are though will be enjoyable in the Summer Demo that will be coming along before too long.</p>

<p>One gameplay mode that CJ advised a lot of effort was being put into was the training mode. This is being developed so that while the game is completable by simple clearing each level when you want to challenge others online or go for the longest streak possible in Endless mode that you'll have all of the tools at your disposal.</p>

<p>If you're not a fan of loud music, pulsing and shifting icons, and technicolor images moving up, down, around, and through your screen then worry not. <em>Lumines Arise</em> features a wide variety of accessibility options to make sure as many players as possible can experience the game.</p>

<p>Some of the accessibility features mentioned were that you can change any of the screen effects, make the play field static, can normalize the look of the blocks for easier recognition, and <em>Lumines Arise</em> will also include colorblind settings.</p>

<p>The game also has three different difficulty modes, and an additional setting that the blocks are the top of the screen won't start dropping automatically.</p>

<p>You can control nearly even level of the single player experience.</p>

<p><em>Lumines Arise</em> is doing for <em>Lumines </em>for <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fea07652-3892-4b73-b789-13e6a4c5b930" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tetris-effect-review-full-of-stars" rel="nofollow"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a> did for <em>Tetris</em>. It's bringing a curated story experience, perfect to zone out to, and a fun new level of play for fans of the dropping blocks genre.</p>

<p>It's a game where you'll be able to continuously challenge your speed and wit while getting to enjoy beautiful visuals and engaging music.</p>

<p>That being said, at it's core it is still a game about dropping blocks to solve puzzles and moving on. If you're not a fan of this genre then it's not likely Lumines Arise will be what convinces you to enjoy it, but if you do at least enjoy good atmospheric EDM tracks then it's probably at least worth a few rounds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-preview-focused-on-teamwork<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Surprisingly enough, <em>Pathfinder </em>hasn’t had a ton of video game adaptations, though the team at BKOM Studios is here to change that. They’re taking one of Pathfinder’s most popular Adventure Paths, Abominations Vaults, and turning into a hack and slash RPG.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A Classic Hack and Slash</h2>

<p>What I played at SGF Play Days was a vertical slice of the game that is not quite finished. If you’re familiar with isometric hack and slash games like<em> Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance</em>, the old <em>Gauntlet </em>games, or the <em>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance</em> games, you know what I’m getting at.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you play, there are always four characters (an AI will control those not played by someone) that work together on the field. They have complementary abilities, like healing each other or setting up combos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One unique aspect was that each had an AoE they could throw on the ground that then buffs the heavy attack of your friends with a unique effect while they stand in it. Those sort of interactions are exactly what they want to happen throughout the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When talking to Creative Director Wyatt Gray, he described the design philosophy of the game and what he envisions certain elements of the game to be like.</p>

<h2>Focusing on Teamwork</h2>

<p>For one, he wasn’t looking for a mindless hack and slash but something that really emphasized cooperation and the party working together to accomplish some task. That can come in the form of combat, navigating the level, solving puzzles, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, we all worked together to push large boulders out of the way to get further in the level. In another area, there was a noxious gas slowly killing us that could be relieved by a healing mist from some nearby mushrooms two party members could then activate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a more advanced way, Gray mentioned scenarios where two people in the party may be rowing and controlling a raft while the other two defend them from enemies attacking. They want to get creative in the scenarios they put players in to have to overcome together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To that end, even if you’re playing solo, <em>Abomination Vaults</em> will always feature four heroes running around with you. You have the option of swapping through them at any time while playing as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gray noted that for a solo player, it is a slightly different game. You can fine tune characters to be a singular killing machine that sets up combos the way you want, where multiplayer lets you and some friends play each character the way they want.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A Pathfinder Adventure Classic</h2>

<p>The four characters you play are likely well-known to Pathfinder players: Amiri the Barbarian, Harsk the Ranger, Kyra the Cleric, and Ezren the Wizard. Fans of Owlcat Games may remember Amiri the Barbarian, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each character will have three different subclasses you can choose, which vastly change up their gameplay style. And of course there’s a ton of gear that will let you build them as you please.</p>



<p>Moreover, if you’ve played through the Adventure Path of <em>Abomination Vaults</em> of the pen and paper variety of <em>Pathfinder</em>, most of this game is going to be very familiar to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gray said that their game is essentially an adaptation of the 1 – 10 experience of <em>Abomination Vaults</em>, so the characters, settings, and story beats will remain the same. Obviously there will be some minor changes to make it work for a game, but by and large it’s the same thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the end, <em>Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults</em> looks like it will be a good time, particularly with friends. It has a let’s grab some food and drinks, chill for a bit, and just go on an adventure vibe"... sort of like the tabletop version of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p>Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults was previewed at Summer Game Fest and is looking to release in 2026 only on PC currently.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/lego-party-preview-more-interactive-party-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>LEGO </em>games always have a certain charm and humor to them that always makes for a good time. That same wit, whacky, and unserious atmosphere permeates <em>LEGO Party</em>. Is it <em>Mario Party</em>? Well, yes but also no.</p>

<h2>Is LEGO Party Just Mario Party?</h2>

<p>It’s impossible not to compare <em>LEGO Party</em> to <em>Mario Party</em>, and it’s set up in a similar way. The main game is set up on a board with spaces, minigames in between, and you're collecting gold bricks instead of stars. Though, there are some change ups and nice quality of life features that <em>Party </em>fans will be happy to hear about.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for changes, <em>LEGO Party</em> doesn’t have a set turn order. That is determined by the order of where everyone placed in the minigame prior. Each new game is kicked off with that initial minigame before you start moving on the board.</p>



<p>Whoever wins the first minigame not only has the first turn of the game, but they also have a huge advantage. Everyone starts with enough bits to buy a gold brick, and the first gold brick is always just a few spaces from the start. A quick way to get an early lead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One big change is just how much more interactive and just plain active the game is while you’re playing.<em> LEGO Party </em>tries to have very little downtime where even the screen showing minigame winners is a little box you can run around and slap each other in. Where something like <em>Mario Party</em> can have great theming in one of the boards,<em> LEGO Party</em> enlivens it with an announcer that helps really sell the competition you’re in on top of all the board's quirks.</p>

<h2>LEGO Party Is Full of Charm and Jokes</h2>

<p>There are over 13,000 unique lines of dialogue for that announcer written by the writer of <em>LEGO City Undercover</em>. Some of that is set up for what is happening on screen, and there is a lot of reactivity to what just happened, like a drastic change in who is winning.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>LEGO Party </em>is set up as though you’re participating in a game show, so the announcer plays a big role and that’s why he always has something to say. It is all laced with the classic <em>LEGO </em>humor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The contestants of said game show, you and your friends, can make the minifigure of your dreams if you want as well. They are fully customizable, from the head, torso, legs, hats, and all other accoutrements that you may desire. We didn’t get to play with it much, as we all know how easy it is to get lost in character customization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At launch, there will be four different boards that all play quite differently. We played the smaller pirate themed board, which was full of interesting hazards and unique board elements that fit the theme. For example, you would get picked up and thrown to a different part of the board by a giant tentacle or could rebuild a pirate ship to bury treasure (gold bricks) around the map.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other maps were larger, with one based on <em>Ninjago</em>, another in space, and the last was a theme park-like in that there were four distinct areas that each acted very differently from the other. They’re each designed for a certain play length, and we found that six turns is about 30 minutes of gameplay.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minigames are Flash Games Inspired</h2>

<p>Minigames are a pretty big step up from what you might see in something like <em>Mario Party</em>. Developer SMG Studio said that a couple of their designers have a deep history with making classic flash games, hundreds of them in fact, which you can really see in the minigame design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one, it was a downhill snowboarding game that seemed ripped from my childhood, another was a <em>Splatoon</em>-like where we had to run over sections of the map to paint them our brick color, and another was pretty much just straight up <em>Trials </em>and whoever got furthest in the time would win.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the board itself, there are quite a few opportunities to level the playing field. For example, someone landed on a dueling space that pitted us 2v2 (there is no 1v1, everyone is always involved in everything) where the winning team would get a golden brick. High stakes and it made the minigame that much more fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are also things like hidden bricks that may net you a golden brick just by luck and a lot of shenanigans built into the boards to knock people off the top so they don't get too far ahead.</p>

<p>We played a condensed version, but it felt that every turn who was up top was changing. There is a lot of “rubberbanding” to keep everyone in a similar playing field. By that, I also mean that there is a lot of random shenanigans with seemingly no explanation like <em>Mario Party </em>as well.</p>

<h2>LEGO Party Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>LEGO Party</em> was a good time that I think anyone who likes party games will absolutely love. There is a lot of charm, the boards are fun to engage with and look at, and a lot of attention was given to making sure there isn’t a ton of down time.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/possessors-preview-deal-with-devil-thats-worth-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Often, I bounce off metroidvanias due to their rather slow and deliberate combat as you move around their sprawling maps. <em>Possessor(s)</em> is quick, brutal, and full of cool combos powered by an arsenal you can make your own.</p>

<h2>Quick Customizable Combat</h2>

<p>I like the fast-paced weapons, but <em>Possessor(s)</em> will give you an arsenal of weapons and abilities to customize as you like. Pair that with its quick movement and dodge, and you’ve got all you need to be effective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You'll have your main attack determined by the weapons you equip and up to three different secondary abilities you can throw out there. The one I had access to was a computer mouse that you whipped forward to hit enemies with a combo, which was really reminiscent of Ness's yo-yo attacks in <em>Smash Bros</em>.</p>



<p>Obviously, movement and getting around the map is pretty key in the game. I was introduced to wall jumping and given a grappling hook to swing on certain points – as well as use it in combat to pull enemies towards me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are some soulslike elements to <em>Possessor(s)</em>, as well. The save points you reach are akin to bonfires, and you collect a currency for defeating enemies along the way. They respawn if you heal up and you leave behind something to collect if you die to retrieve that lost currency.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A Big, Visually Interesting Setting</h2>

<p>I didn’t have enough time to really dig into the exploration of the game, as in getting a sense of the scale or just how interconnected it is, but I did get to see vast swaths of empty map for objectives I had to get to. Plus, there are a ton of hidden secrets if you’re keeping an eye out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every area I went into was visually interesting and had engaging level design for moving/fighting through the level. None were simply just go left to right to get to the next area. Lots of verticality and visual cues for things to check out.</p>

<p>As much as I love to speed through some platforming quickly dealing damage, taking in the sights is worth it.</p>

<h2>Story with a Great Hook</h2>

<p>As someone who can’t get enough of a good story, <em>Possessor(s)</em> has a great setting and hook. Something has led to demons attacking, seemingly related to some big corporation go figure, that has left the main character, Luca, extremely injured with both her legs missing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game starts with you literally crawling along legless, trailing blood behind you, before you reach an injured demon. Of course, Luca has no choice and makes a deal with the demon who promises he can restore her legs. He didn’t tell her that three years would pass in that time, however.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luca awakes three years later in the world wracked by demons, now intimately connected with on of her own, Rehm. He grants her some abilities and they have a tenuous truce as they both realize that they need one another to survive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can’t wait to see where the story goes, as it has a lot of potential for great character moments and big setpiece moments as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you like metroidvanias, <em>Possessor(s)</em> is an obvious one to keep your eye on. Combat is great, story is intriguing, and it is genuinely fun to move around the map. Not much more you can ask for.</p>
