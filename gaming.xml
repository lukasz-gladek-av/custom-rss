FromSoftware has released a brand new story trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-everything-we-know-9415">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree.
</p>
<p>
The trailer lasts three minutes and provides a fresh look at the story, which for the most part has remained under wraps until now despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-trailer-analysed">analysis and speculation on previous trailers</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can watch the trailer in full below.

<p>So what do we see?</p>
<p>"Miquella the kind spoke of the beginning," the narration begins. "The seduction and the betrayal. An affair from which gold arose. And so too was shadow born." That certainly seems to encapsulate the backdrop of the narrative, which is spoken along with images of Miquella walking up bloody steps towards an archway of bloodied bodies, presumably awakening from his slumber.</p>

<p>We witness a war of flames, with plenty of those caged fiery giants from the previous trailer. "A purge without grace or honour, the tyranny of Messmer's flame," says the narration as the big bad presides over the battle. We see another previously seen boss too as eventually the camera pans upwards from the battle in the shadow of the golden erdtree. It seems clear that the golden Miquella and the flaming Messmer are at odds.</p>

<p>Repeatedly we see this golden symbol, presumably marks left by Miquella, in various environments. Is this a new type of site of grace, or just an indicator of our goal?</p>

<p>The final shot sees the camera pan backwards to reveal a number of characters stood at one of these symbols, the golden erdtree in the background. Are these characters we'll meet along the journey as we follow in Miquella's footsteps? And, in typical Souls fashion, are they not to be trusted? "We choose to follow," speaks the narration. "Will you walk with us?"</p>

<p>
We don't have long to decide now as Shadow of the Erdtree will release next month on 21st June across all platforms and will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-fromsoftwares-largest-expansion-ever">FromSoftware's "largest expansion" ever</a>. It will also be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-elden-rings-sole-dlc-but-may-not-be-the-series-end">the sole DLC, but maybe not the end of the series</a>.
</p>
<p>
In the lead up to this new story trailer, the studio has released artwork of some new enemies including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-reveals-new-elden-ring-enemy-with-bloodborne-esque-design">Bloodborne-esque enemy with a bulbous golden head</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-dlc-features-fearsome-foes-of-unfathomable-power-and-heres-one-of-them">masked creature some have likened to a uterus</a>.

			<p>A new Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree trailer was released online today, providing a new quick look at the highly anticipated expansion.</p>
<p>The new trailer, which can be watched below, focuses on the expansion's story, which takes place in the Land of Shadow, a place obscured by the Erdtree where the goddess Marika first set foot. Guided by the Empyrean Miquella, players will discover the dark secrets of the world in this land and meet others who follow in Miquella's footsteps with ulterior motives.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree | Story Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6uT8wGtB3yQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With its new locations to explore and new enemies to defeat while taking advantage of new mechanics and weapons, the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion is set to improve the Elden Ring experience considerably, which was already excellent to begin with, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>I tried hard to find any faults in Elden Ring, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't find any outside of some technical issues that the developers could fix via patches. I firmly believe that perfection doesn't exist and that it is always possible to improve, but I really couldn't think of anything that Elden Ring could have done better. As such, the game wholly deserves a perfect score, an honor I would have given only to a couple of other modern games, not only for its extremely high quality but also for what it accomplished with its open world and for how it will surely influence video games as a whole in the future.</em></p>
<p>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree launches on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One on June 21st.</p>

The RPG follows Mario and an eclectic group of pals as they hunt for stars on a treasure map to unlock the secret behind the titular Thousand-Year Door. Turn-based combat has you hitting buttons in real-time to make attacks and other techniques more effective, and a badge system lets you experiment with different strategies. Another highlight is the writing, which isn’t afraid to be both funny <em>and</em> weird. And after years of gimmick-driven sequels, the lost GameCube gem offers a purer, more old-school RPG alternative to the likes of <em>Paper Mario: Color Splash </em>and <em>Paper Mario: The Origami King</em>. </p><p>At the time of this writing, the new release of <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> has an 89 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/game/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Metacritic</a></span>, and it doesn’t appear to have cut any of the story beats or dialogue that has stuck with fans for decades. But it also doesn’t appear to have added much in the way of new content, making it feel like more of a straight HD port. “<em>The Thousand-Year Door </em>has all the ingredients of an incredible turn-based RPG,” wrote  Steven Petite for <em>GameSpot</em>, while at <em>Nintendo Life</em> Alana Hagues <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> that the remaster falls slightly short of last year’s <em>Super Mario RPG </em>when it comes to adding additional gameplay wrinkles. </p><p>Here’s a round-up of what others are saying about <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door.</em></p><hr><h3 id="h104212"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Rogueport and its surrounding areas are bursting with personality thanks to writing that’s just as sharp and funny today as it was in 2004. It also introduces a host of modern improvements that streamline (but don’t eliminate) the original’s backtracking issues, easily making this the best way to experience Mario’s quest to gather the Crystal Stars. </p></blockquote><h3 id="h104213"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-step-inside-the-plumber-rpgs-back/1900-6418230/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-step-inside-the-plumber-rpgs-back/1900-6418230/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GameSpot</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> <em>The Thousand-Year Door </em>has so many great lines of dialogue that touch on the full range of human emotions that it’s absolutely worth your time to talk to every NPC you encounter and read the messages sent to Mario’s Game Boy Advance SP communication device—there are some real gems in there. A few lines of dark humor actually made my mouth drop, and it’s hard to believe that the words of a Bob-omb with a steering wheel attached to his back got to me more than any game in a long time. There’s even a conversation about the need for renewable energy sources—as a reminder, this game is from 2004.</p></blockquote><h3 id="h104214"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24159333/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-remake-nintendo-switch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/24159333/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-remake-nintendo-switch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> is one of the last times that Mario didn’t feel like a carefully managed pop star, never allowed to appear even remotely unlikable. In <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em>, however, he can be a little prick, should you so choose, telling people to “beat it, loser!” as if a little paper mustachioed man was capable of intimidating anyone. The fact that this game is returning on its 20th anniversary, hot off the heels of a remake of the similarly idiosyncratic and beloved <em>Super Mario RPG</em>, hearkens back to a time when a big Mario game could be for a specific kind of person, and not necessarily for everyone. </p></blockquote><h3 id="h104215"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-nintendo-switch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Digital Trends</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> If you were hoping that <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> on Nintendo was a thorough remake that redefines a classic, you may come away from this Switch remake disappointed. Thankfully, <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em> still holds up 20 years after release, thanks to some hilarious dialogue, timeless visuals, and an approachable RPG battle system. While it’s a bit of a bummer that Nintendo’s 2024 game lineup is mostly comprised of remakes, I’m glad Nintendo is giving <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em> a second shot at life. It truly isn’t like any other Mario game out there.</p></blockquote><h3 id="h104216"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/review/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/back-and-forward&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/back-and-forward" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Game Informer</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>For all the annoyances of repeating areas and slow (but engaging) combat, <em>Thousand-Year Door </em>is now a series highlight. It marks the first instance of where I didn’t want a Mario RPG to go (I generally prefer the Mario &amp; Luigi direction), but the constant fourth-wall breaking, myriad colorful and unique characters, and its willingness to just be weird all lead to a joyful journey. I am grateful that this shined-up version of the GameCube classic I missed is finally available on a contemporary platform.</p></blockquote><h3 id="h104217"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>TheGamer</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> To contrast, the next level has you infiltrate a haunted church in order to lift a curse that turns villagers into pigs. It’s giving<em> Majora’s Mask</em>, and the fact that it doesn’t end with the boss battle – the twist here is great – gives it life and vibrancy, despite the dim corridors you explore. The platforming puzzles are clever, but it’s all over too quick. After spending such a long time in the wrestling ring, I was excited to get back to the game proper, and felt shortchanged.</p></blockquote><h3 id="h104218"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.engadget.com/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-a-switch-remake-mostly-befitting-a-masterpiece-130052569.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.engadget.com/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-a-switch-remake-mostly-befitting-a-masterpiece-130052569.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Engadget</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> It’s too bad Nintendo had to lower the frame rate down to 30fps from the Gamecube’s silky smooth 60fps, but it’s not the end of the world. If you can enjoy some of the greatest games ever made in 30fps, like <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, <em>The Thousand Year Door</em> is no different. The remake also adds enough new graphical elements to make it look better than the original. I’m sure I nailed the game’s timing-based moves more often in 60fps, but they’re still fairly easy to pull off (except for those damn counters).</p></blockquote><h3 id="h104219"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-remake/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Like most <em>Paper Mario</em> games, the narrative is the star here. But where other entries have been let down by their occasionally gimmicky gameplay, <em>Thousand-Year Door</em>’s RPG mechanics remain pleasingly robust and consistently engaging, with players able to battle foes alongside their companions in turn-based battles, and level up their stats upon defeating enough of them. At the time, these systems will have felt staunchly conservative. There’s little here that didn’t feature in the first two <em>Mario RPG</em> games, or indeed a decade of genre classics released before it. But after enduring dozens of tedious <em>Paper Mario </em>reinventions in the years since, it is frankly something of a relief to return to a set of balanced and compelling mechanics, with no stickers, cards, or bags of confetti in sight.﻿</p></blockquote><h3 id="h104220"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.techradar.com/gaming/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>TechRadar</em></a></span></h3><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door’s Nintendo Switch remake demonstrates that the 20-year-old Gamecube role-playing game has aged like a fine wine, barely touching its gameplay elements while offering a stunning glow-up in the visual department. Some may lament the 30fps cap and some rather antiquated backtracking, but it remains a thoroughly charming and engaging experience from start to finish. </p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>FromSoftware has released the story trailer for Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring/shadow-of-the-erdtree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ahead of the expansion’s release</a> on June 21 for all available platforms. </p>



<p>The trailer, which you can watch below, gives a glimpse into the player’s journey as they head into the Land of Shadow at the behest of Empyrean Miquella.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree | Story Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m55p6BzELb4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>“In these strange new lands, players discover the dark secrets of the world as they meet others who follow in&nbsp;Miquella’s footsteps with ulterior motives,” the expansion’s description reads.</p>



<p>The expansion will add new weapons, weapon skills, equipment, and magic for players as well as a number of new enemies. As you explore the new area of the Land of Shadow, you’ll be able to “seamlessly travel back and forth” between there and the Lands Between.</p>



<p>When it releases on June 21, Shadow of the Erdtree will cost $39.99. Players will need the base game in order to play the expansion.</p>



<p>After Shadow of the Erdtree, Elden Ring fans shouldn’t expect to see a second expansion for the game. FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-reportedly-wont-get-new-dlc-after-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a recent interview</a> that there wouldn’t be anything else released for Elden Ring. However, there is still the potential of a sequel somewhere down the line.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">From Software just dropped a new cinematic trailer for Elden Ring's upcoming DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, and it's packed with lore and details to discuss.</p><p dir="ltr">In the trailer, we see a battle that takes place prior to The Shattering, the big calamitic event that kicks off a lot of the story in Elden Ring. The battle seems to take place during a war that asserts the dominance that the Greater Will and the Golden Order will have by the events of the main game, and we get to see a lot of Messmer the Impaler doing what he does best, too.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Sadly, we don't see more gameplay or confirmation of what we can expect to experience when playing Shadow of the Erdtree. That said, the trailer does showcase some runes that could be a replacement for the Lost Grace resting points seen in the main game--so that might be a potential indicator toward gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">Game director Hidetaka Miyazaki has said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-first-and-last-dlc-no-other-content-planned/1100-6523137/">Shadow of the Erdtree will be "the first and last DLC" for Elden Ring</a>, making this our final hurrah into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2022/1100-6509957/">GameSpot's Game of the Year for 2022</a>. It's shaping up to be one of the largest post-launch expansions FromSoftware has ever done (possibly just the largest, period) as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-dlcs-map-is-as-big-or-bigger-than-limgrave/1100-6521275/">Shadow of the Erdtree's map is as big or bigger than Limgrave</a>, the first major area in Elden Ring.</p><p dir="ltr">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is set to launch June 21 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch-vivian-trans-localization/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch-vivian-trans-localization<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="386" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Reviews for the Nintendo Switch remake of <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> dropped earlier today (<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including our own</a>), and they’ve unsurprisingly been overwhelmingly positive. What is surprising, though, is that among the game’s quality-of-life updates includes a revised localization and script, which unambiguously cements the character of Vivian as a transgender woman.</p> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">This was highlighted in <a href="https://youtu.be/3ZPwyfIL_qU?si=EjEbli6vQseViJSM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo Life’s own video review</a> on the remake, which shows off this line from Vivian that wasn’t present in the original Western release: “Truth is, it took me a while to realize I was their sister… not their brother. Now their usual bullying feels heavier.”</p> <figure data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">For context, Vivian was always written as trans in the original <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em>, at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191203073129/https://themushroomkingdom.net/pmttyd_j2e.shtml#vivian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">least in the Japanese script</a>. In fact, this was central to Vivian’s character arc as she eventually joins Mario as a party member, having grown sick of her sister Beldam’s insults whereas Mario treats her with kindness. </p> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="709" data-injectable="true">When the game was localized and released in the West, this aspect was rewritten; Beldam was still a nasty bully who belittled Vivian’s appearance and clumsiness, but any allusions to Vivian’s gender were excised. For the remake, though, the updated script goes out of its way to ensure there’s no room for debate or alternative reading; Vivian is unquestionably trans.</p>
 <p data-characters="641" data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true">I’m honestly shocked this has even happened, but it’s awesome nonetheless. Aside from allowing Vivian’s character arc to be fully realized with no compromises, it’s just nice to see more positive trans representation, particularly in a franchise as huge and popular as <em>Super Mario</em>. <a href="https://x.com/Dededaio2/status/1792907310785830917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fans of Vivian on Twitter</a> are seeing this as <a href="https://x.com/mrgrizz123/status/1792914541136736456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an absolute win</a>, though they also acknowledge this is going to <a href="https://x.com/BlackeyeThe2nd/status/1792912703927021607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">invite the usual tired discourse and outrage</a>. I must reiterate, this isn’t ‘forced diversity’ on the part of the localization team; Vivian is trans in the original Japanese, so this is an accurate translation.</p>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">The remake of <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> was always going to be worth checking out if only for the pedigree of the original. It would’ve received praise for its combat, funny dialogue, pleasing visuals, and quality-of-life updates anyway, but this tiny clarification to the script is a big deal for a lot of people, and one worth celebrating.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/does-xdefiant-have-sbmm-skill-based-matchmaking/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=does-xdefiant-have-sbmm-skill-based-matchmaking<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="170" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) continues to be one of the most controversial features in first-person shooter titles, and players want to know if it will be in <em>XDefiant</em>. </p> <p data-characters="491" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true">Skill-based matchmaking refers to the matchmaking system and algorithms a game uses to find other players.&nbsp;Users are placed in matches based on connection and skill level. After years of silence, Activision finally <a href="https://dotesports.com/call-of-duty/news/call-of-duty-wrote-1700-words-in-tell-all-skill-based-matchmaking-blog-yet-changed-nothing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> in January that SBMM is used in <em>CoD</em>. In defense of SBMM, Activision argued that it set out to create an even experience where the top and bottom players on the scoreboard don’t have too wide of a gap in ability and wins and losses happen regularly for everyone.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">However, a segment of highly skilled&nbsp;<em>CoD&nbsp;</em>players argue that SBMM unfairly punishes them, as they are forced to face increasingly difficult opposition if they perform better. The never-ending debate shows no signs of slowing down soon as the feature still dominates conversations. Here is everything you need to know about whether or not it will be in <em>XDefiant</em>. </p> <h2 id="h-does-xdefiant-have-sbmm-skill-based-matchmaking" data-injectable="false">Does <em>XDefiant</em> have SBMM (Skill-based matchmaking)?</h2> <figure data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft </figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="336" data-injectable="false"><em>XDefiant</em> <strong>does not use skill-based matchmaking for its casual playlist</strong>. If players want a more competitive experience, ranked mode will use SBMM. Ranked won’t officially be available at launch, but players can test the 4v4 competitive mode in a ranked mode practice playlist. Ubisoft plans to add a ranked mode in a future season. </p> <p data-characters="117" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">Instead of matching based on skill, <em>XDefiant</em> puts a priority on fast connection times among a list of other factors. </p>
 <ol data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li>Latency</li> <li>Blocked Players</li> <li>Party Size</li> <li>Region</li> <li>Input Device</li> <li>Platform</li> </ol> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="595" data-injectable="true">In saying that, casual matches do not use skill to determine who gets into a game, but once the lobby is full, <em>XDefiant </em>balances the teams based on skill to ensure a somewhat balanced match. Ranked Play will use the same list of criteria, but rank points and matching players within an acceptable rank range will be the most important determining factor. </p>
 <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">“We believe that no SBMM is paramount to a fun and varied game experience in the long-term,” Ubisoft <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/73QFbfzYxQbbL4ua8DValH/matchmaking-in-xdefiant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>. “Frankly, skill-based matchmaking means every casual game is repetitive- constantly repeating matches that are just as stressful and matched as ranked.” </p> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="520" data-injectable="false">Lobby persistence has also been an issue in <em>CoD</em>. <em>XDefiant </em>will test the feature later this year, meaning subsequent games will often include the same group of players from the previous match but will shuffle the users between teams. </p>

<p data-characters="261" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Winning a game of <em>Fortnite</em> is never easy, but some players are convinced that the game’s Zero Build mode has gotten a whole lot harder, with players claiming it’s been “miserable” and that they’re getting “annihilated.”</p> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">When Zero Build was introduced to <em>Fortnite</em> in March 2022, it provided a safe space for gamers who didn’t enjoy the building aspect of the game, or simply weren’t very good at it. Like many, I ran to the mode and never looked back, and I don’t think I’ve played a build game since. </p> <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="486" data-injectable="true">While I definitely found the mode easier, some players have complained that Zero Build has suddenly become much more difficult, posting about it on the official <em>Fortnite</em> subreddit. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Zero Build made me as happy as this guy. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">“In the last few days, the lobbies I am getting are significantly harder,” wrote Professional-Wish116. “I am guessing it’s because I am getting better so being put in harder lobbies. Or is it just what it’s like at the end of a season?”</p>
 <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true">They weren’t alone in this feeling either, with Sweet-Cicada-6971 stating: “My experience is the exact same. Basically since yesterday every game feels like a tournament. People are trying so hard, every game I get blasted by TikTokers on Level 500, it’s crazy,” with YrsaAse saying their experience had been “miserable” and that they “weren’t just losing” but getting “absolutely annihilated.”</p>
 <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">As for why this is happening, the resounding theory is that with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-update-countdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 5, Season 3</a> starting on May 24, lots of players have returned to the game to rank up their battle passes before they expire. The influx of returning players has then raised the quality of lobbies, making them harder. </p> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="584" data-injectable="false">Of course, it is possible that Epic Games have tweaked their matchmaking system, but nothing has been announced by the developer so we can’t be sure. We’ll learn more over the next week though as lobbies settle post-update, and we may even hear from Epic if they have made changes. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-games-bucharest<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon Games has announced that it's opening a new studio in Bucharest, Romania, representing the studio's fifth development location and its first in Europe.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/bucharest-studio-announcement" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement post</a> on the official Amazon Games website, the Bucharest studio will "focus on supporting Amazon Games' diverse portfolio of games now and in the future".</p>

<p>According to Amazon Games VP Christoph Hartmann, Bucharest is "one of the top emerging European cities for game development", and the addition of a studio in the city is Amazon's "natural next step".</p>

<p>He's worked with franchises like&nbsp;<em>Far Cry</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tom Clancy's The Division</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Crew</em>, and he says he's excited to join Amazon Games in order to get the chance to work on the company's "exciting roadmap".</p>

<p>As well as announcing Pana's stewardship of Amazon Games Bucharest, Amazon also <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/cristian-pana-interview" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released an interview</a> with its new studio head in which he discusses his career, his achievements, and some of the projects he's overseen.</p>

<p>Pana says that the game of which he's most proud is&nbsp;<em>Tom Clancy's The Division</em>, where he headed up the development of post-launch content.</p>

<p>Those layoffs took place against the backdrop of a wider industry trend that has also seen companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">Sony</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-layoffs-targets-20-of-workforce-resulting-in-1100-jobs-lost">Hasbro</a> letting hundreds of employees go within the last year or so.</p>

<p>Despite that, Amazon still has a pretty stacked slate of upcoming games, with projects like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/blue-protocol"><em>Blue Protocol</em></a>, an as-yet untitled&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game, and a&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>MMO (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-game-studios-cancels-lord-of-rings-game">no, not that one</a>) currently in the works at the company's gaming division.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see where Bucharest slots into Amazon's plans. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24160999/hellblade-2-headphones-audio-engineering<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23992977/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-looks-extremely-intense"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em></a>, the first and only instruction the game provides is that the game is <a href="https://youtu.be/nTek6v64bG4?si=bgQ9B4nEIf3SXEYH">best experienced with headphones</a>. Typically, I always ignore that advice. I’m not a “headphones on, lights off” kind of player. I don’t need <em>ambiance. </em>But for <em>Hellblade II</em>, I decided, “Why not?” What followed was an aural <em>experience</em> that thrilled, frightened, and unsettled the Hel(lblade) outta me.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Of course, if, for whatever reason, you can’t play with headphones, the game’s subtitles and closed captioning do good work conveying the game’s unique audio design.</em></p><p>In <em>Hellblade II</em>,<em> </em>the follow-up to 2017’s<em> Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice</em>, Senua, a Pict warrior, embarks on another harrowing journey. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16117978/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review-ps4-pc">Instead of venturing to the gates of Helheim</a>, she travels north to confront the viking raiders that have been stealing and enslaving her people. On her journey, Senua is accompanied by a Homeric chorus of voices that reflect her struggle with psychosis. The team at Ninja Theory made it a point to explain that they <a href="https://youtu.be/KVBxvlRV0d4?si=-FsKyhWDLqitiAid">consulted with mental health experts</a> — including a professor of psychiatry at Cambridge University and people who live with the disorder — in order to portray psychosis respectfully and accurately. That manifests as hearing voices clip in and out of each side of my headphones. At the beginning of the game, I would whip my head left or right as the voices jumped around before I finally grew used to them. </p><p>There’s a richness to the voice performances that are lost if they’re diffused through open air instead of beamed directly into your ears. They speak in short, staccato sentences, contextualizing Senua’s feelings about a particular encounter. When she meets someone, her voices wonder if they can be trusted. In fights, they shout encouragements and admonitions. “Get up. Get up!” or “They’re so strong!” I like the voices. They remind me of my own rapid-fire internal monologue quipping about the myriad things that flit around in my head.</p><p>Senua’s voices also help with navigation and puzzle solving, but not so much that it becomes obnoxious. In <em>Hellblade II</em>, there’s none of that “the dialogue tells you the solution” stuff <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23631177/chatty-video-game-characters-god-of-war-horizon-forbidden-west-high-on-life-forspoken">that happens in other games</a>. For the first puzzle section involving a path blocked by a large symbol, the voices yell “Focus!” prompting you to press the right trigger to engage Senua’s focus ability. When I got lost during a particularly bewildering section in a dark forest, the voices remarked only once that I was lost then shut up, leaving me to figure out the solution in blessed silence.</p><p>In delving into a drained lake, I could hear water dripping all around me as the caverns echoed with the sound of my breathing. The further I traveled, the darker it got, and the more sinister the sounds became. My breathing slowly transformed into the guttural sounds of disquieted spirits. That should have been a problem. I <em>hate</em> the sounds typically associated with horror — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/21/23416630/scorn-h-r-giger-xbox-game-pass-horror-game">that crawling, squelching sound</a> used whenever a game or movie wants to convey that something’s gross and wet. But the scary sounds in <em>Hellblade II</em> never crossed the threshold into repulsive or triggering for me (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/5/14497584/misophonia-eating-sound-brain-scan-fmri">misophonia sufferers</a>, rejoice). Instead, the sounds were soft and quiet but no less sinister, sounding as though they were just over my shoulder in the real world.</p><div><figcaption><em>When audio enhances visual, </em>Hellblade II<em> becomes a harrowing experience.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ninja Theory</cite></p></div><p>My aural journey with <em>Hellblade II </em>wasn’t limited to sound effects and voices. The music also played an integral role in crafting a visceral full-body experience with the game. Early on, there’s an encounter where it all combines — music, sound effects, and voices — to create a goose bump-inducing moment that I won’t spoil. The tempo of the music combined with the on-screen action created a beat that I could physically feel reverberating in my chest as I played. It’s a game-defining moment that really nails the skill and creativity of <em>Hellblade II</em>’s sound team. </p><p>I’m an aural person, someone who places great emphasis on sound, and <em>Hellblade II</em> felt like it was a game made for me. In <em>Hellblade II</em>, there is no in-game UI. There are no tutorial pop-ups that pause the action to tell you what buttons do what or how to interact with the environment. A UI adds a layer of artificiality, reminding you that you that this is make-believe. Without it, the game created a level of reality that I’ve never really experienced before, forcing me to fully inhabit Senua as a character. And with headphones in, I heard so much more of the world and got a greater feeling for Senua’s unique experience in it. </p><p><small><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em> is out now on Xbox and Game Pass. </small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Nintendo has acquired known porting studio Shiver Entertainment from Embracer - the studio behind the recent Hogwarts Legacy and Mortal Kombat 1 Switch ports.</p>
<p>The acquisition was <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240521e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> through an official press release earlier today. Following the acquisition, Nintendo will obtain 100% of the outstanding shares of Shiver to make it a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Japanese gaming behemoth. As mentioned above, Shiver has been working on the recent Switch versions of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-switch-looks-performs-well-caveats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avalanche Software's Hogwarts Legacy</a> and NetherRealm's Mortal Kombat 1.</p>
<p>"By welcoming Shiver’s experienced and accomplished development team, Nintendo aims to secure high-level resources for porting and developing software titles", the press release reads. "Going forward, even after it becomes a part of the Nintendo group, Shiver’s focus will remain the same, continuing commissions that port and develop software for multiple platforms including Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/6d6f636869/status/1792730561708204474" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> by Bloomberg journalist Takashi Mochizuki on X, many see the acquisition as a way for Nintendo to strengthen resources available for third-party devs to bring more high-end titles to the recently confirmed Nintendo Switch 2, which is expected to arrive sometime next year.</p>
<p>During Nintendo's most<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-announce-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> recent earnings call</a> with investors, President Shuntaro Furukawa talked about expansion, pointing out that acquisitions might be part of the company's strategy, although the focus is expanding via recruitment of recent graduates and mid-career hires. "Although development resources could be expanded through M&amp;A, first we will work within the company with our developers, who thoroughly understand and have built up the Nintendo brand over the years, to have them nurture talent who can drive Nintendo's future development", Furukawa said. "In addition, many of our external development partners have gained a deep understanding of Nintendo's way of thinking and game development methods over the many years of collaboration, and we would like to further strengthen our ties with such partners."</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23911151/call-of-duty-game-pass-release</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/so-when-is-call-of-duty-coming-to-game-pass.877290/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23911151/call-of-duty-game-pass-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="vcZwIR">Last October, Microsoft <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23915545/microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-close">completed</a> its $68.7 billion <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23546288/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-deal-merger-ftc-latest-news">acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a> and taken ownership of a raft of huge gaming properties, not least among them Activision’s Call of Duty series. Microsoft is now theoretically free to add all Activision Blizzard games to its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/23759446/xbox-pc-game-pass-ultimate-subscribe-price-perks">Game Pass subscription service</a> on Xbox and PC. So it’s natural to wonder when Call of Duty games — 2024’s installment in particular — will hit Game Pass.</p>

<p id="DFj8Vu">According to the Wall Street Journal, Microsoft intends to release the next Call of Duty game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158941/call-of-duty-xbox-game-pass-microsoft">directly on Game Pass on day one</a>. The game doesn’t have a title or release date yet, but on previous form can be expected in late October or early November 2024. Microsoft is expected to unveil the game and detail its release plans at the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24145559/xbox-games-showcase-june-2024-call-of-duty-black-ops">Xbox showcase on June 9</a>. However, Microsoft has so far made no official comment on when Call of Duty games might be coming to Game Pass. </p>
<p id="R6LfRz">Activision Blizzard, moving to get ahead of speculation before the completion of the deal with Microsoft, <a href="https://x.com/ATVI_AB/status/1711464921077006751">said on Oct. 9, 2023</a> that <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</em> and its other big 2023 release, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/diablo-4/40629"><em>Diablo 4</em></a><em>, </em>wouldn’t be added to Game Pass that year, but said it did plan plan to begin adding games to Game Pass in 2024. Indeed, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24074326/diablo-4-xbox-game-pass-release-date-blizzard"><em>Diablo 4</em> was added to Game Pass</a> back in March, but Call of Duty so far remains notable by its absence.</p>
<p id="vJUvOu">Speaking to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgxuEV8xqEM&amp;t=673s">official Xbox podcast</a> on Oct. 17, 2023, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said, “The regulatory process took so long [...] that we weren’t able to get in and work with Activision Blizzard on that back catalog work. Now that the deal is closed, we’re starting that work, but there is work.” Spencer continued: “The fact that we’re not hitting day one with a bunch of games dropping in to Game Pass is a little bit of a downer, but I’m very excited about the future.”</p>
<h2 id="fNEHx9"><strong>When will old Call of Duty games come to Game Pass?</strong></h2>
<p id="mKu7gi">This is unclear. Microsoft could have added older Call of Duty titles to Game Pass by now, and many expected it to, but it hasn’t. Microsoft <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/3/11/22325601/bethesda-games-on-xbox-game-pass-xbox-one-series-x-pc">began adding Bethesda games to Game Pass</a> within weeks of that deal being completed in March 2021. The initial list ran to 20 games, focused on back catalog titles. But this hasn’t happened for Activision Blizzard games.</p>
<p id="cpdTBr">As for the most recent game in the series, <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>, Activision has a marketing deal with Sony that will probably preclude that game’s arrival on Game Pass for anything from six months to a year. It also has a well established marketing and business plan for Call of Duty that works on an annual schedule, which Microsoft may not want to ride roughshod over. For those reasons, we wouldn’t expect to see <em>Modern Warfare 3 </em>on Game Pass until the end of 2024 — at which point it would be overshadowed by the new game, anyway.</p>
<p id="5Tz9Go">Perhaps Microsoft wants to make the biggest splash possible by having the first Call of Duty title to hit Game Pass be 2024’s brand-new installment. Microsoft may choose to put a range of Call of Duty games on the service at the same time — or it might just focus on the big new release.</p>
<h2 id="jad0Js"><strong>When will other Activision Blizzard games like Diablo, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch come to Game Pass?</strong></h2>
<p id="7x1Elg">A clue to Microsoft’s strategy is its handling of Diablo games on Game Pass. Once again, many expected older games like <em>Diablo 3 </em>and <em>Diablo 2 Resurrected</em> to appear on Game Pass quite soon after the acquisition, but this didn’t happen. Instead, the latest release, <em>Diablo 4</em>, arrived with a splash in March 2024. It seems Microsoft is less focused on putting the whole Blizzard back catalog on Game Pass than it was with Bethesda.</p>
<p id="PQTJCT">One of the biggest unknowns is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/world-of-warcraft"><em>World of Warcraft</em></a>. The massively multiplayer game will celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2024, but still enjoys a healthy audience which pays <em>WoW</em>’s own monthly subscription fee to play it. Will Microsoft be willing to cannibalize this revenue stream for the sake of what would be a unique and substantial value-add to Game Pass? Perhaps it will, but it’s a difficult calculation to make — so we wouldn’t expect to see it in the first wave of games added, if at all.</p>
<p id="i5wE9i">As for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/overwatch-2/40628"><em>Overwatch 2</em></a>, it’s a free-to-play game, so this is less relevant. But Game Pass subscribers have already received some perks for the title, including immediate unlocks for some of the game’s heroes.</p>
<p id="c8gqi7"><strong>Update (Oct. 13, 2023): </strong>This article has been updated to reflect the completion of Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard on Oct. 13.</p>
<p id="BDDJth"><strong>Update (Oct. 18, 2023): </strong>This article has been updated with comments from Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer.</p>
<p id="yB6Rus"><strong>Update (May 21, 2024): </strong>This article has been updated to reflect the addition of <em>Diablo 4</em> to Game Pass and reports that the next Call of Duty will come to the service.</p>

<p>After 20 years, PlayStation’s London studio has officially closed its doors. The closure comes as part as part of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-laying-off-900-employees-about-8-of-workforce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced layoffs by Sony</a> that saw 900 people lose their jobs.</p>



<p>As a goodbye, the studio <a href="https://x.com/LondonStudioHQ/status/1792872997167984733">took to T</a><a href="https://x.com/LondonStudioHQ/status/1792872997167984733" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">w</a><a href="https://x.com/LondonStudioHQ/status/1792872997167984733">itter</a> to share one final message.</p>



<p>“For over twenty years London Studio has been home to some exceptionally talented and wonderful people in the games industry,” the studio said. </p>



<p>“As we close the doors, and all go forward to new adventures, we wanted to say a heartfelt thank you, to all our past and present, players and colleagues who have supported us over the years. We’ve had one wild and wonderful journey!”</p>



<p>Over its 20 years, PlayStation’s London Studio has been known for making games for the console’s EyeToy accessory in the mid-2000s before developing the SingStar franchise. It also developed a couple games for PlayStation VR: PlayStation VR Worlds and Blood &amp; Truth.</p>



<p>In 2024, the gaming industry has seen over 10,000 people lose their jobs in the first five months. In 2023, roughly 10,500 people lost their jobs within the industry.</p>

On Steam, it features Steam Workshop integration.</p><p>Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Developed and implemented by Yigsoft with close collaboration from the CD PROJEKT RED team, The Witcher 3 REDkit offers a plethora of advanced features as well as full Steam Workshop integration, making publishing — and using — mods easy for both creators and casual players. As a repurposed, reworked, and extended codebase of REDengine 3, it gives modders unparalleled freedom in creating new quests, characters, locations, and more. Today’s release was accompanied by a trailer that features some of the modding possibilities contained within the tool as well as an overview of its major features.</blockquote><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The Witcher 3 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/REDkit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#REDkit</a> is now available for free for all owners of the game on PC!</p><p>As a player, you’ll soon be able to enrich your time in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt with a wealth of new content created by the community!</p><p>As a modder you’re about to get your hands on the same set… <a href="https://t.co/LQT6Ee4uCV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/LQT6Ee4uCV</a></p></div>— The Witcher (@witchergame) <a href="https://twitter.com/witchergame/status/1792873818265940181?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The hope is these modding tools will breathe new life into the nine-year-old Witcher 3, and may even spark a collaboration that results in a DLC-sized mod akin to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-4-next-gen-update-left-fallout-london-dev-feeling-blindsided">Fallout London</a> mod for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It feels like a thousand years have passed since Princess Peach first summoned Mario to the seedy city of Rogueport to hunt for the legendary treasure that sleeps beneath the town. In reality, it’s only been 20 since Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door graced the GameCube, but it seems longer because the Paper Mario series has abandoned its traditional turn-based RPG battles ever since. The Thousand-Year Door rapidly faded into legend, kept alive by the spoken word of longtime Nintendo fans who clung onto hope that it would one day open again. </p><p>Finally, that patience has paid off, as the Nintendo Switch remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is the definitive version of this classic adventure. It unquestionably justifies why the original is so treasured, pairing a faithful recreation of one of Mario’s most iconic quests with a set of welcome additions and modern improvements that keep it feeling fresh off the printing press even two decades later. Just as Princess Peach tells Mario <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1775568951835083009" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>he MUST come to Rogueport</u></a>, I’m telling you that you MUST play The Thousand-Year Door.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Remake Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>From its opening moments to the end credits, it’s still impressive how distinct this RPG feels from any other game in the wide Mario universe. The surprisingly gritty world of Rogueport and its surrounding towns, a lovable cast of offbeat partners Mario recruits along the way, and an Indiana Jones-style race between Mario and the scheming X-Nauts to unlock the secret behind the sleeping door give this journey an unforgettable identity that has passed the test of time with flying colors.</p><p>It helps that the Switch remake is absolutely gorgeous, with lovingly redone character models and dazzling environments that fully commit to the original’s papery, storybook aesthetic. It’s always a joy to look at, and the lighting in darker environments like Hooktail’s Castle, Boggly Woods, and Twilight Town is stunning. It maintains 30 frames per second very consistently, as I only noticed slight framerate dips in moments where the screen is flooded with hundreds of characters at once, but that doesn’t happen often so it never really bothered me. The revamped soundtrack is similarly amazing, with outstanding updated versions of the original tunes and new battle theme arrangements specific to each location.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The sharp, laugh-out-loud script is consistently as funny and charming today as it was in 2004.</p></div><p>The exciting premise and artistic world are backed up by a sharp, laugh-out-loud script that’s consistently as funny and charming today as it was in 2004. The Thousand-Year Door wastes no time setting its comedic, irreverent tone: Just minutes after Mario sets foot in Rogueport, he’s witness to the town’s high crime rate as members of the Pianta Syndicate get in a brawl with their rival Robbo Thieves in the background. Almost every character does or says something hilarious that also serves the excellent worldbuilding, like the evil, cackling spirits who are convinced they’re cursing Mario for all eternity, when they’re actually blessing him with a useful upgrade. Side characters like those from the Pianta Syndicate and Robbo Thieves constantly intertwine with Mario’s journey, and some folks even email life updates to his Game Boy Advance SP-like phone with adorable photos of themselves attached. How thoughtful!</p><p>Small interludes also stand out, like ones where you play as Princess Peach while she’s held in captivity by the X-Nauts or as Bowser as he searches for the mythical treasure with his moronic band of minions. Some story elements from Princess Peach’s segments haven’t aged <em>super </em>gracefully – it plays up the fact that she has to take off her dress not one, not two, but <em>three </em>separate times across less than 30 total minutes of Peach gameplay – but it’s still fun to see how she assists Mario from afar. The Bowser sections offer a glimpse of how the King of the Koopas comically mismanages his dysfunctional army when he’s not getting tossed around by Mario.</p><p>Another clear highlight is bumping into Luigi throughout Rogueport, where he updates Mario on his parallel misadventures in the Waffle Kingdom. Mario can’t even stay awake to hear the whole story (poor Luigi!), but I love soaking up every word of it. This remake enhances the endearing dialogue even further, as developer Intelligent Systems replaced the generic typewriter text sound from the original with an amusing Animal Crossing-like babbling noise unique to each character type. It’s an impressive touch that shows a willingness to go above and beyond to polish this beloved tale.</p><p>Mario’s quest to collect the Crystal Stars before the X-Nauts do is the backdrop for each of the eight chapters, but some of the most unforgettable moments come from within the smaller stories that pop up. For example, one Crystal Star is the crown jewel of a wrestling championship belt, kicking off an incredible sequence where Mario – dubbed by his promoter as “The Great Gonzales” – climbs the ranks in the Glitz Pit’s cutthroat pro wrestling world. Every chapter has its own flavor like this, and it’s always delightful to see where Mario and friends will end up next.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>It’s Dangerous to Go Alone… Take Partners!</strong></h2><p>Speaking of friends, Mario’s party of seven partners is one of The Thousand-Year Door’s greatest strengths. Each character you recruit has a well-defined design and personality: Koops is an insecure, shy Koopa who musters up the courage to travel with Mario to avenge his father, while Goombella is a smart, sassy student at the University of Goom who’s interested in archaeology. Every chapter provides some backstory for the new companion it introduces that’s generally very sweet and oftentimes strikingly mature and emotionally resonant, which highlights how the series hasn’t managed to match their quality since. </p><p>When exploring, each partner helps out in a unique way: You can kick Koops’ shell to hit far-off switches, while Yoshi significantly increases your speed and can flutter across gaps. The remake’s new Partner Ring lets you change characters on the fly in the overworld, making some late-game puzzles that require lots of partner switching much snappier. And, there’s a robust new hint system you can access at any time where Goombella will tell you exactly what to do next. Some quests are a little bit obtuse at times, like when it’s unclear who exactly you need to talk with to advance the story, so that was a nice fallback that ensured I never got stuck.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Logan Ranks the Mario RPGs</h3><p>I'm not counting Mario + Rabbids because I haven't finished them yet!</p></div><p>Partners also fight alongside Mario during The Thousand-Year Door’s excellent turn-based battles. Paper Mario’s trademark Action Commands are here, where you deal more and take less damage if you properly time the correct button presses. But The Thousand-Year Door takes it much further than basic jumping, hammering, and blocking, spicing up its battles with a great Badge-based upgrade system and electric live audience so I never got tired of fighting at any point during the 30-hour campaign. </p><p>Collectable Badges – which are hidden throughout the world and on sale at Rogueport’s Lovely Howz of Badges – let you customize Mario’s abilities however you want as long as you have enough Badge Points to equip them. There are over 80 Badges to choose from: Some give Mario powerful new types of jump or hammer attacks, like the Quake Hammer, which attacks all non-flying enemies with one big smash. Other badges impact Mario’s stats, like the P-Up, D-Down Badge that boosts attack power but sacrifices defense. I turned my Mario into a glass cannon, to the point where perfect Action Commands disposed of enemies in a flash, but any mistake led to him taking serious damage. As a Paper Mario pro, I loved turning up the heat with my Badge builds to create more of a high-risk, high-reward balance, and it’s always fun to mix and match to try out different combinations if anything starts to feel stale. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pumping up the crowd is one of the coolest mechanics I’ve ever seen in an RPG.</p></div><p>It’s the live audience, though, that truly pushes battles to the next level. Lots of Nintendo games are presented as stage plays (a tradition going back to Super Mario Bros. 3 and most recently seen in Princess Peach: Showtime!), but The Thousand-Year Door has my favorite implementation of this idea. When a fight begins, Mushroom Kingdom citizens frantically rush into an auditorium to watch it unfold on stage, cheering when Mario does well and leaving early when things go poorly (are they trying to beat traffic?). Hecklers threaten to pelt Mario with rocks and stage lights or fog machines might malfunction during the battle, requiring a timely block. </p><p>Balancing fighting with appealing to the crowd is so dynamic, and it’s even more entertaining when you pull off the Stylish Moves that add flourishes to attacks and make the crowd go wild. Mario can backflip after pulling off a Hammer attack, or Koops can breakdance after rushing through a line of enemies in his shell. Pumping up the crowd through well-executed Action Commands and Stylish Moves fills up Mario’s special attack meter, and it’s one of the coolest mechanics I’ve ever seen in an RPG. The fights aren’t especially difficult – with the exception of some late-game bosses and optional challenges like the returning Pit of 100 Trials – but keeping track of all the mechanics at play during battle meant I never fell into a repetitive rut where I stopped having to think. If you love punishment, the Double Pain Badge doubles the amount of damage Mario takes, but besides that there aren’t traditional difficulty options to be found here. On the flipside, if you’re a Paper Mario rookie and want to improve your skills, the new Battle Master Toad hanging out in most towns lets you practice your Action Command timing whenever you like with no penalty for messing up.</p><h2><strong>There and Back Again</strong></h2><p>The Thousand-Year Door’s one major flaw I wish this remake had done more to fix is the main quest’s overreliance on backtracking. Most areas have two major points of interest separated by several linear pathways, and the campaign frequently forces you to travel back and forth between them multiple times over the course of a chapter.</p><p>Adventures on the pirate island of Keelhaul Key and in the spooky Twilight Town are especially bad about this. These chapters make Mario travel all the way to the edge of an area, realize he doesn’t have the means to progress further, walk back to the town he started in to get something, then return, and so on. It’s about as much fun as realizing you forgot your wallet as you pull into the movie theater parking lot. The new Partner Ring means your trusty Yoshi steed is more accessible than ever, so at least it’s quicker to run back and forth than it was on GameCube, but that’s a half measure when it comes to fixing the level design, which is noticeably outdated in a remake that otherwise feels pretty modern.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I do wish more had been done to fix the overreliance on backtracking.</p></div><p>To its credit, Intelligent Systems made several changes to at least somewhat address the backtracking problem without fundamentally changing the original’s design. In Keelhaul Key, a helpful new spring shortcut means you only have to do an annoying section of precise Yoshi platforming once, rather than every time the chapter asks you to go back and forth across its screens. So they removed the painful part, but not the actual trek.</p><p>It’s not as if major changes were unthinkable, because The Thousand-Year Door has some big ones elsewhere, the best of which is its revamped Warp Pipe Room. This fast-travel hub opens up underneath Rogueport a few chapters in, and it’s a total game changer for quests that make you revisit previous locations. In the original, the only way to get to the Glitz Pit was to ride the blimp all the way on the far side of Rogueport. Now, there’s a pipe that zips you straight there, and it’s conveniently labeled in a room filled with pipes that lead back to the central locations from every chapter. Similarly, longtime fans will remember that Chapter 7 contains a particularly ridiculous quest that requires revisiting every major town in the world, but with the help of the new-and-improved Warp Pipe Room I was done with this mission in less than 10 minutes. It wasn’t a particularly stellar 10 minutes in terms of actual entertainment, but it was a lot less tedious than what I’d been braced for. </p><p>Even if solutions like this feel like putting makeup on a blemish that we all can tell is still there,<strong> </strong>I respect the decision to keep this remake extremely faithful, and the combat, story, music, and graphics are so much fun that I really don’t mind the back-and-forth exploration too much. And thankfully, you don’t see any tedium in the fantastic dungeons, which are packed with interesting puzzles, collectibles, and epic boss fights that shake up the usual battle conventions in interesting, cinematic ways. Mario also learns clever paper abilities throughout the campaign, like turning into a paper airplane or rolling up into a tube, and those open up new shortcuts and secrets in the Rogueport Sewers to give exploration an almost metroidvania-like feel at times.</p><p>Outside of the main campaign, the entirely optional side quests are your pretty standard RPG fetch-quest fare. Sometimes they’re good for a laugh, like a mouse who asks Mario to whack him with his hammer over and over again until he remembers something important, but from a reward standpoint they’re largely skippable because they <em>mostly</em> give you items or coins that can easily be found elsewhere. I also dislike the side quest system: Mario can only accept one at a time from Rogueport’s Trouble Center, and you must solve or abandon it before taking on a new task. If this remake is already trying to make things more convenient, why not let us take on multiple quests at once to cut down on the number of times completionists will have to walk back and pick up a new one? As it stands, they don’t seem worth doing… with the exception of <em>one </em>extremely worthwhile reward I won’t spoil here.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-kitty-big-city-players-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie feline adventure&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty, Big City&nbsp;</em>has crossed two major milestones after less than two weeks on sale, which will likely make developer Double Dagger Studio very happy indeed.</p>

<p>Earlier today, the studio <a href="https://x.com/LittleKittyGame/status/1792634871749230934" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> that its adorable open-world sandbox game has crossed a million Game Pass players, which isn't surprising given that it's one of the highlights of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/all-confirmed-xbox-game-pass-may-2024-games">May's Game Pass lineup</a>.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, Double Dagger also revealed that&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty, Big City&nbsp;</em>has passed the 200,000 sales mark. It took the game just a little over a week to achieve that goal, which is pretty impressive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-kitty-big-city-game-pass-players-sales-fish.jpg?itok=nVYa-J5f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-kitty-big-city-game-pass-players-sales-fish.jpg?itok=jke6cnjO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Little Kitty, Big City&nbsp;</em>is a popular game, and it's no wonder. I mean, look at the cat!</figcaption></figure><p>The sales figure is even more commendable given that it's in addition to the game's Game Pass player count, which means 200,000 players knew&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty, Big City</em>&nbsp;was available via Game Pass and bought it anyway.</p>

<p>I'm not surprised&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty&nbsp;</em>has proven so popular; it's a very sweet little game with arguably the cutest protagonist since&nbsp;<em>Stray</em>'s little friend. If you're a big fan of cats, you need to check it out.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty, Big City</em>, it's a sandbox adventure game set in an unnamed city (which looks very much like it's somewhere in Japan, given its structure and features like painted manhole covers).</p>

<p>One day, while you're napping in your favorite spot just outside your highrise apartment's window, you find yourself plummeting to the ground (painlessly!), and you must find your way home, all while interacting with a cast of colorful and quirky animal characters.</p>




<p>Activities you can engage with in&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty&nbsp;</em>include batting plant pots off ledges, playing with your own tail, and causing humans to drop their stuff so you can steal it for your own nefarious feline purposes.</p>

<p><em>Little Kitty, Big City&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1177980/Little_Kitty_Big_City/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/little-kitty-big-city/9nf5s7mlm8xt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Little-Kitty-Big-City-2372180.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. It's also available via Game Pass on both PC and Xbox.</p>

  <p id="nOO5gf">Polygon is proud to reveal that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/5/30/18642763/batman-last-knight-on-earth-joker">Greg Capullo</a> will be drawing the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23661676/marvel-comics-gods-hickman-x-men">Jonathan Hickman</a>-written miniseries <em>Wolverine: Revenge</em>, thereby solving one of the enduring mysteries of 2024 in comics. </p>
<p id="jg5HI8">All the way back in January, Capullo tweeted <a href="https://aiptcomics.com/2024/01/04/greg-capullo-wolverine-x-men/">a peek at a mystery Marvel project</a> that didn’t have any particularly identifying details in it — except, as perceptive fans immediately noticed, that it appeared to be titled “Wolverine.” The conclusion was clear: Capullo, a storied talent for his work on <em>X-Force</em> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/sdcc/23273324/new-batman-spawn-comic-con-todd-mcfarlane-greg-capullo"><em>Spawn</em></a> in the 1990s and a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/6/15208506/batman-dc-comics-dark-nights-metal">50-issue run on <em>Batman</em></a> in the 2010s, was returning to Marvel to draw a Wolverine series. </p>
<p id="pu7IdZ">Perhaps he’d even be drawing <em>the</em> Wolverine series of this summer’s <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/x-men-summer-2024-titles-creative-teams">relaunch of the X-Men line</a>? The mystery thickened this month when Marvel announced a new <em>Wolverine</em> ongoing from writer Saladin Ahmed and artist Martín Cóccolo — with no Capullo to be seen. </p>
<p id="ZmCnhs">Polygon can now share the actual Wolverine series Capullo is working on, <em>Wolverine: Revenge</em>, with Krakoan Era architect Jonathan Hickman penning the story. </p>

<p id="9A1eX1">“I’ve finally returned home to Marvel and I’m ready to raise some Hell,” Capullo told Polygon via email. “And, who better to do that with than the Hitman Hickman? To celebrate, Marvel has removed the fences and let us off our leash so that we can bring the most vicious and punishing Wolverine story possible to the fans this summer. I hope they’re prepared.”</p>
<p id="YUqSJ1">In five issues, <em>Wolverine: Revenge</em> promises to “pit WOLVERINE against a cadre of foes who will turn his world upside down!” according to Marvel’s official summary. “He’s been beaten! He’s been bloodied! And LOGAN only has one thought on his mind: REVENGE!” </p>
<p id="RYQIkd">Preview pages from the first issue (read ’em below!) show Logan hunting alongside the Zebra People of the Savage Land and battling a dinosaur in a truly classic bit of Marvel action. </p>
<p id="N0kGUZ">“Well, obviously it’s such a privilege to get to work with a legend like Greg,” said Hickman via email. “When we first talked about the project, our number one concern was taking the readers on a high-octane, no-hold-barred Wolverine story that was a proper celebration of both the character and Greg returning to Marvel. And like he said, the bosses cut us loose and the result is an absolutely wild book. Honestly can’t wait for everyone to get to check it out.”</p>
<p id="3l9Cl0">Hickman and Capullo are not kidding about being let off the leash. <em>Wolverine: Revenge</em> #1 will also be published in a “red band” edition, containing some pages not included in the regular edition, with “elevated violence you won’t see anywhere else!” according to Marvel’s news release. The red band version of the issue will be polybagged “for the protection of innocent eyes!” </p>
<p id="RT4CCW">Both versions of the issue will hit shelves on Aug. 21, with a main cover by Capullo. </p>

It’s arguable that the team’s current approach of just making awful decisions as loudly as possible isn’t doing enormous good for its reputation. Last month saw <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-pve-dlc-unheard-edition-1851441954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-pve-dlc-unheard-edition-1851441954">a new PvE mode for the first-person shooter gated behind a $250 paywall</a></span>—made even worse by having previously sold a $150 <em>Edge of Darkness </em>edition that had promised all future DLC—all then halfway reneged by offering a confusing $50 upgrade for those affected. Except a whole bunch of people had already forked out the full $100. Now, how could this situation be made worse?</p><div data-video-id="196663" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="429" data-playlist="196663,195840,195624" data-current="196663"><div><p>The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22220.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>What about, instead of refunding those people the $50 they clearly deserve, Battlestate could instead <em>keep</em> that money, and give them a voucher worth $50 of in-game content?! But wait! It gets  much dumber.</p><p>The amount of money players of <em>Tarkov</em> are willing to spend is quite astonishing. People who bought the eight-year-old game when its perpetual Early Access first began have been willingly buying it over and over ever since, presumably out of loyalty and a desire to support a project they love. However, April’s clusterfuck undid an enormous amount of goodwill, as people who’d already paid the most astonishingly large sum to guarantee access to all future DLC had assumed—not unreasonably—that this would also include newly added features. So a response of “It ain’t DLC” (actual quote) wasn’t exactly the customer support they were after.</p><p>The situation is incredibly muddled, such that while Battlestate eventually backed down to the degree that they said PvE would <em>eventually</em> be included for <em>Edge of Darkness</em> owners, it’s only “in waves,” with no firm deadline for when this might happen. Those still wanting to jump the queue were first told they needed to upgrade to (or entirely buy) the $250 <em>The Unheard Edition</em>, and so of course, many did. Days later it was announced that <em>EoD</em> owners would now need to “only” pay $50 for the upgrade, despite still fully believing they had already bought the ultimate edition of the game.</p><p>And for all those who’d paid the $100 in the interim? In any functioning universe, Battlestate would have said, “Of course we’ll refund those who paid double,” an act that would still be a struggle to call decent, given <em>EoD</em> owners should have been fully entitled to the update in the first place. This is not that universe, and instead the company is offering people a one-time $50 voucher for <em>Tarkov </em>content, that amazingly comes with ludicrous strings attached!</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/tarkov/status/1791452217402180032&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1791452217402180032" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A statement posted to X.com</a></span><em> </em>(formerly a less hellish social media site) by Battlestate explains the outrageous limitations. “Please note,” it sneaks in mid-paragraph, “that you can only use the compensation once: if the cost of all the expansions you have selected is lower than the compensation, the remaining balance cannot be used later.”</p><p>Yeah, not only do people not get the money they’ve overpaid, but should they want to pick up a $30 expansion, they can kiss the other $20 goodbye. And if you’re wondering why, say, Steam doesn’t get involved, <em>Tarkov </em>remarkably isn’t on Steam, instead sold direct by Battlestate.</p><p>It beggars belief that a situation could be handled this poorly. We’ve reached out to Battlestate to ask why this is all happening when simply honoring the <em>Edge of Darkness</em> edition and paying people back their money would do so much to restore the game’s damaged reputation.</p><p>Still though, as a nice treat, players are getting two extra lines on their stash size, worth a whopping $3, so that’ll probably calm things down.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p> Blizzard is continuing to refine elements of its massive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-massive-loot-reborn-update-is-live-now-read-the-full-season-4-patch-notes/1100-6523441/" data-ref-id="1100-6523441">Loot Reborn patch</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>, which dropped last week and fundamentally overhauled some of the game's core systems. The latest hotfix for the game only introduces one major change, but it will be a welcome one for anyone working on Masterworking their items, with the gold cost of transmutation dramatically reduced.</p><p>Masterworking is a new system added in the Loot Reborn patch which gives players a new way to upgrade their most powerful items, as well as introducing a new endgame dungeon to farm for materials. Players can take on the Pit to earn crafting materials Obducite, Ingolith, and Neathiron, which are used to unlock successively higher ranks of masterwork. </p>

<p>While you have to progress through the Pit to unlock the rarer materials--with Ingolith only dropping between Tier 31 and Tier 60 of the dungeon, and Neathiron from Tier 61 up--players can transmute extra high-level materials to one of lower rarity at the Alchemist.</p><p>The latest patch dramatically reduces the gold cost of this process, with the most expensive transmutation, the Large Ingolith Cache, reduced from 6,000,000 gold to just 60,000. The other caches have seen similar reductions, with the cheapest Small Obducite Cache starting at just 1000 gold. The other material costs have remained unchanged, with one Neathiron still transmuting to three Ingolith, and one Ingolith transmuting to three Obducite.</p><p>The newest patch also introduces "various performance and stability improvements," according to the patch notes, which can be read in full below.</p><p>The main Diablo 4 Loot Reborn patch has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-4-loot-overhaul-is-going-over-very-well-with-fans/1100-6523491/" data-ref-id="1100-6523491">well-received by players</a>, which is likely linked to Blizzard's decision to playtest the patch using a PTR before releasing it to the public. While some elements may not have received universal praise, like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-community-warns-that-latest-patch-changed-how-item-salvaging-works/1100-6523489/" data-ref-id="1100-6523489">change to the Salvage All Items feature</a> which may have seen players accidentally getting rid of rare and valuable items, Diablo fans are generally on board with the direction the latest game is taking.</p><p>Diablo 4 is in line for its first major expansion later this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-first-expansion-vessel-of-hatred-coming-late-2024/1100-6518910/" data-ref-id="1100-6518910">Vessel of Hatred</a>, which Blizzard teased with imagery of a lush, jungle-like setting.</p><h2>1.4.0b Build #53811 (All Platforms)</h2><h4>Game Updates</h4><ul><li>The amount of gold it costs to transmute Masterworking material caches has been significantly reduced.</li></ul><h4>Bug Fixes</h4><ul><li>Various performance and stability improvements.</li></ul>

        <p>The developer's closure comes months after Sony announced global layoffs</p>

</header>  <div>



            <p>PlayStation's London Studio has officially closed its doors today.</p>
<p>The Sony subsidiary posted <a href="https://x.com/LondonStudioHQ/status/1792872997167984733">an official statement on social media</a>, marking the end of its more than 20-year operations.</p>
<p>"For over twenty years London Studio has been home to some exceptionally talented and wonderful people in the games industry," said the studio.</p>
<p>"As we close the doors, and all go forward to new adventures, we wanted to say a heartfelt thank you, to all our past and present, players and colleagues who have supported us over the years. We've had one wild and wonderful journey."</p>
<p>Since its establishment, PlayStation's London Studio has developed games such as The Getaway, Gangs of London, and SingStar Ultimate Party. It has also worked on titles such as Horizon: Forbidden West.</p>
<p>Additionally it was one of Sony's most experimental teams as it worked on EyeToy, Wonderbook and then VR.</p>
<p>In 2022, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-playstation-london-studio-is-leaving-vr-to-create-a-fantasy-online-combat-game">GamesIndustry.biz spoke with co-studio head Stuart Whyte</a> as the developer pivoted from VR to an untitled online co-op title.</p>
<p>The game maker's closure comes months after Sony Interactive Entertainment announced it would be <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-to-lay-off-900-playstation-workers">laying off 900 staffers of its global workforce</a>.</p>

Three compilations, and a compilation of those compilations, will bring the entire “Dark Seeker Saga” to Valve’s storefront.</p>

<p>On June 13, you can purchase the following titles on Steam:</p>

<p>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX</p>

<p>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</p>

<p>Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind DLC</p>

<p>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece (bundle that includes all the above compilations)</p>

<p>If you’re jumping into the series for the first time or returning from a long absence and have no idea how to decipher the bizarre names of these titles, here’s what each game includes:</p>

<p><strong>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 +2.5 ReMIX</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Kingdom Hearts Final Mix</li>
	<li>Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories</li>
	<li>Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days (HD remastered cinematics)</li>
	<li>Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix</li>
	<li>Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix</li>

	<li>Re Mind DLC</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn’t the first time the Kingdom Hearts series has come to PC. These games have been available on the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/02/11/the-kingdom-hearts-franchise-is-coming-to-the-epic-games-store">Epic Game Store since 2021</a>. But it’s always nice to see another audience experience a beloved franchise. Now everyone can get up to speed and join the wait for more news on the upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/10/kingdom-hearts-4-revealed-in-20th-anniversary-trailer">Kingdom Hearts IV</a>.</p>

<p>The franchise’s move to Steam also comes shortly after Square Enix announced it would <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/13/square-enix-will-aggressively-pursue-multiplatform-strategy-in-company-reboot">“aggressively” pursue a multi-platform strategy</a> after Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Final Fantasy XVI fell short of sales expectations. The publisher is in the midst of a structural reform that led to a <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/13/square-enix-will-begin-layoffs-as-part-of-structural-reforms-this-week">swath of layoffs</a> across its California and UK offices last week.</p>

<p data-characters="295" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I’m not one for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsport-is-insistent-on-not-adding-permanent-new-career-events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FOMO</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-can-you-get-your-old-sunset-guns-back-after-the-final-shape-comes-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feature deprecation</a>, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-bungie-no-more-sunset-expansions-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">content sunsetting</a>. Time and again, I’ve voiced my opinions on these matters, but the schtick keeps rearing its ugly head quite often. The latest (potential) victim? Fishing in Destiny 2, believe it or not, is as beloved as it might be.</p> <p data-characters="651" data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-go-fishing-in-destiny-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Destiny 2</em> introduced fishing</a> into its eclectic mix of activities during the Season of the Deep. Veteran players will know that this was, essentially, during the height of the community’s unhappiness with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/lets-look-at-the-biggest-destiny-2-lightfall-issues-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how Bungie was handling the year of <em>Lightfall</em></a>. As such, this simple little activity became a bit of a highlight in trying times, even if it wasn’t hugely significant in the grand scheme of things. It’s a bit of a bummer, then, that Bungie <em>appears</em> to be looking to sunset fishing in <em>Destiny 2</em> with the release of <em>The Final Shape</em> DLC, as per its recently updated “Items Being Deprecated at the Start of Year 7” <a href="https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/25896964261396-Items-Being-Deprecated-at-the-Start-of-Year-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">webpage</a>.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-destiny-2-s-fishing-system-is-being-deprecated-in-the-final-shape" data-injectable="false">Destiny 2’s fishing system is being ‘deprecated’ in The Final Shape</h2> <p data-characters="490" data-current-count="790" data-injectable="true">Now, the only reason why I’m saying “probably” is that Bungie is yet to chime in on the matter of sunsetting the fishing mini-game in<em> Destiny 2</em>. The studio is very well aware of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/pretty-much-the-entire-destiny-2-community-has-turned-on-the-sunsetting-content-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the community’s stance on content sunsetting</a>, and it’s certainly possible that the feature will be brought back in some form down the line. As per the blog mentioned above, though, the Fishing Tackle is one of the items that will be 100% unavailable after <em>The Final Shape</em> comes out.</p>
 <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="455" data-injectable="true">This shouldn’t come as a surprise, perhaps. As widely accepted and celebrated as the recent <em>Into the Light</em> content drop might’ve been, for one, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/most-destiny-2-into-the-light-will-sunset-with-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a huge chunk of it will be carved out of the game with <em>The Final Shape</em></a> as well. Most notably, this includes the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-destiny-2-player-has-soloed-the-raid-boss-run-pantheon-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pantheon boss-run mode</a>, which is one of those things <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frft3e/destiny_2_should_have_a_boss_rush_mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people</a> <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/pdp037/it_will_probably_never_happen_but_i_would/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have </a><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1bu5wax/i_have_always_wanted_a_raid_boss_gauntlet_and_now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wanted</a> access to for quite a long while now. At least the horde survival/defense mode is bound to stick around, I suppose?</p>
 <p data-characters="568" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true">One thing I’d like to highlight here is that I don’t even like fishing in <em>Destiny 2</em>. It just doesn’t feel like it fits into the game properly, especially now as the Guardians prepare for their final clash with The Witness and its Dread faction. Still, I hate to see the activity being yanked out of the game. Especially one that’s as innocuous and inoffensive as this. Who knows: the Fishing Tackle may end up being reintroduced at some point in the future. Perhaps even as a timed exclusive, as Bungie suggested might happen with the Pantheon.</p>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">Whatever the case may be, the good news is that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-month-ahead-of-the-final-shape-destiny-2s-community-is-at-ease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Destiny 2</em> community is now calm and collected</a>, just weeks away from <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s grand release. From the looks of it, everyone is waiting to see if this is yet another <em>Lightfall</em>, or if we’re looking at something along the lines of <em>The Taken King</em>, <em>Forsaken</em>, or <em>Witch Queen</em>, as Bungie’s been promising all along. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/should-you-pull-for-jiyan-or-yinlin-in-wuthering-waves/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=should-you-pull-for-jiyan-or-yinlin-in-wuthering-waves<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="255" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The first Banners in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> arrive pretty much when the game launches. If you want to use your valuable currency properly, you will need to know whether you should pull for Jiyan or Yinlin or if it is worth being a big spender and going for both.</p> <h2 id="h-should-you-pull-for-jiyan-or-yinlin" data-injectable="false">Should you pull for Jiyan or Yinlin?</h2> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false"><strong>You should pull for Jiyan</strong> if you want a strong, focused DPS character to act as your main battle DPS, and <strong>you should pull for Yinlin</strong> if you already have a strong DPS that needs to be backed up by solid support. This is a really simplified version of what you should do, but it’s also the best way to look at things. </p> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="574" data-injectable="true">One important thing to note is that all these opinions are based on beta builds and that some buffs are coming in the full release. I’ll update my thoughts accordingly based on those buffs, but I’m not expecting anything too wild to happen.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wuthering Waves Wiki</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="749" data-injectable="true">Because both characters are available so early in the lifetime of Wuthering Waves, you really need to consider which of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-5-star-selector-character-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5-Star Selector characters</a> you went for. For example, Calcharo is a great damage character and could be easily backed up with Yinlin. Meanwhile, Jianxin is a good all-around character who could back up Jiyan nicely if you opt for the paring, or Verina would be an excellent dedicated support for Jiyan and could buff his DPS.</p>
 <p data-characters="41" data-current-count="41" data-injectable="false">As such, I would break it down like this:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="121" data-injectable="false"> <li>If you go for Verina or Jianxin from the 5-Star Selector, then Jiyan makes a lot of sense as they can back him up pretty well.</li> <li>If you go for Calcharo from the 5-Star Selector, then Yinlin makes a lot of sense. Yinlin also likely has a strong life in the game, as she can back up ANY damage character, so you are likely to get more value from resources invested in her.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="557" data-current-count="678" data-injectable="true">The other factor to think about here is the 4 Star characters. You are likely to rack up a couple of them, at least, before you get your hands on the 5 Star that you want. Danjin, Mortefi, and Chixia are all on the banner, and Mortefi works really well with Jiyan, so there is some built-in synergy in this Banner. The only real downside to Jiyan as the center of your team will be that his single target damage is not as good as it would be against groups, as he can gather up enemies and dump them all in one spot to damage them all with the same attacks.</p>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">If you are worried about boss fights, Calcharo is better, and using Yinlin to back him up would work a lot. There is also an argument to be made here that there is less synergy within this Banner overall. That said, if you plan on running the deeper difficulties of content early, then you will just need different characters to make up teams, so you might want to pull on both Banners.</p> <figure data-current-count="686" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Wuthering Waves Wiki</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Important things to remember for early pulls</h2> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="306" data-injectable="false">If there is one thing we have seen in a multitude of other games, it is that character power is not set in stone. You can spend a lot of time, money, or effort to get a character and then see them nerfed into the ground later or dismiss a character who is buffed to instant proportions after a few updates.</p> <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true">It can also be easy to get weapons and equipment for characters that we just don’t know about yet that can really change the appeal of a character with some testing. Finally, at this stage, we just don’t have enough information about the build that is about to go live to make firm decisions right now. </p>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false"><strong>The best advice I can give you, for now, is that the Jiyan will be around until mid-June, so it might be better to wait and play the game for a while to figure things out and then proceed from there.</strong> You have time to figure things out a bit and learn what you want from your characters and teams before you need to commit to spending resources on anything. </p> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="745" data-injectable="false">Finally, one of the most important elements is to pull the character that you like the most. If a playstyle appeals to you, or you like the character art and voices, then just buy in. As much as I enjoy the math behind these games, trying to get the most out of everything, and a bit of min-maxing, I still think you need to put fun first. I am a Razor main in <em>Genshin Impact</em>, after all. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-avalanche-guide-to-insurrection.877209/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-vii-remake-rebirth-terrorism<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s hard to think of a more iconic opening sequence in RPG history than the intro of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>. After a CG cutscene that was groundbreaking in 1997 and still slaps today, the game quickly makes its intent clear: the player is here at Midgar’s Sector 1 Mako reactor to do terrorism.</p><p><strong>This article contains spoilers for the original <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, <em>FFVII Remake</em>  and <em>FFVII Rebirth</em></strong></p><p>The explosive sequence that follows sets up the game’s initial conflict between the planet-killing capitalists of the Shinra Electric Power Company—who are literally extracting the world’s life force for profit—and Avalanche, a resistance group clearly modeled after real-world environmental activists like the Earth Liberation Front (ELF). But unlike many games released at the time, <em>FFVII</em> starts off by firmly establishing the eco-saboteurs as the good guys.&nbsp;</p><p>The game’s main conflict has been on my mind while watching university students protest Israel’s ongoing attacks on Gaza. The protests emerged on campuses across the country several months after the release of <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, and while I normally find it cringe to reflect on real world horrors through the lens of video games, the timing of the uprisings—and how they’ve unfolded—made it impossible for me to ignore the political impact of the original <em>FFVII</em>.</p><p>Nearly everyone I’ve ever talked to who played <em>FFVII </em>growing up has told me that its opening scene was a pivotal moment in their political awakening. In 1997, the idea that militant insurrection is sometimes necessary to create political change hadn’t really been explored in a major video game before. Even those that dallied in the topic hadn’t so viscerally placed players in the role of protagonists engaged in violent resistance, or made clear why they believe these actions are moral and justified.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 80s and 90s, the ELF’s militant actions included sabotaging industrial equipment and defacing corporate property, causing material and economic damage to those responsible for environmental destruction. This made them one of the first groups to be targeted by the US government as so-called eco-terrorists, inspiring the “<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/03/23/ecoterrorism-fbi-animal-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Green Scare</a>” and new laws that later became the framework for the government’s ever-expanding “War on Terrorism.” There was debate at the time over whether or not the methods of these groups were effective or too extreme. But in <em>FFVII</em>, the stakes are made clear: The planet is literally dying, and blowing up a reactor whose sole function facilitates this ecocide is a practical and material response to avoid, or at least delay, a world-ending global cataclysm.</p><p>My goal here is not to compare a fictional resistance struggle with Palestine’s 75-year anti-colonial struggle or with the international movement that has risen in support of it. But as a Jewish woman who used to identify as a hardcore, pro-Israel Zionist, replaying <em>FFVII</em>’s story via <em>Remake</em> and <em>Rebirth</em> has made me realize how deeply this game’s ideas resonate—and how many of them went completely over my head as a kid.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@starlordziggy/video/7295005161183890730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common criticism</a> goes like this: Many people empathize with the goals of fictional resistance groups like Avalanche, but can’t seem to connect the dots when it comes to the real-world resistance struggles they’re based on. This has always fascinated me. <em>FFVII </em>not only forced players to consider the righteousness of militant actions, but illustrated two of the most important ways that real-world governments historically respond to them: first, by using the media to scapegoat and smear resistance groups and their supporters, and second, by enacting disproportionate violence as a form of collective punishment.&nbsp;</p><p>This allows the state to project the consequences of its own violent excess onto its political enemies, thus justifying further violence against them. Shinra’s destruction of Sector 7 in the original <em>FFVII </em>is the most obvious and extreme example, but <em>Remake</em> takes this a step further, changing the story to show that it was actually Shinra—and not Avalanche—responsible for the deadly aftermath of the reactor bombing in the game’s opening. Monsters—which Shinra protects some, but not all, of its citizens from—are also a result of the company’s experiments to create biological weapons of war. Even Sephiroth, who fully replaces Shinra as the game’s main antagonist in <em>Rebirth</em>, is a living reminder that the apocalyptic crisis the world faces is a direct result of a fascist government’s insatiable greed and colonial ambition. Without Shinra, after all, there would be no Sephiroth.</p><p>Characters on the pro-Shinra side, meanwhile, describe the company at best as a necessary evil. The power of Mako quite literally keeps the lights on in Midgar, and most citizens can’t imagine living without it. This always reminds me of something I was taught early on in my Zionist education: the idea that a powerful nation-state is necessary to ensure our safety. I was taught that violence done in my name—the details of which were often omitted or obscured—is unfortunate but justified. Like many young Jews, I learned about the Holocaust from a very early age, and this was all the proof I needed to know that our comfort and way of life—our very survival as Jews, I was told—was at stake.</p><figure></figure><p>It wasn’t until later in life that I began to see holes in this narrative, which weaponizes generational trauma to manufacture consent for state violence. It started by reading the many historical examples of resistance groups, and how they’re often painted as criminals and terrorists who seek only to destroy the average citizen’s way of life. We’ve seen that narrative a lot in recent weeks, as police and university administrators inflict violence on students protesting genocide while demolishing their encampments. The news media and politicians use their platforms to snarl at students and their allies, calling them “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/01/new-york-mayor-outside-agitators-columbia-protest-00155581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outside agitators</a>,” “<a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/elections/2024/04/steve-garvey-gaza-protests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terrorists</a>,” or <a href="https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2024/05/02/bloodthirsty-tom-cotton-is-going-to-get-someone-killed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worse</a>. In early May, President Joe Biden admonished the student protesters, declaring that “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-silence-college-protests-police-gaza-israel-d5f3092671951c3bc2968b8751c93ba6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">order must prevail</a>” and stating—<a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Haymarket-Affair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ahistorically</a> and without a <a href="https://twitter.com/akela_lacy/status/1786058411026665628" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hint of irony</a>—that “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/05/02/remarks-by-president-biden-on-recent-events-on-college-campuses/#:~:text=Threatening%20people%2C%20intimidating%20people%2C%20instilling,semester%20and%20their%20college%20education." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dissent must never lead to disorder</a>.”</p><p>Such declarations rarely, if ever, stand the test of time. The “order” that Biden is demanding is the very same that Martin Luther King, Jr. excoriated in his <a href="https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Letter From Birmingham Jail</a>, where he famously described “the white moderate [...] who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice.” The “negative peace,” in this case, being the comfort of school administrators and pro-Israel faculty amidst a complete absence of safety and justice for Palestinians in Gaza, where <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/details-humanitarian-crisis-gaza-2024-05-01/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every last university and approximately 62 percent of homes have been destroyed</a> by Israeli occupation forces, using US weapons and funding. As always, those calling for this “peace” are in reality calling for a status quo that prioritizes their feelings of comfort in the imperial core over the lives of those who suffer the violence of the state.</p><p>Those condemning the protesters also use the predictable and age-old tactic of declaring pro-Palestinian demonstrations “antisemitic.” I’m intimately familiar with this narrative, because I was taught it as a teen. The explicit goal is to conflate any criticism of the Israeli state with hatred of Jews—something the US Congress is currently <a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/05/antisemitism-bill-bund-jewish-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attempting to codify into law</a>. This <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/pro-israel-agitator-shouts-kill-the-jews-gets-everyone-else-arrested" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">false</a> idea attempts to justify an eliminationist campaign in Gaza that has already killed over <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/13/middleeast/death-toll-gaza-fatalities-un-intl-latam/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">35,000 Palestinians</a>, completely <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/another-hospital-gaza-forced-close-amid-intensified-israeli-offensive-rafah" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">destroyed the majority of hospitals</a>, and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/the-un-says-theres-full-blown-famine-in-northern-gaza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">created an artificial famine</a> by cutting off <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/trending/israel-settlers-destroy-gaza-aid-spark-outrage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aid and medical supplies</a>.</p><p>History shows us again and again that balancing the comfort and safety of one group atop the destruction and oppression of another never goes well for anyone involved. Those who cheer on state violence against resistance movements are not remembered fondly, and the extraction and exploitation of colonial powers <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opensecurity/foucaults-boomerang-new-military-urbanism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eventually comes back to haunt</a> those it was supposedly done to benefit.&nbsp;</p><p>Shinra served as an early guidepost in my understanding of how these oppressive powers think and act. Although the conglomerate falls into the background as a secondary rival throughout most of <em>FFVII</em>, every societal ill the player encounters can be traced back to it. In a polarizing scene toward the end of the game, Avalanche leader Barret Wallace does a surprising mea culpa, expressing regret for the group’s reactor bombing. <a href="https://youtu.be/M-Xf26EAqs0?feature=shared&amp;t=35427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This scene</a> always struck me as good character development, but also forced and awkward. While Barret and crew wouldn’t be the good guys if they didn’t care how their actions might harm others, the speech seems to miss the bigger picture.&nbsp;</p><p>By forcing the planet to a point of crisis, Shinra guarantees the undoing of its world order and all the mess that comes with it, including Avalanche. When the very ideas of “order” and “peace” become cover for a controlled decline that inevitably leads to disaster, the only options remaining are to either accept that fate, or oppose it by any means necessary. We see glimpses of a reality that “has accepted its fate” in one of <em>FFVII Rebirth</em>’s multiverse timelines, where ex-SOLDIER Zack returns to Midgar as the last remaining Mako is drained from the planet. These are some of the bleakest scenes in the game, both because the citizens of Midgar have lost all hope, and because Shinra’s soldiers nonetheless continue to maintain “order” as everyone awaits their demise—an extinction event that Shinra itself has orchestrated.</p><p>Shinra may be a fictional world government from a video game about magical twinks with giant swords, but it draws vividly from a history of real-world imperialism. That history shows us that sometimes, states must be pushed to the brink in order for any real change to occur. Before being assassinated by Israeli forces in 2017, Palestinian activist Bassel al-Araj <a href="https://www.thebadside.net/tbs-2-exiting-law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>, “The beginning of every revolution is an exit, an exit from the social order that power has enshrined in the name of law, stability, public interest, and the greater good.”</p><p>This “exit” is necessarily destabilizing and scary, and no one’s safety can be guaranteed during the struggle that ensues. But the only alternative to building a better world in the unknown is to accept the world we’re already in—calmly waiting until the Lifestream runs dry.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24161514/hellblade-2-review-xbox-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Traversing the nightmare realms of the human mind has always been central to horror. The stories we tell ourselves about what’s moving in the darkness, the creation of monsters out of unknown sounds — from this emerges our fascination with terror. In <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em>, players navigate a cold, dark ninth-century Iceland in the often wet shoes of the Pictish warrior Senua on her second adventure in the third-person action-horror franchise. I was very fond of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16117978/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review-ps4-pc">the first <em>Hellblade</em></a>, which saw Senua journey into Hel to save the soul of her lover. But the sequel pulled me in even further, with some of the most unforgettable and unsettling psychological horror I’ve ever experienced.</p><p>Senua, who lives with psychosis that causes her to hear constant voices, is a fierce warrior who has “killed” gods before in her personal quests at redemption. Cast out by her people in the Orkney Islands for being different, or a “witch,” she has taken her battles across the sea to rescue her people from slavers.</p><p>She washes up alone on a cold Viking shore and must find her way through a mysterious land. Her aim, vaguely, has to do with getting her people back, if not stopping the slavers who are taking her people. She soon discovers this is a land of literal giants, who remind me slightly of <em>Attack on Titan</em>: their designs are horrific and genuinely terrifying. The giants have all but destroyed the land, but Senua, being who she is, finds a way to stop them.</p><p>Let me be clear: this is the best-looking game I’ve ever played. Senua’s face is so detailed, I struggled to discern the real-time gameplay from the cutscenes; the environmental details are so intricate, it was like looking at photos. With fantastical lighting, inversions of the world as Senua is sucked into various states of mind, and stunning cinematic direction, there was no moment when I was not ogling my TV.</p><p>Perhaps more important, however, is the sound design and direction. The voices in Senua’s head portray themselves as furies, gods, and spirits, alternating between berating and encouraging. In terms of game design, they help the player navigate the world — telling you to look in this direction, highlighting when an enemy is about to hit, and so on. Add to this beautiful and horrific soundscapes, with chanting voices or drone-like sounds puncturing the environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The world is alive with horror, as it was difficult to discern what was “real” and what was Senua’s psychosis. This is illustrated in combat: Senua is an incredible warrior but the game bookmarks combat. What I mean is that, when a battle happens, you are locked on to a single enemy where you must parry, block, and strike. Senua has an ability called “focus” that builds up with successful blocks and strikes, which is effectively bullet time with swords. Combat is exhausting and the one weak spot of the game, as I always felt she was not responsive to my blocks and parries, resulting in constant strikes from enemies. Senua has no health bar and it is rather hard to die, but the combat proved frustrating even if it was incredible to witness: it’s brutal and dynamic, with fights happening around Senua, enemies crashing into her organically, and kills blending smoothly into cutscenes.</p><p>Unlike the first game, Senua has companions whom I genuinely grew to like: a spiritual leader; a reformed slaver; and the daughter of a betrayed chief. Villages are filled with people, with one sequence showing off a small battalion fighting alongside Senua. However, Senua remains inherently alone, and the journey is a lonely one — despite the voices constantly in your head. Senua solves environmental puzzles to navigate the world, which, like the first game, did get a little repetitive. These involve her having to match shapes that unlock doors. However, there was at least more diversity to the puzzles this time to keep things interesting, aside from the boring shape minigame.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The game is short, and I finished it in about 10 hours. But it packs a number of gorgeous scenes and scenarios into that brief span, from battling a monster in a volcano pit to the rhythm of metal music to navigating a <em>Silent Hill</em>-esque forest. This was an exhausting, beautiful experience that shattered me often, built me back up, and constantly challenged what it meant to manage one’s darkness. Senua is a broken person, but because of that, she fits into this broken world.</p><p><small>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II <em>is available now on Xbox and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NVIDIA has released a new Game Ready driver (version 555.85) today, optimized for the upcoming launch of F1 24. As Codemasters <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-24-qa-codemasters-talks-ai-improvements-confirms-nvidia-dlss-3-frame-gen-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Wccftech</a> in our exclusive interview on the racing game, on its launch day (May 28), F1 24 will support DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, DLAA, Reflex, and ray tracing with the new Ray Traced Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination that will reportedly improve the light response in shaded areas.</p>
<p>The Game Ready driver is also optimized for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</a> (out today with DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, DLAA, and Reflex) and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1610520/Serum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Serum</a>, a survival adventure game out in two days on Steam Early Access with DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, DLAA, and Reflex. According to NVIDIA, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II can have its performance tripled with the combination of DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance mode and Frame Generation. At 4K and max settings, the RTX 4090 nearly runs at an average of 148 frames per second, while the RTX 4080 SUPER is almost at 120 FPS, and the RTX 4070 Ti SUPER surpasses 103 FPS.</p>
