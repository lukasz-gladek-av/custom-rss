<p>Fortnite players are set to be treated to another new game mode, according to leakers, with a mode for five-player squads in the works.</p>



<p>Battle Royale in Fortnite currently supports 1-4 players, but larger groups have been restricted. However, that could be set to change with five-player squads on the horizon.</p>







<h2 id="h-leakers-say-fortnite-will-add-five-player-squads">Leakers Say Fortnite Will Add Five-Player Squads</h2>

<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/Fecooo_/status/1996365066212696385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter post from Fecoo_</a>, five-player squads are “likely coming” to Battle Royale soon, with a sub link code to the data of the playlist of the mode showing details of ‘Quints’, which also confirms that five players can be in a team.</p>



<p>The string has come in the same area where the Battle Royale modes of Solo, Duos, Trios, and Squads are shown, suggesting there is strong legitimacy to the claims.</p>



<p>Five-player squads would be the first variation to the standard Battle Royale since the introduction of Trios in January 2019, which initially came as a limited-time mode before being later added as a permanent option.</p>



<p>Since then, Battle Royale has branched into entirely separate modes with the likes of Blitz, Reload, Fortnite OG, and Delulu, but the lobby sizes have largely remained the same.</p>



<p>The leaks do not specify when to expect the addition of five-player squads to Fortnite, nor is it indicated whether the addition will arrive permanently or as a limited-time mode.</p>



<p>It does serve as further evidence of Epic Games’ plans to continually expand Fortnite to cater to a wider range of players, with the game now containing separate ecosystems with their own passionate playerbase.</p>

<p>Fortnite has confirmed an iconic character has survived the shocking attack that occurred in the trailer for Chapter 7 Season 1, with the Battle Bus poised to return and the driver being safe from harm.</p>



<p>One of the biggest shake-ups in recent history in Fortnite occurred at the start of Chapter 7, with players landing on the Battle Royale Island after surfing a wave after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-to-the-battle-bus-fortnite-chapter-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shocking destruction of the Battle Bus</a>. However, the iconic vehicle isn’t gone for good.</p>







<h2 id="h-battle-bus-returning-to-fortnite">Battle Bus Returning to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Survival. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>A <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1996338694383714586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on Twitter</a> was shared confirming the safety of the driver, alongside a message that read “The Bus Driver, who was obliterated by an energy beam last week, just texted me this.”</p>



<p>The exchange of messages included one from the driver himself, saying “i lived *****,” and a dramatic return to Fortnite is expected to take place later today.</p>



<p>Players have been hard at work completing quests to repair the Battle Bus, including finding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-custom-battle-bus-pieces-chapter-7-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">custom Battle Bus pieces</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-battle-bus-wheels-pump-n-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Bus wheels</a>, and the work has seemingly paid off, with Dummy successful in their repairs.</p>



<p>The return of the Battle Bus coincides with the return of additional modes to Fortnite, following a brief absence, with Reload, Blitz, and Ranked now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-roadmap-blitz-reload-og-delulu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available from December 4</a>.</p>



<p>Fortnite OG remains unavailable for the time being until the launch of a new OG Season on November 11, while Delulu is back for Chapter 7 the following day.</p>



<p>At this stage, it’s not clear whether the surfing mechanic will be removed entirely or retained with a varied approach to landing in matches.</p>

            <p>Arrowhead trusts the newly-announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film director, and has shut down any comments suggesting the director should at least try the game before taking on the adaptation.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-announced-helldivers-movie-director-may-not-be-a-gamer-but-he-has-worked-on-multiple-fast-furious-films">Fast &amp; Furious' Justin Lin would be taking the director reins for Sony's upcoming Helldivers adaptation</a>, which will be based on Arrowhead's game. On this announcement, it was revealed that Lin is not a gamer himself, and actually used this to his advantage when pitching his take for the film.</p>

<p>However, while this move was clearly enough to win over those within the film business, it caused a bit of scepticism with some over on the game's Discord server. In fact, one user tagged Arrowhead's studio head Shams Jorjani asking if they could direct the adaptation instead.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Jorjani did not take the user up on the offer, and instead showed his support for Lin's work. "Let Justin Lin work his magic," <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1445530210098352138">Jorjani replied</a>.</p>
<p>In a further exchange, another member of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> Discord asked the Arrowhead exec to ensure Lin "plays the game at least once" or checks out some gameplay footage. Again, Jorjani affirmed that Lin is the right person for the job.</p>
<p>"I trust Justin," the Helldivers 2 CEO said, adding: "He did a great job on the Star Trek movie."</p>

<p>The Helldivers film was initially announced back in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">along with a Horizon Zero Dawn adaptation</a>. Soon after it was announced, Arrowhead's Johan Pilestedt confirmed the developer will be involved with the upcoming film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">but in a somewhat limited capacity</a>.</p><p>In the meantime while we wait for Sony's Helldivers film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-largest-fan-film-premieres-today-and-even-arrowhead-is-waiting-to-watch">there is a fan made release available to watch now</a>. Created by volunteers at YouTube channel Plot Coalition, the film is almost an hour in length, making it longer than any other Helldivers fan project made to date.</p>

But, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> finally here, Nintendo is changing that... in Japan, at least.</p>
<p>Yes, a new wave of Metroid merch is now available <em>exclusively</em> at the Nintendo Stores in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Fukuoka and the Okinawa pop-up. Just to really rub salt in the wound, it's also available on the <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/feature/feature_met001?">My Nintendo Store</a>, <em>exclusively</em> in Japan. *<em>sigh</em>* Back to looking longingly at plane tickets, it is.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cevmxgow&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p><em>Update: Well, it looks like Nintendo has answered our wishes! Although it appeared that the merch outlined below was exclusive to Japan, many of the items have just cropped up on the <a href="https://nintendo-uk.pxf.io/c/205546/1889570/22585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.nintendo.co.uk%2Fen%2Fmerchandise%2Fview-all-merchandise%2Fshop-by-franchise-merchandise%2Fmetroid-merchandise" rel="sponsored noopener">UK My Nintendo Store</a>, too.</em> <em>Time to beef up those Christmas stockings!</em></p>
<p>Simply put, the new range is awesome. There's a super cute Baby Metroid keychain, a Morph Ball zip-up pouch, a 'gadget case' for all your wires and charging banks, and even glasses so you can 'cheers' Prime 4 in style.</p>

<p>The real winners, mind you, are the Metroid ice cube tray (not available on the EU store) — because why have cube-shaped ice, when it <em>could</em> look like a tiny alien? — and the Arm Cannon pillow, which, yes, <em>you can actually wear</em>.</p>

<p>The full collection ranges in price from 2,420 yen / £12.99 for the keychain, up to 6,600 yen / £37.99 for the Arm Cannon pillow.</p>
<p>And if the above has got you in the mood for even more merch, the squishy Metroid amiibo is now back in stock on the <a href="https://nintendo-uk.pxf.io/c/205546/1889570/22585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.nintendo.co.uk%2Fen%2Fmetroid-amiibo-metroid-collection-000000000002006766" rel="sponsored noopener">UK My Nintendo Store</a> for <strong>£12.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Those unable to get their hands on any of the above can still take joy in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, which arrives on Switch and Switch 2 <em>today</em>, instead. We called Samus' latest adventure "one of the very best Metroid games of all time" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>, and today, the wait is finally over!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Diablo IV: Season of Divine Intervention Lands on December 11, Bringing ‘Evolved Monsters’ and Many More Changes]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-divine-intervetion-lands-on-december-11/</link>
            <guid>1372660</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard Entertainment has announced that Diablo IV: Season of Divine Intervention is going live on December 11, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-ptr-tests-big-core-changes-itemization-monster-combat-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after several weeks of testing on the Public Test Realm</a>.</p>



<p>The game's eleventh season introduces 'evolved monsters', as they were described by the studio, increasing the challenge players will face when playing the latest installment in the studio's acclaimed hack-and-slash action RPG series. Monster AI and affixes have been overhauled: enemies react more dynamically, elites and champions hit harder and come with over twenty new affixes, champion packs are formalized, and packs clump less. These changes apply across all Diablo IV content, including Nightmare Dungeons.</p>



<p>Blizzard also releases the long-awaited itemization overhaul with Diablo IV: Season of Intervention:</p>



<ul>
<li>Non‑unique items now drop with four base affixes instead of three, and Sanctification (channeling Angelic power into gear) becomes a final, irreversible upgrade that can add a bonus legendary power, Greater Affix, special Sanctification affixes, and 5–25 extra Quality while locking the item from further modification; Sanctification, which occasionally can even make items indestructible, is earned via Heavenly Anvils and Heavenly Sigils at higher tiers.</li>



<li>Tempering now lets players pick a specific affix from a recipe instead of rolling randomly; items get only one tempered affix, but charges are infinite, and Ancestral items can occasionally upgrade the tempered affix into a Greater Affix. </li>



<li>Masterworking uses a new Quality (0–25) stat that increases base damage/armor/resists and all affix values by 1% per Quality level; Masterworking adds 2–5 Quality per upgrade, with costs scaling by current Quality, and a final Capstone Bonus roll at max Quality that boosts one random affix (Greater included) by 50%.</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>As previously announced, Blizzard has also overhauled the defense stats to equalize effective Health across classes better and builds. Diablo IV: Season of Intervention introduces rating‑based Armor and Resistances (with diminishing returns and Armor now reducing all damage types), a new Physical Damage Resistance, and a unified Toughness stat that summarizes effective HP against each damage type and can be compared on item tooltips. Many skills and Paragon nodes that granted generic damage reduction now give multiplicative bonuses to Armor, or all Resistances; Fortify is redesigned from DR into an extra Life reservoir that slowly heals the player character at the cost of Fortify.</p>



<p>Potions have been redesigned as well. They're now reduced to a base stack of 4, but now provide an instant 35% max‑life heal, and passively regenerate one charge every 30 seconds. Life on Hit, Life Regeneration, Life on Kill, and Healing % are buffed and more available, potion tier upgrades are removed, and Welcome Back Booster handling is adjusted for future seasons.</p>



<p>There are significant tweaks to the Season Journey, too. Season Rank is replacing Renown on the Seasonal Realm; players advance through the ranks by completing objectives and a Capstone Dungeon at each tier, earning Skill points, Paragon points, Smoldering Ashes, cosmetics, Heavenly Sigils, and other rewards. The Eternal Realm, on the other hand, keeps traditional Renown with some adjustments. </p>



<p>Five Capstone Dungeons (Vault of the Crucible, Hellish Descent, Enclave of Darkness, Den of the Apostate, Breach of Sin) have now been built into an all-new system aimed at challenging progress through the many difficulty tiers, from Hard through Torment III, as the character grows in power. Despite Capstone Dungeons stating a suggested level at which to attempt them, their difficulty does not actually scale with the character's current level.</p>

<p>Story-wise, Diablo IV: Season of Intervention features the angel Hadriel aiding Sanctuary's heroes. In Seasonal Realms, players follow his light in towns to start the seasonal questline. The Lesser Evils each invade a specific endgame mode: Duriel takes over Helltide, Belial corrupts The Pit, Andariel infests the Kurast Undercity, and Azmodan becomes both a permanent world boss and a summonable challenge in Hawezar with variant powers from the others; their minions gain themed affixes and visual readability updates.</p>



<p>Killing each Lesser Evil unlocks two Divine Gifts tied to that boss. Gifts have a Reward track plus Corrupted and Purified socket options that change difficulty and benefits for activities like Helltide, The Pit, Undercity, and World Bosses (for example, more socketables from Pangs of Duriel but harsher maggot threats, or extra Tower/Pit upgrades in exchange for lethal Belial eye beams). Divine Gifts level up as players farm their associated content, and Purified slots for each Lesser Evil unlock at specific Season Rank milestones (Duriel IV, Andariel VI, Azmodan VIII, Belial X).</p>



<p>Looking ahead, in Patch 2.5.2 (tentatively slated for early 2026), the multi‑stage timed dungeon The Tower and its Leaderboards return in Beta: Tower difficulty tiers will unlock independently, some problematic bosses will be removed, and class and party‑specific leaderboards will track clears by tier, time, date, platform, and mode (Normal/Hardcore) with filters for friends and clans.</p>



<p>Diablo IV will get its second expansion, following 2024's Vessel of Hatred, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at some point in 2026</a>. The original plan was <a href="https://wccftech.com/annual-diablo-4-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to release annual expansions</a>, but it ultimately proved unfeasible for Blizzard. </p>

            <p>Access to Roblox has been blocked in Russia, with federal censorship and media oversight agency Roskomnadzor accusing the platform of distributing content "justifying terrorism" and spreading "LGBT propaganda". According to Russian media reports, the state body said Roblox has become rife with content that can "negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Roskomnadzor also cited reports of sexual harassment of children and the sharing of intimate images in their accusations against Roblox. As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-blocks-access-us-childrens-gaming-platform-roblox-2025-12-03/">Reuters</a> and <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/12/04/russias-media-regulator-blocks-roblox-for-justifying-terrorism-and-spreading-lgbt-content">Euronews</a>, Roblox Corporation have issued a response to the ban via a spokesperson. </p>
<p>"We respect the local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and believe Roblox provides a positive space for learning, creation and meaningful connection for everyone," this statement reads. "We have a deep commitment to safety and we have a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform."</p>
<p>Roblox has faced plenty of criticism over how it protects young players in the last few years, with the US state of Louisiana <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/louisiana-attorney-general-sues-roblox-calling-platform-perfect-place-rcna225144"> bringing a lawsuit against Roblox Corporation over child safety concerns</a> in August, and Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill accusing the game of being a "overrun with harmful content and child predators".</p>
<p>The company behind the blocky game that's actually many games have responded to this by pushing to limit interactions between minors and adults, introducing measures like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-to-roll-out-facial-age-estimation-technology-for-everyone-after-us-prosecutor-dubbed-it-the-perfect-place-for-pedophiles">mandatory selfie-based "facial age estimation technology"</a>.</p>
<p>"We’re taking this step as part of our long-term vision as a platform for all ages," Kaufman added. "We expect that our approach to communication safety will become best practice for other online platforms, whether lawmakers pass laws requiring age verification for all platforms in the future or not." Though, checks of this nature <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord">haven't always proven to be totally bulletproof</a> when deployed in response to the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-begin-rolling-out-xbox-account-age-verification-checks-in-response-to-uk-online-safety-act">the UK's Online Safety Act</a>.</p><p>As far as their accusation of spreading "LGBT propaganda" is concerned, Roskomnadzor have a long history of going after games which they deem to violate the Russian government's <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-signs-law-expanding-russias-rules-against-lgbt-propaganda-2022-12-05/">ultra-conservative views</a>, which have seen draconian laws <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/30/russia-supreme-court-outlaws-lgbt-movement">carve away the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people</a> in the country. Just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-block-steam-game-with-queer-art-in-russia-after-state-censor-attacks-it-for-promoting-non-traditional-sexualities">last month</a>, Valve blocked Flick Solitaire from the Russian version of steam, after Roskomnadzor accused the card game of "promoting non-traditional sexualities".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite has revealed a surprise Nickelodeon collab with Danny Phantom is arriving in the Item Shop tomorrow, with the secret somehow being kept from the flood of leakers on social media.</p>



<p>Epic Games’ boasts a proud history of featuring a wealth of impressive collabs in Fortnite, shown by the recent The Simpsons mini-season, but keeping collabs under wraps and coming as a surprise is difficult. This time, though, they’ve managed to do so.</p>







<h2 id="h-danny-phantom-coming-to-fortnite">Danny Phantom Coming to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Surprise! Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1996323949882523779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">teaser post</a> showcasing what to expect to appear in the Item Shop on Fortnite this week, it was subtly revealed that a Danny Phantom bundle will land on December 5.</p>



<p>The bundle will feature skins for Danny Phantom and Samantha Manson, though further items like Back Bling, Emotes, or Gliders have not been showcased, nor has the price been revealed.</p>



<p>Keeping such a huge collab under wraps is a big win for Fortnite, and the fact that Danny Phantom falls under the Nickelodeon banner could open the door to further huge collabs in the future.</p>



<p>It’s already been widely reported that SpongeBob SquarePants is coming to Fortnite later this Chapter, which, along with Danny Phantom, suggests other collabs could be on the cards.</p>



<p>The potential for collabs has increased following the release of Sidekicks, which allows for smaller characters to feature in collabs, whereas previously, there were size restrictions that prevented small-sized characters from starring prominently.</p>



<p>So far, the only Sidekick collabs have come from The Simpsons, with Scratchy and Homer’s Pig, but there are plenty of options for the future.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, the fantastic musical action game, is losing Denuvo anti-tamper support early next year, according to a post on the game's official Steam page.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1817230/view/542250073650626840?l=english">The post</a>, succinct in scope, announced suddenly that the software would be removed in a mandatory patch on the 16th January, 2026. However, it also states the game's own anti-tamper measures will still remain in place, so it shouldn't become totally unguarded from tampering hands.</p>
<p>The reason why? Well, the post gives the following justification: "This adjustment is intended to provide a more stable and efficient service environment. We sincerely appreciate all players who continue to support the game through legitimate use."</p>

<p>So important is this update in the eyes of developer Tango Gameworks that Hi-Fi Rush will apparently not launch unless this patch has been installed. The comments responding to this Steam post are largely filled with fans celebrating the removal of Denuvo. The software has proven controversial for a variety of reasons - one of them being the online connection requirement which has rubbed folks the wrong way over the years.</p><p>We do know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-sequel-being-considered-positively-but-tango-gameworks-considering-various-opportunities">Tango Gameworks is considering a Hi-Fi Rush sequel, among other potential projects</a>. It had been in development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-2-already-in-development-six-months-when-krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks">for six months at the point when Krafton bought the studio</a>, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-newscast-hi-fi-rush-redfall-sign-game-pass-xbox-publishing-model-failing">Tango Gameworks' sudden closure by Microsoft</a>. In recent news, new-owners Krafton has announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation">its intention to become an "AI-first" company</a> - good luck Tango!</p>
<p>If you've not tried out Hi-Fi, we recommend you remedy that as soon as possible. You can give <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">Eurogamer's review</a> a read for an idea of what you've been missing, in which Ed Nightingale wrote: "Vibrant and self-assured, Hi-Fi Rush happily embraces the 00s' cheese - and is all the better for it."</p>

            <p>Supertrick Games, the developer of Let it Die sequel Inferno, which launches today, has issued a statement on the game's AI use following controversy from earlier in the week.</p>
<p>The controversy surrounded <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/made-with-ai-let-it-die-sequel-inferno-discloses-substantial-generative-ai-use">Let it Die: Inferno's AI disclosure on Steam</a>, which suggested substantial use of generative AI during development, across art, music, and voice, but it did not specify in detail exactly how AI had been used. The statement issued in response to the reaction provides that detail, and in general, the game's AI use seems less than suspected.</p>
<p>For example, the game does use generative AI to create the voices of two characters, but these characters are an AI-driven machine and a "mysterious life form", so the AI-generated voices were a deliberate, creative choice to fit the character, rather than a cost-cutting exercise.</p>

<p>"These specific cases use AI-generated voices intentionally to match the nature of the characters," the statement read. "These voices are not derived from or modeled after any human performers, ensuring no copyright concerns." Otherwise, "All in-game characters are voiced by human performers."</p><p>AI-generated art was used, meanwhile, "to generate rough base images" for background posters, InfoCast (news) insert images and in-game reading material, which the team's artists then "painted over, refined, and adjusted by hand". The AI tool also apparently helped the team observe copyright laws, although there's no explanatory detail on how.</p>
<p>Finally with regards to music, AI was used to begin the creation process for music you'll hear in the background in Iron Perch. Specifically, and I don't really understand this, so excuse my lack of sound creation technicalities, AI was used to generate stems, which I believe are collections of audio tracks, or mixes. "Once all stems were exported," the statement read, "few were manually edited, but most were rebuilt from scratch."</p>
<p>And that's it.</p>
<p>Let it Die: Inferno is the sequel to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-is-grasshoppers-refreshingly-different-return-to-form">eccentric and asymmetrical multiplayer game Let it Die</a>, by Suda51's studio Grasshopper - Supertrick was a co-creator. This new game ditches the asymmetrical multiplayer idea for direct, real-time multiplayer, in an on-trend PvEvP framework. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2576150/LET_IT_DIE_INFERNO/#app_reviews_hash">Initial reviews on Steam don't seem to be positive</a>, however, with a Mixed overall response.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> has been banned in Russia, accused of distributing LGBTQ+ propaganda and terrorism-related extremist materials.</p>
<p>Roskomnadzor, the Russian watchdog for communications and censorship, described Roblox as "rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children". It also flagged reports of sexual harassment of children.</p>
<p>"We respect the local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate," a Roblox spokesperson told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-blocks-access-us-childrens-gaming-platform-roblox-2025-12-03/">Reuters</a>, "and believe Roblox provides a positive space for learning, creation and meaningful connection for everyone."</p>
<p>The spokesperson added Roblox has "a deep commitment to safety and we have a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform."</p>
<p>Roskomnadzor has a track record of restricting access to Western media and tech it deems to be in breach of Russian laws, from Duolingo to WhatsApp and Telegram. Last week, the watchdog <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-threatens-full-ban-whatsapp-tass-reports-2025-11-28/">threatened to block WhatsApp entirely</a>.</p>
<p>Russia has of course long had anti-LGBT laws in place, in 2013 banning the "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships" to minors.</p>
<p>Yet Roblox also has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-accused-of-being-unsafe-environment-for-children">criticised for its questionable safety measures</a>, with a report last year claiming the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">platform had reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation</a>. This year, Roblox has been steadily improving its safety standards, most recently <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat">requiring age checks for all those wishing to communicate through the platform</a>.</p>
<p>Still, Russia isn't the first country to ban Roblox. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-responds-to-platform-ban-in-turkiye">Türkiye also banned access to the platform last year</a> to "ensure the protection of our children".</p>
<p>"We've spent almost 20 years making Roblox one of the safest online platforms for our users, particularly the youngest, and ensuring the safety of our users is at the core of everything we do," said a Roblox spokesperson to Eurogamer at the time.</p>
<p>Most recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-boss-says-problem-of-predators-is-an-opportunity-for-the-platform-in-disastrous-interview-following-latest-child-safety-measures">Roblox boss David Baszucki appeared on the New York Times podcast Hard Fork to discuss safety measures</a>, but he described the problem of predators on the platform as an "opportunity", in what amounted to a disastrous interview.</p>

            <p>Dispatch studio AdHoc knew it was taking a risk releasing the game in weekly episodic installments, and was actually advised not to do it. However, the studio did it anyway, and the risk paid off.</p>
<p>AdHoc itself has been around for seven years, with its superhero workplace comedy being in full production for three of those. Dispatch is the studio's first game, so it was understandably a big deal when its first episodes were released back in October of this year.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"Seven years, <em>one </em>game," AdHoc's CEO and executive producer Michael Choung reflected in a recent interview with <a href="https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=788256D6-9F75-4793-8D5F-28F96B1C91A8&amp;sid=7C18806E-AF5A-4F78-A29B-F02783429FF1">Knowledge</a>, before adding: "But what's inside that game is basically three feature-length premium animated films and a videogame, all meshing and rubbing up against each other."</p>
<p>The studio exec noted the team decided it wanted to go with a completely original narrative driven episodic format, and was not simply about making life easy for them. "And part of it was because we weren't really thinking about feasibility," Choung said. "We were just thinking in terms of creative and player experience."</p>
<p>But, while this approach worked for AdHoc and Dispatch, Choung admitted releasing the game in one go would have been "the conventional wisdom".</p>
<p>"Everyone was telling us not to do it," Choung said of the game's episodic format. "We had internal debates about it but the story was always structured that way." So while other release cadences were floated - such as bringing the game out in two halves or even one episode per week - the studio eventually settled on two episodes, once a week.</p><p>"A lot of the reasons for it we're now seeing the results of," Choung furthered. "There would just be a longer time period for it to be covered." The developer remarked that we have been seeing this kind of release schedule with TV series for decades now.</p>
<p>"We knew that it gives a 'the train is leaving the station, but not just yet - I can still make it' kind of feeling across weeks, and people catch on. When we look at concurrent user numbers across the drops, it's exactly that - it just kept doubling every week. Again, conventional wisdom says: whatever you guys do in the first week, the second week is going to be half that number. It was literally the opposite. Those things, we anticipated.</p>
<p>"I don't think we anticipated the scale of it."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But while Dispatch has seen immense success with its release schedule, Choung admits this is not something every studio should now attempt, especially if there isn't the creative backbone to support it. "It's insane to do," he said. "From every metric, from a production perspective, no one should do this. If you think episodic alone is going to be the thing that dictates success for you, then good luck!"</p><p>The exec continued: "If the creative is strong, you can cut it up however you like, and it probably is going to make it through, even if it's a poor decision. If we'd said, 'We're just going to release the whole thing', it probably would have done ok. But it probably wouldn't have been as big as this… If you go episodic with a not-so-great story, you're flirting with people that aren't attracted to you whatsoever."</p>
<p>But while Choung cautioned releasing a game with an episodic format, he said if others did try, AdHoc would of course "be thrilled if it worked out".</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Earlier this year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>. Thanks to this success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about">the studio is now considering a second season</a> (perhaps one with more sex scenes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>).</p><p>Meanwhile last month, AdHoc said it has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/maybe-ai-is-a-creative-solution-if-you-arent-a-creative-person-dispatch-devs-take-a-firm-refreshing-stance-against-ai">no interest in using AI to replace voice actors or game development</a>. "AI feels like a production solution, not a creative one," creative director Nick Herman said, before adding: "Maybe it's a creative one if you <em>aren't </em>creative."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> is ditching its Denuvo anti-tamper software as part of developers' Tango Gameworks transition to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pubg-owner-krafton-have-acquired-tango-gameworks-and-the-hi-fi-rush-ip">working under new owners Krafton</a>. A fresh patch has been released swapping logos to reflect that switch in management, and you'll need to install it before mid-January if you want the game to stay playable.</p>
<p>Krafton, of course, bought up Tango after the studio's former parent company Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">announced plans to shut it down</a> back in May, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redfall">Redfall</a> developers Arkane Austin and Mighty Doom creators Alpha Dog Games.</p>

<p>There is, however, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1817230/view/542250073650626840?l=english">one key wrinkle</a> it's well worth you being aware of. The patch has removed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-the-state-of-drm-in-2020">Denuvo's controversial anti-piracy/DRM software</a> from the game, with support for it set to end in full as of January 16th. As a result of that, Tango make clear that grabbing patch 10 by that date is mandatory, as "significant changes" made to Hi-Fi Rush's "internal system structure" in the Denuevo removal mean that the game'll no longer run without this latest patch installed after that point.</p><p>"Please note that even after Denuvo is removed, the game’s own anti-tampering features will remain active and will not affect normal gameplay," Tango added, just in case you were wondering if the security guards were being permanently dismissed from Hi-Fi's door.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-fi-rush-review">our review</a> of the rhythm action romp, Hirun Cryer dubbed it "a fantastic cocktail of rhythm-based head banging and action-packed platforming". "The combat system is surprisingly deep and malleable for any style of player and meshing it gently into the musical beat without putting pressure on the player is a deft touch," he continued. "Its writing and characters might leave a little to be desired, especially when compelling narrative beats are so painfully overlooked, but that doesn’t stop the entire package from being a certified banger."</p>

<p>A long-awaited Fortnite skin has finally been made available, although the initial unlock is locked behind the purchase of a $170 piece of hardware.</p>



<p>Fortnite skins continue to flood out, with both collabs and Epic Games creations becoming hits, and the Clyde skin has been on the eyes of players for a while, providing a mix of a raccoon and a cowboy. However, it won’t be cheap initially.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Hefty purchase. Image via Backbone</figcaption></figure>



<p>Although the Clyde skin could be available in the Item Shop at a later date, the initial option to claim the skin is locked behind the purchase of a $170 Backbone Pro Controller.</p>



<p>Existing owners of a Backbone Pro can also receive the Clyde outfit by redeeming a code, which unlocks a quick in-game Quest before Clyde is added to your Locker.</p>



<p>The code is redeemable only once per user, and cannot be resold, exchanged, or redeemed for cash, though that’s unlikely to stop some people trying to flog their codes on the market.</p>



<p>Anyone else wanting the Clyde outfit will have to fork out the price to purchase the controller, or wait for the Outfit to potentially be available in the Item Shop in the future. However, there’s no indication of how long that will be, nor is the price of such a release known.</p>



<p>The Clyde outfit can also only be unlocked by playing Fortnite on iOS, Android, PC, and cloud streaming, although it will be usable across all platforms when unlocked.</p>

The audio refresh includes a "comprehensive pass" on footstep audio that aims to make footstep sound effects more tactically useful to players who can hear it. The update also includes some improvements towards ongoing performance issues that sometimes cause important sounds not to play as intended, an issue that's especially prevalent on large maps.</p>

<p>Rush and Breakthrough are also getting some balance changes designed to improve the game mode's flow, and even out the win rate between attacking and defending teams. Seige of Cairo, for example, will get a few boosts to the attacking side, including one more attacker tank in Sectors 1 and 3, and an updated capture area on B. Rush attackers are also getting a small boost, with changes to M-COM locations on Manhattan Bridge and Liberation Peak.</p><p>More balance tweaks are coming across both modes, including changes to vehicle spawns on multiple maps, with full details still to come in the update's patch notes. Battlefield Studios says all changes made are intended to "reduce bottlenecks, remove frustration points, and create more consistent and engaging fights around objectives."</p><p>Outside of these specific changes, the Winter Offensive update will include some broader improvements aimed at increasing reliability and predictability across the game. This includes ongoing improvements to hit registration, another element that was previewed in the Battlefield Labs mini-test, as well as changes to make damage feedback feel more immediate and understandable.</p><p>Other balance tweaks include improvements to soldier visibility, with a focus on visibility in dark and low-contrast areas, and soldiers in low-profile positions. Weapons will also be getting a balance pass to improve handling, something the <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1996248184381641171" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefield Studios post</a> says is always a priority for the team.</p><p>When it comes to Redsec, Battlefield 6's battle royale spinoff, Battlefield Studios is lowering the availability of tanks in the mode, in response to player feedback that the vehicles feel too powerful. The team is also investigating how armor works in the mode, and may be making changes in that area in future updates.</p><p>Battlefield 6 update 1.1.3.0, Winter Offensive, will arrive on December 9 on all platforms. More in-depth patch notes for the upcoming update will be inbound over the next couple of days.</p><p>In another recent blog post, Battlefield Studios revealed that its anticheat protections have been incredibly effective, leaving popular shooter is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-almost-cheater-free-studio-claims/1100-6536589/" data-ref-id="1100-6536589">98% cheater-free</a>.</p>

Major outlets are conglomerating and downsizing, resulting in experienced and budding journalists alike being kicked to the curb amid the homogenization of both trade and consumer publications under the umbrellas of massive corporations.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For reporters, it means constricting career pathways, wage stagnation, and the likelihood of burnout as those who remain are forced to fight for the scraps that are left—all while attempting to cover a titanic industry that only continues to swell.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That spells disaster for readers, too. Fewer voices and outlets can only lead to coverage that lacks breadth, depth, and diversity. That isn't to say those still plying their trade aren't doing important work, but it is simply impossible to cover a cultural, artistic, and economic beat that continues to grow at such a rapid pace with a resource pool that only seems to dwindle with each passing day.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The numbers—at least, as I suspect they're viewed in the corporate offices of Ziff Davis, Valnet, and others—simply do not add up. So what now?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The upshot (if you can call it that) of widespread layoffs and degeneration across the media landscape has been the rise of worker-owned (often reader-funded) independent outlets that are attempting to prove it remains possible to carve out a sustainable career in journalism in 2025 by publishing informative, engaging, and personable reporting while shunning the insatiable growth mindset.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-netflix-to-sell-spry-fox-back-to-founders" target="_self" data-discover="true">Netflix to sell Spry Fox back to founders</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Live or die, we'll do it blogging the way we want&quot;">"Live or die, we'll do it blogging the way we want"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One such outlet is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://postgame.substack.com/about">Post Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the solo project of former Polygon editor-in-chief Chris Plante, who established the weekly ad-supported podcast to deliver NPR-style interviews in 90 minutes or less. Post Games content is free to access, although it's possible to subscribe for $5 per month to access bonus segments, video episodes, and other perks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer, Plante explains they passed 1,000 paid subscribers at around the five-month mark but has no wish to turn that early success into infinite growth. Instead, he intends to ensure the business remains "microscopic."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I don’t have a desire to grow any time soon. My only goal is to create a sustainable business that allows me to tell stories that matter to my listener," he adds.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Plante says going independent has enabled him to tell stories that were simply incompatible with the expectations of a major website like Polygon, which has fundamentally different business needs. "It’s not the switch to independent media that changed what I cover. What’s responsible for the shift is the change in business model and audience size," he continues. "At a large publication that depended on ad revenue, I needed to create stories that appeal to a colossal audience of gamers. At a much, much, much smaller publication, my goal is to serve a small audience, but to make things that they love enough to pay for each month.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hideo-kojima-to-deliver-keynote-at-gdc-2025" target="_self" data-discover="true">Hideo Kojima to deliver keynote at GDC 2026</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For example, at Polygon, millions of readers appreciated our high-quality guides. But they were unlikely to pay for them, since other guides (while not always of the highest quality) were easily and freely available elsewhere. With Post Games, a comparably small audience of listeners wants to learn the nitty-gritty stories behind NSFW game development or the Atari CEO’s plan to save the old brand, but since they can’t find that depth elsewhere, they're willing to subscribe to the free podcast RSS or pay $5 a month for extended episodes on Patreon."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Being able to tell stories that might have been deemed off-limits in the corporate sphere was a similarly attractive proposition for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PeopleMakeGames">People Make Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (PMG) founder, Chris Bratt.

This is not normal within the world of conventional, corporate media.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We just did a story that took about six months to complete, involved flights from the UK to Croatia and we also brought on board a script editor and a media lawyer to guide us through the process as well. There's simply no way we could have requested that sort of budget in my previous job and so that story would likely not have happened," says Bratt.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like Plante, Bratt says PMG doesn't have any formal growth targets. "I suppose I'm aware that we don’t publish many videos in a year—perhaps five or six—and so if I had one personal goal for 2025, it'd be for me to be able to look back at the work we've done over the last 12 months and feel proud of the stories we have chosen to dedicate our time to. Other than that, we need to make sure our funding stays reasonably stable," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We've been very lucky to create jobs for ourselves on PMG that we really enjoy and that we really care about. For me, sustainability is about protecting that feeling from whatever other motivations may seek to disrupt it. Growth for growth's sake feels like an absurdly easy way to turn all of this into something we don’t actually want to do."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a sentiment echoed by Chase Taylor-Carter, co-founder of independent tabletop game outlet </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rascal.news/">Rascal News</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, who stresses that independence also protects writers from the fleeting whims of corporate owners.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Worker ownership means that we survive or fail on our own terms, not because an executive we've never met is 'pivoting' into the latest technology and decides they no longer need writers. It also means that we can work directly with paying subscribers—who we cheekily call our stakeholders—to fashion a version of digital journalism that understand audience needs and the mercurial shape of the internet," he says. "Our position is precarious, but the freedom earned is incredibly gratifying. Live or die, we'll do it blogging the way we want."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;The success of larger legacy publications is often placed in opposition to the interests of their readership&quot;">"The success of larger legacy publications is often placed in opposition to the interests of their readership"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In some instances, the rise of independent outlets was born out of a desire for change. In other cases, necessity became the calling card—but all roads seemingly lead back to a conflict between reporters who entered the profession to tell stories that speak to readers, only to find themselves cut adrift and admonished in a corporate landscape that actively dismantles that ideology.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The success of larger legacy publications is often placed in opposition to the interests of their readership or the welfare of their workers. Worker-owned publications typically have a greater vested interest from the people making the content, and can place those same priorities in parallel with each other," says Alice Jovanée, co-founder of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rogue.site/">Rogue</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rogue broke cover earlier this year and was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/polygon-staffers-reunite-to-establish-independent-video-game-website-rogue">formed by a group of former Polygon writers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> who were laid off after the website was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/polygon-sold-to-valnet-many-staff-laid-off">sold to Valnet by Vox Media</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Jovanée explains the website's definition of sustainability stresses "equity, transparency, and empathy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We all want the site to succeed, and we're all vested partners in that success, but that can never come at the expense of anyone's mental or physical well-being," she adds. "We provide a detailed outline of our compensation in our mission statement, but it boils down to everyone getting a mutually agreed-upon number of shares of our monthly revenue after expenses. Freelancers are paid a flat rate that will never be less than the value of a single share. No financial information is private within the members of Rogue, so everyone knows where the money is going."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://aftermath.site/">Aftermath</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is another independent, worker-owned outlet that emerge in the wake of layoffs—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-kotaku-staffers-launch-independent-game-and-culture-website-aftermath">this time at Kotaku</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Co-founder Luke Plunkett says the decision to establish the website was essentially "forced" on the team after they were jettisoned by former employer G/O Media, who he claims were "only interested in making a line go up."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like many of their peers, the Aftermath team sought to learn from everything they hated about their previous roles. "Stuff like pageviews and uniques, which we lived off at sites like Kotaku, are almost worthless metrics to us. The only numbers that really matter are newsletter subscribers and, more importantly, paying subscribers, since they're pretty much our sole source of income at the moment," he explains.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We can write what we want to write. Nobody is shaping our coverage, nobody is telling us to tone something down, or 'both sides' an issue, and nobody is making us rush to hit a deadline. We're in complete control of everything that goes on the site, which is great for us, but is also a huge reason people subscribe to us; they know they're getting zero bullshit because there's nobody in a corner office telling us what not to do (we don't have an office!)."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Precarity dwarfs the capacity of every working journalist&quot;">"Precarity dwarfs the capacity of every working journalist"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Plunkett says he would love to see a decline in traditional corporate media in exchange for a rise in independent outlets, but concedes getting there might be tricky. Some of the associated challenges are universal. Almost everybody I spoke with agreed it remains hard to manage your workload when you're tasked with not only being a reporter but essentially running an entire business. Burnout, then, remains a huge risk.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is also the awkward task of convincing people to pay for something they have become accustomed to receiving for free. I doubt there is a single reporter who doesn't believe their work is worth at the very least a few dollars a month (none of these sites are charging big bucks), but consumers might feel differently.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, what's in it for them? According to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> founder Stephen Totilo, who established the newsletter (which generates an annual gross of over $140,000, before Substack takes 10 percent and payment processor Stripe takes 3 percent) after departing Axios, there is ample reason to support independent journalism.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"True, honest, earnest, fearless, curiosity-driven reporting and criticism of video games can be valuable. The highest quality execution of such work largely costs money to produce. Reporters gotta eat. Critics (most of them) need to wear clothes," he says. "But the media business–not just the games media business but the whole enterprise–is a rickety operation where profits are meager and even the mightiest publications would not be able to rake it in without the help of ancillary businesses such as recipe apps and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Therefore, all independent media really is is an attempt to produce the work I described in a way that can survive financially."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Therein lies a perhaps lesser-discussed barrier for entry. Almost everyone I spoke to was an established reporter with years (and often decades) of experience, and they all acknowledge the inherent risk of going independent. How, then, can more inexperienced writers hope to chart a similar path—or, at the very least, learn from their more veteran peers, who might not have the resources to start anything resembling a newsroom?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"While independent media can in some ways take the place of faltering corporate outlets, it has so far involved a smaller number of people, many of whom, like me, have the benefit of years' of reader recognition of my byline," continues Totilo. "A shift into independent journalism for me was risky but had decent odds of paying a full-time wage. Someone who is not known in the field faces far worse odds. That is why I cheer the sight of outlets such as Aftermath bringing aboard more writers and why I began working with freelancers at Game File earlier this year earlier than I had planned. It's crucial for independent media to find ways to lift up others who also might be able to produce great journalism and criticism."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Totilo also underlines some of the other challenges of being a smaller—and in his case, often solo—operation. "The biggest drawback is not having a second reporter to bounce stories off of, to pool resources (and sources!) to enhance my ability to get the most accurate and interesting stories to readers. It’s also hard to switch from writing brain to self-editing brain, hence typos. Not every independent outlet is a solo operation, of course, but me being solo impacts my work far more than me being independent," he adds.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then there are the legal risks. Often, corporate owners will have internal legal teams that can protect journalists (and by extension their sources) when publishing investigative or potentially inflammatory pieces that might rub some of the industry's more litigious companies or personalities the wrong way. Even when an independent site can afford to stump up for legal advice, the costs for even a standard pass can be eye-watering. For instance, PMG recently spent £3,000 on legal fees earlier this year before it felt comfortable publishing a documentary.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pitfalls of independent journalism are there for all to see—and yet, what else can those reporters being forced to plunge into the career maelstrom by trigger-happy corporate employers do but scramble for a lifeboat? The hope is that those who manage to find safe harbor will eventually be able to guide others to shore.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Precarity dwarfs the capacity of every working journalist, from single-person newsletters up to the damn New York Times," says Taylor-Carter. "We cannot simply job create our industry out of existential threat when the problems include fascists' ire and near-complete capture by hypercapitalists. Burdening yourself with that mantle is simply unhelpful and actively self-destructive. Instead, you do what all wise radicals suggest: focus on immediate ability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Platform one writer, one voice whose lived experience or identity would otherwise disqualify them from legacy media. Accept a freelance piece or two when the money makes sense, and treat that assignment with all the solemnity and rigor you can muster. It won't be enough to solve the problem, but our peers grow in number every day and reach out their hands, too. I am the benefactor of outlets like Into the Spine, Unwinnable, and the site now known as Endless Mode. Their dedication to fostering talent kept this industry alive, if only just. I'll be lucky if one person cites Rascal when it's their turn to wax long on their professional path."</span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-rise-and-risk-of-independent-game-media]]></content:encoded>

Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser has recently being doing the rounds to chat about to his company Absurd Ventures, and his latest tidbit from his time at the Grand Theft Auto studio is the surprisingly revelation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> perhaps owes as much to Victorian literature as it does cowboy films.
</p>
<p>
"I binged on Victorian novels for that," he explains in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/dec/03/i-binged-on-victorian-novels-dan-houser-on-dickens-red-dead-redemption-and-redefining-open-world-games">new interview with the Guardian</a>. "I listened to the audiobook of [George Elliot's] Middlemarch walking to and from the office every day. I loved it."
</p>
<p>
As to why Houser turned to this perhaps unexpected source of inspiration, he explained, "I wanted [Red Dead Redemption 2] to feel from the writing perspective, slightly more novelistic. I thought that was a way of doing something new on the story side – and the game was going to look so pretty, the art was so strong, I thought the story had better really set it up."

<p>
It was his search for the right tone that ultimately led him not just to Middlemarch, but other Victorian fiction, including Sherlock Holmes. And as he noted elsewhere, big 19th-century novels perhaps have more in common with open-world games than is immediately obvious, bringing a "sense of slightly spread out storytelling" that's paralleled in the likes of GTA.
</p><p>
Houser, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-is-leaving-the-company-in-march">departed Rockstar Games in 2020</a>, formally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-returns-with-new-media-company-absurd-ventures">unveiled his new media company Absurd Ventures</a> in 2023. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-housers-new-studio-reveals-graphic-novel-and-audio-drama">currently working on A Better Paradise</a>, charting the "ill-fated development of an ambitious but addictive video game project that goes very wrong", which so far spans a novel and podcast series, with a TV series and game on the way.
</p>
<p>
It's also developing a new crime fiction universe, American Caper, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meet-absurdaverse-gta-5-writer-dan-housers-next-big-project">Absurdaverse</a>, a "story-driven action-comedy adventure game".

<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is finally in the hands of players worldwide after years of waiting, but players have uncovered that a basic feature is locked behind an Amiibo figure.</p>



<p>18 years after Metroid Prime 3: Corruption was first released, the fourth instalment in the series launched on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 on December 4, but early impressions are mixed, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-is-the-lowest-reviewed-game-in-the-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critic scores being the lowest in the series</a>.</p>



<p>There’s still time for that to change, however, and user scores may be more positive, but the locking of a basic feature behind a paywall has left one area of the game feeling barren.</p>







<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond-desert-music-locked-behind-amiibo-purchase">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Desert Music Locked Behind Amiibo Purchase</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Locked. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://x.com/lukestephens/status/1996340617497227440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Luke Stephens</a> on Twitter, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond’s music in the desert, an area explored while driving the Vi-O-La bike, is absent unless you purchased the $29.99 Samus Amiibo.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/hardware/amiibo/game/bgw5a_2/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo’s product description</a> lists background music as a perk from owning the Samus Amiibo, along with the ability to activate a shield that will block up to 99 damage and fully restore Samus’ life once per day.</p>



<p>The description doesn’t inform you, however, that without the Amiibo figure, the desert landscape in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be eerily silent, and offers nothing if you haven’t splashed out on the figure.</p>



<p>There are also two other Amiibo figures to purchase to get additional bonuses in the game, with the Samus &amp; Vi-O-La figure providing customizable colors, the ability to check total distance travels, and a once-per-day increase to the rate of regeneration for Viola’s Boost Energy.</p>



<p>The final figure, Cyrax, allows you to see the full version of the movies that are shown in fragments throughout the game, once you have completed it, a feature that is otherwise locked behind achieving a 100% scan rate and item collection rate.</p>

                <p>Those waiting for the return of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> leaderboards will have to wait a little longer, as the feature has been delayed into 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard announced the delay during its most recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVHjgCsanBE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diablo 4 developer update livestream</a>. The new leaderboard system revolves around a new dungeon called The Tower, where players will be able to test their builds and compete for clear times and rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is to make sure we have some stability with the season launch, and then when The Tower shows up, it's online and people are ready to tackle it," associate game director Zaven Haroutunian said regarding the reason for the delay.</p><p dir="ltr">Leaderboards and The Tower were originally set to debut as part of Season 11 on December 11. Instead, Blizzard said the feature will arrive with patch 2.5.2 sometime in the new year. Even when The Tower and leaderboards do arrive, they will technically be in "beta" form, an approach Blizzard hasn't taken before when it comes to developing new features for Diablo 4.</p><p dir="ltr">Delaying The Tower wasn't just in the name of season-launch stability. Haroutunian said it was also to incorporate learnings and feedback from the recent Season 11 public-test-realm, which featured a version of The Tower Haroutunian said was intentionally "rough." Blizzard wanted to test it and make sure it was going in the right direction for the feature before committing to it, he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVHjgCsanBE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CVHjgCsanBE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Now, Blizzard is aiming to refine The Tower based on feedback. One problem Blizzard is looking to fix is to make it so progress orbs dropped by slain enemies will spawn closer to players to require less backtracking. Another problem area is the feeling that players need to "fish" for optimal dungeon layouts before committing to a run, something that was also a problem in Diablo 3.</p><p dir="ltr">Haroutunian said Blizzard is looking to address or remove outliers like certain bosses and or environments that aren't as conducive to a competitive game mode.</p><p dir="ltr">"We want to aim at consistency and make sure the mode is fun, exciting, and competitive over just cramming in visual variety in it just for its own sake," Haroutunian said.</p><p dir="ltr">Haroutunian also addressed feedback that The Tower currently feels too similar to The Pit, another part of Diablo 4's endgame. He said the comparison is completely valid, as The Tower currently is very similar to The Pit, with both modes taking inspiration from Greater Rifts in Diablo 3. Over time, however, the goal is for both The Pit and The Tower to diverge and offer different experiences.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Tower is going to start very similar, because it's starting at the same foundation," Haroutunian said. "Over time, it will change, it will morph, it will be its own thing. And The Pit will suddenly have all this space it's freed up to occupy. It doesn't have to be this pseudo-competitive mode anymore, it can just be whatever it needs to be. It can be as crazy as we want."</p><p dir="ltr">When The Tower does officially arrive, it won't be the first time Diablo 4 has had leaderboards. A similar feature launched with one of Diablo 4's earlier seasons, only to be removed a few months later with the launch of its first expansion, Vessel of Hatred.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season of Divine Intervention begins December 11 and just might be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-11-might-be-its-biggest-rework-yet/1100-6535476/" data-ref-id="1100-6535476">the game's biggest rework yet</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#907)—Clues and Answers for Thursday, December 4]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-december-4-907/</link>
            <guid>1372570</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You’re almost through the first week of December, and you’re a few steps closer to the festive window that we all love. Before you get there, you’ve got a few more NYT Connections puzzles to complete, and naturally, that includes today’s puzzle. Below, I’ve sketched out the best NYT Connections hints and solutions you’ll find anywhere.</p>



<p>If you’re being hampered by today’s puzzle, be sure to read on for the NYT Connections hints you need to get through it and keep your streak running.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-4">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 4)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #907:</p>



<ul>
<li>DRAW CLOSE</li>



<li>PUZZLE</li>



<li>ROSTRUM</li>



<li>NUZZLE</li>



<li>GUZZLE</li>



<li>IKEA FURNITURE</li>



<li>MUZZLE</li>



<li>LEGO SET</li>



<li>HOLD TIGHT</li>



<li>KNOCK BACK</li>



<li>MODEL</li>



<li>SPOON</li>



<li>SWILL</li>



<li>BEAK</li>



<li>POUND DOWN</li>



<li>PROBOSCIS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These are all different ways people might physically draw close to one another for comfort or affection.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>These words all describe drinking something quickly, often in large amounts or without pause.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are all items that don’t come ready-made — you have to put the pieces together yourself.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These words are all different names for the protruding facial structure of animals.</em> </li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 4:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-4-907">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 4 (#907)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– DRAW CLOSE, HOLD TIGHT, NUZZLE, SPOON</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – GUZZLE, KNOCK BACK, POUND DOWN, SWILL</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – IKEA FURNITURE, LEGO SET, MODEL, PUZZLE</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BEAK, MUZZLE, PROBOSCIS, ROSTRUM</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Console Nobody Has Heard of Just Topped PS5 in Sales in the US]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/console-nex-playground-topped-ps5-sales-us/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Circana’s most recent release of hardware sales in the United States just revealed a tantalizing tidbit about an unknown piece of hardware that’s making waves this holiday season. In a post on social media by Circana’s Mat Piscatella, it was revealed that the <strong>NEX Playground Interactive Gaming System </strong>outsold the PlayStation 5 during the week ending November 22, 2025.</p>



<p>The NEX Playground came in just behind pole position, held by the Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World Bundle, this year’s hottest Christmas gift.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-nex-playground">What is the NEX Playground?</h2>



<p>Mat Piscatella’s telling post on social media revealed that the <strong>NEX Playground Interactive Gaming System </strong>beat the PS5 Slim Digital in sales in the United States midway through November, prompting many to ask what the device even is.</p>











<p>The NEX Playground has been around since 2023, but it’s gathering steam now ahead of this year’s holiday season. It’s part of a new line-up of interactive games consoles designed for families and young gamers, allowing them to turn their televisions into engaging experiences without the need for controllers.</p>



<p>It’s like the Kinect, Eye Toy, or PlayStation Camera, but you don’t need a console to make it work, as it <strong>is </strong>the console.</p>



<p>It’s an AI-powered device that sits next to your television, offering a range of games like Fruit Ninja, Bluey Bust-a-Move, NHL Puck Rush, and Barbie Dance Party, all of which encourage young players to get up, get moving, and enjoy video games more interactively. It also has a bolt-on subscription that users can opt into to secure more games.</p>



<p>The NEX Playground costs just $249, which makes it a considerably cheaper option compared to the Nintendo Switch 2 ($500) or the PS5 Slim Digital ($449).</p>



<p>Circana’s Mat Piscatella followed up his simple sales report with a comment that read, ‘MOTION CONTROL IS BACK.’</p>







<p>Are you investing in a NEX Playground Interactive Gaming System for your family this Christmas? If you’re in the market, don’t forget to hang out at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/">Insider Gaming Holiday 2025 deals hub</a>, and be sure to hit up the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> to discuss what gaming gifts you’re buying this year.</p>

<p>It's confirmed Ezra Duke (Sergeant Duke) is voiced by the accomplished actor Jason Kelley...aka Doom Slayer! Yes, Kelley actually was the voice actor behind id Software's legendary character in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/doom_the_dark_ages">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>, which was released earlier this year, and he's now voicing a soldier in Samus' latest outing.</p>

<p>The man himself has <a href="https://x.com/Jasonkelley_JK/status/1996311621136973858">even replied to a fan</a>, who requested a "Samus and DOOM" game, while acknowledging the history of the mostly silent protagonists and how they don't actually "say much". Admittedly, this might be as close as fans ever get to seeing Samus and DOOM Slayer in the same game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I wouldn't be mad at that pairing. Neither one of us say much.😂"</em></p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cevmxgow&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>In case you missed it, Duke is described on Nintendo's Japanese website as being a "veteran who has survived countless battles with the Space Pirate army". And "his stubborn personality often leads to conflicts with his superiors, but his sincere and compassionate nature make him a reliable presence on the battlefield".</p>
<p>Samus will encounter Duke on her new adventure along with various other Galactic Federation soldiers. You can find out more about each character in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/metroid-prime-4-beyond-meet-the-team">our previous post</a>.</p>
<p>If this has got you wondering about the possibility of DOOM: The Dark Ages coming to the Switch 2 in the future, there's no official word just yet, but the previous Switch generation saw multiple <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM</a> titles released, including the latest entries. So, hopefully, we see something in the future.</p>

<p>Escape from Tarkov has been dominating the extraction shooter space for many years, and midway through November, it hit the long-awaited 1.0 release window that pushed it out as a ‘finished’ game. In the weeks that followed, the game’s best players have busied themselves with completing the game’s all-new story-driven campaign, seen as the ultimate challenge for Tarkov fans.</p>



<p>The first completion came earlier this week, with streamer ‘Tigz’ being dubbed the first in the world to see Tarkov through to the end. Other streamers and players followed, but recently, a Chinese streamer proved to be the first to capture unlocking the game’s best, and reportedly <strong>hardest</strong>, ending – <strong>Savior</strong>.</p>



<p>This was the first <strong>PvP </strong>unlock, while the first PvE unlock, recognized as the world’s first <a href="https://x.com/nikgeneburn/status/1996179962685178266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Battlestate Games</a>, was by a player named Tsukinogi.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-s-best-ending-has-been-secured">Escape from Tarkov’s Best Ending Has Been Secured</h2>



<p>On BiliBili, <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nE2YBGEWr">an hour-long VOD</a> was posted from the perspective of a Chinese streamer, Youmoxiangche, who goes by the in-game username ‘NeverPlayScav’.</p>



<p>In this video, we saw a tense battle through Terminal rage as the player pushed towards what’s widely believed to be the <strong>best </strong>of Escape from Tarkov’s four endings: Survivor, Fallen, Debtor, and Savior.</p>



<p>The worst endings are <strong>Debtor </strong>and <strong>Fallen</strong>, while <strong>Survivor </strong>is seen as being a middle-of-the-road victory, and <strong>Savior </strong>sits atop the pile as the best outcome. In the Savior ending, the player character is welcomed onto the ZUBR Boat after extracting through Terminal, fighting through Scavs, RUAF, and Black Faction enemies in a PvE environment.</p>



<p>As they’re ushered onto the boat, the vessel’s captain tries to assassinate them, but is caught and killed by a friendly RUAF soldier who assures the player that nobody is left on the boat but allies. As they head topside for a smoke, more bodies are seen being dumped into the river through Tarkov.</p>



<p>At that moment, jets fly overhead and drop what appears to be a <strong>nuclear warhead </strong>on the city of Tarkov, and the soldier quips that they managed to escape just in time. As the image fades to black, the player character receives a unique ring, and the RUAF soldier utters the words that it’s up to them to decide their own fate now.</p>



<p>It almost suggests a sequel of sorts could be coming. The RUAF squad, along with the PMC protagonist, zip off into the sunset, and the soldier says:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What matters is we’re alive, and now we’ll take down those bastards from TerraGroup. The whole world will know the truth.</p>



<p>From here on, we decide our own fate.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We know that Battlestate Games is working on ‘other games’ in the Escape from Tarkov universe, and that DLC will be delivered now that the 1.0 version of the game is out, but is this our first indicator as to what that might look like?</p>
