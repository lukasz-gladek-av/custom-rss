            <p>
A final update is on its way to Redfall after all.
</p>
<p>
Following the news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Microsoft was closing a number of Bethesda studios</a> including Redfall developer Arkane Austin, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-studio-was-reportedly-working-on-offline-mode-for-may-release-before-closure">the team was working on DLC and updates</a> - including an offline mode - until very recently.

</p>
<p>
A new post on X, however, states the update is still on the way. "Thank you all for your supportive messages," it reads. "We are working to release our final update, Game Update 4, that brings revamped Neighbourhood and Nest systems, Single Player Pausing, Offline Mode, and more. We'll provide additional details soon. Thank you all."

<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Thank you for all your supportive messages. </p><p>We are working to release our final update, Game Update 4, that brings revamped Neighborhood and Nest systems, Single Player Pausing, Offline Mode, and more. </p><p>We’ll provide additional details soon.

What's not specifically mentioned here, though, is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-hero-pass-dlc-still-missing-a-year-after-its-release">Hero Pass DLC</a>, which will add two new player characters to the vampire shooter but remains missing a year after the game's release.
</p>
<p>
This was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-hero-pass-cancelled-following-arkane-austin-closure">cancelled after the studio closure</a>, with players directed to a <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/?linkId=100000260400360#en/answer/65606">Bethesda support page</a> with details forthcoming of a credit programme to reimburse anyone who already purchased the DLC.

</p>
<p>
At present, that support page still stands. It suggests that while the offline mode and other requested features are still on the way, the Hero Pass is not.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Bethesda to confirm.
</p>
<p>
Even before this final update, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-last-stroll-through-redfall-at-the-pace-it-was-always-meant-to-be-played">Redfall remains worth checking out through one last stroll of its world</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-redfall-update-will-grant-arkanes-shooter-offline-immortality.874197/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-redfall-update-offline-mode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arkane Austin's ill-fated vampiric shooter&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>is just about still alive, it seems, as the devs have announced the game is to receive one final update before being laid to rest for good.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/playRedfall/status/1791491460858020040" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on&nbsp;<em>Redfall</em>'s official X (formerly Twitter) account, Arkane Austin says that one last update, titled Game Update 4, is in the works for&nbsp;<em>Redfall</em>, so it looks like the studio will get to finish <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redfall-offline-mode-update-report">what it was working on before that shutdown</a> after all.</p>

<p>The first major feature the update will bring is the long-called-for Offline Mode, which will allow you to play&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>without being connected to a server. With online games being shut down left, right, and center, this is a pretty important move for preservation.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/redfall-update-offline-mode-vampire-stairs.jpg?itok=M8bwdiZP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/redfall-update-offline-mode-vampire-stairs.jpg?itok=DNYIrNCA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>is getting one last update after all.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to being able to play offline, the last&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>update will also bring "revamped Neighborhood and Nest systems", and Arkane doesn't seem to have intended that pun.</p>

<p>The update will also bring the ability to pause the game if you're in single-player mode, so no more getting ganked by nasty vampires while you're making a cup of coffee in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Arkane says additional details for the update will be revealed "soon", and there's no release date for the update yet, so it might be a little while before it arrives.</p>

<p>Still, it's nice to know that although&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>was much maligned by critics and players alike, there will still be a way to revisit it in future, even if it is just to figure out what went wrong.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/redfall-update-offline-mode-sniper.jpg?itok=SiDR7yWO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/redfall-update-offline-mode-sniper.jpg?itok=86e2IwBT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to play&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>offline? You'll soon be able to do just that.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Redfall</em>, it's a shooter developed by&nbsp;<em>Prey&nbsp;</em>studio Arkane Austin.</p>

<p><em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>has a multiplayer focus (although it can technically be played single-player), with each character taking the role of one of the game's survivors, each of whom has special abilities that complement the rest of the group.</p>

<p>On release,&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/14768/redfall" rel="noopener" target="_blank">met with ambivalence</a> by critics and players, with many pointing to its lack of Arkane's signature immersive sim-style gameplay features, as well as the shallowness of its gameplay loops and story.</p>

<p>Last week, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">made the call to shut down Arkane Austin</a>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>developer Tango Gameworks and two other studios.&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>will, however, seemingly survive the death of its studio. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Around a week after Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">shuttered a number of beloved studios</a> with a track record of making excellent single-player, story-driven games, their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-finally-buys-activision-blizzard-as-last-legal-hurdles-fall-away">newly-owned arm of Activision</a> has revealed a brand new studio. Working on a new series of story-driven, triple-A games.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The unveiling of Elsewhere Entertainment comes days after the sudden and shocking closure of Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks and Mighty Dog Studios, who between them have been responsible for games including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey">Prey</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-evil-within-2">The Evil Within</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostwire-tokyo">Tokyo: Ghostwire</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and more.</p>
<p>With the exception of multiplayer misfire <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redfall">Redfall</a>, the likes of Arkane and Tango were arguably known for specialising in inventive and well-liked-to-loved single-player titles built around their narratives, making the emergence of a new studio doing exactly that somewhat frustrating timing.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting, of course, that Activision and Microsoft operate separately in many respects - including budgets - despite now being merged into one multi-billion-dollar megacorp, so the new Activision studio’s launch isn’t directly tied to Microsoft’s decision to close several other developers. (Elsewhere will apparently draw from Activision’s resources and use their tools for their projects.)</p>
<p>On top of that, the Polish team made up of devs with experience on Naughty Dog’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection">Uncharted</a>, CD Projekt Red’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and Ubisoft’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division">The Division</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> was <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/activision-and-microsoft-are-opening-a-new-game-studio-in-poland-elsewhere-entertainment-with-a-totally-new-ip">apparently put together a little while back</a>, rather than being freshly formed now.</p>
<p>Given those particular credits, it might not come as a surprise to learn that Elsewhere will be working on an original “narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise", which lines up with those blockbuster single-player titles.</p>
<p>“The team’s underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games,” Activision added in their <a href="https://blog.activision.com/activision/2024/activision-announces-new-studio-elsewhere-entertainment-all-new-franchise-development">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>By “enduring legacy” and “resonates beyond games”, I can only assume they mean “makes a whole boatload of money and gets turned into a prestige TV show like The Last of Us and The Witcher”. Whatever it ends up being, expect it to be at least a while off while Elsewhere continues to staff up on their debut project.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/24158250/upgrade-netflix-movie-cyberpunk-scifi</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/upgrade-is-a-terrific-cyberpunk-thriller-disguised-as-an-action-movie-and-it%E2%80%99s-now-on-netflix.874191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/24158250/upgrade-netflix-movie-cyberpunk-scifi<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="oyOft2">Compelling sci-fi dystopias are few and far between in movies these days, which is why it might be surprising that one of the best is hiding inside an underappreciated action movie from 2018. <em>Upgrade</em>, which arrived on Netflix this week, is full of bone-crunching, genuinely funny action, but it’s also secretly a fantastic thriller with an excellent sci-fi world hiding beneath the surface. </p>
<p id="m2tJ6n">The movie follows Grey (Logan Marshall-Green), a mechanic living in a not-too-distant future. Early in the film, Grey’s wife gets murdered in a seemingly random mugging that leaves him paralyzed, but he finds an opportunity for revenge thanks to an experimental cybernetic implant, called STEM, that allows him to walk again. But that implant seems to have a mind of its own, and talks to him almost constantly.</p>
<p id="XbbP80">This dynamic between STEM and Grey (voiced by Simon Maiden) gives <em>Upgrade </em>a surprisingly welcome dose of comedy that most action movies or thrillers don’t make time for. Because STEM can’t read Grey’s mind, Grey has to say everything he wants to tell STEM out loud, leading to hilarious fight scenes that leaves bad guys (who are also getting their asses kicked) completely baffled. It’s all the fun of Tom Hardy’s <em>Venom</em>, without the constraints of comic book characters holding anything back, and with the added comedy of a cold emotionless machine processing helping make the violent decisions quicker.</p>
<p id="O67W14">The fights themselves are also an excellent blend of silly and brutal that keeps them fun. Because Grey doesn’t really have a natural talent for fighting, he has to let STEM take over his body for brawls. As such, every fight is as robotic as you’d expect from a microchip learning to pilot a person. Arm and leg movements are staccato and instant, with barely any bending or smoothness to them at all. Punches are blocked without thought and delivered even more swiftly, and gunshots land with the perfect precision of an algorithm that’s worked it all out ahead of time.</p>

<p id="kH7o2l">What really sells all this is Logan Marshall-Green’s reaction to it. He plays the character like if Tom Hardy was in an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23737241/every-i-think-you-should-leave-sketch-ranked-best-to-worst-itysl"><em>I Think You Should Leave</em> sketch</a>, with a mix of terrified faces, unintelligible yells, and confused expressions, all while he’s putting random assassins in the dirt or throwing them through walls. For its part, the camera follows this strange style of movement too, frequently bending with Grey when he dodges a punch at an unnatural angle, giving us bizarre views and tipping us into the same kind of passenger-in-his-own-body feeling that Grey has when STEM takes over.</p>
<p id="7HuwUT">But in between all this action, director and writer Leigh Whannell (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/28/21154461/invisible-man-review-movie-elisabeth-moss-blumhouse-saw-leigh-whannell"><em>The Invisible Man</em></a>, <em>Insidious</em>), fills <em>Upgrade</em>’s world to the brim with fascinating details. Voice assistants and self-driving cars are just starting to eclipse the old mechanical ones on the road — putting Grey’s custom car repair business in jeopardy — while humans are getting augmentations to improve their everyday lives. The big city is swarming with police drones that monitor every street and alley for crime, but somehow never actually do anything to prevent it. While most of society is aware that human modification is common, the cops seem baffled to see it, making them feel decades behind the crimes they’re trying to solve. </p>
<p id="bW2vj5">It’s the kind of setting that feels quietly on the precipice of a full-on cyberpunk dystopia. The movie’s main characters all live in beautiful high-tech homes that look like they cost a fortune, while the side characters reside in abandoned apartment buildings, tiny run-down houses at the edge of town, or tent cities. Meanwhile, in the background of one scene we see a few people hooked into VR-headsets they rarely ever disconnect from, because for some, living in the virtual world is easier than living in the real one. The movie presents its nameless city setting as one slowly sliding into a massive class disparity that leaves only the ultra-wealthy and the incredibly poor, and it’s happening incrementally enough that no one in the movie even thinks to comment on it. </p>
<p id="hWoJI1">It’s rare that any movie manages to craft a cyberpunk world so subtly, but it’s even rarer when it’s all tucked neatly inside a black comedy about violent revenge, but that’s exactly what <em>Upgrade </em>pulls off. And while it wasn’t a particularly big hit in theaters back in 2018, hopefully the movie can get the appreciation it deserves now that it’s on Netflix. </p>

While we don’t have a lot of details at the moment, it seems that players will be able to visit at least one <em>Fallout</em>-inspired location on the battle royale’s map. It also looks like the franchise’s iconic power armor will be added to <em>Fortnite</em>, likely as a premium cosmetic skin. </p><p>In April, after years of rumors and hype, the live-action<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505"><em>Fallout</em> TV series premiered on Amazon Prime</a></span> and quickly became one of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-show-amazon-prime-audience-ratings-1851445138&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-show-amazon-prime-audience-ratings-1851445138">service’s biggest hits</a></span> as well as one of the most-watched shows of the year.

So it’s not surprising that Epic and Bethesda would work together on a big <em>Fallout/Fortnite</em> event. </p><p>At the moment, as previously mentioned, we don’t know much about what to expect with this crossover or when it will go live in <em>Fortnite</em>. It’s possible that this will be a tiny thing, just a few skins and nothing more. But I’d bet a few V-Bucks that this is a bigger event that will feature more than just a few cosmetic items, maybe even some quests. The teaser image posted by Epic seems to show at least one on-the-map location inspired by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-amazon-prime-bethesda-1851421573&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-amazon-prime-bethesda-1851421573"><em>Fallout</em></a></span>, so perhaps there’s more to this upcoming event than just cool-looking power armor. </p><p>Interestingly, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-dataminers-unearth-evidence-of-fallout-gundam-and-the-crow-crossovers-for-modern-warfare-3-season-4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-dataminers-unearth-evidence-of-fallout-gundam-and-the-crow-crossovers-for-modern-warfare-3-season-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">earlier in May</a></span>, <em>Call of Duty Warzone </em>dataminers discovered evidence of a <em>Fallout</em> crossover happening in that battle royale game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-memorial-day-deals-xbox-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">In search of Xbox deals over Memorial Day weekend? Here's what we think will pop up.</h2></div><div><section><p>There are a few different points in the year that feature some great sale events, offering excellent discounts on a variety of gaming-related items. Memorial Day weekend is one of those times and usually has quite a few deals for Xbox fans to enjoy. Whether you’re looking for deals on games or controllers or storage, there’s plenty to check out at numerous different retailers.</p><p>While we don’t know what exactly will be hitting those virtual sale shelves this year, we can take a good look at previous years to see what could be making a comeback. Below, you can also find information on when Memorial Day lands this year, how long sales will last, and when the next big sale event will be that you can mark your calendar for.</p><p><strong>Best Xbox Deals Today</strong></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/wKDXA?_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate 3-Month<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$36.99</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/NMXbE?_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Xbox Core Wireless Controller – Robot White<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$35.99</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/dPVeM?_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Xbox Series X Mini Fridge<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$39.94</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/5OYlN" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Xbox Series X Diablo 4 Bundle<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$469.99</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/MY3X4" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Xbox Wireless Headset (Official)<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$89.99</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/3v3em" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$30.00</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Y0r6o" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Seagate Storage Expansion Card For Xbox Series XS 1TB<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$139.99</span></li></ul></div><h2>When is Memorial Day?</h2><p>While Memorial Day lands on <strong>Monday, May 27</strong>, some of the sales start up a bit earlier. Sometimes even a week before, but that depends entirely on the retailer. Places like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart will put up a notice on their respective websites stating when their sale event begins and how long it will last for, so it's worth checking out your preferred site to see when the best time to buy is.</p><p>It's also worth noting that some of these retailers offer early access to sale events through their respective memberships. Though that hasn't been confirmed yet at one of their locations for this one, it's still worth keeping in mind. Places like Walmart, for example, offer this through their Walmart+ membership and you can even score a free 30-day trial to test it out! They're also offering some excellent bonus offers right now that you can take advantage of, like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-plus-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-deal"><u>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for two months for free</u></a>, a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-plus-youtube-premium-free-trial"><u>three-month trial of YouTube Premium for free</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-plus-apple-music-deal"><u>five months of Apple Music for free</u></a>, and more.</p><h2>What Xbox Deals to Expect This Year</h2><p>Based on previous years, there are quite a few different Xbox deals that could pop up again this year. Xbox video game deals will absolutely come back around, but last year saw various <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/here-are-saturdays-best-memorial-day-deals">expansion cards go on sale</a> and there's a very good chance that Xbox controllers will be discounted as well. We'll make sure to update this piece with the best Xbox deals as they appear, but if you simply can't wait for Memorial Day weekend and want to see what the best deals are right now, make sure to have a look at our roundup of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-deals">best Xbox deals</a>.</p><h2>How Long Do Memorial Day Sales Last?</h2><p>While some sales will just run through the three-day weekend, others can extend a few days after, which is nice if you're feeling on a tight schedule of picking up your favorite deals. Again, this entirely depends on the retailer, so it's worth checking out your preferred shop to see what their sale event plans are.</p><h2>When Will the Next Sale Event Happen After Memorial Day?</h2><p>Summer is a great time to shop around as there are a wide variety of sale events that go on over those months. You won't even have to wait too long for the next one, as June usually sees some big Summer gaming sales very early on. With <a href="https://www.ign.com/live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN Live</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-game-fest-2024-date-and-livestream-details-officially-announced">Summer Game Fest</a> kicking the festivities off this year in June, there will likely be a sale that happens around that time on each platform's store. IGN Live will run from <strong>June 7-9 in LA </strong>and SGF's big livestream event will kick off on <strong>June 7 at 2pm PT/5pm ET/10pm GMT</strong>, so make sure to keep your eyes peeled around this time to see what the Xbox Store has up its sleeve.</p><p>Not long after these events will be <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prime-day-2024">Amazon Prime Day</a>, which is an excellent time for Prime members to scope out deals they may have missed over Memorial Day weekend. While we don't know the exact dates for it this year, if it follows the pattern of previous years, it'll likely land around the second week of July. </p><p>If you want to see even more deals outside of Xbox, check out our roundups of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-playstation-ps5-deals">best PlayStation deals</a>, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals"><u>best Nintendo Switch deals</u></a>, and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pc-video-game-steam-deals">best PC video game deals</a>.

Competitive gaming YouTubers are reportedly already playing under a non-disclosure agreement.</p><p>However, that hasn’t stopped what looks like a slew of screenshots showing off Deadlock. X/Twitter account <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791115270905290793" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@gabefollower</a> was first with the details, describing Deadlock as a third-person hero-based shooter, with 6v6 battles on big maps with four lanes. There are abilities and items alongside tower defense mechanics. The setting is described as fantasy with steampunk.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since testers started sharing Deadlock screenshots all over the place, here's ones I can verify, featuring one of the heroes called Grey Talon. <a href="https://t.co/KdZSRxObSz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KdZSRxObSz</a></p>— ‎Gabe Follower (@gabefollower) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>These elements will be familiar to players of Valve’s multiplayer online battle area (MOBA) game Dota 2 as well as its own hero shooter, Team Fortress 2. Blizzard’s Overwatch, Riot's Valorant, and Hi-Rez’s Smite also look like they're in the mix.</p><p>Valve boss Gabe Newell is yet to announce Deadlock. IGN has asked Valve for comment.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every IGN Valve Game Review</h3></div></output><p>Valve’s last developed game to release was competitive first-person shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/counter-strike-2">Counter-Strike 2</a>, which effectively replaced Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Before that, in 2020, Valve released <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a> exclusively for virtual reality headsets. Valve has also released a Dota-themed digital card game called <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/artifact">Artifact</a> and a Dota auto chess game called <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dota-underlords">Dota Underlords</a>, although both have failed to find as big of an audience as the company’s previous titles.</p><p>All the while, the wait for Half-Life 3 continues. Back in 2020, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-left-4-dead-3-details-cancelled-valve">a making-of for Half-Life: Alyx revealed a swathe of games developed and shelved by Valve</a> between the release of Half-Life 2: Episode 2 and Valve's latest VR game. That list included details on a version of Half-Life 3 that was in development for around a year, and an open-world Left 4 Dead 3.</p><p><em>Photo by Olly Curtis/Future Publishing via Getty Images</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Arkane Austin's co-op vampire shooter, Redfall, will receive its fourth and final major update soon.</p><p>The official <a href="https://x.com/playRedfall/status/1791491460858020040" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Redfall Twitter account</a> posted that Redfall's Game Update 4 is bringing several quality-of-life features to the game. This include revamped Neighborhood and Nest systems, an offline mode, the ability to pause during single-player sessions, and more. The development team didn't say when the update will go live, but will provide more details at a later date.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">Microsoft shut down several of its studios</a>, including Arkane Austin. Xbox executive Matt Booty stated that Redfall's most-recent update was going to be its last one as development comes to a close. However, that doesn't seem to the case anymore. Booty also confirmed that Redfall's servers will remain online.</p><p>It seems like Game Update 4 only contains quality-of-life changes, as there's no mention of any additional story content. Those who purchased the premium editions of the game were entitled to two extra playable heroes. After Arkane Austin's closure, however, they were instead promised credits for the undelivered content.</p><p>Redfall is available on PC and Xbox Series X|S, as well as Xbox Game Pass. The game is included in <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/pick-and-mix/build-your-own-supreme-collection?aff_track=CJ&amp;CJEVENT=af14b923146511ef817d01af0a1cb826&amp;utm_source=CJ&amp;cj_pid=100770772&amp;cj_aid=13797872" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Fanatical bundle</a> (both GameSpot and Fanatical are owned by Fandom) as part of the Supreme Collection.</p>

<p data-characters="288" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Any <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> player will know by now, considering the <a href="https://x.com/search?q=ffxiv%20mountain%20dew&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deluge of memes</a> across the internet, that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xiv-adds-the-mountain-zu-a-mountain-dew-themed-bird-mount/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>FFXIV </em>and Mountain Dew Gaming</a> are working together on a promotion that provides prizes both in and out of the virtual world. But for those excluded from events, it’s not much fun.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">The bummer here is that the Mountain Dew Gaming partnership isn’t for all players on the North American Data Centers — the <a href="https://www.mtndewgaming.com/terms-and-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terms and conditions</a> state it’s for residents of the United States only — so that excludes a lot of players typically in that region. And for physical prizes, there’s no shipping outside of the continental US. </p> <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true">Of course, more region locked codes have frustrated players excluded again, particularly those in North American Data Centers but not US residents. The responses to<em> Final Fantasy XIV’s</em> official Twitter account demonstrate as much. <br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We're excited to partner with <a href="https://twitter.com/MTNDEWGaming?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MTNDEWGaming</a> to offer fun rewards!</p><p>Please note that the Mountain Zu/Sparkling Citrus Refreshment item codes cannot be redeemed on Mog Station until Dawntrail early access. Attempting to redeem before then will display an "invalid code" error. <a href="https://t.co/GYGvNT6cWA">https://t.co/GYGvNT6cWA</a></p></div>— FINAL FANTASY XIV (@FF_XIV_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1791177357979697259?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">The complaints are pretty evenly spread between <a href="https://x.com/ChaosValentine/status/1791183714346528957" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canadian players</a> upset and confused they aren’t included, and those in the <a href="https://x.com/umbrastaff/status/1791182937456771406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UK and EU</a> lamenting that we don’t even seem to get thrown the scraps of these promotions.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">There’s one <a href="https://x.com/TailzSnowMew/status/1791181116033921485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common theme</a> among the comments – why are these promotions region locked? This isn’t the first time that North America (or a select part of it) has benefited from a promotion while the rest of us could only look on longingly. Off the top of my head, I can name two that happened in 2021:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="389" data-injectable="false"> <li><a href="https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1390023980195532801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Butterfinger promo</a>, which gave players the Chocorpokkur mount</li> <li>The controversial <a href="https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1726571133254963235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grubhub promotion</a>, which gave players the ‘Eat Pizza’ emote</li> </ul> <p data-characters="157" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true">Admittedly, the Eat Pizza emote is now available to purchase on the<em> FFXIV</em> Online Store, but the Chocorpokkur mount is still only owned by those in the USA.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">Of course, there are other promotions, such as the Japan-exclusive KFC promotion, which provides players with the ‘Eat Chicken’ emote. But I’d like to mention here that the only promotion that happened in the EU was <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/9303c603b00fb18f64bd7d0beaeba8eead0ebecd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this one</a> back in 2016, which didn’t make it to the UK. </p> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true">During the May 16 Live Letter stream, Yoshida noted EU Data Center players should shout out ideas and partnerships they’d like to see. It’s a nice gesture and all, but it’s been a while, and even if you play on one of the Data Centers typically of a certain region, there’s no guarantee you’re included. </p>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">Maybe I’m just salty. After all, I am a British player on North American servers, so I will soon have the Mountain Dew exclusive rewards in front of my face with no way of earning them, while my American friends discuss how much Mountain Dew they need to buy to get cool items.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="283" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Are you <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-prepare-for-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preparing for <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em></a>? Well, if not, it might be time to do so, as not only is the community <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-month-ahead-of-the-final-shape-destiny-2s-community-is-at-ease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemingly fully on board</a> with Bungie’s next flagship, but there’s a lot of exciting stuff being shown off, like the improved weapon enhancement system.</p> <p data-characters="705" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">Indeed, <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-05-16-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie’s latest <em>This Week in Destiny</em> blog post</a> has gone in-depth on <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s new and improved weapon enhancement feature, and everything suggests it’s going to be a hoot. The gist of it is that all the currently active weapons (i.e. the stuff that’s been issued out after <em>Beyond Light</em>) will have access to an up-to-date version of the masterworking and levelling systems, available via the three-stage enhancement upgrades that unlock as a given weapon is levelled-up. Some of the biggest boons of the new system include the ability to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-how-to-unlock-the-lost-memento/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apply a Memento to a non-craftable weapon</a>, for example, though the same functionality will not be available on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-can-you-get-your-old-sunset-guns-back-after-the-final-shape-comes-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously sunset gear</a>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-destiny-2-the-final-shape-adds-three-stages-of-weapon-enhancement" data-injectable="false">Destiny 2: The Final Shape adds three stages of weapon enhancement</h2> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="719" data-injectable="true">Broadly, <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s new weapon enhancement system allows you to upgrade <em>most</em> of the game’s available weapons to gain access to enhanced traits, weapon levels, and a Memento socket. A rougher, work-in-progress version of this new system has been available for some time now via the Raid Adept weapons, but the same features (and then some) will be accessible to a wider array of gear with the new DLC.</p>
 <p data-characters="61" data-current-count="61" data-injectable="false">Here’s how the new weapon enhancement system will work:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="181" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Enhancement Tier 1:</strong> replaces a weapon’s Masterwork, unlocks an enhanced intrinsic, leveling, and a Memento socket; Raid Adept weapons can have their perks adjusted via the Martian Relic</li> <li><strong>Enhancement Tier 2 (at weapon level 11):</strong> upgrades the weapon’s left column trait to its enhanced version</li> <li><strong>Enhancement Tier 3 (at weapon level 17):</strong> upgrades the weapon’s right column trait to its enhanced version</li> </ul> <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">Further, Bungie has promised that all of the currently available weapons from the following activities will be eligible to acquire enhanced traits in some way, shape, or form:</p> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true"> <li>Vow of the Disciple (Adepts)</li> <li>King’s Fall (Adepts)</li> <li>Guardian Games</li> <li>Gambit PvPvE</li> <li>Crucible PvP (including Competitive, Iron Banner, and Trials of Osiris activities)</li> <li>Vanguard PvE (Operations, Nightfalls)</li> <li>Prophecy Dungeon</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="441" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true">“Unfortunately,” says Bungie’s blog, “due to some technical constraints, there are a handful of weapons instances from before Season 17 that have origin traits and are active drops, but they will not be eligible for weapon enhancement. If a weapon is not actively dropping in these activities and playlists or it’s under the legacy focusing options, it will not be enhance-able when The Final Shape releases.”</p>
 <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">It shouldn’t be overly surprising that some of the active weapons will be precluded from the system, given how many different iterations of the weapon enhancement system <em>Destiny 2</em> has gone through over the years. We don’t yet have a concrete list of the weapons that won’t be eligible for enhancement just yet, but the good news is that Bungie will update them to support the new system “if [they] are reissued and become a part of a playlist’s active drops once again.”</p>
 <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">It’s good news all around, then, and it seems that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-content-update-and-four-streams-completely-turned-the-destiny-2-community-around/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie has successfully turned <em>Destiny 2</em> around</a> following all the problems that cropped up during the year of <em>Lightfall</em>. It’s an impressive feat, to be sure, and it’ll become even more impressive if Bungie manages to deliver something truly meaningful and engaging with <em>The Final Shape</em>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-college-football-25-gameplay-reveal-shows-attention-to-detail.874134/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-25-gameplay-reveal<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed the first gameplay footage for&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>, and it looks like exactly the kind of thing you'd want if you've been waiting for this revival since 2013.</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I'm a Brit, and what I know about college football wouldn't fill the back of one of our very picturesque postage stamps. Still, we've got college football fans on our team, and our very own Andrew Otton assures me this is a strong showing.</p>

<p>Yesterday, EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date">promised to show us</a>&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>in all its glory in a trailer, and they've made good on that promise. The footage doesn't technically show raw gameplay, but it does show what you can expect from the game's impressive-looking engine.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-opener.jpg?itok=imfgpMmc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-opener.jpg?itok=JBSuQoZP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA is paying attention to the fine details in&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It looks like EA is not only paying attention to how games feel, but also how&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>pays tribute to its subject matter.</p>

<p>Plenty of pregame rituals and traditions have been incorporated into the game; in the trailer, we can see the USC Trojan stabbing the field, for instance, as well as the iconic Oregon Ducks motorcycle.</p>

<p>Any college football fan knows that the behavior of the crowds and the teams' mascots can be just as important as what happens on the field, so it's nice to see EA paying attention to this element of college football.</p>

<p>You can check out the new trailer for&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>right here. It should bring a happy tear to your eye if you're a college football fanatic.</p>




<p>In an <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/EA-SPORTS--Gives-First-Look-at-Gameplay-Modes--Fan-Favorite-Ways-to-Play-in-EA-SPORTS-College-Football-25/default.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accompanying press release</a>, EA reveals some of the features that will be making their way to&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football&nbsp;</em>in July.</p>

<p>They include a Wear &amp; Tear system that requires you to manage your players' fatigue and stamina on the field, as well as a system that incorporates the unnerving feeling of a homefield advantage into the gameplay itself.</p>

<p>All 134 FBS colleges will be represented in&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>, and you can look forward to realistic "unique team run-outs, rivalry rituals, synchronized crowd-chants, loudness meters", and mascots, plus lots more.</p>

<p>It's nice to see the&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football&nbsp;</em>franchise returning. The last installment was all the way back in 2013, and a series of lawsuits and setbacks made another game in the series impossible for many years.</p>

<p>In 2021, however, the NCAA and EA revealed that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-returning-in-coming-years">college football games would return</a>, with EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-deal-covers-4-games">signing a four-game deal</a> to bring its signature franchise back to life.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>, the first game in that four-game deal, launches on July 17th on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10003151/">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ea-sports-college-football-25/9nsdm7mbgg8l" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. No PC version has been announced. Stay tuned for more.</p>

  <p id="bfiqT3"><em>I Saw the TV Glow</em> is a rare treat of a movie. It’s equal parts dense, complicated, funny, and sad, all while being an absolute joy to watch. Its story is equally concerned with the pain of loving a TV show that ended too soon, and the pain of letting your whole life slip by without ever truly knowing yourself. Finding ways to communicate all these complicated ideas while still making a watchable, entertaining film is a big task, but <em>TV Glow</em> writer-director Jane Schoenbrun has experience with that.</p>
<p id="RFxffj">Their fantastic first feature, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23027388/were-all-going-to-the-worlds-fair-review"><em>We’re All Going to the World’s Fair</em></a>, centers on a young woman who finds friendship online as part of a community obsessed with something called “the World’s Fair Challenge,” a viral ritual that supposedly changes the body of anyone who performs it. <em>World’s Fair</em>, and Schoenbrun’s earlier documentary about Slenderman, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F275691576%2F4429fa2599&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F24158543%2Fi-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23922584__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://vimeo.com/275691576/4429fa2599\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/24158543/i-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23922584__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://vimeo.com/275691576/4429fa2599&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24158543/i-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>A Self-Induced Hallucination</em></a>, are both deeply rooted in online communities, creepypasta, and how we find ourselves and our identities in the media we consume. </p>
<p id="nKfyCq"><em>TV Glow</em> takes that concept even further, following Owen (Ian Foreman and, as he gets older, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24113743/american-society-of-magical-negroes-ending-explained-analysis">Justice Smith</a>) and Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine), two loners who bond over a shared love of a late-night TV show called <em>The Pink Opaque </em>— a mashup of ’90s TV hits that lives somewhere between <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23069583/buffy-spuffy-elysian-fields-fanfiction"><em>Buffy The Vampire Slayer</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23434855/twin-peaks-november-lets-go"><em>Twin Peaks</em></a>. Ahead of the release of <em>I Saw the TV Glow</em>, Polygon sat down with Schoenbrun to talk about their inspiration for the movie, their distrust of narrative convention, and the subtle ways all their films connect.</p>

<p id="GxNxRU"><strong>Polygon: Where did this script start for you?</strong></p>
<p id="NQXvay"><strong>Jane Schoenbrun: </strong>My process is very weird. I say my process — I don’t think it’s the way people normally work when they’re trying to make a narrative film. Something will kind of get lodged in my brain. And that something could be just like a title or an image or an idea. That’s definitely not a movie. But it feels stuck, and it feels connected to a lot of nerve endings that can be investigated. </p>
<p id="9GRLSz">And so for me on this film, there was this idea of being haunted by an unresolved cliffhanger from a child’s show, and the idea specifically of the characters on the TV show being in a certain kind of danger. That [feeling of] not having resolution, and that making it hard to exist in the “real world,” to the point where you’re almost taking on the pain of those characters. And from there, I really wanted to investigate why that particular mental metaphor or idea, and this sort of unreality and merging of fiction and reality that’s inherent in it, was so close to me. </p>
<p id="SJlLSy">I knew fairly early on that what I was talking about was a trans experience and dysphoria. And as I was beginning to work through dysphoria and beginning my actual transition, I understood this as a movie about recognizing something that’s wrong, and about the process that goes into that recognition.</p>

<p id="2km3NG"><strong>Do you think those feelings are similar for you, an unresolved TV show and the process of what it means to transition and to understand yourself better?</strong></p>
<p id="3kpc6T">The queer philosopher Eve Sedgwick does a lot of literary theory. I was reading the intro to one of her books, and she’ll talk about, like, a Henry James novel and pick apart the queer themes that are embedded in the work, or inherent to the work, even if only in a way that feels subtle, or only hinted, or glimpsed.</p>
<p id="K8p3KQ">She talked in this intro about, in childhood, finding these glimmers of a thing that at the time, she didn’t have the language to call queerness, but that she understood as some kind of signal that she wasn’t picking up elsewhere, that she wasn’t picking up in the immediate surroundings of the “real world” she existed within, and the straight world she existed within. And how she remembers almost making a promise to herself, whenever she would find these signals, these secret codes in the work that resonated with her, to look for that feeling in her adult life. </p>
<p id="tZFurk">When I read this, I had already been working on the movie, and it felt so eloquent, obviously [in] a different medium, you know? She’s not talking television, but it felt like exactly what the movie is trying to speak about, which is when you’re young, and you see a glimpse of something that cuts through in the way that feels, like Maddy says, more real than real life. What do you do with that? And to what degree do you reassess the life that you’re in, that does feel real, to make room for that kind of transmission?</p>

<p id="9oul03">I think the characters [in <em>TV Glow</em>] are very much haunted by that question. This question becomes more urgent as they get older, and they maybe do start to realize the true implications of the ways in which reality feels insufficient to them. And certainly for myself — like, yeah, obviously, I’m not trapped in a TV show, to the best of my knowledge. But I think I was unpacking some very personal things that I was working through.</p>
<p id="oCenUO"><strong>There have been a lot of conversations about the idea of representation in movies, but it’s very different to talk about people finding themselves in movies, TV, and art generally, and seeing things they may not realize are part of themselves until they see it on screen. I think </strong><em><strong>I Saw the TV Glow</strong></em><strong> is incredibly adept at showing that feeling. </strong></p>
<p id="av9G5d">I think on a very simple level, the concept of representation, the shallow identitarian representation, feels like mostly a tool of the oppressor. It’s like, <em>Who is the audience that is for?</em> I’m not sure that it’s for me, and trans people. We know we exist, you know? It’s for some kind of imagined idea of equality that will never actually exist, because we live in, like, a fundamentally evil, white-supremacist, capitalist hellscape.</p>
<p id="SQDsSc">But the idea of art creating possibility — or putting language to possibility — that previously felt either undefined or unimaginable feels to me like a form of representation, if you could even still call it that, that I could get behind. The idea of, like, a queer coming of age as something that’s inherently about creating unrealized or previously unrealized possibility, both on a personal and political level, and a piece of art that is speaking very honestly and personally about everything, that’s both liberatory and terrifying and difficult about that. I’m proud to have made that.</p>
<p id="HPPRHX"><strong>Why did you choose to center the story on Owen?  Was there ever a version that explored more of Maddy’s story?</strong></p>
<p id="widroH">I think if you’re thinking about, like, what’s-his-name’s Hero’s Journey shit, then Owen is the least interesting character, in that he doesn’t so much <em>grow</em> as he<em> decays.</em> Until perhaps at the very end of the movie he’s discovering or seeing something that explains the decay. And in this sense, he could be called, by, like, a hack studio executive, a passive narrator. </p>

<p id="nwNZCc">At the same time, I think that kind of “passivity” feels inherently tied to an experience that I — and I think many other trans folks — can relate to on a deeply visceral level. It indicates exactly how our ideas about what proper narrative or progress is is not only woefully limited in the experiences it’s showing, but also like maybe by definition, masculine and cis. [It’s] reflective of an idea of agency and individual agency that doesn’t resonate with other experiences, like my own. And so I am trying to rewrite or call into question or challenge or simply just like, exist within alternative ideas of narrative structure, to express something that feels emotionally truthful to my experience in the world. </p>
<p id="KzUUkc">I had a meeting with a really smart producer for this film. And he was like, <em>Listen, Owen is too passive. You need to rewrite this thing. Owen needs to be like, he got out of his home town and he’s coming back to visit, and all of these things are haunting him. This character is just a mess, and nobody wants to watch a mess.</em> </p>
<p id="WVC9yx">In fact, this producer told me, <em>Your audience is going to be convinced that Owen murdered Maddy, when Maddy disappears. Because you are playing against a century of Hollywood filmmaking about the reclusive, passive man who is secretly a psychopath, right?</em> Like the lineage of Norman Bates or <em>Peeping Tom</em>; the stuck-inside-himself, freak, passive, strange recluse, a character we should be viewing with suspicion. And I was so fascinated by this. I was like, <em>That’s a great point</em>. And really interesting from a trans perspective, because of course, Norman Bates was trans. And so I do think part of if it feels wrong to you, to be watching a character who is so stuck inside himself in the way Owen is. And for you to sit with that and question it as narratively incorrect, like, what presuppositions are you bringing to the table with that?</p>
<p id="mQ2zLO"><strong>Did you try to parallel and connect the suburbs as Owen experiences them and the world of </strong><em><strong>The</strong></em><strong> </strong><em><strong>Pink Opaque</strong></em><strong>? </strong></p>
<p id="u1KL3Q">There was an idea early on in the film that it all existed in sort of one realm, that the suburbs Owen exists within are heightened in the way that the suburbs were heightened in ’90s television. The suburbs <em>The</em> <em>Pink Opaque</em> is set within are some kind of reflection of that, or they’re all sort of occupying maybe the same solar system, but different planets, because the whole movie is sort of playing with the idea of the memory of an imagined ’90s suburban utopia, and also the memory of how the television of that time helped to create that idea.</p>

<p id="5wVwA1">And then I think what happens in the movie is, both the real world and the TV show transform as the movie goes on into something else, but they kind of transform in tandem, right? Owen’s world becomes a darker and more haunted place, as the show transforms from this very nostalgic, cheesy, VHS analog thing to something that feels more like a snuff film.</p>
<p id="2nWVZF"><strong>One thing I really enjoyed about your last two films is the way the outside world interacts with the things we see from the characters. How did you approach building that off-screen world for your characters, and developing the things we don’t see?</strong></p>
<p id="S04Z4v">I think it comes from an understanding that your real estate, when you’re making a film, is actually quite limited. You have 90 minutes, maybe, and if tempo and pace and restraint are important to you, as paints on your paintbrush, which they are for me, you really don’t have much time to smoosh in a lot of exposition.</p>
<p id="61f4gC">And beyond that, I’m skeptical of the ability of a work of art to explain anything. I think that narratively, if you see that Owen has an angry dad, then the “Angry Dad” becomes a stand-in for an explanation for something. Or if you see that Casey [in <em>We’re All Going to the World’s Fair</em>] is being bullied in school, then everything you’re seeing in the film becomes explained to a certain degree by this narrative choice. And it’s all constructed, right? Everything in there is a decision I’m making. For me, when we get too far from the margins into these expository zones, it almost becomes a way for me to interact with the viewer. </p>

<p id="WcdugB">I’m less interested in a psychological explanation of, <em>Oh, Owen’s life is like this because X</em>. I’m going for more: If I show you these three things, and then continue to explore what I’m exploring at the center of the film, what is your relationship to the exposition? Which is kind of heady, and, you know, maybe a little pretentious, but I do find that this kind of light touch makes films linger in ways that are more generative and evocative and long-lasting than if everything was able to be charted out and mapped out and explained. </p>
<p id="S2hRAW"><strong>What do you see as your own inspiration for that kind of storytelling and approach?</strong></p>
<p id="9Xqdi7">I am inherently suspicious of narrative, is probably where it comes from, and I think this is very apparent in my work. The work is so interested in narrative construction. <em>We’re All Going to the World’s Fair</em> explicitly is a film about narrative construction and a film about a character narrating themselves. And I think <em>TV Glow</em> similarly is a film that’s interested in how power mediates the narratives that we are able to exist within.</p>
<p id="4sBR8h">I do think there is this impulse in [my] movies to do a thing that’s a little bit intentionally frustrating, perhaps, to people who are used to a straightforward, narrative, commercial language of cinema, which is to be interrogating narrative design and narrative tropes as a limiting, potentially even nefarious mechanism.</p>
<p id="Zlf3dl">I think the work is not trying to necessarily satisfy. And I think a lot of American entertainment, its primary goal is to satisfy in a very shallow and short-term way. To give you an experience that feels like spectacle, or feels relaxing and satisfying enough immediately that you can then go on with your life and see the next thing that’s going to satisfy you.</p>

<p id="8RqjcG">That’s just not what gets me out of bed, in my art, you know; I want to be making things that are speaking to the world we live in. And I do think our relationship to entertainment, which is our relationship to, like, narrative or resolution, or as [cultural critic] Lauren Berlant would talk about, ideas of the good life, or Cruel Optimism that can only let you down in reality. All of these things are [what] I’m trying to leverage the art and the experience of the movie to be like, to be generative in a way that’s a little bit deeper than just [giving] you finely tuned, perfected, narrative satisfaction.</p>
<p id="EjsFAa"><strong>Is that something that resonates with you in other people’s work as well? </strong></p>
<p id="QUNwOH">It’s almost mandatory for me, especially in the film and television and written-word work I consume. Something like <em>The Sopranos</em>, maybe kind of a random example. But I feel like the entire purpose of that show was exactly this. [It] was about utilizing the TV form. All of these different episodes, each of them kind of flirting with progress, but never quite getting there, and always doubling back on itself until it’s finally over. That’s a perfect metaphor for speaking about the way life can feel. And I think so much of the art I’m drawn to, it’s not that it’s disinterested in the pleasure of narrative, or like the power of catharsis or arc, but it is utilizing those weapons toward a goal that’s more than just enjoyment.</p>

How often do you think about that movie and the stories you include in it? </strong></p>
<p id="WB4wAW">I think everything is an echo of everything else. And I think I did crack something with <em>Self-Induced Hallucination</em> that started a process I’m still very much a part of. I think my work has always been interested in this intersection point, this non-straightforward relationship between fiction and reality. And is it fiction that makes reality, or reality that makes fiction? Or is it something more complicated and interlinked? </p>
<p id="4tHBZn">I think about [that] all the time. Like that Tulpa kid, at the end of <em>Self-Induced Hallucination</em>. I think about this idea of something fictional that you understand on a certain level is fictional, being real enough to save your life. And I think about the ways those questions aren’t just a way to investigate the construction of identity, but are also a way to talk about this world we’ve built, and all of the ways in which it is both very real and very constructed. Like I was talking about earlier, the ways in which possibility could maybe be opened from the things that we consider “fiction.”</p>

In the early days of the saga, which Summoning Salt recounts with archival records of high scores in <em>Tetris</em> from sources like a 1992 issue of <em>Nintendo Power </em>and online chats from circa 2005, there was skepticism among players that a score of 999,999 was even possible. That’s because, when you reach level 29, the game begins moving so fast that it was clearly the programmers’ intended way of saying, “this is where the game ends”; playing (with normal methods anyway) just didn’t allow you to move the pieces fast enough to arrange them skillfully, so you were promptly met with a game over. Level 29 was dubbed the “killscreen” for that reason, even if it’s different from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_screen#:~:text=A%20kill%20screen%20is%20a,across%20the%20arcade%20machine's%20screen.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_screen#:~:text=A%20kill%20screen%20is%20a,across%20the%20arcade%20machine's%20screen." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">killscreens in other games</a></span> like arcade <em>Pac-Man </em>and <em>Donkey Kong </em>in which some sort of glitch or other oddity literally makes additional play impossible. And it wasn’t clear if it was even possible to rack up 999,999 points—the highest number the game’s score window could display—before reaching the killscreen and being forced to game over.<br></p><p>However, what follows over the video’s hour-and-50-minute runtime is so astounding and transformative that by the end, people’s perceptions of what’s possible in <em>Tetris </em>have been completely obliterated and remade, as new understandings of the game and approaches to playing it result in a total sea change. At one point, for instance, a shift in how players in the <em>Tetris </em>community hold and manipulate the NES controller completely destroys perceived barriers in just how far people can push the game. Suffice it to say that there’s no doubt any longer that people can reach scores way, way, <em>way </em>beyond 999,999 in NES <em>Tetris</em>. And just how we’ve gotten to this point is a story for the ages, packed not just with remarkable innovations and accomplishments, but new obstacles as well. For example, if you progress far enough in <em>Tetris</em>, the blocks will start having glitchy, unintended color palettes applied to them, some of which make the action very hard to see. It’s just one of those things you have to deal with when you push a game way past what the original programmers ever envisioned a player would achieve.<br></p><p>Don’t balk at that 110-minute runtime, either. It may sound like a lot of time to invest in a video about people making number go up in a video game, but there’s as much drama here as there is in an outstanding sports documentary. And one of the really exciting things about this story is that it’s not over yet. Shortly after Summoning Salt’s video was released, competitive <em>Tetris </em>player MylesTheGreat was streaming his own gameplay, but decided to call it a night. Just then, however, Summoning Salt himself piped up in chat. “One more!” he said. Reluctantly, Myles agreed, and—of course—had an absolutely amazing game, as you can see in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/xtrfxm8weXA?si=9kN1c-q8zqQ3EThu&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/xtrfxm8weXA?si=9kN1c-q8zqQ3EThu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this YouTube video of his</a></span>, appropriately titled “SummoningSalt Said ‘One More Game’ AND I BROKE TETRIS.” The story of <em>Tetris</em>’ past is absolutely bananas. Its future could be even wilder.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="210" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The iconic Kar98k sniper rifle is returning to <em>Call of Duty</em> in <em>Warzone</em> and <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>, but when will you be able to get your hands on this behemoth? I’ve got the official date so you can get ready. </p> <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">New weapons are added to <em>Call of Duty</em> every season, giving players new options to add to their loadouts. Usually, these new guns are pretty powerful, which makes unlocking and leveling them up necessary if you want to be a part of the meta. </p> <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">While Season 3 Reloaded added <em>Advanced Warfare</em>‘s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-bal-27-warzone-loadout-attachments-perks-and-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BAL-27</a>, we’re going further back into history for Season 4, with the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/looks-like-the-kar98k-is-set-to-return-in-mw3-and-warzone-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kar98k</a> sniper rifle making its <em>Modern Warfare 3 </em>debut. </p>

 <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="198" data-injectable="false">The gun will then be added to the game and will be unlocked either through the Battle Pass or a set of challenges, which will be confirmed when Activision drops the Season 4 blog before the update. </p> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true">Teasers for the Kar98k dropped on May 16, when content creators were sent packages advertising the new season, which included a toy car with the number 98 on it, the tagline “Bolt into action,” a scratch-off portion with the letter “K,” and a section on the back that indicates there are 98 of them in the world. Subtle, I know. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="false">The Kar98k was an extremely popular option in <em>Warzone Pacific</em> back in 2021, so it’ll be interesting to see how the new version stacks up. New guns generally dominate the meta to begin with, so I imagine we’ll be seeing people calling for nerfs on May 30. </p>

They always come back, don’t they? We’re here to keep you in the loop with the&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em>&nbsp;movie release date, potential returning cast, and teasers.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-when-does-five-nights-at-freddy-s-2-movie-come-out" data-injectable="false">When does Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 movie come out?</h2> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">The release date of the&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy’s&nbsp;2</em>&nbsp;film has been set for&nbsp;<strong>Dec. 5, 2025.&nbsp;</strong>Universal Pictures confirmed this exciting news, listing it on their <a href="https://www.universalpictures.com/upcoming-films" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming movie schedule</a>. The movie’s production company, Blumhouse, also <a href="https://x.com/jason_blum/status/1791200127149126116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">backed this date</a>, but as with any movie filming, delays are always a possibility.</p> <figure data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">The plot for&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em>&nbsp;remains a tantalizing mystery, adding to the intrigue and excitement. Will it continue where its predecessor left off, or dive into Freddy Fazbear’s deranged origins? The games have been known to play with time, so a prequel-esque storyline could be in the cards.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true">However, there are still many unanswered questions from the first film, centering around Mike, the newly-appointed night security guard of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria. We may better understand what happened to him and his family in the much-awaited sequel.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-five-nights-at-freddy-s-2-film-teasers" data-injectable="false">Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 film teasers</h2> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">Blumhouse has only revealed one teaser so far, where we get a glimpse of Jim Henson’s Creature Shop. Although it hasn’t&nbsp;been confirmed, they seem to be working on another sinister animatronic, Mangle. This infamous character was first introduced in the&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/find-the-fnaf-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video game</a>, showcasing a much more disfigured Foxy.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="239" data-injectable="false">Since Mangle is a part of the second entry in the&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy’s&nbsp;</em>series, it could be safe to say that the film will be tied to this game. Nevertheless, Blumhouse could still change things as they did with the first film.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-who-is-returning-for-five-nights-at-freddy-s-2-movie" data-injectable="false">Who is returning for Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 movie?</h2> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">While the official cast announcement&nbsp;is yet to come, there are strong indications that Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lillard may be reprising their roles. In a <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/five-nights-at-freddys-2-script-josh-hutcherson-1235863907/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>&nbsp;report, Hutcherson expressed his eagerness to return to the&nbsp;set, hinting at his possible involvement in the sequel.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false">Lillard also commented on the&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2&nbsp;</em>release date announcement. In an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/matthewlillard/p/C7C7W7aP5Ro/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram post</a>, he cryptically stated, “December 2025. I ALWAYS COME BACK.” This intriguing hint could indicate his return, but we won’t know for certain until Universal Pictures or Blumhouse unveils the cast details.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/report-call-of-duty-2024-will-come-to-xbox-game-pass-on-day-one/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has reportedly decided that, yes, Call of Duty 2024 will launch day and date into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>This is apparently something that Microsoft’s executives have been debating for some time – per <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango">The Verge</a> – but The Wall Street Journal is now reporting that they’ve made up their mind and will bring the next Call of Duty game straight into Game Pass when it launches later this year.</p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/30/xbox-games-showcase-and-a-redacted-direct-confirmed-for-june-9th/">The next Call of Duty is set to be revealed at Xbox Games Showcase on 9th June</a>, and is likely to be the game featured in the [Redacted] deep-dive stream that follows.</p>
<p>The hope is that this will be a major boost to Xbox Game Pass subscriber counts, across both Xbox and PC, and since COD will not be a platform exclusive for a long, long time, should preserve a lot of the overall profitability of the franchise with the majority of gamers still happy to buy the games outright on PlayStation in particular. A large portion of the money that Call of Duty makes also comes from the free-to-play Warzone game mode.</p>
<p>That reason means that some analysts, such as games industry analyst Daniel Ahmad, are all for it. He <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1791470465753518402">wrote</a>, “This is the right move for Microsoft because it’s a multi-platform title that is being sold for $70 outside of the subscription and because it’s a live service title with in game purchases. That model can also work for other Xbox first party games.”</p>

<p>However, this could still be a double-edged sword for Game Pass. It likely will boost subscriber counts, but how sticky will that be to keep people subscribed? Xbox and PC gamers might see this as an opportunity to pay for a trial or single month to get a quick fix of Call of Duty, before unsubscribing a month later, ultimately cutting a big chunk of the profit from all of those gamers, and potentially undermining the Xbox Game Pass project and business model in general. Worse would be if it fails to meaningfully move the needle, with the growth of subscriber counts having levelled off in the last couple years. One possible mitigation would be to have a higher priced tier specially for COD.</p>
<p>Of course, this should all be taken with a grain of salt. We can expect WSJ to have trustworthy sources, but we’re also a few weeks away from the 9th June showcase and Microsoft could very easily change their minds again between now and then.</p>
<p>The pressure is on the Xbox division and Microsoft’s gaming business to grow and be as profitable as possible, thanks to the almost $70 billion that Microsoft paid to acquire Activision Blizzard. Since that purchase was completed, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/25/microsoft-is-laying-off-a-staggering-1900-people-across-xbox-activision-zenimax/">Microsoft made major redundancies</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/15/four-xbox-games-are-coming-to-other-consoles-but-not-starfield-or-indy/">announced that they were bringing select Xbox exclusives to rival platforms</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">closed two beloved Bethesda studios</a>, and is reportedly planning for more games to arrive on PS5, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/15/report-more-xbox-games-coming-to-ps5-as-part-of-the-latitude-project/">nothing held back</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-coming-to-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-2024-coming-to-game-pass-is-a-done-deal-according-to-the-wall-street-journal.874107/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-coming-to-game-pass/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Is <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty</a> coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a>? When Microsoft first began pursuing it’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, many assumed using Call of Duty to bolster Game Pass was one of their goals, but things have changed since then. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-ps-plus-gaming-subscriptions-up-only-1-percent-year-on-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Pass growth has slowed</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-falls-fall-short-of-microsoft-growth-targets-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">badly missing growth targets</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-unlikely-more-than-10-to-15-percent-of-microsoft-gaming-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox boss Phil Spencer has admitted there’s a ceiling to its success</a>. While some Activision Blizzard games like Diablo IV have been added to Game Pass, recent reports suggested that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-still-evaluating-whether-to-put-cod-on-game-pass-and-a-game-pass-price-increase-hellblade-ii-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft was still “evaluating”</a> whether to do the same with the headliner that is Call of Duty.</p>
<p>Well, it seems the big decision may have been made. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/microsoft-call-of-duty-game-pass-53e8930c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to a new report from the Wall Street Journal</a>, Microsoft will indeed be bringing 2024’s entry in the Call of Duty franchise to Game Pass. This should be announced next month at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big Xbox Games Showcase</a>. Of course, Microsoft has not confirmed this, so take it with a grain of salt for now, but the Wall Street Journal isn’t in the business of spreading baseless rumors.</p>
<p>Needless to say, putting Call of Duty on Game Pass is a major risk for Microsoft. As we recently heard from former 343 Industries PR head Brad Hilderbrand, releasing titles on Game Pass on Day 1 <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-miss-sales-goal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causes them to “badly miss” sales targets</a>. Now, to some degree, the damage might be contained if Game Pass was only on Xbox, but this also has the potential to hurt PC sales. It should also be mentioned, that during the lengthy Acti-Blizz acquisition process, Phil Spencer hinted <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-ps-plus-playstation-7-spencer-no-forever-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’d be up for CoD on PlayStation Plus, too</a>. All that said, if Microsoft is still committed to Game Pass as an idea, maybe it’s time to throw that ultimate Hail Mary. It’s going to be hard to stuff this genie back in the bottle if it doesn’t work out though.</p>
<p>For those who haven’t been keeping up with the series, this year’s Call of Duty is being developed by Treyarch and is expected to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-gulf-war-rumor-early-access-period-unusually-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continuation of the Black Ops franchise set during the Gulf War</a>. In other words, this ought to be a pretty big entry in the series, and a heck of a way to potentially launch the “CoD on Game Pass” era.</p>
<p>The Xbox Games Showcase where the next Call of Duty will be revealed takes place on June 9. What do you think? Is bringing Call of Duty to Game Pass a good move or is Microsoft strangling the golden goose? If it happens, will you still pay for CoD or go the Game Pass route?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158944/college-football-25-trailer-gameplay-modes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Commki">With the release of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157717/college-football-25-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-x-ea-sports"><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em></a> just two months away, we’ve now got our first glimpse of what the game looks like in action, courtesy of a proper trailer that publisher Electronic Arts released Friday morning.</p>
<p id="1DtOwo">Transitioning from Guns N’ Roses’ original recording of “Welcome to the Jungle” — a quintessential hype-up-the-fans song — into a marching band version is a very nice touch in this trailer. And it plays over footage of storied college football traditions from all over the country: unique team entrances (with, for the first time, real names on the backs of jerseys), mascots getting everyone into a frenzy, and crowds singing fight songs. It’s clear that developer EA Tiburon has gone to great lengths to bring the game-day atmosphere of college football to life in <em>College Football 25</em>.</p>
<p id="hrpALY">EA also revealed the first details about <em>College Football 25</em>’s modes and gameplay, confirming the return of the fan-favorite franchise and career modes — Dynasty and Road to Glory, respectively — as well as a new competitive offering called Road to the College Football Playoff. In that mode, players can choose a school and work toward winning a national championship by progressing through divisions and earning rank. In a way, its existence can be seen as a nod to the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24074774/ea-sports-college-football-25-teaser-trailer">11-year gap between EA’s college football games</a>: The College Football Playoff wasn’t a thing when EA released <em>NCAA Football 14</em> back in 2013. And, yes, EA’s microtransaction-based fantasy team setup, Ultimate Team, figures to be a major part of the game, especially now that EA can use players’ real names.</p>

<p id="2A4qm4">College football doesn’t look the same on the field as the NFL, and EA Tiburon is touting some new gameplay features this year to differentiate the action not just in general, but on a team-by-team basis, with a gamified version of home-field advantage. If you’re taking Ohio State into the Big House for a showdown with the Wolverines, expect “distractions like screen shaking, missing pre-play icons, and moving play art,” according to EA. The developers are also introducing a wear-and-tear system that will force you to manage fatigue and make the right substitutions at the right times to prevent players from becoming tired (and making mistakes).</p>
<p id="mMrwGc">Off the field, EA is bringing back a bunch of veterans from ESPN’s college football broadcasts for audio commentary in <em>College Football 25</em>. Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbstreit will call “marquee matchups,” said EA, while Rece Davis, Jesse Palmer, and David Pollack will handle all other games.</p>
<p id="wZPSh3"><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> will be released July 19 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. While EA is also pairing it with <em>Madden NFL 25</em> (which is scheduled for an Aug. 16 debut) in a package called the MVP Bundle, there’s no word yet on whether there will be any cross-game functionality between the two.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/early-look-at-valve%E2%80%99s-new-hero-shooter-deadlock-leaks.874101/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158960/valve-deadlock-hero-shooter-leak<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="qSDUJK">A new multiplayer hero shooter reportedly in development at Valve leaked Thursday in the form of gameplay details and early screenshots of the project, known as <em>Deadlock</em>. The new game is described as a blend of Valve’s own <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/8/15/16151674/dota-2-review"><em>Dota 2</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23178358/valve-team-fortress-2-update-bots-fan-campaign"><em>Team Fortress 2</em></a>, as well as competing multiplayer games like <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Smite</em>, and <em>Orcs Must Die</em>.</p>
<p id="5Aqqy7">Longtime Valve researcher and dataminer <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285">Tyler McVicker published the in-game screenshots on X</a>, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. McVicker said the images were shared by <em>Deadlock</em> playtesters, and show <em>Dota 2</em>-style heroes battling on “steampunk European city” maps. One of those maps has fast-travel lanes; players can ride quickly across the maps using “floating rails, similar to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/3/25/4064448/bioshock-infinite-review-above-and-below"><em>BioShock Infinite</em></a>,” McVicker said.</p>
<p id="VyYzLu"><a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791110448114188557">McVicker said that <em>Deadlock</em> is Valve’s next game</a>, and that it was in development under previous names <em>Neon Prime</em> and <em>Citadel</em>. He describes it as a competitive, third-person, hero-based shooter, with two teams of six heroes — a mix of “magicians, weird creatures, and robots” — battling each other. <em>Deadlock</em> also reportedly features tower defense game mechanics.</p>
<div id="zxtgvt">
<blockquote data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since testers started sharing Deadlock screenshots all over the place, here's ones I can verify, featuring one of the heroes called Grey Talon. <a href="https://t.co/KdZSRxObSz">pic.twitter.com/KdZSRxObSz</a></p>— ‎Gabe Follower (@gabefollower) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2024</a>
</blockquote>


</div>
<p id="id__nk6rhc27g6">Screenshots of <em>Deadlock</em> hint at MOBA-inspired elements like bases and guardians that heroes would attack, and collectible orbs that may offer power-ups to abilities. All of that is, of course, subject to change, as <em>Deadlock</em> has not been officially announced.</p>
<p id="CKBotb">McVicker reported that <em>Deadlock</em> was initially styled as a sci-fi game “inspired by Half-Life and Portal,” but feedback to the game’s aesthetic pushed Valve to “focus on fantasy.” He also published artwork and a character description of a hero from the game, also apparently named Deadlock. Valve has reportedly been working on <em>Deadlock</em> since 2018.</p>
<p id="at7MuA">Polygon has reached out to Valve to confirm details on <em>Deadlock</em> and will update when the company responds.</p>

<p id="0WUYOT">Valve boss and co-founder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210125102049/https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/realistic-possibility-48m-e-sports-tournament-could-held-in-nz-says-gaming-tycoon-gabe-newell">Gabe Newell said in 2021</a> that his company has multiple games in development. Last September, Valve shipped one of those games, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23889113/counter-strike-2-release-date-steam-cs2-launch"><em>Counter-Strike 2</em></a>, a replacement for its extremely popular first-person shooter, <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>, originally released in 2012. Newell also intimated in 2021 that there was “a lot of momentum inside of the company” to develop more single-player games in the wake of shipping <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/3/23/21188169/half-life-alyx-review-rift-half-life-3-valve-index-vive-virtual-reality"><em>Half-Life: Alyx</em></a> in 2020.</p>
<p id="Y2ZHlb">For now, though, it appears that Valve’s interests lie in multiplayer and blending the gameplay of its most popular team-based games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158948/endless-legend-strategy-game-free-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="m2dx6N">It’s time to do a bit of casual Friday colonizing (virtually). <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/8/27/4664212/endless-space-dev-expanding-with-fantasy-sequel-and-roguelike-side">Amplitude Studios</a>, the Parisian game studio known for strategy games, is giving away its acclaimed game <em>Endless Legend </em>for free on Steam. Starting on Thursday and running until May 23, interested players can download the entire game for free on Steam. </p>
<p id="fpiTuZ">The deal is an absolute steal. Usually, the game costs  $29.99 at full price. Now all you have to do is go to the Steam page to get it for free. Just proceed as if you were buying any other game on the platform. The Steam version is available to play on Windows PC and Mac OS. </p>
<p id="CPvCnm"><em>Endless Legend</em> is a top-down 4X game (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) in which players defeat opponents by harvesting resources and building military units and additional support buildings. The game is complicated <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/7/22/5924649/endless-legend-steam-preview">and a bit imbalanced</a> — and intentionally so. The developers created the game so that each play-through would have variation. Each race’s basic unit has several stats and special powers that makes them unique, so that players wouldn’t face units with identical stats to their own. </p>
<p id="G9uFO8">Amplitude Studios originally published the game to Steam in 2014. At the time, <em>Endless Legend</em> helped bring a new layer of complexity to the turn-based strategy genre. So if you want to have a try at long-beloved strategy game, now is your chance.</p>

<p>Where were you when Grand Theft Auto V hit store shelves? The initial launch in 2013 was one of the most hype video game releases of the time. It brought out the masses at GameStop for a midnight release, which was still a thing then. Here we are, waiting for the next title, but more than a decade later. So, how long has GTA 6 been in development?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-did-gta-6-development-begin">When Did GTA 6 Development Begin?</h2>



<p>A few years ago, it was revealed that <strong>GTA 6 development started in 2014, just one year after the launch of GTA V and GTA Online</strong>. Unlike past titles, however, Rockstar Games intends to tread carefully with its upcoming Grand Theft Auto storyline. It wants to avoid trampling on marginalized groups through the series’ long-standing trend of occasionally harsh jokes.</p>



<p>We’ll likely see some significant overhaul to Grand Theft Auto Online with Grand Theft Auto VI, though nothing has yet been confirmed about the multiplayer component. Every GTA since Grand Theft Auto IV has featured some form of multiplayer, from small lobbies in Liberty City to the massive scale of GTA Online over the past decade. Hey, maybe they’ll go full MMO?!</p>







<h2 id="h-who-are-the-main-characters-in-gta-6">Who Are the Main Characters in GTA 6?</h2>



<p>We know the game features two main characters: <strong>Lucia </strong>and <strong>Jason</strong>. We’ve seen more of Lucia, a Latina criminal who will take the leading role in the upcoming Grand Theft Auto game. Jason, on the other hand, appears less often in marketing materials. He’ll likely provide the old-school GTA experience that so many players are accustomed to.</p>



<p>Furthermore, there’s no indication that we’ll see Michael de Santa, Franklin, or Trevor in Grand Theft Auto 6, unfortunately. None of the three previous protagonists were shown off in the trailer, though it’s not out of the realm of possibility. I can see Michael or Franklin appearing in Leonida to lay low from the heat in San Andreas.</p>



<hr>



<p>We have a long way to go until the GTA 6 release date, so why not join Insider Gaming as we cover the hottest new and upcoming releases:</p>

<p>EA Sports College Football 25 is set to release on July 19 for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5, and EA Sports took Friday to announce all of the game’s features <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date-and-cover-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after revealing its cover</a> on Thursday.</p>



<p>As previously known, the game will include modes you expect like Dynasty, Road to Glory, Ultimate Team, and a Road to the College Football Playoff. But now we have more details on what each mode will offer players when they load up the first college football game in 11 years.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="College Football 25 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W1QDaXkufCo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Dynasty Mode will see you “create a coach and build a powerhouse college football program from the ground up. Establish your coaching staff, recruit the best talent, utilize the transfer portal, and watch your program ascend to the sport’s pantheon.”</p>



<p>Moving on to Road to Glory, players will “live the life of a student-athlete”. With a created players, you’ll have to manage your schedule, GPA, and overall image as you work to become a Heisman Trophy winner. You’ll work to built coach trust to get extra playing time or even transfer if you aren’t getting the time you feel you deserve.</p>



<p>Ultimate Team is exactly what you’d expect from an EA Sports title. Collect players to build the best team you can and play with it either online or offline, completing challenges to earn rewards. </p>



<p>Lastly, the Road to the College Football Playoff lets you “experience a new way to play competitively and represent your favorite team in the Road to the College Football Playoff.”  You’ll take your team against tougher opponents in order to move up the poll and make it to the playoff.</p>







<p>As part of College Football 25, EA Sports is bringing in “iconic atmospheres” that fans have seen for years across the sport. </p>



<p>“With traditional team run-outs, rivalry rituals, synchronized crowd-chants, loudness meters as well as real game-day audio, fight songs and, of course, mascots, it’ll feel like home everywhere you look,” EA Sports says.</p>



<p>Presentation wise, Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbstreit call the action of the biggest games. Rece Davis, David Pollack, and Jesse Palmer will be the team for other games.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-campusiq-gameplay">The CampusIQ Gameplay</h2>



<p>In the game EA Sports introduces its CampusIQ gameplay system. This system, the company says, will offer “true college gameplay” no matter the teams on the field.</p>



<p>“Powered by a wide range of player ratings that fluctuate throughout a game, team tiers, and new in-game passing mechanics, EA SPORTS™ College Football 25 delivers strategic, fast-paced gameplay reflecting the true depth of college football,” they said.</p>



<p>The game also features a “wear &amp; tear system” that has you managing a player’s health and doing what you can to limit potential injuries and fatigue. There’s also a homefield advantage system that will have players facing “various levels of distractions like screen shaking, missing pre-play icons, and moving play art.”</p>



<p>College Football 25 is <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/buy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available to pre-order</a> today.</p>

While Xbox executives have insisted sales can be boosted by a game’s presence on Game Pass, some publishers remain unconvinced.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-asian-protagonist<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ubisoft has finally announced its long-awaited <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">Assassin’s Creed game set in feudal Japan</a>. Subtitled Shadows, it follows dual protagonists – a ninja named Naoe and a samurai based on the historical <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/who-is-yasuke-assassins-creed-shadows-black-samurai-explained">Black samurai Yasuke</a>.</p><p>While it’s a known issue that Asian representation in Western games is severely lacking, I find it hypocritical and laughable that we’re only talking about the need for an Asian protagonist now that it’s been revealed Assassin’s Creed Shadows <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-racism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will star a Black samurai</a>. This misses the forest for the trees. While I am always advocating for more Asian men in AAA games, I’ll be the first to say that better representation <em>isn’t</em> going to be found in yet another samurai hero.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/15/assassins-creed-shadows-40-details-1715771281424.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>You can't pretend to want Asian representation by asking for another samurai. Credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><h2><strong>Enough With the Samurais</strong></h2><p>Ubisoft deciding to focus on Yasuke — <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-yasuke-japans-first-black-samurai-180981416/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a known historical figure</a> — is a smart move. An Assassin’s Creed game set in Japan that otherwise would have been, frankly, hard to distinguish from some other recent open-world samurai games. And if I wanted to see an Asian samurai protagonist I don’t have to look very hard.</p><p>Asian samurai protagonists are a path already well-trodden. There’s Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Katana Zero, Like A Dragon: Ishin!, Samurai Warriors, Rise of the Ronin, Onimusha, Way of the Samurai, Way of the Samurai 2, Ghost of Tsushima… There’s also my personal favorite, Muramasa: The Demon Blade. I can go on and on. So it’s difficult to come to any other conclusion than that the limited imagination of AAA game development can only envision Asian heroes when they wield katanas or ninja stars.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If I wanted to see an Asian samurai protagonist I don’t have to look very hard.</p></div><p>Worse still, the complex characters that were so wonderfully brought to life in shows like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shogun-review-fx-hulu">Shogun</a> are often distilled into their simplest forms in games, especially those created by Western studios. While Japanese developer-led titles like Sekiro and Like a Dragon: Ishin utilize their samurai protagonists to tell nuanced stories about overcoming fantastical challenges, or provide a glimpse of street-level heroics in Edo Japan, the Western-developed games fail to hit a similar level of complexity, often falling back on tired tropes of honor and stoicism. </p><p>And that’s only accounting for games that try to tell a story using their samurai protagonist. More often than not the samurai archetype is a vehicle for combat first, eschewing any kind of narrative flavor for a cool sword and top-knot. Consider hero games like Overwatch that feature two kinds of samurai, and a ninja, for their Japanese cast. And all flowers to Ghost of Tsushima for its beautifully rendered open world and combat, but Jin Sakai has about as much charisma as a wet piece of cloth.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/03/06/ghostthumb-1709741324538.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Second verse. Same as the first. Credit: Sucker Punch.</figcaption></figure></output><h2><strong>Wow, Cool Sword</strong></h2><p>The main grievance I have as an Asian American in games in regards to representation isn’t the lack of it — as evidenced by the Wikipedia page full of Asian fighters and ninjas and samurais — but rather is the lack of <em>diversity</em> therein. I’ve reported previously in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/asian-american-game-developers-experience-minari">story about Asian American game devs</a> and representation, we are not a monolith and I, a Korean-American, don’t gain a sense of representation by seeing a Japanese samurai, or a Japanese ninja, or a kung-fu master or ancient gray-haired mystic for that matter.</p><p>Of course, all of this comes with the caveat that it is the nature of AAA game development to focus on “cool” characters with wide appeal. Samurais and ninjas <em>are </em>cool, and their tools and weapons lend themselves to big action blockbusters, so is it surprising that such characters become the default? Maybe not, but after so many games it’s still disappointing to see how little chances these stories take with these characters. </p><p>Given the Assassin’s Creed franchise’s history-jumping concept, we could have our cake and eat it too with a little effort. Why settle for another samurai hero when the franchise could easily go to the Mongol Empire, or post-revolution China? Or even the Pacific Theater in World War II, which was a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/39408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hotbed of counter-imperial espionage led by Asians?</a></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I don’t want to see us have the roles we’re expected to have. I want the roles we’ve not had before.</p></div><p>This problem of only defaulting to a katana-wielding Asian protagonist isn’t exclusive to Western studios as both Capcom and Square Enix often choose to rely on Asian heroes only when they need a samurai or ninja. But even then, Japan and other Asian studios are still more forward thinking than their Western counterparts on who can be the face of their games. </p><p>It’s ironic, but Tango Gameworks is responsible for what I think has been the best Asian protagonist in games in the often overlooked Ghostwire: Tokyo. It’s a game set in modern-day Tokyo with a 21st century Asian protagonist whose responsibilities lay with his dying sister. There isn’t a feudal lord and, honestly, it’s everything I could’ve asked for from a AAA game project with an Asian lead. Not to mention the work Sega and Atlus have done with games like Yakuza, Persona, and Shin Megami Tensei who portray modern characters in unique settings.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/ghostwire-tokyo-header-scaled-1715919770631.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>More of this. Credit: Tango Gameworks, Bethesda</figcaption></figure></output><h2><strong>We Mustn’t Be Afraid to Dream a Little Bigger</strong></h2><p>I find comments saying that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a missed opportunity to represent even more Asian protagonists embarrassing. As an Asian man, I don’t want to see us have the roles we’re expected to have. I want the roles we’ve not had before. I would love for the next Alan Wake-style horror game to have an Asian protagonist, or for Star Wars to follow in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-acolyte-showrunner-on-how-squid-game-solved-one-of-her-key-casting-challenges">The Acolyte and have an Asian lead</a>.</p><p>When I push for greater diversity in games it’s not so that the next AAA samurai game will star an Asian protagonist, it’s so that the next Naughty Dog game, or the next Hideo Kojima game, or hell, even a Final Fantasy game, could imagine an Asian hero. </p><p><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/disgraceful-degradation-this-week-in-business<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p><em>This Week in Business is <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/topics/this-week-in-business">our weekly recap column</a>, a collection of stats and quotes from recent stories presented with a dash of opinion (sometimes more than a dash) and intended to shed light on various trends. Check every Friday for a new entry.</em></p>
<p>
This week, we reported on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-government-responds-to-stop-killing-games-campaign">the UK government's response to a petition</a> from <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a>, a grassroots campaign organized by YouTuber Ross Scott that's trying to get publishers to, well, stop killing games.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, the campaign wants to make sure that games like The Crew, which Ubisoft effectively snuffed from existence when it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-pulls-over-the-crew">shut down the online servers in March</a>, are preserved not just for the customers who paid money for them but for future generations as well.
</p>
<p>
And while nobody's asking companies to continue supporting online games forever at their own expense, Stop Killing Games would like to see publishers required to do more than they are currently. Or at the very least, force them to clearly commit to supporting a game through a specific date when they sell it, and include that expiration date on the packaging and other marketing materials. (This was the same course of action we advocated for when we <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-gives-gran-turismo-sport-the-boot-this-week-in-business">addressed the topic in this space in January</a>.)
</p>
<p>
The UK petition – which is <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/659071/">still available to be signed</a> – is focused less on the expiration date and more on publishers basically not being jerks about it when they drop support for a game.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "Require publishers to leave videogames (and related game assets / features) they have sold to customers in a reasonably working state when support ends, so that no further intervention whatsoever is necessary for the game to function, as a statutory consumer right." – What the Stop Killing Games petition asks for.
</p>
<p>
The government has already responded, and its response is not terribly encouraging. It starts off by saying there's no law saying companies have to support older versions of software, and adds that running servers for old games with declining user bases can be expensive. It then notes that publishers still need to follow existing consumer rights laws.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "The [2008 Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations] require information to consumers to be clear and correct, and prohibit commercial practices which through false information or misleading omissions cause the average consumer to make a different choice, for example, to purchase goods or services they would not otherwise have purchased." – The UK government explains what publishers need to be mindful of when it comes to server shutdowns.
</p>
<p>
That reads to me like the government believes current industry practices are fine, and as long as a game has a note about an "internet connection required" or something on the package – as The Crew did – that's probably good enough.
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind I'm not a lawyer and don't live in the UK. And while I have worked with a number of UK citizens over the years, when I send them several thousand words about innovations in grocery store refrigerators for proofreading and they reply back that it was "interesting," I still take it as a compliment. I should probably not be trusted to understand the English language when it's being used by the actual English.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/coolerscreen2.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>I like in scary movies when early on they disturb your sense of normalcy with a blurry and fleeting glimpse of the horrors to come.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Even so, there's another bit in the government response to reinforce my interpretation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "If consumers are led to believe that a game will remain playable indefinitely for certain systems, despite the end of physical support, the CPRs may require that the game remains technically feasible (for example, available offline) to play under those circumstances."
</p>
<blockquote>Publishers benefit tremendously from the erosion of ownership and ongoing support we've seen in the industry for decades now.</blockquote>
<p>
So long as publishers don't foster an expectation that the game will be playable forever before pulling the plug, there's no problem. That's a pretty low bar for them to clear, and it means the publishers benefit tremendously from the erosion of ownership and ongoing support we've seen in the industry for decades now. 
</p>
<p>
If someone sold an Atari 2600 game in the early 1980s and every cartridge sold was designed to become unplayable six months after purchase, you can bet consumer rights laws would have applied there because players would have assumed they would have permanent access because that was basically the only way people understood games existing at the time. The customer would have been led to believe in the game's continued playability the same way they were led to believe in object permanence as a baby.
</p>
<p>
But games have routinely seen servers for multiplayer modes go dark for years now, and they've been joined by plenty of free-to-play mobile games and MMOs being shut down entirety.
</p>
<p>
Publishers like Ubisoft have taken advantage of that by producing games that should belong in the former category – a game that loses its multiplayer functionality when the servers get shut down – and move them to the latter category – a game that does not exist without servers. </p>
<p>After all, the limited resource publishers are fighting over in a games-as-a-service world is players' time, so it's not in a company's interest to let customers spend their time playing an older game that does not provide a continuous stream of money, especially when it would rather those old players pony up again for newer games built around current best practices for maximized monetization.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "The Crew Motorfest continues to outperform The Crew 2 on acquisition, activity, monetization and net bookings metrics on a comparable basis since launch thanks to its quality seasonal, monthly and weekly activities. The franchise quadrupled its net bookings year-on-year, leading to record net bookings." – In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisofts-reports-record-bookings-for-2023">its earnings report this week</a>, Ubisoft this week touted the tremendous performance of the recently released The Crew Motorfest during the same quarter it shut down the servers for The Crew.
</p>
<p>
I will concede that The Crew sunsetting is pretty far down on the list of reasons Motorfest is doing well. But it doesn't really matter where on that list it is, because as we established the last time we talked about this, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-gives-gran-turismo-sport-the-boot-this-week-in-business#:~:text=QUOTE%20%7C%20%22My%20first,than%20a%20requirement.">the game runs locally off the disc just fine</a>. Ubisoft placed an unnecessary limitation on a product that consumers bought. It is financially incentivized to place this kind of limitations on all of its games going forward, and is doing so with Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin's Creed Shadows, two single-player games whose <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-physical-version-of-assassins-creed-shadows-requires-an-online-connection-to-install/">physical copies will require online connections in order to install them</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>If publishers were pursuing a future driven by planned obsolescence, would their behavior right now be any different?</blockquote>
<p>
Let's assume the worst for now and say that evil, greedy publishers are trying to push the gaming business into one of purely planned obsolescence, where customers have to constantly fork over more money to them or be denied the ability to enjoy their purchases. If that were the end goal, would their behavior right now be any different?
</p>
<p>
They have pushed and prodded the industry in this direction for years, ocassionally overstepping and drawing backlash as with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/always-online-simcity-burns-to-the-ground-10-years-ago-this-month">the always-online SimCity</a> or <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dont-like-always-online-consoles-dealwithit-10-years-ago-this-month">the Xbox One's original restrictions on used games</a>, but never waiting too long before resuming the push for ever-greater control over the gaming experience, control that coincidentally happens to restrain what players can do with games they purchase.
</p>
<p>
If the law as it stands currently allows for such a plan to effectively undermine consumer rights, maybe the law needs to be changed.
</p>
<p>
As of this writing, <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/659071/">the Stop Killing Games petition has more than 23,000 signatures</a>. If it can make it to 100,000 signatures by October 16, it will be considered for debate in Parliament. 
</p>
<p>
Stop Killing Games has also initiated similar petitions in <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/e-petitions/petition/EN6080">Australia</a> (where the deadline to sign is this coming Monday) and <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/petitions/en/Petition/Details?Petition=e-4965">Canada</a> (where signatures can be collected until the morning of September 5).

<h2>Letting Cooler-heads prevail</h2>
<p>
Bear with me for a minute while I talk about Cooler Screens.
</p>
<p>
If you've never seen these before, they're basically the coolers from a grocery store refrigerated or frozen food section, but with the glass door replaced by a TV monitor showing pictures of the products inside.
</p>
<p>
Why would a customer want a TV monitor instead of a glass door on its coolers? Let's ask Cooler Screens.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "The <strong>consumer</strong> is our inspiration. We create an experience that <strong>engages hearts and minds</strong>. We connect with people <strong>emotionally</strong> and inform them <strong>intellectually</strong>, sparking <strong>curiosity</strong> and rewarding them in the moment." <em>[All emphasis in original]</em> – The <a href="https://www.coolerscreens.com/consumer-experience/">official Cooler Screens website</a>, getting a bit grandiose in its mission to show people what's in the cooler section, but in a slightly different way than glass doors did.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/coolerscreen4.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Pictured: A woman whose heart and mind have been engaged by a fridge door. She has connected with the fridge door emotionally <em>and</em> intellectually. She has fallen in love with the fridge door, and it loves her back. She is never leaving this Walgreens.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
But surely there's more? Ah yes, here's <a href="https://www.coolerscreens.com/faqs/">the Cooler Screens FAQ</a>, which as promised contains what must be the single most frequently asked question about Cooler Screens.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "How is the Cooler Screens experience a better shopping experience for me or for others?"
</p>
<p>
Great, exactly what we're looking for. Now to read just a little bit further to find the answer…
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "Cooler Screens is a better shopping experience."
</p>
<p>
Oh, well OK then. 
</p>
<blockquote>"Cooler Screens is a better shopping experience"<cite>Cooler Screens</cite></blockquote>
<p>
In all fairness, it also says Cooler Screens "bring shopping ease, relevance, and transparency," but it's not like glass made shopping difficult or showed you irrelevant things. As for that last one, how are you going to compete on transparency with glass? It's <em>glass</em>, for cryin' out loud!
</p>
<p>
I fail to see how Cooler Screens are an improvement in any way, but that might just be a "me" problem. After all, Cooler Screens says it paid for studies that showed that 90% of consumers did not prefer the traditional glass cooler doors, from which it jumps to the conclusion of people "confirming a strong preference" instead of confirming that people don't give a flying Beef Merlot Café Steamer about what tech the door uses; they just want to see what their options are.
</p>
<p>
I'm not ruling out the idea that some people prefer Cooler Screens. We're more used to seeing screens when we eat TV dinners than when we buy them, so perhaps it just feels like a fancier shopping experience, like that one grocery store I went to as a kid that had a talking soda vending machine. For an eight-year-old kid, that thing was certifiably neato, and I was definitely asking my parents to let get me a Coke whenever we went there just to hear the computerized voice tell me how much money I had put in with each coin.
</p>
<p>
But there are very few stores that would think it's worth investing in such an expensive thing just for the neato factor and a few extra purchases from kids nagging their parents, so of course there's a different pitch for the retailers that install these. For them, Cooler Screens notes that there are cameras and sensors on the coolers, and it promises "AI-driven merchandising" and "interactive experiences" that are "guided by real-time connected data and signals from consumer interactions."
</p>
<p>
Yup, it's ads. Just ads.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@donwitmadness/video/7278465290172910894">a truly absurd amount of ads</a>. And when those ads are playing, customers of course <em>can't see what's actually inside the cooler</em>.
</p>
<p>
Once again, a start-up company has been inspired to move the world a few steps closer to a sci-fi film dystopia (Idiocracy or Minority Report, take your pick) in the name of finding yet another crevice of our lives to cram full to bursting with advertising.

<p>
The whole thing is awful and gross, but why are we talking about it on a video game site? Well as I see it, Cooler Screens have a lot in common with the games industry of late.
</p>
<p>
Much like the generally underwhelming features publishers use to justify superfluous always-online requirements, Cooler Screens are something technologically novel that might intrigue consumers, but offer them very modest benefits in reality. However, the benefits to the companies shoehorning such requirements into games are considerably greater.</p>
<p>They gain control over the play experience that they formerly had to give up back when customers could actually own things. They gain additional insight into how people play their games, which can absolutely be used to improve the player experience, but in a games-as-a-service world that insight is more likely to applied to optimize for monetization and engagement instead of actual player enjoyment. And of course, they get to serve constantly updated ads, either for outside products or for their own add-ons and pricing promotions.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes companies don't even bother to make an argument as to how adding burdens to the player experience is ultimately beneficial, such as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-backtracks-on-helldivers-2-psn-log-in-requirement">Sony's ill-advised attempts to mandate PlayStation Network accounts for the PC versions of Helldivers 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/oculus-devices-to-require-facebook-accounts-to-log-in">Facebook disabling Oculus headsets unless their owners created a Facebook account</a> (and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/deleting-facebook-wipes-out-oculus-purchases">deleting your Oculus purchases</a> if you ever decided to delete your Facebook account), or <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/nintendo-updates-take-wii-u-hostage-until-you-agree-new-legal-terms">Nintendo bricking their customers' Wii U systems until they agreed to a new end-user licensing agreement</a>.
</p>
<p>
Throw in the aforementioned connectivity requirements for both software and hardware and it's not hard to see how publishers have consistently pushed over the years in search of an ever-increasing amount of control over the user experience and more palatable forms of DRM. (Depending on your assessment of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/according-to-experts-on-kernel-level-anticheat-two-things-are-abundantly-clear-1-its-not-perfect-and-2-its-not-going-anywhere/">kernal-level anti-cheat systems</a>, perhaps they can be included here as another example of publisher over-reach.)
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/cooler-screen-denim.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Our friend has returned from the hidden world behind the Cooler Screen, but he has changed. He no longer smiles. His curiosity is no longer sparked. He now has but one desire, one command constantly reverberating through his mind: MORE DENIM</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Almost all of these moves offer some nominal benefit to the end user, but considerably greater benefit (and control) to the game publisher. It's much the same with blockchain, augmented reality, and other such hyped new tech that comes with flashy promises and possibly a neat tech demo, but offers few explanations for why their way of doing things is fundamentally better than what can be achieved with existing tech. A lot of the current wave of AI hype belongs in here too. These innovations can all be eye-catching, at least until the novelty wears off, but they often fall woefully short when it comes to articulating concrete, practical and compelling benefits for the end user.
</p>
<p>
And it's not just that they don't have compelling benefits; in many cases, they have significant drawbacks that companies simply don't bother accounting for.

</p>
<p>
That basic idea is the concept of graceful degradation, designing things in such a way that when various bits stop working, users can still use it for other purposes that weren't entirely reliant on those bits. In some ways, video games are pretty good at this. Most of those aforementioned dead multiplayer modes will give users a "server could not be reached" message after a certain amount of time and let them go back to enjoying the rest of the game. And entire fields like QA and speedrunning are predicated on things in software not going as the designers intended while the remaining parts truck on regardless.
</p>
<p>
In other ways, video games are terrible at this. And not just garden variety terrible, but Cooler Screens terrible.
</p>
<h2>
So what happens when a Cooler Screen breaks?
</h2>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/coolerscreenbroke.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>One situation where Cooler Screens really will spark curiosity, albeit mostly curiosity along the lines of "What were they thinking?"</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The picture above was posted a few months ago by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1am2i6j/cooler_screens_broke_so_they_hung_shitty_pictures/">Reddit user Chriscuits</a>, who explained that employees in the store printed out pictures of the coolers' contents and taped them to the broken monitors. Thankfully, you can still see enough of that PlayStation ad to know this terrible customer experience was brought to you in part by Sony. Much appreciated, Sony! 
</p>
<p>
And it should be noted that situations like the one above giving your store a real Keystone Cops vibe are among the less drastic ways these things can break.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "The doors' digital screens regularly froze or went dark, preventing customers from seeing what was available inside, and some even sparked and caught fire, according to the court documents." – The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/walgreens-test-of-ad-enabled-cooler-doors-ends-up-in-court-c79fecd6">Wall Street Journal</a> recaps Walgreens' complaints about Cooler Screens in an ongoing legal battle with the company over a botched rollout of the TV doors in the pharmacy chain's grocery sections.
</p>
<p>
Sure, adding monitors to cooler doors lets you show ads in novel ways, but it also adds a whole bunch of new (and potentially quite harmful ways) things can break and go wrong, and at much greater cost than the glass doors they were replacing. So when they do break – and given the technology involved, it's going to happen a heck of a lot more than with glass doors – they have a considerably worse impact on the user experience.
</p>
<blockquote>Cooler Screens are the opposite of graceful degradation, and a philosophical match to a lot of the game industry's push towards online functionality</blockquote>
<p>
I'm not even talking about setting-people-on-fire bad (although lest it go unsaid, that qualifies as <em>a very bad user experience</em>). If the measures Cooler Screens want to be judged on are shopping ease, relevance, and transparency, then a screen on the fritz makes the shopping experience harder because it's showing less relevant information (or none at all), and that borked monitor is not at all transparent.
</p>
<p>
That's the opposite of graceful degradation, and it's a philosophical match to a lot of the game industry's push towards online functionality as a means of erasing player ownership. 
</p>
<p>
The games industry is designing fragility into its products at a fundamental level, largely because it shares the same idea of transparency as Cooler Screens: Transparency isn't about letting people see what's really there, it's about showing them the version of what's really there that you're willing to let them see.

<h2>The rest of the week in review</h2>
<p>
<strong>STAT</strong> | 370% - After closing last week's trading at $17.46, GameStop shares were trading at almost four times that price this week because <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamestop-shares-spike-on-return-of-meme-stock-poster">one of the posters who sparked the 2021 meme stock rally started posting memes again after a multi-year break</a>.

</p>
<p>
Obviously, the layoffs are grim, but we're starting to see more stories of new studios launching, including – frustratingly – from companies that just got done laying people off. Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-cuts-1900-staffers-from-its-games-division">laid off 1,900 people in January</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-reportedly-shutting-down-four-bethesda-studios">shut down a few Bethesda studios earlier this month</a>, but this week its Activision division <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activision-opens-new-polish-studio-elsewhere-entertainment">announced the creation of Elsewhere Entertainment</a>, a Polish studio creating new IP. You know, like Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks used to do.
</p>
<p>
And then there's Sony, which <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-to-lay-off-900-playstation-workers">laid off 900 PlayStation employees in February</a>.

            <p>Video game retail GameStop has reported its preliminary financial results for Q1, which ended May 4.</p>
<p>The firm expects net sales from $872 million to $892 million.</p>
<p>This would place GameStop's sales at a decrease of 28% to 30% year-over-year for the quarter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the retailer's net loss is expected to range from $27 million to $37 million, compared to a loss of $40.5 million in Q1 of last year.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/node/20501/html">GameStop is preparing to sell up to 45 million shares</a> of company stock in an effort to raise money.</p>

Cigarettes, fish, live cockroaches; the people of this strange, frost-covered slum have some bizarre tastes to go with their unusual way of talking.<br></p> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_ArcticEggs03cropped.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true">You might wonder how much gameplay you could really stretch out of a single <em>Mario Party</em> mini-game, but it turns out it’s a lot. Two-and-a-half hours, maybe? I don’t know. I left it to idle in the background and now time has no meaning. As soon as you figure out how to get bacon onto its backside, it’s time to move on to something else. It doesn’t always get more challenging, but it definitely gets different.</p>
 <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">The nightclub section provides some of the most interesting hurdles. Folks will place beer bottles in your pan. You can let it fall over and spill its innards all over the unborn, but don’t let that liquid escape the boundaries of your cookware. A drop spilled and you start over.</p> <p data-characters="540" data-current-count="822" data-injectable="true">Yet another challenge has an empty glass fall onto the pan followed by three ice cubes. Your job is to prevent the ice from touching the pan and melting (I guess glass doesn’t transfer heat in this universe). Scratch that. Your job is to cook the food in your pan (both sides) before the ice melts. Pro tip: it takes longer for the ice to melt than it does for one side of an egg to cook. If you successfully flip the egg back onto the surface of the pan, it doesn’t matter if the glass tips out its contents; the egg will finish first.</p>
 <p data-characters="116" data-current-count="116" data-injectable="false">One of my favorites was a single, pan-filling stingray. Another was a cube of grotesque meat. I’m a simple person.</p> <figure data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="228" data-injectable="false">To see the Saint of Six Stomachs, you have to appease 27 of <em>Arctic Eggs’ </em>34 people. This means that, if there’s a challenge you can’t handle, you can pass on it and still finish the game. I fed everyone. I cook a mean egg.</p> <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">But that isn’t easy. There are some challenges that felt like too much. Usually, just when I was about to quit, my sheer determination would pull through, and I’d clear the challenge.</p>
 <p data-characters="517" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">What made it even more difficult is that <em>Arctic Eggs</em> isn’t perfect from a technical standpoint. No game is. Ever. However, early on I discovered the quick movements would sometimes result in food clipping through the bottom of the pan. More intrusively, however, if my computer stuttered for any reason, the hand would completely wig out and immediately snap to an impossible angle. Food would fly up to the rafters where the egg’s sticky yolk would no doubt glue it to the ceiling where it would stay, forgotten.</p>
 <p data-characters="100" data-current-count="100" data-injectable="false">It wasn’t so bad. There’s no penalty for throwing your food skyward. You just try again.</p> <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">I think this would happen specifically whenever my secondary hard drive would wake from stand-by. It’s a traditional platter drive, and I would hear it rev up around those moments. I really need to replace it. The thing is over 10 years old.<br></p> <figure data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false">Can you fry an egg on Mount Everest? Who cares? I can’t think about that right now. I can only think about what’s directly in front of me: eggs. The only future I dream about is one where I am afforded the luxury to once again dream.</p> <p data-characters="77" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">I know you can’t boil a potato on Mount Everest. Sucks for all those Yetis.</p> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="737" data-injectable="true">For me, I have video games. They’re a way for someone to communicate their perspective to me. There’s probably a word for that, but I’m not a thesaurus. I just cook eggs. The best eggs. <em>Arctic Eggs</em> understands the importance of eggs in this bleak, vapid world of ours. They’re nutritious, they’re cheap, and they’re mostly produced through mass torture. So, when we put all that together, this is the best game.</p>

Impressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash. </p>
