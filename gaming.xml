            <p>The world's ended, but doesn't it look pretty? That seems to be the central premise of Verdant, a game in which a young bloke dirt bikes around the plant-filled remains of post-apocalyptic 1980s Germany, figuring out the conundrums all young dirt bikers face.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As someone who loves a good game about lone youngsters with big backpacks venturing into the unknown, the blend of soothing, flowery nature and darker undertones - as skeletons sit in abandoned cars - that Verdant offers really intrigues me. It seems there'll be as much chill camping amid runs as there is poking the barrel of your gun into hidden nooks, trying to work out what the heck turned the place into one big garden centre. The soundtrack's a charming blend of tinkly piano interspersed with bursts of synth, a contrast I also dig.</p>
<p>German devs Tiny Roar also emphasise, in their synopsis, that Verdant is as much about its dirt biker finding where they fit in the world's future as it is about dredging through the past. And touching deer, so they get even more plant-encusted. Hopefully there'll be plenty of depth to all these elements, rather than just surface-level emoting.</p>
<p>The biggest question I'm left with, following the reveal during today's Wholesome Snack showcase, is just how big Verdant's environment will feel as you're roaming around it. While actually having massive scale isn't necessary, maintaining the illusion that you're just a small speck amid a giant ocean of unknown possibility or threat is what makes the likes of similar backpackish youngster adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kill-this-tractor-so-you-wont-have-to-awkwardly-ring-your-parents-keep-drivings-tyres-squeal">Keep Driving</a> tick.</p>
<p>You're just a little dude, sitting in a car or at a campsite, surrounded by the whole. It's your puzzle, or your cage, or your playhouse. Usually all three at various times.</p>
<p>As of right now, Verdant is without a release date, but you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4162340">Steam</a> if you're so inclined.</p>

            <p>Pay up then. Sorry, I've been sent on behalf of The Yolf, a giant horned cat creature who sits on a branch demanding payment in Mandrake. This folklore-infused gardening sim from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sunless-sea">Sunless Sea</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallen-london">Fallen London</a> devs Failbetter games has just had a fresh outing at today's Wholesome Snack showcase, putting centre-stage the The Yolf's need for you to get your affairs in order.</p>

<p>You play a farmer keen to do some gardening, despite curses and weird folkloric beings making that a bit harder. The Yolf, Failbetter say, lives next door. He's a "furry, friendly neighbour who nonetheless demands payment for debts owed to him by your ancestors". He'll only take cash for this sum of 962 gold crowns, as well.</p>
<p>To make that up, you'll have to get your sorcerer bottom in gear and plant some stuff. The game has goose trees, they sound like a good bet, especially if they turn out to be golden. You can also go foraging, fishing, and mining in "a world of old, wild powers, of uncanny spirits that reside in those places mortals dare not go; of deep histories, and deeper mysteries". It seems the more dangerous uncanny beings only come out at night, with the game warning you about going out once the sun sets.</p><p>The thing that's most intrigued me, aside from the gorgeously vibrant art style, is the chance to run around the sleepy rural hollow of Chandley having chats with people, spirits, gods, and bogles via dialogue boxes that remind me of a laid-back version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>'s portrait-side word scrawls. Then again, Failbetter also say you can do the following, all of which sounds rad: "Befriend a river. Eavesdrop on the dead. Spend a haunted night at the Butcher's Oak. Drink tea with the god who lives in your chimney."</p>
<p>Anyway, your job is to grow produce and redecorate the old mandrake lodge you'll be calling home. There's no cannibalism involved, or so the devs say.</p>
<p>Mandrake's still release-dateless as of right now, but you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710210/Mandrake/">Steam</a>. If you're keen for a long read outlining how it came to be and the path it's been on to this point, I'll point you to this piece former RPSer Alice B penned for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/leaving-fallen-london-how-failbetter-games-spent-several-years-growing-hope-and-discovering-the-art-of-the-possible-in-their-new-eldritch-farming-sim/">Perfectly Cylindical Gamer</a> upon its reveal this summer.</p>

			<p>Website MP1st has <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> new Divinity trademarks <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">registered</a> today in Europe. Not only is it a strong suggestion that Larian Studios will unveil a new installment in the series very soon, likely in two days at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>, but it also appears to solve the mystery of the demonic statue teased by Geoff Keighley and the TGA team via social media. The aforementioned trademarks include a few logos, such as the Divinity one above, and two more, such as the following design:</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CJ4JX4FZVCC523YA2TMALSKFLEIBGLRQBTFAMB5NW5UJISNF565FMR7UNSBD5JSL4TTWOPCUMGRIG.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Well, that's what the demonic statue (which is physically located in the Mojave Desert) looks like at night:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>A new Divinity game was always the safest bet once Larian Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-no-sequel-dlc-larian-dropping-dungeons-and-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it was not going forward with Baldur's Gate 4 despite the enormous success of the third installment. The developer would want to reap the profits of future games all on its own, so it would need to own the intellectual property of its next games. Other than a science fiction RTS title titled The L.E.D. Wars and released in 1997, though, Larian only ever made Divinity games. It was either another installment of their acclaimed cRPG franchise or a brand-new IP, and the latter would always carry a degree of risk. Besides, Original Sin 2 sold well and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/divinity-original-sin-2-new-divine-born/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received almost as much acclaim from critics</a> and fans as Baldur's Gate 3.</p>



<p>An announcement so early is certainly a bit of a surprise, though. Less than a year ago, Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-says-their-next-game-will-be-so-big-but-it-needs-a-lot-more-time-in-the-oven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that their next project would be very big, but also added that it needed 'a lot more time' in the proverbial oven. Just a bit earlier, in October 2024, Vincke had <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-says-next-game-may-come-in-2029/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped a hint</a> that it would take 'another five years' before they could return to an award event and win more prizes after Baldur's Gate 3, which fans took to mean that the studio might target a launch in 2029.</p>



<p>That said, considering their track record, Larian <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-iii-reveal-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> Baldur's Gate 3 in June 2019, more than four years before its final launch date of August 3, 2023. So, the timeline fits. An early access release appears to be very likely as well: all three of the studio's most recent games launched first on early access and then gradually made their way to version 1.0.</p>



<p>So, perhaps early access could launch in 2027, with a tentative late 2029 release window. That's mere speculation for now, though. We may learn more in just two days.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, Xbox's <em>Perfect Dark </em>reboot was canceled earlier this year, and its developer The Initiative <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="df7c528b-daa2-4f58-9ed5-674add97b2fd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">was shut down into the bargain</a>.</p><p>The game's cancellation and the studio's shutdown were part of a larger wave of layoffs at Microsoft, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="56028754-47c9-4b65-ac22-8847d892a2d8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">around 9,000 employees</a> losing their jobs, including staffers at subsidiaries like <em>Candy Crush Saga</em>'s King and Bethesda's parent ZeniMax.</p><p>Legendary studio Rare was also among the companies hit by the wave of layoffs, and the long-in-development <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e65a86bf-038b-44cc-a270-514b2c2e9af9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Everwild </em>was canceled</a> as well, seemingly leaving Rare with no games currently in the works (although the studio is still supporting multiplayer pirate adventure <em>Sea of Thieves</em>).</p><p>Of course, the sweeping wave of Microsoft layoffs didn't stop Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-revenue-up-microsoft-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3b9a1ab8-8bd4-4fa7-ad54-c26181c6b9bc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">reporting a revenue increase</a> back in late July, and it also doesn't appear to have stopped the company seemingly expecting its studios to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-profit-margins-30-percent-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="45823056-a08c-4c3f-9861-36a87b007045" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hit ridiculously high profit margins</a> (which might explain some of the staff cuts).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Geoff Keighley may not be opening a portal to hell after all. Roleplaying game fans have desperately linked <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-statue-elder-scrolls-6-geoff-keighley-2000651010">The Game Awards’ hell statue</a> to a new trademark application filed Tuesday and <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue">reported by games publication <em>MP1ST</em></a>. A law firm <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288420">filed a European trademark application</a> on Tuesday under the name&nbsp;<em>Divinity,&nbsp;</em>and the symbol in the accompanying stylized graphic certainly does look familiar.</p> <p>Two other trademark applications, showing similar imagery, were filed alongside the&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em> one. One looks to be of a person tied up in a spiderweb, and the other has a striking similarity, again, to the symbol overlaid on the Game Awards statue. The trademark application for&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em> categorizes it under computer game programs and video game software, as well as books, clothing, board games, and other “entertainment services.” No other information is available in the application to link the trademark to either the Game Awards statue or to <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em> and&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> developer Larian Studios.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Larian Studios for comment on the trademark application and its connection to the Game Awards statue. A Larian Studios representative did not mention&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin 3</em>, but said: “We are releasing <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998477127478554899">Divinity: Original Sin 2 on Next Gen</a> but weren’t going to announce it until a bit later, so please keep an eye out!”</p>

 <p>Michael Douse, Larian Studios publishing director, <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998484634397479293">also posted to X addressing the rumors</a>,saying “there aren’t currently any plans for a new <em>Divinity Original Sin 3</em> game but once we are ready to show what we’ve been working on we will.”</p>

 <p>Larian Studios announced in 2024 it’s working on two projects. All founder Swen Vincke would say, at the time, <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-next-game-excalibur-1851509450">was that one is codenamed Excalibur</a>. The studio is coming off of the massive success of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, released in 2023. But before&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, Larian Studios was best known as the maker of the <em>Divinity</em> series, starting with 2002’s <em>Divine Divinity</em> and its 2004 sequel,&nbsp;<em>Beyond Divinity</em>. It’s published six different <em>Divinity</em> games, as well as expansion packs and enhanced editions of the games. The last <em>Divinity</em> game,&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em>, was released in 2017. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-started-work-on-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-then-canceled-it-the-studio-was-elated">Asked about&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin 3</em> in 2024</a>, Vincke wouldn’t say anything except that whatever the studio’s next game is was “different than what you think it is,” yet “still familiar.”</p> <p>The Game Awards are just days away, so it’s unlikely that Larian Studios will say much about the trademark application or its potential link to the mysterious statue before the big show. But for many, that doesn’t matter: People are still holding out hope that there’s something more than simply an enhanced version of <em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em> to be announced at The Game Awards on Thursday.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-cloud-buster-sword-remake-2000651766</link>
            <guid>1377595</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Final Fantasy VII</em>‘s Cloud Strife has two defining characteristics: he suffers from repressed emotional trauma and carries a giant sword. Square Enix almost toyed with ruining one of those when it was originally planning to develop the <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-the-kotaku-review-1842697312">current</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129">remake</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-rebirth-switch-2-xbox-port-part-3-2000629254">trilogy</a>.</p> <p>The Ex-Soldier’s iconic Buster Sword looks like a six-foot butcher’s knife. While fans love it, the RPG publisher was worried it might not look realistic enough for the real-world aesthetic its Unreal Engine homages to the classic PS1 game were chasing. Maybe what looked good with blocky polygons back in 1997 wouldn’t fly in a less cartoony overhaul.</p>

 <p>“While making <em>Remake</em>, there was this aspect of the weight and how Cloud swings [the sword] around with one hand that sort of felt like it would weaken the sense of realism, you know?” director Naoki Hamaguchi recently recalled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKxyZ5DsgSs">in an interview</a> with YouTuber Julien Chièze, according to a translation by <a href="https://x.com/ShinraArch/status/1997787393253118017/photo/1">Shinra Archeology</a>.</p>

 <p>“So at the time, when we were making <em>Remake</em>, there was some discussion about whether we should give Cloud a more realistic version of the Buster Sword,” he continued. “But it was just too iconic, and if we’d made it just a regular old sword, players wouldn’t accept it…in the end we stayed faithful to the OG and a whole new generation of people fell in love with it, so I think it was the right call.”</p> <p>It’s hard to know just how serious Hamaguchi is being or just how real the concerns and doubts raised in those original meetings were. Take away his Buster Sword and Cloud is just a spikey-haired emo kid slowly having a psychological break with reality. Much harder for all the fans to cosplay as during conventions.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-statue-mystery-possibly-solved-report/</link>
            <guid>1377592</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new report, <strong>it seems like the mystery of the Game Awards statue may have been solved</strong>. Furthermore, if true, it comes from a studio fresh off huge wins at the event.</p>



<p>Since last month, a weird statue in the middle of New Mexico has appeared out of nowhere. Both The Game Awards and Geoff Keighley hinted at its true nature, but fans have been going berserk figuring out what it means. From God of War and Diablo to Saros and The Elder Scrolls, guesses <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-mystery-statue-new-mexico-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been all over the place</a>. Some theories had some real weight to them, though many were shut down by industry figures like Jason Schreier and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-director-reveals-if-the-game-awards-2025-statue-has-anything-to-do-with-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cory Barlog</a>. However, <strong>a new trademark for a legendary RPG series has been spotted</strong>, with the designs matching the statue perfectly.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-divinity-game-possibly-being-revealed-at-the-game-awards-via-mystery-statue-new-report-details">New Divinity Game Possibly Being Revealed at The Game Awards via Mystery Statue, New Report Details</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The report comes from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, who previously did pieces on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-dead-rising-hollywood-possible-capcom-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Rising</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/contraband-screenshots-canceled-xbox-avalanche/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contraband</a>. In it, the outlet found <strong>trademarks for a new Divinity game</strong>, directed by Baldur’s Gate 3’s Larian Studios. From the looks of it, <strong>the logo and accompanying images look strikingly similar to those of the statue</strong>. The picture of the listings, as well as the statue for reference, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/0BhWOdo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can be found here</a>.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that <strong>the connection has not been confirmed by Larian or The Game Awards</strong>, so <strong>take it with a grain of salt</strong>. In any case, a new Divinity is something many fans will be pumped about. The last release, Divinity: Original Sin 2, came out in 2017 for last-gen consoles. The acclaimed RPG series took players to a new medieval fantasy world with turn-based combat and an isometric perspective. While the logo and all do look new, it could be a remaster of sorts for newer consoles. Still, Larian Studios has been on a roll after the success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-bafta-games-awards/">Baldur’s Gate 3</a>, so, needless to say, if true, it’s one to keep a giant glowing eye on.</p>

As players prep for this month's upcoming Expedition--an optional wipe that resets much of their progress in exchange for in-game rewards--they'll also be treated to the fresh Cold Snap update. This new content includes an additional snow-based map condition, a premium Raider Deck, and another event to complete for goodies. Here's everything we know about it so far.</p><h2 id="Cold_Snap_release_date">Cold Snap release date</h2><p>Arc Raiders' Cold Snap update will release on <strong>December 16, 2025</strong>. While we don't know an exact launch time for this update yet, the previous North Line update launched at 1:30 AM PT / 4:30 AM ET, so it's safe to assume this one may also launch in the wee hours of the morning for US-based players.</p><p>The Cold Snap update falls just one day before the Expedition window opens, which will allow players to send their raider off and reset much of their in-game progress any time before December 22. This should give dedicated players at least a few days to see this fresh content on their current raider before sending them off and starting anew.</p><h2 id="Snowfall_map_condition">Snowfall map condition</h2><p>The Cold Snap update will feature the new snowfall map condition. While we don't know everything this condition will entail, we do know that heavy snow will reduce visibility and muffle sound, which should force players to engage in close-quarters combat--or tuck tail and run in another direction. Choosing the latter, though, may open you up to ambushes, as players will leave footprints in the snow that allow other raiders to track you more easily.</p><p>As with other map conditions, snowfall will rotate across a few of the game's existing maps and almost certainly increase loot value as an incentive for visiting and exploring the hazards within. Embark hasn't specified which maps will receive this condition yet, but based on layouts and existing map condition rotations, our best guess is Buried City and Blue Gate.</p><div tabindex="0"

However, we assume that the game's existing Creds currency will be used to buy each item in-game after you've unlocked the premium access, but we'll certainly update you when we know for sure.</p><p>For more on this extraction shooter, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-guides-hub/1100-6536157/" data-ref-id="1100-6536157">Arc Raiders guide hub</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Geoff Keighley Talks Game Awards: ‘Lots Of Games Get Sold’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/geoff-keighley-game-awards-sales-balatro-clair-obscur-2000651728</link>
            <guid>1377568</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Game Awards just keeps getting bigger and bigger. While viewers sometimes complain about the marathon runtime and nitpick every game announcement trailer they don’t care about, Geoff Keighley’s year-end showcase has become the closest thing we still have to an old-school E3 marketing extravaganza. In the face of <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-tgas-geoff-keighley-reviews-trailers-1851720812">annual criticism</a> about not putting the focus exclusively on the awards part of the ceremony, the host recently explained why his show is as much about recognizing art as it is about revealing big game announcements.</p> <p>“There are many different constituents that tune in,” Keighley told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/interview-geoff-keighley-on-the-impossible"><em>The Game Business</em></a> (a newsletter he cofounded with author Chris Dring) in a new interview. “And it is a balancing act. You correctly pointed out that there’s the awards aspect of the show, there’s the announcement aspect, and yes, there are some people that would like to see the show be all awards. Some would like to see all announcements.”</p>

 <p>He described a virtuous cycle in which more viewership means more attention for the games being celebrated, big and small, which can in turn lead to more sales for the companies or indie teams behind them.</p> <p>“My view always is that the announcements create a very wide audience that tunes into the show,” he said. “And because of that, when we do give out these awards, they’re seen by a lot of people. Lots of games get sold out of The Game Awards. <em>Balatro</em> had a huge boost. So hopefully it’s a good thing for developers. But that careful balance is a hard thing to strike and we don’t always get it right.”</p>

 <p><em>Balatro</em> was already a big sensation in the gaming world by the time The Game Awards 2024 aired, but its prizes that night <a href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-goty-game-awards-app-store-steam-sale-1851709617">helped catapult it to even bigger success</a> in the months that followed, aided in part by a popular mobile port. All of a sudden games that were big among a hardcore group are exposed to a much wider audience.</p>

 <p>Even just getting nominated can help raise visibility in that way. Alinea Analytics’ Rhys Elliott <a href="https://substack.com/@superhys/p-181156422">recently shared</a> the estimated sales boosts that the Game Awards’ Game of the Year contenders have received over the past few weeks. While the effect was biggest for frontrunner <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, the most nominated game in TGAs history, nominees like <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> were also projected to have sold an additional 100,000 copies during the period.</p> <p>Elliott says holiday sales are also a big factor in that. That’s probably why any Game Awards winners cut their price directly after the event to take advantage of the brief spotlight.</p>

<p>Everyone is obsessed with ‘wrapping up’ more than just presents now as the Holiday season approaches. Xbox Wrapped 2025 is the best way to see how much time you’ve spent on your Xbox, what you’ve done on it, and accessing Xbox Wrapped is nice and easy.</p>



<p>The Xbox brand probably hasn’t had the hottest 2025, and the whole <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-founder-describes-game-pass-price-hikes-as-greed-over-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass price increase</a> probably wasn’t the best of news. Despite these setbacks, there’s still a more than healthy player base on Xbox, and this is why Xbox Wrapped’s Year in Review could unearth some fascinating stats about your playtime.</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-year-in-review-2025-expected-release-date">Xbox Year in Review 2025 Expected Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New year, new stats. Image via Microsoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You should expect the Xbox Year in Review 2025 to arrive during the week of December 8, as this lines up with the last couple of editions of Xbox Wrapped.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike other ‘Wrapped’ round-ups, the biggest consistency about Xbox’s Year in Review is the inconsistency. Looking back at previous releases, you can see that the Xbox Year in Review 2023 was <strong>Tuesday, December 12</strong>, and last year it was <strong>Wednesday, December 4</strong>.</p>



<p>You could guesstimate that it’ll be Wednesday, December 10, for the 2025 edition of the round-up. If it’s not the first week of December, then it has to be the second. We’ve already passed Tuesday, leaving a reasonable assumption of Wednesday, December 10.</p>



<p>Note: Insider Gaming is not claiming this is the date, but is assuming a logical conclusion. Stay tuned and keep checking back for updates.</p>

<p><strong>Once the official Xbox Wrapped 2025 notice is up, there should be an easy-to-access link where you sign in and claim your full Xbox Year in Review 2025 analysis.</strong></p>



<p>This is based on the last couple of years, but it’s hard to imagine the process changing too much. Here’s how you potentially check your Xbox stats in 2025:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/YearinReview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Year in Review</a> site.</li>



<li>Log in to your Xbox account.</li>



<li>This should automatically trigger your custom Xbox Wrapped journey.</li>



<li>You can read and share details of your Xbox gaming in 2025.</li>
</ol>



<p>You only have a limited time to check the review once it’s live. Make sure you do so, and take a screenshot or share the link to keep the stats as memories or future comparisons!</p>



<p>Share your results once the Xbox Year in Review 2025 is live.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bruce Straley’s studio, Wildflower Interactive, will be revealing its debut game at The Game Awards. Straley’s resume includes creating The Last of Us and directing Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and A Thief’s End for Naughty Dog.</p>



<p>The Game Awards are no strangers to The Last of Us. With the Naughty Dog IP winning multiple awards, including Game of the Year in 2020 for Part 2, it’s not surprising to see why. Last year, Naughty Dog even revealed its next project, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, at the end of the show. However, one of The Last of Us’ co-creators, Bruce Straley, wasn’t there, having left the company in 2017. He started Wildflower Interactive in 2021, an indie studio, but didn’t give more information than that. Now, fans can expect to see what the studio has been working on come December 11th.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-game-from-wildflower-interactive-run-by-the-last-of-us-bruce-straley-to-premiere-at-the-game-awards-2025">New Game from Wildflower Interactive, Run by The Last of Us’ Bruce Straley, To Premiere at The Game Awards 2025</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1998452590397501921?s=46&amp;t=hX1f8t9VMLBATttRMgQR3A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on Twitter</a>, Game Awards host Geoff Keighley announced that <strong>the debut title from Wildflower Interactive will be revealed at the show</strong>. The video, only 30 seconds long, shows off the game’s cel-shaded style and a neat wilderness setting. In the back, some dialogue can be heard, including a bear-like roar and some reassurance. No details, like the title or release, have been revealed, though it’s likely to appear during the show on December 11th.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, Bruce’s co-director on The Last of Us, Neil Druckmann, will likely be in attendance. The TV adaptation of The Last of Us’s second season is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nominated for Best Adaptation</a>, in which Neil helped direct. Bruce’s legacy at Naughty Dog goes beyond The Last of Us, as he directed Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and A Thief’s End, which many claim to be the best in the series. Either way, an ambitious new project with a talented director at the helm is always something to look forward to.</p>

But rather than fix the ability to send houses skyward, Blizzard is instead embracing it.</p><p dir="ltr">When housing first arrived on December 2 as part of patch 11.2.7, it didn't take long for players to discover that, while the UI didn't show it, houses could actually be lifted off the ground using keybinds. The result was players making all kinds of airborne housing creations, including elaborate treehouses, airships, mechs, homes held up by kites, and everything in between.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/housing-development-notes-updated-december-9/2207508/5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forum post</a>, WoW community manager Randy Jordan (aka Kaivax) stated that instead of fixing the ability to elevate houses, Blizzard has with this week's scheduled maintenance actually made it easier by enabling proper controls to move houses upward.</p><p dir="ltr">That said, Blizzard does have some concerns. Since it never intended houses to be seen from underneath, the bottom of houses don't have proper textures, so players may want to hide or obscure that part of their home. Having a house in the sky also makes it difficult to reach the front door, so Blizzard advised building a ramp, a mount landing pad, or a jumping puzzle to make the front door accessible.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4619841-wowhousescanflynow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4619841" data-ratio="0.56222222222222" data-width="1800" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4619841-wowhousescanflynow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4619841"></a><figcaption>An example of the flying houses players can create in WoW (source: WoWDB)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4619841-wowhousescanflynow.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Being able to craft flying houses without fear of Blizzard bringing them back to the ground isn't the only good housing news. Blizzard also announced it increased the exterior-housing decor limit from 200 to 250 at housing level three.</p><p dir="ltr">"One of the biggest pieces of feedback we've gotten over the past few weeks was that the exterior decor budget felt too restrictive," Jordan said. "This was intentionally set to 200 to address performance concerns. Now that we have some data from live servers to look at, we're happy to conclude that we can increase this limit by 25%."</p><p dir="ltr">The increased exterior decor limit should result in even more fantastical creations--something that is hardly in short supply. Housing in Blizzard's MMORPG has brought plenty of suprises, including news that the game may soon allow for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-might-be-getting-official-wedding-ceremonies/1100-6536700/" data-ref-id="1100-6536700">wedding ceremonies</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW player housing is currently in early access, with the full version of the feature set to arrive with the release of the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-launches-in-march-2026/1100-6536536/" data-ref-id="1100-6536536">Midnight expansion in March 2026</a>.

Before it was removed, the PlayStation Store revealed new cover art for the game that featured longtime Resident Evil protagonist Leon Kennedy.

Leon appeared similar to his Resident Evil 4 look, with his fur-lined leather jacket, albeit a bit more grizzled.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1998365473516441707" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">High-res image of the official Leon S.

"There has been a photo lately of Leon with an eyepatch, and just basically saying there's a DLC or a new costume for Leon--but just to make sure, these are all fake news," he told <a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/resident-evil-requiem-interview-leon-is-fake-news-no-demo-and-how-outbreak-fits-in" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stevivor in an interview</a>, and added not to believe anything at face value.</p><p>So even though there was an attempt to keep Leon's involvement under wraps, Requiem still has plenty of surprises. Earlier this week, a GameStop listing mentioned another character who hasn't been officially revealed yet: <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/gamestop-may-have-accidentally-leaked-a-second-playable-resident-evil-requiem-character/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rosemary Winters</a>, who fans think will have a smaller role. It also looks like if she shows up, she'll still have both of her eyes.</p><p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, 2026, for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC.</p>
