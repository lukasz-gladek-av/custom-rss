		<p>Microsoft has announced that the Xbox Developer Direct will be taking place on January 22nd, and has confirmed Fable, Forza Horizon, and Game Freak’s Beast of Reincarnation will all have gameplay shown. Both Fable and Forza Horizon 6 are pencilled in to launch this year, so we should get release dates for both at Developer Direct, and we may also get a release date for Beast of Reincarnation.</p>

<p>In the announcement post, Joe Skrebels, Xbox Wire Editor In Chief, said, <em>“2026 is going to be an incredible year for Xbox players – you might even call it a… fabled year. To celebrate, we’re kicking it off with the fourth installment of our Developer_Direct broadcast on January 22, bringing you news, new gameplay, and insights directly from the incredible teams working on titles coming this year. Presented by the game creators themselves, Developer_Direct will once again give you an inside look at not just the games, but the studios working to bring them to life. Fittingly for Xbox’s 25<sup data-sleek-node-id="Me9CxY">th</sup> anniversary year, that includes the return of some of our most legendary franchises, which rub shoulders with a brand new title from one of Japan’s most beloved studios.”</em></p>
<p>The Xbox Developer Direct will be streaming on January 22nd at 10am Pacific / 1pm Eastern / 6pm UK.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161411/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>The long-running <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-trails-kiseki-games-on-nintendo-switch">Trails</a></strong> series needs little introduction, as Falcom has been chipping away at this JRPG narrative for the better part of two decades across a variety of arcs and perspectives spread over more than a dozen interconnected games. While newcomers have traditionally been discouraged by the mountain of homework necessary to ‘get it’, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_through_daybreak">Trails Through Daybreak</a> offered a nice on-ramp for the series a couple of years ago, kicking off a fresh arc. After a somewhat disappointing sequel, many hoped Falcom would right the ship with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Trails Beyond the Horizon</a> and start offering some payoffs for the many plot threads it’s set up. Luckily, Falcom <em>has</em> started to get things moving, and this entry overall feels like an improvement over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_through_daybreak_ii">Trails Through Daybreak II</a>, though it isn’t without its flaws.</p>
<p>Centred on the initiation of humanity’s first steps into space, this is narratively a continuation of the ‘Calvard arc’ that started with the first Daybreak game, but there’s also a good reason why this wasn’t simply called Trails Through Daybreak 3. While Van is (debatably) the primary character of this release, there are also two parallel story routes starring Kevin and Rean, two protagonists from previously concluded arcs who still have a role to play in the all-encompassing storyline now approaching a grand conclusion that the technological developments of Zemurian space exploration are bringing into focus.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161391/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This three-route narrative approach proves to be both a blessing and a curse. On the more positive side, it’s interesting checking in with these older characters to see how they've grown and changed ‘offscreen’ while the focus of the series shifted elsewhere. Plus, bringing some legacy characters into the fold demonstrates how Falcom has begun to unite the previously distinct casts in the run-up to a finale years in the making.</p>
<p>On the other hand, these additional cast members dilute the Calvard characters' story a bit and contribute to turning what is ostensibly a ‘payoff game’ into yet more table-setting for a later resolution. Given the mixed reception to Daybreak II's relatively inconsequential storyline, it feels like a rug-pull in some ways that we have to keep waiting for things to really kick into gear.</p>
<p>Not all players will consider this more indulgent pace a bad thing, but Trails Beyond the Horizon sometimes feels a little too comfortable in keeping the narrative in neutral, coasting towards a finale and making lots of promises that will hopefully be delivered on in the future.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161398/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Combat continues the hybrid battle system implemented in the last two Daybreak games, mixing simple action combat with a much more in-depth turn-based system. When you first encounter enemies in the field, batting at them with your weapon to chip their health down will also build a gauge for a more powerful stun attack which can combo nicely into the turn-based mode.</p>
<p>This action combat acts as a nice way to clean up trash mobs or to soften up foes before a proper battle starts, but it can fall apart the longer you engage in it and realise how surface-level it tends to be. Falcom has done a good job of making it more interesting over time with the addition of things like reaction attacks and quick arts, but the mechanics here are still relatively sparse, particularly when compared to the significantly more complex turn-based mode.</p>
<p>Once you transition into turn-based combat, things play out more akin to a typical Trails game. When it’s a party member’s turn, you have a variety of attacks and active skills at their disposal, most of which are affected by character positioning. Not only can you freely move characters around within a fixed area before taking an action, but casting arts or crafts usually requires you to ‘aim’ an attack or area of effect to <em>just</em> the right spot to maximise passive buffs and how many enemies get caught in the blast.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161390/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Amid all this, it’s important to also be cognisant of how your potential actions affect the ongoing battle timeline. Not only are there stat bonuses that you can use (or steal) if you’re careful about how you organise party actions in the turn order, but there are ways you can delay enemy actions to create more openings for your party. Though there’s a learning curve to its management, the timeline adds a fun and dynamic layer to combat proceedings that keeps you engaged not just in <em>what</em> you’re doing, but also <em>when</em> you’re doing it.</p>
<p>This hybrid battle system wasn’t just copy-and-pasted into this entry, however; Falcom has added even more mechanics in the form of ZOC, Awakening, and Shard Commands.</p>
<p>ZOC acts as a way of slowing down time, which either lets you get in a lot more hits on the field or gives you an immediate extra turn in turn-based combat, while Awakening acts as a ‘beast mode’ that can supercharge your damage. The most interesting of these are Shard Commands, which ultimately allow you to burn some boost points in turn-based fights to activate party-wide buffs that can massively turn the tide of battle if you time them properly.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161384/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The new mechanics don’t feel like revolutionary new ideas and ultimately result in a lot prettier effects and bigger numbers, but it’s nice to see Falcom continuing to iterate on the new combat. Yet when considering all the different features together, it can sometimes feel like there’s a bit too much going on, particularly for the majority of the average encounters you’ll find yourself in. All the same, there’s lots to sink your teeth into with the gameplay here, and the system really shows its potential in the occasional tough boss fight that demands you pull out all the stops.</p>
<p>When it comes to building your team, Trails Beyond the Horizon also borrows the Orbment system from previous games, wherein each character can be equipped with various elemental crystals that grant them new arts, passives, and stat bonuses depending on how you lay things out.</p>
<p>Though there’s no explicit class system here, how you choose to configure a character’s Orbment can significantly affect the sort of role they occupy in your party, and you’re encouraged to really get into the weeds with experimenting with party compositions as the narrative unfolds. It can feel a bit confusing at first, but fooling around with it reveals lots of depth for tailoring your party, and I think it manages to strike an elegant solution to offering deep party customisation without needlessly bogging you down in menus and comparisons.</p>

<p>While the expected mountain of side quests is still present and accounted for, the Marchen Garten makes a return as a significant portion of the optional content. Here, it’s been dubbed the ‘Grim Garten’ and gotten a creepy makeover to reflect a story event that led to its change. The structure largely follows its previous appearance, wherein you put together a party and delve into procedurally generated dungeons in pursuit of fresh rewards and unique story content.</p>
<p>Not only does this provide a convenient way to put together characters who otherwise have little to no interaction with each other in the main story, but it also has an interesting feature where you collect and view 'memories' that fill in some <em>really</em> critical pieces of plot information.</p>
<p>Grim Garten doesn’t necessarily offer much that you can’t find when playing through the rest of the game, but it's a fun side mode that strips away a lot of fat and just lets you get to the meat of the thrilling combat. Plus, it can be a nice distraction from the occasionally glacial pace of the main narrative, where you can kill some time and gather resources to power up your team in the main story quest.</p>

<p>As far as visuals are concerned, this is one of the most beautiful Trails games yet. The new engine that Falcom debuted with Trails into Daybreak really sings on the Switch 2 hardware, holding to a mostly stable 60fps while maintaining an impressively sharp image quality in both docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>Most notably, the text is <em>actually</em> readable on the Switch 2 screen this time around, clearing up an irksome issue from the last couple of games. Animation quality has also gotten a nice boost this time around, with many of the bigger attacks and arts having a nicely cinematic quality to them that hides some of the ‘Falcom jank’ that gives these games some of their charm.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Trails Beyond the Horizon is another solid new entry in the long-running series and feels like a firm step forward, even if it’s not quite as big a step as some may have hoped. Though the story can be uneven, it’s buoyed by a strong and diverse cast that keeps you invested and reminds you how all the work Falcom has been putting in over the years has ultimately been pushing towards something.</p>
<p>Couple its engaging (if sometimes slow) narrative with polished graphics, deep character customisation, and a dynamic combat system, and you’ve got a great and ambitious JRPG that especially stands out in these relatively early days of the Switch 2 library. I’d give this one a strong recommendation to series fans, as it really does feel like a step up from Daybreak II. Newcomers, though, will want to give this one a pass until they’ve played the previous two Daybreak games, at least.</p></section>

<figcaption>We'll finally get a first look at <em>Fable </em>later this month.</figcaption>

<p>As well as <em>Fable</em>, the Developer Direct will also be checking in with another Playground Games title in the form of <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, which will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-6-revealed-ps5" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7ede297d-3bdf-4de5-b00a-3479b4a33aab" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">launching sometime this year</a> on PC and Xbox (and on PS5 later after that).</p><p>We already know the racer will be moving its open-world simcade action to Japan this time around, but Xbox is promising we'll get to see gameplay during the Developer Direct.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-gimbal-stabilizers-go-on-clearance-as-osmo-mobile-7p-with-built-in-extension-rod-and-tripod-drops-to-its-all-time-low-2000658108</link>

              <p>Shaky footage is frustrating and, well, headache-inducing, especially when it ends up ruining a perfectly beautiful moment. If you film with your phone and are looking to enjoy stable, steady results, you might want to invest in a gimbal stabilizer.</p>
<p>DJI makes some of the best filming accessories on the market, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6702/">we just spotted its Osmo Mobile 7P gimbal stabilizer going at a 20% discount on Amazon.</a> It’s now available for just $103, after the retailer took a sweet $26 off its usual $129 price. Placing your orders today can also help you enjoy free delivery with your purchase, which brings the overall cost down even further. Just be sure to act fast, as the offer is expected to wrap up soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Steady, Hands-Free Footage</h2>
<p>This stabilizer works with both iPhones and Android smartphones. It’s powered by DJI’s seventh-generation stabilization technology to ensure cinema-quality high and low-angle footage at your fingertips, wherever you go. Getting started couldn’t be easier. Unfolding the gimbal turns it on, while the magnetic design makes mounting any paired phone a breeze. Once the phone is up, access the Mimo app with a single click and get to filming right away.</p>
<p>There’s support for native camera features like Apple ProRes and zoom tracking, plus the stabilizer plays nicely with different live streaming apps. Gesture control makes it easy to operate the thing from afar. For instance, the “palm” gesture starts/stops recording, the “Double L” gesture adjusts framing, and making a “V” takes a photo without you having to manually click any buttons. Additionally, you’re getting a built-in fill light which adjusts brightness and color temperature for better, Instagram-worthy results, even in low light conditions.</p>
<p>DJI Mimo offers dual-lens, active tracking. This allows the subject to move freely around while still staying in focus. Play basketball with your little ones, or just show off some dance moves without worrying about the camera focusing on the tree behind. And when there are more than one subjects in the frame, you can effortlessly switch between them by tapping on their selection boxes on your phone. This way, everyone gets to be in the spotlight!</p>



<p>The all-in-one design of the gimbal offers multiple use cases. You can hold it to take selfies or record on the go, as well as set it down as a tripod for solo creation and recording videos. Battery life is another strong selling point. A single charge gets you an operating time of around 10 hours, which is great for extended filming and those long live sessions. Even better, the gimbal is also capable of powering your phone, meaning you won’t have to worry about running out of your smartphone’s battery in the middle of filming an exciting adventure.</p>
<p>Note that you need the DJI Mimo app to get started with using the gimbal. It’s not available on Google Play due to some compatibility issues, but you can install it using the official DJI website.</p>
<p>To wrap it up, this gimbal makes filming a lot more fun, and convenient. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6702/">It typically retails for around $129, but the current discount lets you grab it for $103</a>. There are no delivery charges to worry about, either, so $103 is all you’ve got to pay. Just be sure to get your orders in before the offer expires or the stock runs out.</p>

<p>The Xbox Developer Direct is just weeks away, and Xbox has confirmed the first three games that will appear at the annual event.</p>



<p>Airing on January 22 at 1pm ET/10am/6pm UK, the Xbox Developer Direct gives players a look at upcoming first-party games from Xbox Game Studios as well as some third-party titles. Last year featured games liked Ninja Gaiden 4, Doom: The Dark Ages, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, among others. And with Xbox celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, Microsoft is promising fans a “incredible year”, starting with the Developer Direct.</p>



<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/08/xbox-developer-direct-2026/?ocid=Event_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Photo_lrn_1.8.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox announced</a> that Fable, Forza Horizon 6, and Beast of Reincarnation would receive expended looks during the event.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-fans-will-see-at-xbox-s-developer-direct">What Fans Will See At Xbox’s Developer Direct</h2>



<p>For Fable, Playground Games is giving fans the first extended look at the game that’s scheduled to release this year. Forza Horizon 6, also from Playground Games, will receive its gameplay reveal after first being announced at Tokyo Game Show last year. </p>



<p>Lastly, Beast of Reincarnation comes from Pokémon developer Game Freak. The game is an Action RPG featuring “one person, one dog”. During the event, Game Freak will “reveal details of our protagonist Emma’s innovative plant manipulation actions and gameplay with her canine companion, Koo.”</p>



<p><strong>“Presented by the game creators themselves, Developer_Direct will once again give you an inside look at not just the games, but the studios working to bring them to life,”</strong> Joe Skrebels, Xbox Wire editor-in-chief, said. <strong>“Fittingly for Xbox’s 25<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary year, that includes the return of some of our most legendary franchises, which rub shoulders with a brand new title from one of Japan’s most beloved studios.</strong>“</p>







<p>It’s expected that at least one more game will be shown during the event, though what the game will be is still anyone’s guess. The Xbox Developer Direct takes place on Thursday, January 22. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the event as it airs.</p>

<p>A lot of new details about Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 have been revealed recently, including that the game’s experience is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more or less complete</a> and that the devs consider it a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-devs-are-considering-a-full-title-after-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full title after this instalment</a>. However, a remake has now been mentioned, and it’s none other than 1994’s Final Fantasy 6. </p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-remake-director-would-like-to-see-a-new-creator-come-in">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Director Would Like to See a New Creator Come In</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbrBjFZabUE&amp;t=3s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamerBraves</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/while-final-fantasy-6-remake-would-be-a-dream-project-final-fantasy-7-remake-director-thinks-hed-rather-someone-else-lead-it-should-i-be-the-one-to-undertake-remaking-another-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), FF7 Remake series director Naoki Hamaguchi spoke about someone else leading Final Fantasy 6 Remake. Hamaguchi first spoke about how Final Fantasy 6 has been influential in his journey as a gamer, and that influence often comes through in his work. However, FF7 Remake didn’t include any elements of FF6 as they were following a set script. </p>



<p>Hamaguchi then went on to talk about how many fans have requested a remake of Final Fantasy 6. But, he has been leading the FF7 Remake for close to 10 years and is “now finally seeing basically the end of the tunnel.” He wonders whether he should be the one responsible for taking up another remake series after pouring so much time into remaking this project. </p>



<p>Hamaguchi then states that, rather than him being the lead, he wants to see a “new creator” take the lead position, and he can take a more supportive role, “sort of cheer them on”. </p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced two pastelly new Joy-Con 2 controller colours for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and said they'll release next month.</p>
<p>The colours - officially Light Purple and Light Green (though I'd have called them Lavender and Turquoise) - are due to arrive 12th February, alongside Mario Tennis Fever on Switch 2. As far as I'm aware, these are the first new Joy-Con 2 colour variants offered for Switch 2. I'm sure they won't be the last.</p>

Since then, Hello Games has worked tirelessly to improve their ground breaking title. Underwater exploration, fishing, multiplayer, haunted wrecks, and more were all added to the space exploration game to have it meet player expectations.</p><p>These improvements continued into, and throughout, 2025. Worlds Part II kicked off the year with a new star system, gas giants, and quality of life updates. It was followed up by more Expeditions and improvements to settlements.

  </picture><h2>Second Place - Marvel Rivals</h2><p>Developer: NetEase Games | Release Date: December 6th, 2024</p><p>Written by Samuel Guglielmo</p><p>Cards on the table: I am not a huge Marvel comics fan, and only really got into it with the movies. When <em>Marvel Rival</em>s came out at the very end of 2024, I suggested it to my friends as an alternative to <em>Overwatch 2</em> (and<em> League of Legends</em>, mostly because that game just made them worse people). I did not know I would be setting us up for a game that would keep us playing all year.</p><p>2025 was an amazing first year for <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Hero shooters can expect maybe 3 or 4 new characters a year. <em>Marvel Rivals </em>added 12, and this was to an already massive roster of 35 at launch. Several of the new heroes, such as Emma Frost, Ultron, and Phoenix, have entered my rotation of regularly played characters. Others, such as Rogue and Mister Fantastic, have been picked up by my friends. There are already two characters announced for next year, and I can’t wait to get my hands on them.</p><p>But it’s not just new characters. New maps and gameplay modes have kept the game lively. There’s an all new 18v18 mode that is chaotic nonsense. There has been new experimental seasonal modes all year, ranging from really strange matches where everyone plays the same character, to “what if <em>Splatoon </em>but everyone is Jeff?” There’s even been an absurdly fun PVE zombie survival mode that mostly reminded me of <em>Left 4 Dead</em> but with a sort of a<em> Vampire Surviors</em>-styled upgrade element. I love it.</p><p>If <em>Marvel Rivals </em>sees even half the love it got in 2025 next year, it deserves all this praise again. I have a feeling we’re still going to see plenty of more for this game though.</p><picture>

From how great the team is at engaging with its community with interesting events to the new content, it was a great year for Helldivers 2 fans.</p><p>One of the biggest things for<em> Helldivers 2</em> this year was releasing on Xbox, which came with a crossover event with <em>Halo ODST</em>-themed content in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>More than that, there were two major content updates this year with the first, Heart of Democracy, centered around repelling an invasion of Super Earth. New, dense cityscape maps, that come with its own challenges like civilians to save.&nbsp;</p><p>The next, Into the Unjust, added giant caves to explore with holes in the roof for stratagems, destructible walls, and a ton of bugs to wipe out of course.&nbsp;</p><p>There was even an ARG, Station-81, that tasked the community with cracking codes, aligning antennae a la Twitch Plays <em>Pokemon </em>style, and more to reveal the invasion of Super Earth, which led into Heart of Democracy.</p><p>All in all, <em>Helldivers 2</em> continues to be a masterclass in how to keep a community engaged.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<figcaption>Kinetic Games isn't just about <em>Phasmophobia </em>anymore.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>Phasmophobia </em>director and Kinetic CEO Daniel Knight says his studio's growth means the company is now in a position to "provide the support [he'd have] appreciated at the start of [his] journey", while marketing director Asim Tanvir says Kinetic Publishing hopes to "champion and encourage creativity" in indie development.</p><p>Knight and Tanvir will spearhead Kinetic Publishing alongside three other senior team members, but don't worry; work on <em>Phasmophobia </em>won't be slowing down. Developers at Kinetic will be "entirely focused" on the game, the studio says.</p><p>With regards to <em>Phasmophobia</em>, Kinetic says it will reveal the ghost-hunting game's 2026 roadmap "soon". We already know that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-1-0-coming-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="edc0a99d-8664-4093-82db-df3ab1a960ee" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the 1.0 release is scheduled for this year</a>, and that a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-switch-2-version-on-way-next-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="159fca3c-8df3-41ad-98da-95af3a28123c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Switch 2 release is also on the cards</a> for the game.</p><p>According to Kinetic, <em>Phasmophobia </em>enjoyed 16 million Steam page visits this year, as well as "an increase of over 700,000 in broader community growth" and 150,000 new Discord members. It's been a big year for <em>Phasmophobia</em>, that's for sure.</p>
<p>Kinetic Publishing doesn't seem to have signed its first game yet, but the studio says it's currently accepting pitches from indie developers.</p><p>If you want your game to be considered, Kinetic says you'll need to be "12-18 months from release" and to have a "clear vision" for your game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has unveiled the first new colors you'll be able to pick up for the Switch 2's Joy-Con 2 controllers, and they're launching in February, but there's a slight catch for the aesthetically-inclined.</p><p>As revealed via the Nintendo Today app, new purple and green Joy-Con 2s will be released on February 12th this year, and as you've probably surmised, the edges of the controllers will be light purple and light green, respectively.</p><p>The body of the Joy-Con 2 will remain black in both instances, however, and what's more, the colors won't correspond to the edges of the console, so you'll have to deal with a mismatch every time you attach your Joy-Con 2s to your Switch 2.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>Happily, however, it doesn't look like you'll be able to tell that the colors don't match when the controllers are docked on the console, so the clash shouldn't be too much of an eyesore.</p><p>Introducing new Joy-Con colors was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-pastel-joy-cons" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ba98a8b8-8ce9-4458-b4e9-813635a22d7e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a staple of the original Switch</a> for Nintendo, so it's nice to know that tradition will continue for the Switch 2, although I'm hoping for some slightly more interesting designs on the actual controllers themselves next time.</p><p>Of course, these controllers aren't any different to the original Joy-Con 2s you'll have received as part of your Switch 2, so they're just as susceptible to problems like controller drift as the originals (and, indeed, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/consumer-watchdog-urges-nintendo-to-get-grip-on-joy-con-drift" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="10da3ff4-d0cf-4623-9c10-63fda942fd3f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">as the Switch 1 controllers were</a>, seemingly).</p><p>Still, perhaps you'll be able to use <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-voice-command-software-hitachi" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c6fddd4a-de7d-4262-8492-e73298196a0a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Hitachi's new voice control protocol</a> to interact with games if your controllers do start showing signs of drift, or maybe Nintendo will switch to Hall effect sticks at some point in the future (although that seems unlikely if you ask me).</p><figure role="group">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo has revealed the first variant Joy-Con controllers for the Switch 2 and they’re not as colorful as some might have hoped. Still mostly all graphite black, the new Joy-Con sport subtle lines of lily purple and mint green and arrive next month for $100.</p> <p>The new options ship on February 12, the same day as <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em>, though they don’t seem to have any obvious thematic overlap with the Switch 2 sports game or its colors. Like the existing orange and blue Joy-Con, the colors are limited to the inset around the thumbsticks and the sides where they connect magnetically to the console. For anyone playing in handheld mode, most of what’s “new” about these variants won’t even be visible most of the time.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">As you enjoy <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioTennisFever?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MarioTennisFever</a>, you’ll also have the opportunity to give your <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitch2</a> a new look! </p> <p>The first new colored Joy-Con 2 controllers—Light Purple and Light Green—also arrive Feb 12. </p> <p>Pre-purchase now: <a href="https://t.co/xoK6jsePMp">https://t.co/xoK6jsePMp</a> <a href="https://t.co/JoE8r4oOQl">pic.twitter.com/JoE8r4oOQl</a></p> <p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2009253320150425831?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Is it a big surprise that Nintendo is, at least for now, sticking with the more sophisticated, less whimsical sensibility of the existing Switch 2 Joy-Con? Not entirely. But it’s definitely a bit deflating for anyone who’s been waiting for something cool to come along before upgrading to a second pair of controllers. You’d get as much difference out of sticking different-colored nubs on the thumbsticks (which you should do anyway because the base ones are no good).</p>

 <p>The first year of the Switch 1 saw multiple new, full-color variants ship alongside games like <em>Arms</em> and <em>Splatoon 2</em>. They were bright, exciting, and fun. One of my favorite things from that console era is now having a drawer full of different colored Joy-Con that looks like someone dumped out a box of oversized crayons. Maybe we’ll get to those eventually. For now, fans will have to settle for “Joy-Con™ 2 (L)/(R) Light Purple / Light Green.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbl-xtreme-3-is-back-to-its-black-friday-low-as-amazon-clears-out-the-best-selling-portable-speaker-2000658112</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A solid speaker can bring life to any gathering, and even upgrade those solo streaming sessions at night. Hardly any brand does music better than JBL, and today is a great time to grab one of its top-rated speakers for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5961/">Amazon has – quite generously – dropped the price of the JBL Xtreme 3 speaker by 39%.</a> You can now pick it up for $200, after a whopping $130 discount. The offer applies to all three color options, including black, blue, and camo. The deal is open to all shoppers (both Prime and non-Prime members), but we’re expecting it to wrap up soon. If you’ve been looking for an option that lets you enjoy your favorite beats to the fullest, now is the time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5961/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Keeps the Music Going All Night</h2>
<p>The JBL Xtreme 3 is a powerful, yet portable speaker. It comes with a detachable carrying strap that makes the speaker easy to take with you on the go, plus a built-in bottle opener for added convenience, especially when you’re partying in the great outdoors. The overall design is quite sturdy and can handle everyday wear and tear like a champ.</p>
<p>Sound-wise, it’s got four drivers and two JBL Bass Radiators that push deep, rich sound for all your tracks. You’ll also enjoy bold bass for energy-filled songs – the kind that makes everyone want to step on the dance floor and show off some cool moves. Whether you’re just using the speaker to listen to a podcast in your living room or for vibing to the latest Coldplay album, it delivers exceptionally well across all genres and audio types.</p>
<p>Additionally, Xtreme 3 is IP67 waterproof and dustproof, which means you can bring it anywhere without worry. Take it to the beach, by the pool, and even in the shower. Starting to rain in the backyard during a jamming session? That won’t be a problem, either. As for the battery life, it’s better than most options in this range. A single charge gets you up to 15 hours of playtime. That’s more than enough to keep the party going all night, and well into the next day! Plus, recharging doesn’t take forever, either, so even when you’re running low, the speaker should be back up in no time.</p>



<p>Connectivity-wise, the speaker can be paired with up to two smartphones or tablets at the same time. You can connect it to your phone and your friend’s, then easily take turns playing your favorite tracks. The PartyBoost feature deserves a mention, too, here. It allows you to pair two JBL PartyBoost-compatible speakers together for an even bigger, bolder sound when you want to entertain a larger crowd. Just ask a loved one to bring theirs, and have your own private concert with stereo sound at home!</p>
<p>Altogether, the JBL Xtreme 3 delivers powerful sound in a compact build. You will also enjoy a long battery life, plus incredible durability with its IP67 rating. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5961/">On a regular day, you’d pay around $330 to enjoy these features, but the current deal lets you pick the speaker up for just $200.</a> Discounts this good don’t last long, though. It’s best to get your orders in without wasting much time.</p>

                <p>The story of Max Caulfield and her best friend, Chloe Price, was a major part of the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/life-is-strange-collection/" data-ref-id="5000-686438">Life is Strange</a>, and the pair are apparently about to reunite. The Pan-European Game Information has seemingly leaked the next game in the series, Life is Strange: Reunion, which looks to bring Max and Chloe back together for the first time in years.</p><p>In the original game, Max used her powers to rewind time to save Chloe's life, only to face a choice between saving her friend or saving their hometown. Chloe wasn't a featured character in the most recent game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure/" data-ref-id="5000-631969">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, but the PEGI rating for Reunion reveals that both of the game's heroines are facing some serious trials ahead.</p><p>"Chloe Price was Max Caulfield's partner in time," reads the game's description. "Losing her is Max's greatest regret. Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max's help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus."</p><p>The PEGI rating notes that most of the violence in the game is implied, and that there are some swear words. It also specifically notes a scene where the player's character has the option of accepting wine to drink before realizing that it was spiked with a hallucinogen.</p><p>Square Enix will release Life is Strange: Reunion on PS5 according to the rating, which doesn't mention PC or Xbox Series X|S. Presumably an official announcement of the game will be made soon.</p><p>Late last year, Prime Video ordered a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/life-is-strange-tv-series-officially-happening-after-9-years/1100-6534515/" data-ref-id="1100-6534515">Life is Strange TV series</a>.

<p>New balls, please</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has served up a five-minute <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> overview trailer, giving us our best look yet at the upcoming sports title.</p>
<p>The big focus right from the jump is the titular Fever Rackets, which grant special power-ups to your shots or movement. The trailer gives us another look at the Flame Shot and Ice Racket, but there's also the enemy-summoning Pokey Racket, the helping hand Shadow Racket, and the speedy Golden Dash Racket. Some of these can even deal damage to your opponent, because the one thing that tennis is really missing is <em>pain</em>.</p>
<p>But these Fever effects aren't the be-all and end-all. As explained in the new overview, if you can send the Fever ball back before it bounces, the effect will be sent back with it — gosh, <em>the tension</em>!</p>
<p>Those after something a little more standard can play in 'Classic Rules', removing the Fever Rackets and putting more focus on the new Slide and Leap shots.</p>
<p>We get a closer look at more of those teased 38 playable characters, too, with Goomba, Nabbit and Baby Waluigi getting some time in the spotlight, and those with a keen eye will also spot the likes of Dry Bones, Bowser Jr. and more.</p>
<p>As for game modes, there's Tournament, the challenge-based Trial Towers, and the Baby 'Adventure' mode that we saw in the initial reveal.</p>
<p>And yes, GameShare is also enabled in this one, so you can play with friends online even if they don't own a copy of the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Krafton and developer ARC Team have announced the Early Access release date for their free-to-play top-down tactical shooter <em>PUBG: Blindspot</em>, and it's heading to PC via Steam next month.</p><p>As revealed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3143710/view/535497844504658077" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a post</a> on Steam, <em>PUBG: Blindspot </em>will be available to play in its Early Access form starting from February 5th. Again, the game will be free at the point of entry, so it won't cost you anything other than time to try it out.</p><p>Krafton says that <em>PUBG: Blindspot</em>'s Early Access version "may include limited content", but that the project will "evolve through ongoing balance updates, improvements, and live development", which is pretty much the dictionary definition of an Early Access game, I think.</p><figure role="group">

<p>More details about <em>PUBG: Blindspot</em>'s Early Access release, as well as a "full FAQ", will be made available via the game's official Discord server at some point in the near future, so look out for that if you want to know more.</p><p>If you're wondering exactly what <em>PUBG: Blindspot </em>is, Krafton describes the game as "a 5v5 top-down tactical shooter built on clever positioning, tight teamwork, and shared vision".</p><p>Each game will see one team trying to gain entry to a building in order to access its Crypt, while the other team tries to defend the building from the first team's incursion. Krafton and ARC Team are promising unique classes, as well as iconic weapons from <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> for you to try out.</p><p>&nbsp;You can check out a trailer for <em>PUBG: Blindspot</em>, which should give you a sense of what kind of gameplay you can expect from the project, right here.</p>

            <p>Right, so, Starcraft. A new shooter in the series is reportedly set to be revealed this year, possibly as the big headline act of Blizzcon in September.</p>
<p>The existence of such a secret shootery thing in the works at Blizzard was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-ghost-of-starcraft-ghost-endures-as-a-new-shooter-set-in-the-rts-universe-is-in-the-works-at-blizzard">first reported</a> by Jason Schreier last year, being one of the revelations to come out of his book on the publisher, titled Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Well, now a report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">Windows Central</a> claims that said Starcraft shooter is "most likely" going to headline Blizzcon 2026, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> expansions expected to take the snowy stage alongside it.</p>
<p>That's it in terms of details for this latest report, but Schreier's reporting from last year did reveal that - at least as of the time of his book's publication - long-time FarCry producer Dan Hay is heading up the project. Asked about like likelihood of this Starcraft shooter making it out into the wild by IGN around the same time, Schreier said the following:</p>
<blockquote>If it’s not canceled. This is Blizzard after all. Their history with StarCraft shooters is not good. Yes, that is a project that as far as I know is in development, or at least as of the time that I wrote this book was in development. They are working on a StarCraft shooter, StarCraft is not dead at Blizzard.</blockquote>
<p>He added that it "felt like such an interesting and useful nugget to include, because it really just shows you that Blizzard cannot quit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a> shooters, they just can't say goodbye to them." Indeed, as this'd be the third time acting as the charm for such a game. Nihilistic Software’s  StarCraft GhostGhost was announced in 2002, put on hold in 2006, and later canned. Then, a shooter named codenamed Project Ares was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzard-cancelled-starcraft-fps">reported to have been cancelled</a> in 2019, with Blizzard's focus pulled towards Diablo 4 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>.</p><p>As a young whippersnapper who's never Starilly Crafted, I've got no strong feelings about any of this, but I do hope <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-starcraft-game-is-on-the-way-from-the-publishers-of-dave-the-diver-and-the-finals-according-to-reports">Edwin can be spared</a> having to write more lines like "It's been so long since the last Starcraft that all I can remember is that Zergs build on creep, the Protoss Void Ray is a glorified Xmas bauble, and Jim Curry went to space."</p>

              <p>The next major update to&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> is going to make all the baby animals over 2,740 percent cuter. I checked the figures using measurements, and by watching the new trailer for the Spring Drop four times over.</p> <p>It seems that until now,&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> has generated its baby animals by scaling down the body size of their adult forms, but keeping the heads the same. And that’s good. That’s worked. But there was room for improvement. In the next update, due in the spring, all the game’s younger animals will receive bespoke designs, complete with all-new animations, sound effects, and the cutest iddle widdle eyes you’ve ever seen.</p>  <p>Seriously, how are we supposed to even cope with those fuzzy lil’ guys? Those bunnies! The new wolf pups! The way the bunnies tip their heads and twitch their ears?!</p>

 <p>This is also a splendid piece of game promotion, for a game that requires less advertising than oxygen. Mojang’s Agnes Larsson is infectiously and apporiately excited about the new pups, and it compelling portrays&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> as a game that’s interesting far beyond that of the PvP-focused YouTube denizens of LifeSteal or what have you.</p>

 <p>I tested the video to its absolute limits, by this morning showing it to my 11-year-old son who is hellbent on a new, tougher exterior, and he melted before it. There were attempts at somewhat patronizing, “Yeah, that’s sweet,” remarks to placate me until he was caught off guard and let out, “KITTENS!” After that, he was n. Some cool credibility was recovered on the reveal that name tags are soon to be craftable, as he let out a YouTuber’s “Yesssssssss,” and carefully noted the ingredients for the task. After that, his Switch lured him away from the video, as he and fellow classmates rushed to work on a new world on their shared Realm before each player was popped out of existence as they were dragged from screen to school. I happily continued watching yet again, until Larsson was once more scratching a real pig’s belly with a rake.</p>

 <p>I’m a little bit worried about how I’m going to cope <a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-donut-smp-server-farm-notch-2000656412">on returning to Donut SMP</a> to a world that is yet to contain those cuboid little chicks, or baby highland cattle that I need to hug until they pop.</p> <p>All of the above is currently available in Snapshot, Beta and Preview versions of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, although there’s no date for when it will all properly arrive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ready to pick up a new pair of earbuds? There are tons to choose from, but you can always count on Apple to have some of the best on the market. Apple’s AirPods (fourth gen) are true wireless earbuds designed to provide users with seamless, fast and convenient listening experiences. And if you’re thinking it’s time right now to get some earbuds to level up your music, you should absolutely take advantage of this deal.</p>
<p>If you want a pair of your own right now, you’re in luck. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/">You can get fourth-generation Apple AirPods on Amazon.com for under $100, which represents a savings of $29 compared to their retail price of $129</a>. That’s about 22% off, which is well worth locking in your purchase for.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A pair of one of Apple’s best sets of earbuds</h2>
<p>These AirPods are all about seamless integration, and they do that perfectly. As soon as you pair the AirPods with your iPhone, the AirPods will also automatically appear on your iPad, Mac, and any additional Apple products that utilize the same Apple ID. To start listening to music, podcasts, etc., simply open the AirPod case and put the AirPods in your ears.</p>
<p>In terms of sound quality, the fourth-generation Apple AirPods sound great. They deliver balanced audio with clear vocals, punchy enough bass, and relaxed tuning that allows for extended listening periods without fatiguing your ears. And they’re super comfortable, too. Each stem is relatively thin and lightweight, so you don’t get tired of wearing them.</p>
<p>Plus, the included charging case fits into a pocket or bag so you can carry the AirPods with you at all times and recharge them when needed. Simply flip the lid of the charging case and you can determine if there is sufficient battery left to continue listening or if it is time to charge the AirPods again.</p>



<p>As far as battery life, the fourth-generation Apple AirPods are capable of delivering hours of continuous listening per charge, allowing users to listen to content for extended periods of time. After the battery runs low, the AirPods can be placed back into the charging case for additional power to extend the amount of time available for listening. Users can also recharge the charging case via a cable, eliminating the need to store separate chargers for individual components.</p>
<p>These Apple AirPods build upon the ease-of-use features that were introduced in earlier generations of AirPods and offer you a budget-friendly option to upgrade or acquire a set that improve on Apple’s previous release in just about every way. If you’re interested in grabbing the new AirPods right now, be sure you lock in this deal while it’s still available.</p>

            <guid>1400371</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s seasonal content moves on with Season 2. If you’re after the Black Ops 7 Season 2 start date and times, this hub has everything you need to know about the next season and new additions.</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-reloaded-starts-thursday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a> is one of the least commercially successful CoD titles in years; you’re all still playing it anyway. A steady player count means there’s an incentive for Treyarch to deliver the goods to retain the current community. What better way to do this than with a stacked second season?</p>



<p>Season 2 is looking to carry on the game’s early momentum.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-black-ops-7-season-2-coming-out">When Is Black Ops 7 Season 2 Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Stick ’em up. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Black Ops 7 Season 2’s expected release date is currently February 5.</strong></p>



<p>Seasonal live-service models have a certain level of consistency when it comes to start dates and times. As one season ends (usually signified by that season’s Battle Pass end date and time), the next begins. Using Season 1 Reloaded’s data, it’s a fairly logical assumption that Season 2 begins on February 5.</p>



<p>If this changes, IG will update you.</p>







<h2 id="h-expected-black-ops-7-season-2-start-times">Expected Black Ops 7 Season 2 Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>As pretty much all Call of Duty seasons start at 9 AM PT, you can look forward to Black Ops 7 Season 2 starting at 9 AM PT first, with other regions facing a slightly different time relative to time zones.</strong></p>



<p>No extra words needed for this one, just check out the table below to see when Season 2 should get underway where you live.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Black Ops 7 Season 2 Start Times &amp; Dates</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">9:00 AM—January 8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">11:00 AM—January 8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">12:00 PM—January 8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">5:00 PM—January 8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4:00 AM—January 9</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-all-new-black-ops-7-season-2-content-ranked-amp-new-maps">All New Black Ops 7 Season 2 Content: Ranked &amp; New Maps</h2>



<p><strong>Early indications are that BLOPS 7 Season will add Ranked Play for the first time in this iteration, along with new and classic maps, and the usual slew of guns and game modes.</strong></p>



<p>At this early juncture, it’s safe to assume the usual carousel of seasonal content is coming. The armory needs restocking with new toys, game modes are needed to inject new life into the core gameplay, and it wouldn’t be a new season without the new Battle Pass and cosmetics, would it?</p>



<p>But two main additions will likely dominate the headlines: Ranked and Maps.</p>



<h3 id="h-maps">Maps</h3>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-black-ops-7-season-2-maps-have-already-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Black Ops 7 Season 2 Maps leaked</a> well ahead of time. They include <strong>Plaza</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Slums</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Yemen</strong>. There’s always going to be remasters, as it’s easy for the devs, and it helps boost the content count for a new season. On the other hand, no one’s going to reject the chance to play on different maps, especially classics.</p>



<p>There are likely going to be more announced.</p>



<h3 id="h-ranked-mode">Ranked Mode</h3>



<p>You’ve been asking for it, and Treyarch is finally delivering. Ranked Play is coming to BLOPS 7, and it starts with Season 2. Furthermore, it doesn’t appear to be a midseason drop either: Insider Gaming has more on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ranked-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Mode release date</a>.</p>



<p>This signals a new grind for the more experienced and hardcore users among you.</p>



<p>Head to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> to explain what you’re looking forward to most about Season 2.

<p>A new report about The Witcher 3’s upcoming rumoured DLC says it could take players to a brand-new region. </p>



<p>Talks about a new The Witcher 3 DLC have been circulating on the internet for quite some time now. Lastly, we learned that the rumoured expansion is scheduled for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-will-receive-a-new-dlc-in-may-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release in May 2026</a>. Now, it seems some additional details about this expansion have surfaced online, suggesting exploration of Zerrikania. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-3-s-rumoured-dlc-could-be-centered-around-the-zerrikania-region">The Witcher 3’s Rumoured DLC Could Be Centered Around the Zerrikania Region</h2>



<p>A report by <a href="https://pl.ign.com/wiedzmin-3/69405/news/wiedzmin-3-nowe-dlc-zabierze-nas-na-pustynie-ujawniamy-nasze-informacje-sprzed-lat-i-rzucamy-nowe-sw?fbclid=IwY2xjawPKJn1leHRuA2FlbQIxMQBzcnR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN Poland</a> reveals that they have been aware of The Witcher 3’s rumoured DLC for some time; however, they decided not to disclose any information until now. According to what they had learned then, it seems that The Witcher 3’s DLC will take players to a brand-new desert region, where they will encounter exotic fauna and culture, a lot like “Dune-Style” Witcher. What’s more, there are a lot of hints in the games and the books about this region. </p>



<p>The Manticore School is situated in the Zerrikanian desert, which Geralt discovered in The Witcher 3’s Blood and Wine DLC. Additionally, many characters have referenced the school or the desert in the series. There’s also speculation that this is where Ciri could take her Trial of the Grasses and become a Witcher before the arrival of The Witcher 4. </p>



<p>However, information about this new region for The Witcher 3’s DLC surfaced years ago; players should definitely treat it with caution.</p>







<p>In other news, CD Projekt RED has confirmed that The Witcher 4 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-the-witcher-4-not-releasing-in-2026-new-trilogy-sticking-to-6-year-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not release in 2026 and the new trilogy will stick to the 6-year plan</a>. Additionally, check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-sword-replica/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full-scale replica</a> of The Witcher’s Aerondight Silver Sword.

Artwork by Bogna Gawrońska and Marek Madej.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While IGN Poland cautions that this information dates back several years, it also goes on to list a string of reasons why Zerrikania makes a lot of sense for the expansion, due to various hints at a Zerrikanian Manticore School in previous expansion Blood and Wine, and references to the region made by other characters. The same school is also a part of The Witcher's tabletop RPG — as seen in the artwork above.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Separately, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> report has given a more black-and-white reason why this expansion is likely real and expected to launch in 2026: because there's currently a gap in CD Projekt's employee incentive program target indicative of the company launching something expected to earn significant money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Eurogamer notes, CD Projekt doesn't really have anything else expected to fit the bill, with The Witcher 4 not set for launch until 2027 at the earliest, and Cyberpunk 2 after that. Work on a new IP is also ongoing, but even further off.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a possibility still that this could relate to some other, smaller Witcher spinoff, but with all the smoke around a Witcher 3 expansion now rising, everything looks to be pointing in the same direction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As "full production" on The Witcher 4 continues, CD Projekt has cautioned fans not to expect its launch in 2026, as the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-still-plans-to-launch-all-3-games-in-the-new-ciri-fronted-the-witcher-trilogy-within-a-6-year-period">plans an ambitious six-year roadmap in which it will also launch The Witcher 5 and The Witcher 6</a>. Before all of that, there's a window this year for even more Witcher, and a fresh slice of content that could potentially help bridge the gap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A new DLC feels like a smart idea to reawaken lapsed interest ahead of the series' next chapter, via extra content sold to The Witcher 3's existing audience of more than 60 million players. This content could be used as a reason to sell the game anew, to bring fresh fans to the decade-old role-player, and potentially set up plot points to be expanded upon in the franchise's eventual sequels. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

The expectation is that Reunion will be made official in the imminent future, and launch not long after.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Life is Strange: Reunion is particularly notable as it appears to revive (or return) the character of Chloe, the original game's blue-haired best friend (or love interest) that you could sacrifice (or save) depending on your choices. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deck Nine's most recent Life is Strange game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Double Exposure</a>, received a negative reaction from many core fans of the series for returning to the story of original main character Max Caulfield in a reality in which Chloe survived the events of the franchise's first game but did not appear in person. Fans of the pair's romantic relationship option were particularly upset, as Double Exposure explained that the two characters were now broken up, seemingly permanently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Purported leaks from within Deck Nine Games amid this backlash painted a picture of a troubled development, but also mentioned a further game being in the works that did feature Chloe. Reunion certainly seems to be this project — and it will be interesting to see whether its final version feels like it has been shaped by feedback to Double Exposure.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Life Is Strange: Double Exposure Reveal Trailer Screenshots - Xbox Games Showcase 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Chloe Price was Max Caulfield's partner in time," reads a description of the game published by PEGI. "Losing her is Max's greatest regret. Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max's help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other plot details include a character hallucinating on mushrooms, and a scene where a building is on fire with people trapped inside. The game will reportedly begin with a recap of previous Life is Strange entries, in which it sounds like we'll see Chloe during the events of the first game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A digital deluxe version of the game will also be offered, containing additional outfits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Life is Strange: Reunion is yet to be officially announced by publisher Square Enix, but it likely won't be long now.

            <p>
Last January, our reviewer Brendan "Shitty Shitty Wham Bam" Caldwell <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-summer-car-review-a-sordid-sim-of-piss-and-pistons-that-wont-hold-your-disgusting-little-hand">called</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-summer-car">My Summer Car</a> "a sordid sim of piss and pistons that won't hold your disgusting little hand", proceeding to warn that it "will either scare you off with its complexity or induce Stockholm syndrome with its mesmerisingly neglectful approach". Out now in early access, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-winter-car">My Winter Car</a> is all of that plus the "terrible coldness and darkness of Finnish winter", in the words of developers Amistech Games.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The devs add that "it is hard to keep a track even of the time of the day. World around seems to go forward, but player is spiraling even deeper in the pit he was establishing already in the original game." Awesome! In context, the presence of a generative AI disclosure on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4164420/My_Winter_Car/">the Steam page</a> feels entirely appropriate, like luxuriously urinating all over a deep-frozen turd sandwich.
</p>
<p>
The premise seemingly remains that you are trying to fix up a horrible car without dying of immolation, dehydration, lightning strike, and falling off your moped, amongst other foul ends. Now, you also have to worry about pervasive ice and snow. The "cinematic" teaser video below is insultingly opaque, showing only a man in a bobble hat having a smoke next to a covered trailer, in vague echo of Nintendo president Satoru Iwata <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3d8sjh/what_is_the_story_behind_iwata_and_the_bananas/">contemplating a banana</a>, except that My Winter Car is unlikely to be rich in either potassium or wholesome, Nintendo-ish fun. Regarding the developer's comment about losing track of time above, it's worth noting that there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utsjoki">parts of Finland</a> in winter where the sun doesn't rise for months.

<p>
There was a pinch of genAI stuff in the original My Summer Car, too. It appears to be more prevalent this time. "Some base textures have been AI generated during the development," the devs note in their disclosure. "Some of the imagery and speech audio in the in-game TV programs are AI generated. Some in-game radio music is AI generated."</p><p>Honestly, the use of AI generation for a game like My Winter Car is a frightfully unreadable escalation of the debate around generative AI. Much as I despise the bigger mass market implementations of the tech for their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">corrosive and reductive effect on art and culture</a>, that very infamy makes genAI a good fit for a game that, as Brendy wrote, appears borne of putrid misanthropy and "snickering schadenfreude". I have a terrible feeling that a My Generated Car game would do well, however unlikely to appear on any NVIDIA showcases.
