            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">Microsoft laying off 9,000 people</a> across the company this week, with a significant portion of them coming from its Xbox and gaming business, meant several projects being cancelled before they could see the light of day. One of the more significant cancellations was a game codenamed <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">Project Blackbird</a>, and MMORPG from The Elder Scrolls Online developer, ZeniMax Online.</p>



<p>More details about what this MMORPG would have become have been trickling out since news of the layoffs started to break earlier this week, like how recently, development on the project was progressing well despite some <a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-zos-mmorpg-was-heading-in-a-great-direction-and-new-engine-had-found-its-footing-says-lead-graphics-programmer/">early issues with the game's engine</a>. Microsoft's chief executive officer of its gaming division, <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/">Phil Spencer, reportedly loved what ZeniMax Online was creating</a>, even going so far as to needing the controller ripped from his hands in order for a meeting to actually continue. </p>



<p>Clearly, though, not even Spencer's admiration of the game could get in the way of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-xbox-ai-tools-game-development-laying-off-thousands/">Microsoft's larger AI-driven goals</a>, which are reportedly a key factor behind the cuts. </p>



<p>As far as what Project Blackbird would have become, we've already heard a few details from reports that described it as a third-person shooter that would have had a sci-fi setting, with a major focus on player movement as a key aspect of gameplay, with players having the ability to double-jump, dash, make use of a grapple hook, wall-climb. It was as key to the gameplay as shooting would have been, according to reports we've already heard. Now, a new report from <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/canceled-xbox-mmo-project-blackbird">True Achievements</a> goes into even deeper detail as to what Blackbird was going to be, describing elements of its story, setting, and gameplay. </p>



<p>True Achievements corroborates what we've already heard, that ZeniMax Online was building a sci-fi setting and a third-person shooter/action game, and further elaborates on the setting, claiming that players would have stepped into the shoes of a type of character called a Revenant, "<em>an operative working for alien syndicates on a remote, tidally locked planet called Soteria</em>."</p>



<p>Soteria was said to have been an ice planet on one side while the other was constantly sweltering under an oppressive sun, with an area in the middle called 'The Twilight Band' that was actually habitable. There was a sentient AI named PAN, a race of aliens who thought they were better than everyone else, various syndicates that players could side with, an aquatic race of aliens, a furry alien race, and a race of aliens that could purge the depths of your mind for secrets. All solid ingredients for the foundation of a sci-fi world.</p>



<p>Missions could involve up to four players, with some larger missions involving up to six players at a time, each dolled out by the various syndicates you could work for. Humans also fit into the story, with the various alien races understandably cautious about humans after a high-ranking alien officer was killed in a human neighborhood. That's where much of Blackbird's "<em>alien noir themes</em>" came from, as you dug into the mystery behind the murder and rose through the ranks of this sci-fi world.</p>



<p>All together, this MMORPG from ZeniMax Online sounds like it would have been something far more expansive than what it had built with The Elder Scrolls Online, which is one of the worlds largest and most successful MMORPGs. There's never a guarantee that any game will be a hit, but everything we've heard about Project Blackbird so far suggests that it was going to be something incredible. Now, its cancellation remains a stain on the legacy of the current Microsoft leadership and their clear inability to manage talented developers and studios.</p>

"I am going to screw on my happy cap and try to find some upbeat/quirky news, because I feel like we could do with a bit," I declared to the RPS Slack just now, after writing our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-studios-canned-blackbird-game-was-a-nimble-high-flying-shooter-claims-report">eighth layoff/cancellation post</a> this week. The very next thing I click is a link for a game about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3842300/Hell_Builder/">building hell</a>. Not today, Satan. "Amnesia flying meat orb! Amnesia flying meat orb!" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qpJsLRhvUk">suggests</a> James. James, you are not helping. Why are you never helping. Oh, what's this? An unbeatably broken <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-bosses">Elden Ring Nightreign bossfight</a>? Perhaps this is the champion who will lead us out of our endless technofeudal apocalypse. No seriously, I think Animus, Ascendant Light is really onto something, here.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The misfiring FromSoft bossfight in question is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-everdark-sovereigns">Nightreign's enhanced Everdark Sovereign edition</a> of the Sentient Pest, which is actually three bosses in one. The basic version of that fight pits you against two huge insects. The enhanced edition adds a massive red moth which swoops in when you kill one of the other two and possesses it, reviving the creature in a powered-up state.</p>
<p>You can damage the red moth by attacking the revived critters. The trouble is, Animus has been going AWOL. Despite a hotfix this week, players continue to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lrhc2e/we_killed_the_two_so_fast_that_animus_bugged_out/">report cases</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/fromsoftware-is-struggling-to-squash-an-elden-ring-nightreign-bug-that-sees-its-new-third-boss-bug-vanish-from-a-notorious-duo-bug-fight-making-it-impossible-to-win/">Gamesradar</a>) of the battle extending indefinitely because the third boss refuses to show up. The trigger condition for this issue appears to be killing both the original bugs at the same time, but the situation remains murky. A permanent solution is <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1941051928022339943">forthcoming</a>.
</p>
<p>
I enjoy this partly because it suggests Animus is refusing to play favourites between the two other pests, and partly because it feels like Animus has been taking notes from <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/just-walk-out-you-can-leave-running-skeleton">Da Share Zone</a> - and who could blame a From Software boss for wanting to Just Walk Out, Skeleton (co-op player battles if your quick). These magnificent creatures have been getting their faces kicked off for a decade, with Youtubers dedicating whole careers to their dissection, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a> specifically is a live service mincing machine. You could fill a kaiju birdfeeder with all the Sentient Pests players have chopped and shredded so far.</p>
<p>So good on Animus, I say. Good on it for washing its proboscis of the whole stinking debacle. Good on it for divesting from the GaaS industry. I am going to follow in its footsteps by refusing to come to work tomorrow. That'll teach the status quo who's boss.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Forza Motorsport "is no more", according to a former employee at Turn 10 Studios, though the Horizon series will continue.</p>
<p>Fred Russell, who worked at the studio as content coordinator for four years until 2016, shared a post on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AlfaMale164S/posts/pfbid02mgvk2jQz4X6qum7CiHzVn5YceHn7vHEzpWHYT1913tJBV8XCufKY8knnGjYTzgzbl">Facebook</a> with images from across his time working on the series. "Turn 10 Studios has shuttered the Forza Motorsport space and the team is no more," he said. "A very sad day for one of the best car racing video games. I loved my time there."</p>
<p>In a follow-up reply, Russell added: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> will continue at this point." Another reply from Russell states "the studio is open to support the Horizon side… shuttered the Forza Motorsport side only."</p>

<p>Though it's unclear officially how many have been laid off from Turn 10, losses include the likes of Business Operations Program Manager Jordy Ressler and content creator John Schommer, who worked at the studio for over a decade. "I'm very thankful for the 10 years I was able to be a face and voice for this brand and its awesome car loving community," replied Schommer on Russell's post.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft for clarification on the future of both the series and the studio.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">Microsoft laid off a reported 9,000 employees across the business</a>, including significant cuts from its gaming division. This included nearly 50 percent of Turn 10 being impacted by layoffs, according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier.</p>
<p>Other cuts included layoffs at Zenimax and King, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">cancellations of Rare's Everwild</a>, The Initiative's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Perfect Dark, and an unannounced Zenimax MMORPG</a>.</p>
<p>The Forza Motorsport series began in 2005 for the original Xbox, developed by Turn 10 and published by Microsoft. A sim racer to rival the likes of Gran Turismo, it spawned seven follow-up games in addition to the more casual spin-off Forza Horizon from Playground Games.</p>
<p>Over time, the Horizon games have outperformed the Motorsport series.</p>
<p>Playground Games, meanwhile, is now developing the eagerly anticipated next game in the Fable RPG series. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-fable-reboot-delayed-into-next-year">delayed earlier this year into 2026</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-motorsport-is-no-more-claims-former-turn-10-employee-following-microsoft-cuts]]></content:encoded>

In dungeons, this typically means four to six items, while raid bosses can drop up to 12 depending on the raid’s difficulty setting. Anecdotally, it also seems as if dungeon monsters have a greater chance to drop green- and blue-quality items.</p><figure id="" data-id="042245259078f2262a89a4c38c174884" data-recommend-id="image://042245259078f2262a89a4c38c174884" data-format="jpg" data-width="758" data-height="521" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows loot rewards in WoW." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows loot rewards in WoW." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Thomas Wilde / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="042245259078f2262a89a4c38c174884" data-recommend-id="image://042245259078f2262a89a4c38c174884" data-format="jpg" data-width="758" data-height="521" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows loot rewards in WoW." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is a great opportunity to hunt down any transmogrification items you’ve been missing.

Aggramar’s flaming sword Taeshalach has been a popular transmogrification option since <em>Legion </em>came out, and Argus has a low chance to drop his scythe.</p><hr><h2 id="h169076"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Battle for Azeroth</strong></em></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Sharkbait’s Favorite Crackers</strong>, Harlan Sweete, mythic Freehold</li><li><strong>Mummified Raptor Skull</strong>, King Dazar, mythic King’s Rest</li><li><strong>Underrot Crawg Harness</strong>, Unbound Abomination, mythic Underrot</li><li><strong>G.M.O.D.</strong>, High Tinker Mekkatorque, Battle for Dazar’lor</li><li><strong>Glacial Tidestorm</strong>, Jaina Proudmoore, mythic Battle for Dazar’lor</li><li><strong>Ny’alotha Allseer</strong>, N’Zoth the Corruptor, Ny’alotha</li></ul><p>While anyone in Champion-track <em>TWW </em>gear or better should blast through most <em>BfA </em>content like it isn’t there, this is also where raid encounter design can get a bit tricky. For example, the Stormwall Blockade encounter in Dazar’lor has an instant kill built into it if you don’t interrupt Catastrophic Tides in time. (If you’re a warlock, make sure your felhunter is out.)</p><p>The entrance to Ny’alotha can appear in either Uldum or the Vale of Eternal Blossoms depending on where the Black Empire is attacking in a given week. You can solo N’Zoth these days without the old <em>BfA</em> legendary cloak, but at current <em>TWW</em> gear levels, you cannot simply burst N’Zoth hard enough to ignore his central mechanics. You’ll need to enter his Mindgates and reclaim your Severed Consciousness or you’ll simply drop dead.</p><hr><h2 id="h169077"><a id=""></a><strong>Shadowlands</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Marrowfang’s Reins</strong>, Nalthor the Rimebinder, mythic Necrotic Wake</li><li><strong>Cartel Master’s Gearglider</strong>, So’leah, Tazavesh</li><li><strong>Sanctum Gloomcharger’s Reins</strong>, The Nine, Sanctum of Domination</li><li><strong>Vengeance’s Reins</strong>, Sylvanas Windrunner, mythic Sanctum of Domination</li><li><strong>Fractal Cypher of the Zereth Overseer</strong>, The Jailer, mythic Sepulcher of the First Ones</li></ul><p>While there are a couple of ways to reach various parts of the Shadowlands without having to go through its introductory sequence, you’ll typically end up out of phase with most of the features and characters. To get into places like the Maw or Zereth Mortis on a new character, you’ll need to start their introductory quests by talking to the Knights of Ebon Blade in either Stormwind or Orgrimmar.</p><p>Like BfA, there are a few different bosses in <em>Shadowlands </em>with instant-kill gimmicks, particularly in mythic raids. While none of them have the firepower to really bother a level 80 character, given the stat inflation between this expansion and <em>TWW</em>, a few have abilities that can seriously ruin a solo raider’s day. Particular offenders here include the Jailer’s mind control, Soulrender Dormazain’s Warmonger Shackles, and Artificer Xy’mox’s Stasis Traps. Keep an eye on your dungeon journal.</p><p>At time of writing, So’leah is also difficult to beat solo, as her dungeon gimmick gives her a massive damage reduction bonus that you can’t dispel without a team. You can either autoattack her for 10 minutes, bring friends, or use a level 80 monk’s Touch of Death to bypass her shields and drop her in one hit.</p><p>Collector’s Bounty in <em>World of Warcraft</em> is currently planned to last until July 28.</p><p>.  </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/world-of-warcraft-collectors-bounty-july-legacy-content-1851785640]]></content:encoded>

It’s the day <em>Kotaku</em> completes the sacrament of forgiveness for AAA coverage by dedicating large amounts of space to smaller games. It’s also a good pun.</p><p>How is this difference to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/search?blogId=9&amp;q=thanksgaming&amp;timestamp=1751627095567&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/search?blogId=9&amp;q=thanksgaming&amp;timestamp=1751627095567">Thanksgaming</a></span>, you ask? Shush. It’s a <em>good pun</em>. Unlike “Thanksgaming.”</p><p>As ever, I solicited submissions from independent developers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/botherer.bsky.social/post/3lt35nxrxqk2r&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/botherer.bsky.social/post/3lt35nxrxqk2r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via social media</a></span>, which has resulted in hundreds of emails (239 as I start writing this), from which I will choose entirely at random. And then use a level of discretion. I implore you to look through them all, and wishlist anything that grabs your interest—doing so makes a massive difference for the developers, because it affects the mysterious algorithms running under Steam, and helps these games get more attention. Also, it’ll remind you to buy the game when it’s out!</p><p>Given most of these will be unreleased games, I obviously haven’t played them, so inclusion here is not an indication of their quality—we’re going on vibes, folks. But anything that can help get eyes on any of the approximately 20,000 games that will be released on Steam this year makes a big difference. </p><p>Last bit of business: I’ve compiled this as a slideshow, and you have to just suck that up. It pays the bills, and it’s how I can get this on the site. (But top tip: if you’re browsing on desktop, just narrow your browser window to a portrait width and it’ll unfurl into one long article.)</p></div></div><div><p>It’s bizarre to note that <em>Cupiclaw</em> is not the first rogue-lite deckbuilding claw machine game I’ve seen! At the end of last year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dungeon-clawler-slay-the-spire-deckbuilder-claw-machine-1851715384&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dungeon-clawler-slay-the-spire-deckbuilder-claw-machine-1851715384"><em>Dungeon Clawler</em></a></span> was released, and it’s combination of <em>Slay the Spire</em> and arcade machine is fantastic. And it only makes me want more games using the mechanic. <em>Cupiclaw</em> takes a very different approach, however, feeling more inspired by the likes of <em>Balatro</em>: here you scoop items from the claw machine into a prize pool, and the items you gather affect one another based on their properties. You could end up blowing up all your winnings, or massively multiplying them, with the ability to tweak the contents of the machine in between rounds. I can’t wait! And am installing the demo.</p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Typin<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2967670/Cupiclaw/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2967670/Cupiclaw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span></p></div><div><p>Browsing the unfiltered new release lists on Steam, as I do every week, I see a <em>lot</em> of games calling themselves “survival horror.” Few look like anything I’d want to play. But wow, <em>In Hope Voiden</em> is grabbing me. First, that name! What a name. Secondly, well just watch the trailer. Look at that art! It just looks stunning, and very, very spooky. It describes itself as having both permadeath <em>and</em> persistent consequences, which is deeply ambitious—you’ll play as 12 different characters, each with a unique task to complete, and their failures impinging on all the others. Wow.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Stillburch Games<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3726180/In_Hope_Voiden/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3726180/In_Hope_Voiden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span></p></div><div><p>Time travelling pirates is a woefully under-used genre, so thank goodness for <em>Time Travel Shanty</em>. This is a third-person action game, with apparently some roguelite (because that’s law now) and some metroidvania. It looks like good fun, somewhere between <em>Hades</em> and <em>Zelda</em>, although right now movement looks a little stilted. (And there’s one heck of a typo in the trailer!) There’s no release date yet, so presumably still lots of time and work to come—definitely on my wishlist.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> gypynkt<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1688140/Time_Travel_Shanty/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1688140/Time_Travel_Shanty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>In 2002, before widespread indie gaming was a twinkle in the milkman’s eye, there was a game called <em>Platypus</em>. It was a horizontal scrolling shooter, with all its art made via claymation, and was a critical, and lingering, success. Originally distributed via CD-ROM (because it would have to be!), it went on to get a PSP release, and then in 2009 was released for both PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Indie Games. Rather sadly, the original creators lost control, and a sequel was made and released without their involvement in 2007. But don’t frown! Original developer Anthony Flack has bought back the rights, and is working with a new team on a remake. That’s this. It’s a total remake, reprogrammed, and brand new claymation. Those gloopy clay explosions look so fun.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Claymatic Games<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2912430/Platypus_Reclayed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2912430/Platypus_Reclayed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>The world is ending. I mean, that’s not breaking news, but it’s also the premise in <em>Exark</em>, a pixel-based city-builder, set on an enormous flying ark on its journey toward the rim of the world.</p><p>I’m just enormously pleased to inform you this is a game that involves mining cheese, and indeed rearranging the organs of a manta ray-shaped demi-god. Those are the two elements I look for in any game, so I’m well in. Also, <em>oh my goodness</em>, look at the little idle animations on those pixel animals!</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Robot Cat Limited<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3435610/Exark/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3435610/Exark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>With obvious Rare vibes, <em>Teeto</em> is a third-person action-platformer, in which you play a little blue dude giving a rabbit a piggyback. Apparently the rabbit made the blue blob? It’s from a New Zealand couple (apparently one proposed to the other via the game?!), with their own toddler providing voice work. Your globular blue guy can absorb objects from the world, taking on their properties, <em>Kirby</em>-style, while you leap around a world in the manner of a <em>Spyro</em>.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Eat Pant Games<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2783370/Teeto/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2783370/Teeto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>You know what <em>Liha</em> looks like to me? As if <em>Descent</em> were made by a <em>Darwinia</em>-era Introversion. And to be absolutely clear, that’s about as high as my compliments get. </p><p>Obviously, because otherwise there’s a $45 million fine from the Indie Police, this is a roguelite, where each of your 360 degree exploratory dives to collect tech and upgrades can end in disaster. But that sounds like a great concept, and I want to play it now. NOW. But it’s not out yet, dammit. Oh, but there <em>is</em> a demo!</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Game Kombinat<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332820/Liha/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332820/Liha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>So many explosions! This is a proper old-school space shooter, but presented in proper new-school pretties. Yes, roguelite, but inspired by both <em>Star Fox</em> and <em>Armored Core</em>, this really does seem to want to recapture space combat arcade gaming. Plus, I love the ambiguity in the art, the smokiness of the battles. You can see for yourself in a demo.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Huskrafts<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/782260/Rogue_Eclipse/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/782260/Rogue_Eclipse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>I swear to god, I scour Steam for new point-and-click adventures all the time, so I have no idea how <em>Leaving Home</em> snuck past me last month. Thank goodness I stumbled on it here instead.</p><p>This is by Bart Bonte, who has been making super-stylized puzzle games for a long time, most especially during the Flash era. His latest, as you might have surmised from the title, is about leaving a home. But, not forever, just for the day. I’ve got it installing already.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Bart Bonte<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> Out Now<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3726770/Leaving_Home/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3726770/Leaving_Home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>As soccer becomes an ever-bigger deal in the U.S., you have to wonder which other British-dominated sports could make the transition. But surely never cricket. So massively popular in Australasia, Africa, South Asia and the West Indies, as well as the UK, it remains utterly unfathomable to the United States. So, what if someone took cricket, and combined with with a rhythm action game?!</p><p>Incredibly, that’s the conceit of <em>Bat to the Beat</em>, a game by Kunal Joshi, based out of Michigan. It sounds splendidly bonkers, and there’s a demo to double-check.</p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Kunal Joshi<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> Q3 2025<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3236170/Bat_to_the_Beat/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3236170/Bat_to_the_Beat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span></p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/indiepenance-day-indie-games-demo-steam-wishlist-1851785644]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 Dock" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9299fed9e4f4b/switch-2-dock.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Remember all of the confusion around whether the Switch 2 supports VRR? One moment, it did both docked and handheld, before Nintendo started removing wording surrounding docked VRR from websites and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-apologises-for-error-with-mention-of-switch-2-vrr-tv-support">then apologised "for the error"</a>.</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/697937/nintendo-switch-2-vrr-steam-deck-rog-x-ally-120hz">The Verge</a> (paywalled) has made an interesting discovery — the Switch 2's dock <em>does</em> support VRR, but it doesn't work with the Switch 2 itself. How did editor Sean Hollister find this out? By taking inspiration from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1lnh0fe/psa_switch_2_dock_supports_vrr_and_hdr_on_steam/">SteamDeck subreddit</a> and plugging a Steam Deck into the dock. It's that simple.</p>
<p>Using a USB-C male-to-female extension cable, you can plug your Steam Deck directly into the Switch 2's Dock, where the option to enable VRR will pop up. So if you really want to, you can play your Steam Deck games at 4K and 120fps this way.</p>

<p>Other handhelds tested include Lenovo Legion Go S using SteamOS, and the Asus ROG Ally X using the <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">BazziteOS</a>, another Linux-based operating system. And rather than just relying on the menu, Hollister did use an open-source VRR testing tool. So we're all good.</p>
<p>So it begs the question — why the heck is Nintendo not taking advantage of this? It could be that the company wants to do more testing before issuing a firmware update later down the line. We're not going to know the answer, basically.</p>
<p>And hey, at least VRR <em>is</em> readily available undocked.</p>
<p><em>Have you tried plugging your handheld PC into your Switch 2 dock? Do you want to see VRR support enabled on Switch 2 while docked? Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

			<p>Destiny: Rising, the alternate-timeline mobile version of Destiny Bungie has been making alongside publisher NetEase will arrive on iOS and Android devices this coming August 28, 2025, Bungie and NetEase have announced.</p>



<p>The game was first revealed last <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-rising-brings-the-sci-fi-franchise-to-mobile-thanks-to-netease/">October</a>, featuring recognizable faces from the Destiny universe, though this new mobile-exclusive version of Bungie's popular FPS doesn't expand on the story Bungie is telling in Destiny 2. Its alternate-timeline setting means a number of lore changes to characters, but more significantly, bringing the game to mobile means gameplay changes, like not being able to craft your own Guardian. </p>

<p>Instead, players can choose between pre-designed heroes from the Destiny universe, like Ikora Rey and Iron Lord Jolder. That said, players do also have the choice of playing as Wolf, a new character and "<em>fully customizable Lightbearer</em>," according to a press release for the game's release date reveal. </p>



<p>Veteran Destiny fans will also feel right at home in Rising with its strike missions, larger-scale six-player PvE missions, and, of course, PvP game modes that let players battle it out against each other. The gameplay shown off in the release date trailer also shows that even on mobile, there's no mistaking it for something other than a game set in the world of Destiny. </p>

            <p>The new MMO from the Elder Scrolls Online developers would reportedly have been a sci-fi noir affair in which players swing around tall buildings on grappling lines, and do aerial dashes while shooting and looting. Call it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> Spider-Man. Call it Destiny 2077. Call it whatever you like, frankly, because it has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-mmorpg-from-the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-has-reportedly-been-cancelled-as-part-of-microsofts-layoffs">abandoned</a> as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">wider layoffs at parent company Microsoft</a>, the outfit that made tens of billions of dollars in profit this past financial quarter, yet has decided to jettison thousands of staff in the name of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">"discipline" and "continued success"</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>The report in question is from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-03/microsoft-s-xbox-cancels-blackbird-an-upcoming-game-that-impressed-executives">Bloomberg</a>, where Jason Schreier offers a brief account of the Blackbird project's final hours. Previously codenamed Kestrel, it had apparently been in development since 2018, and was a third-person shooter with looting elements and a heavy emphasis on vertical movement - grapples, double-jumps, aerial dashes, and wall-climbing. According to Bloomberg, ZeniMax Online Studios envisaged the game as the beginning of a "new franchise", running alongside Elder Scrolls Online, which has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-online-f2p">a wobbly endeavour at times</a> but is currently quite the success story, earning a reported $2 billion in total revenue by 2024.</p>
<p>By March this year, the development team had reportedly expanded to 300 people, and Xbox executives Phil Spencer and Matt Booty are said to have been impressed by a demo they sampled in March 2025. But the positivity was not to last. According to Bloomberg's sources, staff were shocked to learn this week that ZeniMax Online Studios head Matt Firor had left the company, and that project Blackbird had been "indefinitely shelved".</p>
<p>Many of those employees now face redundancy, pending the outcome of a haggle over things like severance packages between Microsoft and their union. A Microsoft spokesperson has confirmed this much to Bloomberg, commenting "represented employees are awaiting information regarding these proposed impacts and next steps, which are subject to negotiations with the union".</p>
<p>The scale of Microsoft's recent earnings make this week's layoffs feel like an enormous practical joke. Still, I can guess at elements of the executive reasoning here. Live service games are both costly and increasingly risky, because there is so much competition. Schreier also claims that ZeniMax Online Studios were developing the game's engine technology alongside the game itself, which in my experience covering such things is a hard act to pull off.</p>
<p>Still, assuming Bloomberg's reporting is legit, the fact remains that the C-suits liked it and Microsoft seem to have doubloons to spare right now. Best of luck to everybody affected.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-studios-canned-blackbird-game-was-a-nimble-high-flying-shooter-claims-report]]></content:encoded>

However, <em>Resident Evil</em> has been on an upswing for the last few years, which has brought a lot of new fans to the series. This is primarily meant for them.</p><h2 id="h391968"><a id=""></a>Who is Grace Ashcroft?</h2><p>The <em>Requiem </em>trailer introduced us to Grace Ashcroft, a young FBI agent who’s sent to visit the site of her mother Alyssa’s murder. For anyone who was playing <em>RE </em>20 years ago, that instantly set off alarm bells.</p><p>Alyssa Ashcroft, a reporter for a local newspaper in Raccoon City, was one of eight playable characters in 2004’s <em>Resident Evil Outbreak</em> and its sequel, 2005’s <em>File #2</em>. Both were a unique online spin on the original survival horror formula where you could team with up to three other players to survive one of 10 scenarios set during the death of Raccoon City. This included the chance to revisit several key locations from the original versions of <em>Resident Evil 2, 3, </em>and <em>Zero</em>, such as Umbrella’s underground laboratories, the Raccoon Hospital, and the police station.</p><p><em>Outbreak </em>initially<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html#tab5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html#tab5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> sold very well</a></span> off the strength of the <em>Resident Evil </em>name, but had famously terrible load times. It was also a PlayStation 2 exclusive, so to access online play, you had to buy a<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2_online_functionality&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2_online_functionality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> special network adapter</a></span>. (Some territories, such as Australia, didn’t even get that.) If you did, <em>Outbreak </em>had its own famously janky lobby/matchmaking systems and, in a peculiar decision by the developers, didn’t have voice chat.</p><p>While <em>File #2 </em>fixed a lot of the first game’s mechanical issues and had better overall scenario design, word had already gotten around about <em>Outbreak</em>’s shortcomings. As a result, <em>File #2 </em>bombed in most markets, which reportedly put a stop to Capcom’s plans to continue the series. Some previews from the time suggested there were another 10 scenarios in planning stages, five of which could be partially accessed by using a Game Shark on the <em>File #2 </em>disc.</p><p>Capcom subsequently released <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>in 2005, which put a hard stop to the<em> RE </em>franchise’s classic era. <em>Outbreak </em>was subsequently allowed to fall into relative obscurity, to the point where it wasn’t clear if the games were an actual part of the series’ canon.</p><p>Since then, fan opinion has turned around on <em>Outbreak</em>. The online <em>RE </em>series’ biggest issue might be that they simply came out too early and/or on the wrong platform. If <em>Outbreak </em>had been released as an early Xbox Live title, for example, it might’ve had a warmer reception. As it was, <em>Outbreak</em> was an ambitious project that released on a console that wasn’t really suited for it.</p><figure id="" data-id="9e167e4f1c4ed83e484d36a3946b5130" data-recommend-id="image://9e167e4f1c4ed83e484d36a3946b5130" data-format="jpg" data-width="345" data-height="479" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alyssa Ashcroft poses for a picture." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Alyssa Ashcroft poses for a picture." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9e167e4f1c4ed83e484d36a3946b5130" data-recommend-id="image://9e167e4f1c4ed83e484d36a3946b5130" data-format="jpg" data-width="345" data-height="479" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alyssa Ashcroft poses for a picture." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>12 years after <em>File #2</em>’s release, Alyssa Ashcroft made a cameo appearance in<em> Resident Evil 7</em> as the author of a<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Newspaper_Article_-_Over_20_Missing#Official_localisation&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Newspaper_Article_-_Over_20_Missing#Official_localisation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> newspaper article</a></span> that can be found in the main house on the Bakers’ estate. This made her the only confirmed survivor from <em>Outbreak, </em>as well as the only conclusive proof that fans ever got about <em>Outbreak</em>’s canonicity.</p><p>Now, <em>Requiem </em>appears to be a story about Alyssa’s daughter, partially set in the bombed-out ruins of Raccoon City. According to producer Masachika Kawata during the June 26th Capcom Direct, <em>RE9 </em>is set 30 years after the original disaster, placing it around 2028.</p><p>In addition to being a celebration of the franchise’s 30th anniversary, <em>Requiem </em>is another useful example of how there are no truly dead plot threads in <em>Resident Evil</em>. While there are dozens of dropped plots and characters throughout series history, Capcom routinely dives into its back catalog to find stories. If the next mainline entry in <em>RE </em>is, of all things, a follow-up to the <em>Outbreak </em>games, maybe your own favorite one-shot character has a chance to make their own return.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-outbreak-ashcroft-alyssa-grace-1851785638]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Joanna Dark actor Alix Wilton Regan has implored fans to use their voices to save Perfect Dark, after the game was cancelled by Microsoft earlier this week.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Microsoft announced a wave of layoffs across the company, with games such as its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Perfect Dark reboot, a new Zenimax MMORPG</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild all cancelled as a result</a>. At this time, Microsoft also shuttered Perfect Dark's studio, The Initiative.</p>

<p>Soon after, Joanna Dark's actor shared an image of her Perfect Dark character on <a href="https://x.com/AlixWiltonRegan/status/1940539481586913465">social media</a>, calling her "Resilient. Determined. Creative. Caring. Strong". Adding that her time working with The Initiative had been "an honour", Regan stated: "Agent Dark doesn't give up and neither should any of you.... like Joanna, we will all rise again."</p>
<p>Regan has now called for fans to "speak up if you wanna see Perfect Dark survive". In a <a href="https://x.com/AlixWiltonRegan/status/1941021209891909790">recent social media post</a>, the Joanna actor wrote that "a lot of people have been reaching out and floating this idea on my timeline, my phone and in my DMs, so I'm just gonna say it:</p>

<p>Meanwhile, actor Elias Toufexis - known for playing Adam Jensen in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> series - says "thousands of dollars" he was expecting will now be lost due to the cancellation of Perfect Dark.</p>
<p>In his own <a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/with_replies">post on social media</a>, Toufexis revealed he had "a good amount of days of acting in Perfect Dark" that got "scrapped" when Microsoft put an end to the reboot earlier this week.</p>
<p>"These games getting cancelled is a constant threat," Toufexis wrote, "..now every game I do as director or actor I wake up hoping it isn't cancelled."</p>
<p>In subsequent posts, the actor, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfields-sam-coe-and-andreja-actors-recorded-lines-for-the-player-character">who has also had roles in the likes of Starfield</a>, assured his followers that he does get paid for the days he works. "But when you're working on a game they 'hold' you for x amount of days each month. (so I can schedule work around other games and shows)," Toufexis elaborated.</p>
<p>"You can't help but look at the holds and think about the $ that would have been made."</p>

<p>Word of this week's layoffs at Microsoft - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">also impacted the likes of King, Raven Software and more</a> - first began last month, when a report stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-reportedly-set-for-major-job-cuts-from-next-week">Xbox was set to restructure much of its central-European distribution</a>. At this time, Bloomberg described the then-upcoming redundancies as a "major restructuring", and the fourth case of layoffs to hit Xbox in the last 18 months.</p>
<p>In May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-laying-off-3-of-workforce-in-biggest-round-of-cuts-since-2023-report">Xbox cut three percent of its total workforce</a>, which at the time was the biggest loss of staff since 2023. Previously in September 2024, Xbox laid off 650 employees, which it said was to "organise our business for long term success".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/joanna-dark-actor-asks-fans-to-call-for-perfect-dark-to-be-saved-as-adam-jensens-actor-details-financial-loss-due-to-cancellation]]></content:encoded>

<p>His appointment "could lead to an interesting future"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Shigeru Miyamoto E3 2015 dolls" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5cadad5db1bad/shigeru-miyamoto-e3-2015-dolls.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Shigeru Miyamoto has spoken about the appointment of Nintendo's newest outside director Kazuhiko Hachiya, director of the Japanese doll company <a href="https://global.petworks.store/">PetWORKS</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking at the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">85th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders Q&amp;A</a>, Miyamoto addressed a question on the increased number of outside directors "with diverse backgrounds", including Illumination CEO and <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong> co-producer Chris Meledandri and Hachiya-san, who was revealed to be joining as a member of the board <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-appoints-doll-company-executive-as-a-new-outside-director">back in May</a>.</p>
<p>"Mr. Hachiya is a media artist who is active beyond the framework of games, and I have known<br>
him personally for a long time", says Miyamoto, revealing a connection between Hachiya and Nintendo through their relationship.</p>
<p>Miyamoto says he's been "discussing" the backgrounds of all the outside directors with Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa and that the two "have been exploring various possibilities".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. Hachiya engages in unconventional activities, such as researching video games and building his own equipment. We believe that a connection between Mr. Hachiya and our company could lead to an interesting future, which is why we wanted him to join us as an outside director."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miyamoto's not wrong about Hachiya's background, which we covered briefly back when the artist was appointed. Does Miyamoto's vague answer hint at some art collaboration or Nintendo-themed dolls? Or something beyond that? We probably won't find out for a good while, anyhow.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/convocation_notice2506e.pdf">Convocation Notice of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders</a> — which is essentially an invite to the annual meeting and details the board members and the agenda — Hachiya is described as having "a wide range of achievements", which include art created by using digital tech and developing an email client.</p>
<div><p>He's also served in multiple key positions at Tokyo University of the Arts, where he is currently a professor in the Department of Intermedia Art and director of the Art Media Center. Nintendo believes that Hachiya will bring valuable experience and be able to supervise "based on his broad experience and insight in the field of art, and as a software developer and business executive".</p><p>

Essentially, we have <em>no</em> idea what this collaboration will bring about, but we're excited to see what Kazuhiko Hachiya can bring to the table.</p></div>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of Hachiya's appointment in the comments</em>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-qa-with-virtuos-i-think-we-will-see-it-surpass-the-predecessor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-q-a-with-virtuos-%E2%80%98i-think-we-will-see-it-surpass-the-predecessor%E2%80%99.1235988/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly a month since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch</a> of the massively anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 console. As part of our release coverage, we had the chance to interview two developers from game studio <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virtuos</a> to discover their initial thoughts and experiences with the latest console to enter the games market.</p>



<p>Virtuos may not be a household name to most of the public, but they have been in the industry for over twenty years, during which they have helped co-develop or port several noteworthy games, such as Heavy Rain, Horizon Zero Dawn, L.A. Noire, Dark Souls Remastered, Astral Chain, Cyberpunk 2077, Outriders, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Hogwarts Legacy, and most recently The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, to name a few.</p>



<p>Our Nintendo Switch 2 questions were answered by Alex Heise, Director of Business Development at Virtuos North America, and Eoin O’ Grady, Technical Director at Black Shamrock, a Virtuos subsidiary that contributed to Back 4 Blood, Starlink: Battle for Atlas, Grounded, Destroy All Humans!, Kerbal Space Program 2, The Outer Worlds: Spacer's Choice Edition, and Marvel's Midnight Suns.</p>




<figure></figure>




<p><strong>Firstly, Nintendo recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the Switch 2 sold over 3.5 million units in the first four days, making it the fastest-selling console ever in that timeframe. Were you expecting this level of success? What's your outlook for the console's near future?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Eoin</strong>: Given the phenomenal success of the Switch, expectations for the sales performance of the Switch 2 were already quite high. Nintendo has a huge pool of loyal fans, but alongside that, the handheld gaming market is growing right now — and I'm not talking about smartphones. The original Switch, along with the Steam Deck and other high-quality handheld gaming rigs, has contributed to growth in this area. Gamers increasingly want AAA games on the go, and so I think we will see the Switch 2 surpass its predecessor. This is precisely because it is a Nintendo console, renowned for innovation and its unique gameplay experiences, and because it meets the growing demand for gaming on the go — offering indie gems, Nintendo exclusives, and now AAA blockbuster titles.</p>



<p><strong>Alex</strong>: As the fastest-selling console launch of all time, I don’t think anyone fully predicted this level of success. That said, my expectations were certainly high for a number of reasons. First and foremost, the Switch 2 is the most iterative console Nintendo has launched in quite some time, dating back to the transition from NES to SNES. No Nintendo console has ever had a “2” in its name, and in this case, they made a strategic decision by building on the proven success and strong brand of the original Switch with a similar yet more compelling product. The value of the Switch 2 is immediately clear to gamers, improving upon past console launches such as the Wii U.</p>



<p>Another key factor contributing to the successful launch was effective supply chain management to ensure sufficient units were available. Earlier launches of competing consoles were limited by supply, capping sales and keeping products out of stock for months. Meanwhile, Nintendo clearly prepared well in advance, sourcing new partners and adjusting manufacturing locations to meet the high demand for the Switch 2.</p>



<p><strong>Can you share your thoughts on the new console? What is the most interesting new feature, in your opinion, respectively on the hardware and software side?<br></strong></p>



<p><strong>Alex</strong>: As a day one owner myself, I've been absolutely thrilled with the Switch 2 and have been playing it daily! On the hardware side, the aspect I am most impressed with is something that’s difficult to gauge without hands-on experience — and that’s the build quality. The Switch 2 feels noticeably more premium than its predecessor. One of the most appreciated improvements is the Joy-Cons’ attachment mechanism, which feels much more secure and stable, enhancing the overall durability and user experience. Simply put, among all handheld consoles currently on the market, the Switch 2 offers the best feel in hand.</p>



<p>On the software side, the eShop improvements have been both a pleasant surprise and a delight. The store now loads very quickly and is snappy to navigate. The loading times or delays when cycling across pages are gone. Additionally, the weekly personalized recommendations based on your existing library are fantastic! With so many games released these days, discovery has become a growing challenge for consumers. A curated suggestion list is a great way to address this, especially since consumers are already familiar with similar recommendations on other media platforms such as Spotify and Netflix. Lastly, the ability for trailers and images to autoplay as you scroll through the shop is a notable improvement, effectively drawing attention to games you might have otherwise overlooked. All of these changes excite me both as a developer looking forward to bringing great games to the platform and as a consumer seeking a better shopping experience.</p>



<p><strong>Eoin</strong>: I was happy to see that the new hardware supports DLSS and VRR in handheld mode. Mobile hardware inevitably faces performance constraints, and these features will go a long way towards alleviating those limitations for players. Developers should use them strategically— they can massively enhance the gaming experience, as we have seen with their implementation on other platforms.</p>



<p>The virtual game card is another wonderful addition to the platform. Many of us grew up swapping cartridges and disks—a practice that's dying out as digital downloads become the norm. Virtual game cards make swapping games with friends easier than ever, bringing back that social and nostalgic experience. I am also intrigued by the novel and communal gaming experiences that can be built with the GameShare feature.</p>




<figure></figure>




<p><strong>In terms of raw console performance, do you agree that the Switch 2 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/wild-hearts-s-qa-switch-2-is-closer-to-the-series-s-than-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closer to the Xbox Series S than it is to the PlayStation 4</a>, making it easier for developers to port their current-gen games to the hardware?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Eoin</strong>: GPU-wise, the Switch 2 performs slightly below the Series S; this difference is more noticeable in handheld mode. However, the Series S does not support technologies like DLSS, which the Switch 2 does. This makes the GPU capabilities of the two consoles comparable overall.</p>



<p>CPU-wise, there is a clearer distinction between the two consoles. The Switch 2 is closer to the PlayStation (PS) 4 in this respect, having a CPU just a bit more powerful than the PS4’s. Since most games tend to be more GPU-bound than CPU-bound when well optimized, the impact of this difference largely depends on the specific game and its target frame rate. Any game shipping at 60 FPS on the Series S should easily port to the Switch 2. Likewise, a 30 FPS Series S game that’s GPU-bound should also port well. Games with complex physics, animations, or other CPU-intensive elements might incur additional challenges in reaching 30 or 60 FPS or require extra optimization during porting.</p>



<p><strong>One of the most discussed hardware features ahead of launch is the support of NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, currently the gold standard when it comes to upscaling technology. However, not many Switch 2 launch games are taking advantage of it. Why do you think that's the case? Would you recommend that developers use it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Eoin</strong>: I think there are two main factors influencing whether DLSS is used in launch titles. The first being, is it even necessary? For games like Mario Kart World or the upcoming Donkey Kong Bananza, which feature stylized cartoon-like aesthetics, DLSS may not be needed. Mario Kart, for instance, was in development for many years with the original Switch in mind. Games like these aren’t trying to push graphical fidelity; they have different goals for their art content and tend to hit 60 FPS without relying on DLSS.</p>



<p>For third-party games, it’s worth noting that Cyberpunk 2077 has <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shipped</a> with DLSS. Compared with the Xbox Series S and PS4 versions, DLSS evidently offers better upscaling technology, making a strong case for developers to implement it. More importantly, there are also other games that could benefit from DLSS, but don’t currently utilize it—that often comes down to how these titles are being ported. It is not as simple as taking the PC DirectX implementation of DLSS and running it on the Switch. Instead, DLSS has to be integrated through Nintendo’s NVN2 graphics API, and the extra work required for this might have been deferred by some developers for their initial ports.</p>



<p><strong>Similarly, the Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supports</a> hardware-accelerated ray tracing, but barely any games are using it. Does it even make sense, or should hardware resources be focused elsewhere?<br></strong></p>



<p><strong>Eoin</strong>: Hardware ray tracing is a widely discussed feature in this generation of consoles. The Xbox Series X and PS5 support it for lighting, but maintaining stable frame rates can be challenging. Epic’s Lumen offers support for software ray tracing on the GPU as a lighter option for a lighting solution, although with Unreal Engine 5.6, focus is shifting toward further optimization of hardware ray tracing capabilities.</p>



<p>On the Series S, hardware ray tracing for lighting has not been widely pursued as an option. That is noteworthy as the Switch 2 has less ray tracing power than the Series S, and DLSS may not significantly close that gap. Beyond lighting, however, hardware ray tracing continues to be widely used across all platforms for reflections and shadows. This is where I see the most potential for the Switch 2, as it has sufficient power to deliver high-quality shadows and reflections at reasonable resolutions and frame rates.</p>




<figure></figure>




<p><strong>In your Switch 2 brief, you mentioned that the console's expanded controller features are what really set it apart. Can you discuss them and how developers should leverage them in their games?<br></strong></p>



<p><strong>Eoin</strong>: Nintendo’s innovation with its controllers continues to amaze us all. There is no other platform where the controller doubles as a motion-tracking device, a gyroscope, two smaller controllers, and now, in its latest iteration, a mouse—or more accurately, two of them. A common mistake some developers make is approaching this unique set of hardware like an ordinary game controller. If a game is ported to function like it does on any other controller, we will miss out on the fun that comes from leveraging the Switch 2’s unique features.</p>



<p>Every first-person shooter should make use of the mouse feature; motion tracking should be integrated wherever it enhances gameplay, and support for the two mini controllers should be standard in every multiplayer game. Beyond that, developers should be acutely aware of how the stick layout and controller ergonomics affect sensitivity and precision. Thorough testing and iteration to find the best user experience is a must.</p>



<p><strong>Do you think GameChat will be a game-changer when it comes to social engagement in the Nintendo Switch 2 scene?</strong><br></p>



<p><strong>Alex</strong>: GameChat represents a significant step toward enhancing the social experience on the Switch 2. It provides a more controlled and secure environment locked to the Nintendo platform, which is especially valuable for younger players and their parents. Features like seeing what your friends are playing and being able to quickly join them are essential elements of the modern social gaming ecosystem, and Nintendo has made this intuitive and simple.<br>While it builds upon the trend established by third-party social platforms like Discord, GameChat integrates these social capabilities directly within the console experience. The addition of in-game video is fun and engaging, though it does require a camera setup, which might be a barrier for some gamers. Overall, while widespread adoption remains to be seen, it is undoubtedly a valuable feature that offers a seamless way for players to connect with friends.<br></p>



<p><strong>Eoin</strong>: GameChat has multiple layers of appeal. Firstly, I think it’s an absolute win for people who enjoy co-op games, and games in that genre will be enormously enhanced. The social element is very interesting and will undoubtedly be a hit with both players who love to stream as they play and those who enjoy watching. At the moment, this feature is limited to users on the platform and those on your friends list. To become an even bigger game changer, it could integrate with existing game streaming platforms such as Twitch or YouTube. That step is one that only Nintendo can take, and if paired with some great games, it could really transform social engagement within the gaming community.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

I quickly made my way to it and was able to charge my battery, catch my breath, and protect myself for a bit from nearby BTs. As I arrived at this wonderful bit of hope that was created by another player, I smashed the PS5's touchpad, leaving hundreds of likes for the shelter’s creator in the space of a few seconds. And sometime later, they got a notification that a structure they built had helped someone and received some likes. </p><p>I know this because it happened to me many times while playing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-how-long-to-beat-sequel-story-hltb-1851785232&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-how-long-to-beat-sequel-story-hltb-1851785232"><em>Death Stranding 2</em></a></span>, which is both a video game from Hideo Kojima and the world’s first totally good and not bad social network. </p><h2 id="h175230"><a id=""></a>The Likes Economy Of <em>Death Stranding 2</em></h2><p><em>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</em> launched last month to mostly positive reviews. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-review-is-it-good-ps5-playstation-5-1851784852&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-review-is-it-good-ps5-playstation-5-1851784852">I personally enjoyed this very strange open-world post-apocalyptic cargo delivery simulator starring Norman Reedus</a></span>, even if I found the ending not very satisfying. But while <em>Death Stranding 2</em> is a game obsessed with delivering packages, connecting in-game NPCs to a larger network, and saving the world, it is also a strange multiplayer experience. </p><p>To be clear: You never meet other players directly while playing, but you can see what they build, interact with their creations, and even leave behind holographic signs, structures, and supplies. And all of this—including the mushrooms that grow from the ground when players all pee in the same spot—can be “liked” in-game as if they are pieces of content on your phone’s timeline. </p><p>This is a big part of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-vehicles-ziplines-pcc-dhv-magellan-1851785247&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-vehicles-ziplines-pcc-dhv-magellan-1851785247"><em>Death Stranding 2</em></a></span> that you can technically ignore. But good luck doing that. There is something deeply satisfying and rewarding about building a shelter or a funny sign and getting hundreds of likes for your effort. It creates this “Likes economy” where players work hard to “go viral.” However, to go viral in<em> Death Stranding 2 </em>means you have done something super helpful. </p><p>Unlike actual social media networks like Facebook or TikTok, the only way to go viral and get thousands of likes is by being a good, helpful person. If you place a ladder against a cliff and it leads to nothing, it’s likely that nobody will use it or like it. It will be buried under better, more helpful creations. And you can’t even dislike anything, either. You just have to ignore it. </p><h2 id="h175231"><a id=""></a>Helpful Spam And No Racism</h2><p>This “likes economy” does lead to many of <em>Death Stranding 2</em>'s hubs and in-game shelters being surrounded by what amounts to spam.

And as a bonus, <em>Death Stranding 2</em> doesn’t let you leave text notes or voice messages in the world. No racist garbage or awful slurs are sprinkled around. It’s just people working together to make the world of <em>Death Stranding 2</em> a better, easier place. It’s a social network that rewards kindness, empathy, care, and hope. And in 2025, we all need more of that. </p><p>I’m not foolish enough to believe <em>Death Stranding 2</em>'s social network-like features will replace Twitter or Facebook.

It developed the so-so Wii Party (not to be confused with the better Wii Play, which came with a packed-in Wii Remote), as well as the disappointing Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival on Wii U. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, Nintendo Cube released the functional Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics for Switch 1, before the infamous Everybody 1-2 Switch — a party game sequel launched with little fanfare that earned Nintendo some of its worst review scores in recent memory. ("Everybody 1-2-Switch might be the first party game I’ve played where I ended up with fewer friends afterwards," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everybody-1-2-switch-review">IGN wrote in its 4/10 appraisal</a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's for Mario Party that Nintendo Cube is best known, having taken over as the hugely popular party game series' main developer beginning with 2012's Mario Party 9 onwards, and continuing with Mario Party 10, Mario Party Star Rush, Mario Party: The Top 100, Super Mario Party and Mario Party Superstars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Cube's next launch is (deep breath) Super Mario Party Jamboree: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV, a Switch 2 update for Super Mario Party Jamboree that makes use of the new console's mouse controls and optional camera peripheral, due to arrive on July 24.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While a budget-priced release, criticism was levelled at Welcome Tour for the sheer number of its mouse-control games, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-which-everyone-thinks-should-be-free-requires-95-of-accessories-and-a-4k-tv-for-100-completion">the need to have a camera peripheral, a Switch 2 Charging Grip or Pro Controller, and a 4K TV to see everything it had to offer</a>, and complete the game with gold medals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Even if Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour were the pack-in game it feels like it was meant to be, the execution of its charming concept is a muddled collection of quaint tech demos and boring factoids dressed up as an uncompelling completionist checklist," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-review">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

IGN has contacted Microsoft for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Turn 10 Studios' original Forza Motorsport launched for the OG Xbox in 2005, and established the series as one of Microsoft's core gaming brands, as well as a serious rival to PlayStation's Gran Turismo. Seven Forza Motorsport sequels have launched since, spread across every Xbox console generation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the series' original sim racing side has increasingly been eclipsed by the success of Forza Horizon, the franchise's newer, open-world spin-off that first launched on Xbox 360 in 2012.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A developer who worked on Microsoft's now-cancelled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled">Perfect Dark reboot</a> has addressed the claim that last year's gameplay demo was "fake," and said the glimpse was a vertical slice of the project running "in-engine."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perfect Dark was one of several projects canned by Microsoft this week as part of the company's latest devastating cuts to Xbox staff and games. Developed by The Initiative, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">a studio Microsoft is now shutting down</a>, alongside Tomb Raider studio Crystal Dynamics, Perfect Dark had rarely been glimpsed since its initial <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-perfect-dark-announced-from-the-initiative">announcement back in 2020</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That all changed last year when a "gameplay reveal" video aired as part of the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2024. And it's this video that has since sparked questions over how much of what it shows corresponds to actual, working game systems. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, Kotaku writer Ethan Gach <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lsypye2edk2v" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> on social media that he had been told last year's demo had been "basically fake." The question of the gameplay demo's legitimacy was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adammcdlt.bsky.social/post/3lt23bz2dwk2z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussed</a> in more detail by former Perfect Dark developer Adam McDonald, who now works as a senior game designer at Cuphead maker Studio MDHR.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It is actually in-engine," McDonald said. "I was one of three level designers that worked on it. It worked best if you played it the way the person playing in the video plays it, but it still worked even if you didn't hit the marks perfectly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's some fake stuff in it," he continued, "and the real gameplay systems shown off worked juuust enough to look good in this video. We were rapidly making real design decisions so as to not knowingly lie to players about what the game will be. The parkour is all real, the hacking/deception is mostly real.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The combat is 'real' in that someone had to really do all that stuff in the video, but it's set up to be played exactly that way and didn't play well if you played it a different way."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Perfect Dark Reboot Gameplay Reveal Screenshots - Xbox Games Showcase 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What McDonald is saying then, is that there's nuance here. Like many vertical slices meant to showcase a project that's still in development, it was made to work just enough, and to give a sense of how the final game would have appeared, had the project survived until launch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">McDonald's suggestion here seems to be that the team behind it intended to show something that gave as accurate a sense of what Perfect Dark would be as was possible. That said, some elements clearly still sound like they were a work-in-progress, even if they were meant to be representative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm seeing big controversy over 'THIS WHOLE THING WAS FAKE' and it's annoying me, so I wanted to say something," McDonald concluded. Then, in a reply to another user, McDonald said "it was a pretty typical vertical slice" and "I don't think we were particularly deceptive with it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: "It's probably more real than you think. We were figuring stuff out on the fly in time to include it in the demo, doing our best not to 'lie' to players. There's some fakery but quite a lot of it was legit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After the cancellation of Perfect Dark, Rare's long-awaited Everwild, an MMO from Bethesda's The Older Scrolls Online team and cuts to other projects, it's believed that every game featured at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced">the Xbox Games Showcase presentation in June</a> this year will continue on.

With abundant events awaiting, Proxies can delve deeper into the coastal mysteries beneath the waves and embrace an extraordinary summer filled with friendship and adventure.</p><p>In Version 2.1, Proxies can explore two exciting new additions: Sailume Bay and Fantasy Resort. Nestled beneath the cliffs of Failume Heights, Sailume Bay will become the central stage for Chapter 2’s story. Here, Porcelumex will launch a comprehensive safety investigation to resolve conflicts stemming from the chaos caused by the Exaltists. The high-profile investigation team includes Alice Thymefield, descendant of the esteemed Thymefield family, who will later join the Spook Shack. Meanwhile, the summer story unfolds at Fantasy Resort, featuring sandy beaches, coconut trees swaying in the breeze, and a vibrant holiday atmosphere perfect for summer activities and mysterious stories.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_977737"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Two remarkable allies from the Spook Shack will join the roster. Ukinami Yuzuha is a shrewd S-Rank Physical Support Agent who deploys her tanuki companion Kama to throw candy bombs at enemies, empowering on-field attackers to accumulate Anomaly Buildup more easily. Her signature Sweet Scare ability adapts to the active agent’s attribute via Flavor Match, significantly boosting the Anomaly Buildup efficiency while simultaneously triggering Aftershock attacks. Alice Thymefield, the newest member of Spook Shack, is an S-Rank Physical Anomaly Agent. As a noble heiress, she utilizes her refined swordsmanship techniques to maneuver on the battlefield and accumulate Blade Etiquette. By consuming Blade Etiquette, Alice can unleash powerful strikes, amplifying Assault and Disorder damage. Meanwhile, Miss Esme, a graceful S-Rank Bangboo, soars alongside agents while generating beneficial effects that replenish Energy or HP. Additionally, the Void Hunter Miyabi (S-Rank Frost Anomaly) and Yanagi (S-Rank Electric Anomaly) will rerun on the Version 2.1 banners.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The once-pristine Fantasy Resort now stands as a fading paradise awaiting restoration, and Proxies will partner with the Spook Shack to revive the resort through a series of aquatic activities and attractions. Proxies can enjoy the thrills of surfing by navigating obstacles with power-ups, or board yachts and embark on exciting sea shooting challenges amidst scenic island tours. New fishing spots await our experienced anglers, featuring fresh new species and optimized interactions with reduced grinding for a more relaxed yet diverse gameplay. Besides the summer activities, stylish outfits that fit the summer vibes will be available for Yuzuha, Alice, and the protagonists. In addition, a new Bangboo Auto Battler event, “En-Nah” Chess Legend, will be introduced with a PVP mode, and the Simulated Battle Trial will be refreshed with a new scoring system that rewards combat technique mastery for challenging combat enthusiasts.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,860 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,500 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [23,623 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers and the version 2.1 special program below.

Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-and-neteast-unveil-free-to-play-mobile-shooter-destiny-rising-with-closed-alpha-coming-soon">last October</a>, Destiny: Rising is a collaboration between Bungie and Chinese publisher NetEase, and is officially described as a "shared world" adventure set in an "alternate Destiny timeline, exploring a narrative in the post-Dark Age era". It's a result of a partnership the two companies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-moves-to-reassure-destiny-fans-after-securing-usd100m-for-new-game">initially announced</a> - albeit in vague terms - back in 2018.
</p>
<p>
After a period of closed alpha testing that began last November, Destiny: Rising is almost ready for its full launch, which'll see players - in the role of a "fully customisable" Lightbearer named Wolf - embarking on a sci-fi adventure stretching from the sanctuary of Haven to the "icy, ancient metro of Jiangshi, and the arid expanse of the Red Sea Rift."

<p>
Destiny's familiar looter-shooter action is said to remain at the heart of the experience, and there's talk of "dynamic and challenging" single-player, co-op, and competitive multiplayer gameplay, plus various open-world objectives, missions, strikes, PvP battles, and six-player PvE activities. That's alongside customisable Primary and Power Weapons, the ability for characters to share compatible weapons across their arsenal, a new Mythic rarity gear tier, and more.
</p>
<p>
In a bid to encourage pre-registrations ahead of Destiny: Rising's 28th August release, NetEase is holding a pre-launch event that'll provide special in-game bonuses to anyone that registers their interest ahead of time. More rewards unlock as new registration milestones are crossed, and if that sounds like the sort of thing you want to support, you should direct your attention to <a href="https://destiny.onelink.me/pHa5/c6f53fla">Google Play</a> or the <a href="https://destiny.onelink.me/pHa5/kxdnllj3">App Store</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for Daddy Destiny (or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, if you must), Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-getting-two-paid-expansions-this-year-and-one-of-them-is-star-wars-themed">recently announced its next major multi-year story arc</a>, the Fate Saga. It begins with a new paid expansion, titled The Edge of Fate, that arrives on 15th July alongside a free "core game update" for all players. Weirder is this year's second paid expansion, Renegades, which launches on 2nd December and promises to be "integral" to Destiny 2's new Fate Saga, despite its Star Wars theme.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>While the Switch 2 is dominating headlines around the world, it’s easy to forget the little guys. There’s plenty handhelds that are out there making people’s lives better without all the pomp and grandeur. Enter the Miyoo Flip, a retro handheld designed for emulation that takes some clear inspiration from one of Nintendo’s most iconic handhelds, the Game Boy Advance SP.</p>
<p>This clamshell device brings all the nostalgia to the yard. Picking it up had me reminiscing for days about my red Game Boy Advance SP with Groudon carefully embossed on the cover, and the days I spent playing Pokemon Ruby, Advance Wars and Fire Emblem. The Miyoo Flip feels like the original device, and given that the SP is arguably still one of the best handheld designs we’ve ever had, that’s a very good thing.</p>

<p>Measuring just over 8cm in either direction and 2.5cm thick when folded shut, it’s genuinely pocketable, though there’s also a very lovely hardshell case in the box that makes it a bit too chunky for your pocket. It easily fits in your bag though, and you don’t have to worry about it getting damaged at all. It’s so small compared to modern handheld PCs and consoles that you don’t need to think too hard about taking it everywhere with you, and our review unit has already been around the world a bunch of times with me without any hassle.</p>
<p>There’s a variety of different colours available, with our review unit arriving in a truly retro black and red livery. It looks like the contents of every kids’ bedroom in the 80s and early 90s, and the lighter plastics used make it feel pretty authentic to the period as well. It doesn’t feel premium, but when it’s priced around £70 you’re probably not expecting it too. What it does feel like is an authentic reimagining of a classic form factor.</p>

<p>It is equipped for more than just Game Boy games though, and the Rockchip RK3566 chipset and the central controls of a D-pad, four face buttons, four shoulder buttons and two inset analogue sticks at the bottom, make it ideal for emulation up to, and including, N64, Dreamcast, PSP and PlayStation.</p>

<p>They’re not the best analogue sticks in the world; not in terms of their actual functionality, but because they’re pretty deeply inset to allow the clamshell to close. They also sit at the foot of the device, which can become pretty tiring for your hands, depending on how you’re holding the Flip. It’s nice to have them though, and they do work well, but I’ve found myself mostly gravitating to the excellent-feeling D-pad, and the console generations that still focused their efforts on them.</p>
<p>Overall comfort is, however, very good. The light plastics make this an easy device to hold for long periods of time, and I do find that I prefer the narrow profile of systems like the Miyoo Flip, Trimui Brick or the classic Game Boy systems, when it’s a smaller device. If you liked the form factor of the Game Boy Advance SP, then.. this is pretty much the same.</p>
<p>The screen is a 3.5mm IPS LCD display with a 640×480 resolution, and it’s bright and colourful with plenty of clarity and decent viewing angles. It’s not ultra-high resolution, but the 4:3 scale means that this is a great device for playing classic titles, whether revisiting favourites like Super Mario World or Guardian Heroes, or checking out titles you haven’t found time to pull out of the cupboard in years. It does mean that PSP games suffer though, with large black bars above and below the wider aspect output. That’s a shame with a system that can readily play the games, but an easy concession given the form factor.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, this is the perfect device for revisiting your Game Boy Advance library. Given that it has to be one of my all-time favourite handhelds, that’s a huge benefit, and with the cannily crafted form factor, the Miyoo Flip is a pure shot of nostalgia. No, it’s not a perfect integer scaled resolution for the GBA, but it’s more than good enough to enjoy these games.</p>
<p>Miyoo included both the original and the revised operating software during our review period, and the updated OS made interacting with the Flip just that much easier. It’s simple, clear and straightforward, and while it is more stripped back than some offerings, it runs flawlessly, though I’m pretty certain I’ve heard that background music before. You do also have the option of running EmulationStation if that’s your preferred launcher, and you can opt for a range of its glitzier frontends if you prefer, though it may take a bit more tinkering to get everything working.</p>
<p>There’s a few handy quality of life inclusions here, not least the appearance of a Mini-HDMI out, a second USB-C socket for attaching a wired controller and two Micro SD card slots for adding even more storage. Thanks to that, this is a tiny device that’s capable of holding pretty much every game made up until 2000 and playing them, and that’s pretty special.</p>

<p>Some early builds of the Miyoo Flip were criticised for the build quality of the hinge, but in this V2 iteration it feels rock solid, unleashing a satisfying and solid click every time you open it, and moving through the three different viewing angles. Beyond that, the 3,000 mAh battery is suitable, if not stellar, and you’re going to get a good five to seven hours out of it depending on the games you’re emulating.</p>
<p>You are paying a slight premium for this form factor, with some serious competition from the standard Game Boy-evoking Trimui Brick that certainly feels more solid in your hand, but doesn’t have any analogue sticks, despite having similar processing power to the Miyoo Flip. The overall experience is much slicker with the Flip than budget retro handhelds like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/17/boyhom-r36h-handheld-console-review-retro-gaming-on-a-budget/">Boyhom R36H</a>, but it should be when the Flip costs twice as much.</p>

Now, in 2025, we’ve had two new MCU films — <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> and <em>Thunderbolts*</em> — that were either critically panned and commercially disappointing, or critically loved yet struggling to make MCU-sized returns. Marvel is in a bit of crisis mode.</p><p>Its movies are no longer the safest bet in Hollywood. The Disney+ shows have started to feel more like homework than appointment television, even for the biggest MCU fans. From where I’m sitting, after being a critic for over fourteen years and a lifelong comic book reader, the issues Marvel Studios is going through are mistakes that Marvel Comics has also made over the last few decades. There’s much .Marvel has done over the decades that are genius and have helped the comic book industry. But the company has also put its comic book arm in peril just as many times.</p><p>The MCU completely redefined not only superhero movies but the idea of movie franchises. All that success made Marvel Studios too comfortable with the audience, even after other studios had failed in their attempts to copy them. Why is it, then, that audiences have been disappointed? Why have the movies this year not been hitting the highs they used to? Why does each show seem like a shooting star that disappears from the cultural conversation almost the instant it airs?</p><p>Here, I’m going to diagnose some of the symptoms that have led the MCU to its current struggle era — and ways it can return to its glory days.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="73e0101575dab3fcc977a46f31b1c6cf" data-recommend-id="image://73e0101575dab3fcc977a46f31b1c6cf" data-format="webp" data-width="800" data-height="412" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Marvel's Phase Five" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Marvel's Phase Five" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="73e0101575dab3fcc977a46f31b1c6cf" data-recommend-id="image://73e0101575dab3fcc977a46f31b1c6cf" data-format="webp" data-width="800" data-height="412" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Marvel's Phase Five" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is one you’ll hear the most. Many people felt <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> was a perfect conclusion to the saga that had been told, yet they remained interested in the MCU. Marvel Comics has a history of this pattern. When they hit big with the audience and have a strong group of creators producing stories that resonate, Marvel tended to try squeezing more out of the moment than they should. They flood the shelves with more titles and miniseries, and suddenly every character has their own comic.</p><p> When I bought the <em>Civil War</em> event, I decided to purchase every single tie-in title. By the end, it added up to 100 issues—and realistically, only the <em>Captain America</em> issues mattered to the main story. Even recently, with the <em>Blood Hunt</em> event, there were a ton of extra miniseries that felt completely unnecessary once you read the main comic. These moments made me want to read Marvel less because it felt like the company didn’t care as much and was just exploiting my love for the Marvel Universe.</p><p> After <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> briefly became the highest-grossing film of all time, not even a global pandemic could stop Marvel Studios from flooring the gas pedal. In 2021, they significantly ramped up output: four Disney+ shows and four theatrical films in a single year. Every quarter, there were two concurrent Marvel projects demanding attention. Villains and lesser-known Avengers got shows and films, while brand-new characters were introduced to replicate the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> surprise. But aside from Spider-Man—who’s a cheat code, honestly—and Doctor Strange, most of those new additions didn’t stick. They ended up confusing and exhausting audiences. Feige and his Parliament seemed to ignore Marvel’s publishing history in their “research.” They repeated a mistake the company knows all too well: burnout. </p><p> Their slowdown in 2024, with fewer projects, feels like a step in the right direction. Still, they could’ve done a better job connecting more grounded films like <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> and <em>Thunderbolts</em> to shows like <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> and <em>Ironheart</em>. Only time will tell if a leaner Marvel output leads to the higher-quality releases fans deserve. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="adefae441fff10e9524aab9db7c8f75f" data-recommend-id="image://adefae441fff10e9524aab9db7c8f75f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1201" data-height="503" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hulk explaining something" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hulk explaining something" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="adefae441fff10e9524aab9db7c8f75f" data-recommend-id="image://adefae441fff10e9524aab9db7c8f75f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1201" data-height="503" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hulk explaining something" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Why did it take so long for Black Widow to get her movie? With a star like Scarlett Johansson, who’s been with the MCU since Iron Man 2, you’d think she’d earn her movie before the big Thanos throwdown. For some reason, it came out after the character was dead. Then they didn’t even put it in theaters. I know Hawkeye might not be a marquee name, but he was an Avenger, and his story got demoted to just a TV show. For some reason, Sam Wilson becoming Captain America—with the Winter Soldier as his partner—was also a show. <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> should have definitely been a movie instead of a television series. Fans know these characters just as well as they did Black Widow and could’ve brought in an audience at an important time for starting a new story.</p><p>Now, here’s the thing: I like Shang-Chi—he’s the master of Kung Fu. The Eternals are deep-cut characters and would’ve been a good counter to that planned DC <em>New Gods</em> film, battling big Jack Kirby ideas against each other. Why couldn’t they crack an <em>Armor Wars</em> movie with Don Cheadle’s James Rhodes, especially with an Academy Award and Emmy nominations on his résumé? What’s the deal with Hulk, and how come he’s yet to have another movie—instead of Anthony Mackie’s Cap getting shoehorned into a Hulk story?</p><p>Marvel should use the names people know to draw them to theaters.  Charlie Cox’s Daredevil showing up in <em>No Way Home</em> and <em>She-Hulk: Attorney At Law</em> made the interconnected universe feel fun. <em>Ghost Rider</em> needs to get a second chance, perhaps with the Robbie Reyes version from the comics to attract some of <em>Fast and Furious</em> fans A muscle car with wheels on fire is an attractive visual. While they’ve also let that <em>Nova Corps</em> setup from a decade ago atrophy, they should still build new heroes while also building upon what the larger fanbase already knows. That can help generate excitement.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f9bdb7df4b73595a0ff4f9e1429ed7e5" data-recommend-id="image://f9bdb7df4b73595a0ff4f9e1429ed7e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="676" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aliens arriving" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aliens arriving" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f9bdb7df4b73595a0ff4f9e1429ed7e5" data-recommend-id="image://f9bdb7df4b73595a0ff4f9e1429ed7e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="676" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aliens arriving" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The multiverse angle hasn’t worked as well as Marvel had hoped. While it was an interesting setup for Spider-Man and Doctor Strange, building the entire second MCU saga around alternate versions of familiar characters—or ones from previous adaptations—hasn’t connected with audiences as expected. Seeing Tom Holland’s Spidey meet past Spider-Men and fight their villains, almost forming an MCU version of the Sinister Six, was thrilling. Doctor Strange traveling through realities worked, too. But Marvel’s push toward the 2015 <em>Secret Wars </em>comics<em>&nbsp;</em>concept, with multiple versions of the same characters clashing, feels clunky. A better move would’ve been adapting the original ’80s <em>Secret Wars</em>, with a godlike being like Doom forcing heroes and villains to fight on Battleworld—a much simpler, more engaging concept. WWE has done this every year with Survivor Series. It’s not hard to grasp.</p><p>When they announced a <em>Secret Invasion</em> show, I thought that story would’ve made a stronger backbone for a new three-phase saga right after <em>Endgame</em>. In the comics, massive universe-changing events are often followed by more grounded, Earth-based threats—or cosmic stories that only affect a few heroes. After <em>Civil War</em>, we got <em>World War Hulk</em>, which pitted Hulk against the Illuminati during a fractured time for superheroes. Then came <em>Original Sin</em>, a murder mystery that helped bridge to <em>Infinity</em>, <em>AXIS</em>, and finally <em>Secret Wars</em> 2015. Even if those stories weren’t all perfect, they gave readers breathing room and kept the stakes personal and digestible.</p><p>Marvel could have taken a similar approach with the Skrulls—seeding them in shows and movies for years before building to a full-scale takeover. That would’ve been <em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em> on a superhero scale—not the misfire of a show we got.</p><p>Other events like <em>Acts of Vengeance</em>, <em>The Kree/Skrull War</em>, <em>Shadowland</em>, or even newer stories like <em>Blood Hunt</em> could’ve worked like the original Avengers films did. Each phase would carry a thematic thread across films and series, with big Avengers team-ups as satisfying payoffs. It’s baffling that Marvel drifted from the very formula that made it so successful.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="de091b399fd12bd4a5b3cd0964827947" data-recommend-id="image://de091b399fd12bd4a5b3cd0964827947" data-format="jpg" data-width="900" data-height="525" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Villains coming together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Villains coming together" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="de091b399fd12bd4a5b3cd0964827947" data-recommend-id="image://de091b399fd12bd4a5b3cd0964827947" data-format="jpg" data-width="900" data-height="525" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Villains coming together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Why was Red Skull only used in one movie? He’s a Nazi—basically a bad guy cheat code perfect for recurring use. No Masters of Evil. No Fin Fang Foom, despite the popularity of Godzilla-style movies. They turned MODOK into a badly rendered joke in <em>Quantumania</em>. Where was Thor’s classic villainess, The Enchantress? She could’ve spanned movies and shows and made a better long-term threat than Valentina Allegra de Fontaine trying to be a darker, quippier Nick Fury.</p><p>Why not adapt <em>The Korvac Saga</em>? It could’ve followed a fractured Avengers team dealing with the fallout of the Blip and the loss of Tony, Cap, and Natasha. Watching the team disassemble after failing against Korvac would’ve explained their six-year absence better than just ignoring them.</p><p>One of the MCU’s biggest issues is how it softens or discards its villains. Zemo, for example, was right about super soldiers and the Avengers’ collateral damage. He’s not a villain anymore, just an anti-hero. Gone are the villains who want to rule the world or rob a bank. Instead, they make these characters so sympathetic that audiences often side with them more than the heroes. Marvel seems more invested in their villains than their leads.</p><p>I get making villains complex, but Marvel often goes too far, or just turns its heroes into the villains. Wanda’s destruction in <em>Multiverse of Madness</em> doesn’t feel earned if we’re still meant to root for her. Gorr in <em>Love and Thunder</em> was a terrible adaptation; it’s hard to argue with him given how useless the MCU’s gods are. Dar-Benn in <em>The Marvels</em> responds to Captain Marvel bombing her home world. The Leader in <em>Brave New World</em> is portrayed more like a suppressed genius than a threat. And <em>Thunderbolts*</em> is about helping a hero through depression.</p><p>When Marvel does give us a true villain, like The High Evolutionary in <em>Guardians Vol. 3, </em>it works. He’s evil, cruel, and compelling. That’s the direction they need. <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>’s Kingpin brings that old menace back. Same with Loki at his best. Let’s see more villains like that—the kind that made Marvel worth watching in the first place.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="00a6dda932e73a567e3c5e9b4a644f3d" data-recommend-id="image://00a6dda932e73a567e3c5e9b4a644f3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2554" data-height="1906" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kang and Doom fighting" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kang and Doom fighting" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="00a6dda932e73a567e3c5e9b4a644f3d" data-recommend-id="image://00a6dda932e73a567e3c5e9b4a644f3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2554" data-height="1906" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kang and Doom fighting" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Kang is a classic Marvel supervillain, but Kang is confusing. Even diehard Marvel Comics fans struggle to explain him. Beyond everything with Jonathan Majors and Marvel’s decision not to recast, it says a lot that the character didn’t resonate. Who or what is Kang? How do you explain Nathaniel Richards and his ties to Reed Richards and Doctor Doom without using either character—or even acknowledging they exist? And then you have him lose to Ant-Man. ANT-MAN!</p><p>Compare that to how Thanos was built up: introduced as Loki’s superior, intimidating enough to boss around Ronan the Accuser, and then finally unleashed in <em>Infinity War</em>. It worked.</p><p>I’ve read tons of comics but never ran into Kang until <em>Avengers: Forever</em>, where Avengers from different eras united to stop him and other Kangs. It was good, but I had to research just to fully understand it. The more you deal with Kang, the more research you need. Time travel villains don’t have to be confusing, but Kang often is. He’s mostly an Avengers foe, and not a Marvel-wide threat like Thanos. There were other cosmic-level villains to choose from, yet Marvel picked one of the hardest to adapt.</p><p>Maybe they planned to hint at his connections—like being Rama-Tut in ancient Egypt or using Doom’s time platform to link him to <em>Fantastic Four</em>. But instead, we got a post-credit scene of the Council of Kangs—just multiple Jonathan Majors in bad makeup. His MCU debut was shaky too: <em>He Who Remains</em> beating other Kangs to control the timeline isn’t a strong hook. Try explaining <em>Loki</em> season one and how it ties into <em>Quantumania</em> without sounding unhinged. Thanos just needed magic rocks. Simple.</p><p>Maybe Kang should’ve been a one-off like Red Skull. Instead, they introduced him in two quirky projects and had him fight Scott Lang and his ants. Then he loses, shows up in <em>Loki</em> with a goofy haircut, and gets evaporated. He had a strong first appearance, but Marvel didn’t know what to do with him. Turning him into the core of the Multiverse Saga was likely the big mistake.</p><p>Secret Wars has always been about Doom—not Kang.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0bdadb872215a0c93f8bc3706f1f3f88" data-recommend-id="image://0bdadb872215a0c93f8bc3706f1f3f88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1983" data-height="1003" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Avengers joined together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Avengers joined together" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0bdadb872215a0c93f8bc3706f1f3f88" data-recommend-id="image://0bdadb872215a0c93f8bc3706f1f3f88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1983" data-height="1003" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Avengers joined together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>What I don’t care for is how the MCU has turned The Avengers into a brand instead of a consistent presence. Because of the films’ box office success, Marvel now treats the team like a summer comic book event—something you “build up to.” In comics, both Marvel and DC have always had tentpole summer crossovers—<em>House of M</em>, <em>Civil War</em>, and <em>Secret Invasion</em> from Marvel; <em>Identity Crisis</em>, <em>Infinite Crisis</em>, and <em>52</em> from DC. These events bring together a wide cast of heroes, spark tie-in stories, and launch new characters. But between those events, The Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four<em>&nbsp;</em>are always around.</p><p>In the MCU, though, there’s been no proper team in action until <em>Thunderbolts*</em> and the upcoming <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>. And that long wait just feels unnecessary.</p><p>One of the charming things about The Avengers in the comics is that the roster was often oddball: a couple of scrubs and one star. Within six issues, you had “Cap’s Kooky Quartet”—Captain America, Hawkeye, Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch. No Hulk, Thor, or Iron Man. That model worked, and it still would today. Wouldn’t it be interesting to see a team of Shang-Chi, Wong, Sam Wilson and the new Falcon, and She-Hulk trying to help people? And maybe they’re not doing great at it.</p><p>Now that the Netflix characters are canon, was <em>The Defenders</em> ever referenced again? Did they team back up? Was it on the news? The MCU also keeps teasing Young Avengers or Champions, but won’t commit. These characters show up in cameos or secret side roles, but never truly form a team. Why not just pull the trigger and let them grow across projects?</p><p>This approach makes fans feel strung along. Instead of building real momentum or emotional investment, Marvel just keeps hinting at what’s next—without giving us the actual teams that made the comics worth coming back to every month.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b2621b6628572e96a20347225a54eb13" data-recommend-id="image://b2621b6628572e96a20347225a54eb13" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="804" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man looking bewildered" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man looking bewildered" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b2621b6628572e96a20347225a54eb13" data-recommend-id="image://b2621b6628572e96a20347225a54eb13" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="804" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man looking bewildered" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Go all the way back to Phase One, and you see how each post-credit scene pushed the larger narrative leading to The Avengers. The end of <em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em> is directly followed by a post-credits scene, which is actually a scene from the film. This continued into Phase Two, and it felt like even if the movie you saw wasn’t the best, that last scene could give you the hype you needed to make sure you were in theaters for the next film. It perfectly captured the early days of Marvel Comics, where you’d see little cameos of characters from other comics in panels, and then, as you read, you’d see a little editor’s note directing you to check out another title.</p><p>Yet now, most of the post-credit scenes feel like dangling cliffhangers that will never be realized in a new movie or show. We were teased Blade in The Eternals years ago. What happened to Dane Whitman, the Black Knight? That was Kit Harington — Jon freaking Snow — and he can’t be brought back after all these years? Many Phase Four and Phase Five scenes felt, at times, like they were trolling the audience and going against what we expected.</p><p>While it seems like they’re getting back on track with the post-credit scene in <em>Thunderbolts</em>, it just feels a bit too late, as we’ve been burned too often. Building on what I stated earlier, with the phases functioning as story arcs on their own while still advancing the saga, they need to return to making each post-credit scene feel like it’s pushing the larger story forward. Even if they want it to be funny or a bit of a troll, there still has to be some meat there for our appetites to hook onto—so we don’t walk away feeling like our time was wasted.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c7b5c4b5c7cc003b887e9f3ed8274f4d" data-recommend-id="image://c7b5c4b5c7cc003b887e9f3ed8274f4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="798" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Marvel superheroes joined together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Marvel superheroes joined together" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c7b5c4b5c7cc003b887e9f3ed8274f4d" data-recommend-id="image://c7b5c4b5c7cc003b887e9f3ed8274f4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="798" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Marvel superheroes joined together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This might just be a personal thing, but why does every Marvel movie need so much humor? It’s gotten to the point where the tension is constantly undercut by jokes, making it feel like the characters aren’t taking anything seriously. They make it seem like they know everything will work out. This also weakens the antagonists, reducing them to mere obstacles in the protagonist’s personal drama.</p><p>One of the biggest victims of this is <em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em>. It’s so silly that when Thor and his crew are on screen, it feels like Christian Bale is acting in a completely different film. Nothing ever feels dangerous; at best, it plays like a <em>Scooby-Doo</em> episode with superpowers. Even <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, a movie I enjoyed, leaned too heavily into jokes. Compared to the first two <em>Deadpool</em> films, the humor here often overtakes the heart and personal stakes Wade once carried.</p><p>This overreliance on humor and the tendency to make every Marvel movie an action-comedy flattens the superhero genre. Not only has it become formulaic—it’s become a punchline. In the recent film <em>Friendship</em>, a character mentions going to see “the new Marvel” and everyone immediately gets the joke. That’s a bad sign. Marvel’s slump isn’t just about box office—it’s about perception. People are tuning out.</p><p>Marvel keeps promoting new movies or shows by claiming they’re tapping into other genres, but most of the time, they’re just more MCU fare with jokes at timed intervals. It feels like they’ve abandoned genre experimentation. Phase Two gave us real variety: <em>The Winter Soldier</em> worked as a political thriller, <em>Ant-Man</em> was a heist comedy, and <em>Iron Man 3</em>—a movie I don’t even like—at least felt like a Shane Black buddy action flick.</p><p>Marvel used to be the “cool” alternative to DC. Now it’s the “quirky” one. It’s time to dial back the humor—not to go dark, but to be sharp, confident, and cool again.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4def9d10ed6467e4da7c0e7642b6bf86" data-recommend-id="image://4def9d10ed6467e4da7c0e7642b6bf86" data-format="jpg" data-width="6385" data-height="6048" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A collection of Marvel comics" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A collection of Marvel comics" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4def9d10ed6467e4da7c0e7642b6bf86" data-recommend-id="image://4def9d10ed6467e4da7c0e7642b6bf86" data-format="jpg" data-width="6385" data-height="6048" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A collection of Marvel comics" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Early on, the MCU felt very focused on adapting the tone and vibe of Marvel comics. While not one-to-one adaptations, they blended the spirit of classic Marvel, Modern Marvel, and the Ultimate line. Iron Man’s origin, for example, was captured perfectly, appealing to general audiences while wowing diehard fans by bringing beloved characters to life. Involving comic creators in the production helped strike the right balance to make it enjoyable for everyone.</p><p>But once the MCU hit massive success, it started treating the comics more as a hindrance than a guide. For me, that shift began with <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>. The setup and themes were changed completely. While the film technically split the heroes, most audiences were just excited to see Black Panther and Spider-Man debut. I’m not even a big fan of Mark Millar’s comic or his post-9/11 worldview, but the premise—young heroes botching a mission, sparking a national debate on superhero accountability—was compelling. In the movie, it boiled down to Tony being mad that Cap chose Bucky over him, and Zemo manipulating everyone. It stripped away the political nuance in favor of hero-on-hero spectacle.</p><p>Fans would ask what to read before watching <em>Shang-Chi</em> or <em>The Marvels</em>, and I had nothing to recommend. Even explainer accounts are often just guessing based on Wikipedia and trailers. Straying too far from the comics could repeat the mistake <em>Game of Thrones</em> made: abandoning the source led to a disappointing ending. Unlike that series, Marvel doesn’t have to guess—the stories are already there. Bringing more creators back into the fold would help course-correct.</p><p>The MCU should lean more on its strongest stories to win fans back. Let the comics lead, rather than just using characters as loose inspiration. I’d love to see them attempt stories like <em>Annihilation</em>, <em>Avengers: Forever</em>, <em>Inferno</em>, or <em>Wolverine: Enemy of the State</em>. They could spark wildly different films and shows, while recapturing the shared tone that once connected the comics and MCU so well.</p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-phase-5-marvel-comics-1851785555]]></content:encoded>
