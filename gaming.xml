            <p>
After a bit of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-and-evil-remaster-news-teased-for-showcase-tomorrow">teasing</a> and some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-and-evil-delisting-prompts-speculation-of-imminent-remaster-release">original edition delisting</a>, Ubisoft has - slightly prematurely, it would seem - announced a release date for its Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition remaster. According to a now-deleted social media post, it's coming to PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Switch next Tuesday, 25th June - with new in-game content and more.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/people-are-now-playing-ubisofts-still-unannounced-beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition">confirmed</a> it was working on a remaster of its much-loved 2003 action-adventure Beyond Good and Evil last November, after a "technical error" inadvertently granted some Ubisoft+ subscribers access to an early development build. And now, somewhat sooner than expected (Ubisoft had originally told fans to keep an eye out for news during tonight's Limited Run Games showcase), fresh details have emerged.
</p>
<p>
Alongside a 25th June release date on PC and consoles, Ubisoft's social media post confirmed its new Beyond Good and Evil remaster will feature (thanks <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/06/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-launches-june-25-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-switch-and-pc?s=31">Gematsu</a>) a bunch of presentational upgrades and some new in-game content too. For starters, there's 4K support at 60fps - as well as the more nebulous promise of "improved graphics, controls, and audio" - and the game is getting autosave and cross-save features too.

<p>
Additionally, Beyond Good and Evil's original adventure - which follows reporter Jade as she investigates a terrible government conspiracy with some help from her pig pal Pey'j - now features new treasure hunts revealing more about Jade's past, plus "new rewards" to find while exploring. There's also a new speedrun mode, updated achievements, and a gallery featuring behind-the-scenes details.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft also briefly shared a trailer showcasing Beyond Good and Evil's remaster, but that's now been pulled too. Expect it to resurface during tonight's Limited Run Games showcase - airing at 7pm BST/11am PT/2pm ET - which will hopefully include pricing details too. The price point should be particularly interesting given Ubisoft's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-and-evil-delisting-prompts-speculation-of-imminent-remaster-release">delist the relatively inexpensive earlier version</a> from Steam and the Xbox Store this week - although PC players can <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/beyond_good_and_evil">currently pick it up via GOG for £1.29</a>.
</p>
<p>
Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition will be available for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC when it launches next Tuesday, 25th June. Now we just need some news about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-remains-vapourware-it-seems">ludicrously long-in-the-works</a> Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24182462/tips-for-starting-shadow-of-the-erdtree-elden-ring<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Before <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> finally goes live, Bandai Namco has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178537/great-haircut-tarnished">implemented a patch</a> that adds a couple of small features and updates just in time for the DLC’s launch in a few short hours. FromSoftware also shared a new launch trailer to herald the DLC’s arrival, but it’s chockful of spoilers, so beware. The update isn’t particularly earth-shattering, but it does include some things worth keeping in mind before all you Tarnished <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">get your head beat in by the vicious monsters patrolling the Shadow Lands</a>.</p><p>Firstly, we get new hair options! I was pretty down on <em>Elden Ring</em>’s character creator <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/25/22951205/elden-rings-character-creator-black-hairstyles">for its lack of Black hairstyles</a>. It just didn’t make sense that the character creator was so robust and detailed but lacked hairstyles that represent a good chunk of the human population. There are five new styles to choose from, with two of them being dreadlocks. I chose the loose loc option so my Tarnished can finally get rid of her abhorrent pigtails. I’m not sure if the “white hairs” option was present in the base game or a new addition with this patch, but I really like how it adds gray to my locs, reminding me of when I started picking out errant gray hairs when I had locs.</p><div><figcaption><em>Hooray! New hair options!</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: FromSoftware</cite></p></div><p>To change your appearance, all you have to do is visit <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fia">Fia, Deathbed Companion</a>’s room at the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Roundtable+Hold">Roundtable Hold</a>. She should have a mirror you can interact with that will let you change your appearance. However! If you’re like me and have completed Fia’s questline, neither she nor her mirror will be present at the Roundtable Hold. Instead, travel to the Raya Lucaria Grand Library site of grace and talk to Rennala. You’ll be able to change your appearance through her.</p><p>Secondly — and this is arguably the best little housekeeping update the game has had — the new patch lets you see all your recently acquired items. From now on, new items you pick up either in the Lands Between or the DLC’s Shadow Lands will be marked with a little exclamation point. The game will even collect those new items under their own tab, though that “new items” tab isn’t enabled by default. You have to go into the game’s settings and select the “Show recent items tab” option.</p><div><p><strong>Tarnished note:</strong> remember, you cannot apply weapon greases to enchanted weapons like the Moonveil Katana. Carry around a high-powered but basic weapon to use them.</p></div><p>It was extremely helpful in my journey to see the new items and equipment I picked up so I could compare them to the stuff I’d been carrying around for the last 100 hours. Without it, I would have missed the new “Festive Grease” item that increases the number of runes you earn every time you land an attack and the little notes I picked in my travels that hint at where to go next. The “new items” feature makes choosing the right gear and weapons to tackle all the new threats in <em>Shadows of the Erdtree</em> so much easier. Enable it right away.</p><p>Beyond that, the patch adds a bunch of weapon balance changes and helpfully tweaks the summoning pool feature for folks who need help taking down Mohg, Lord of Blood, in order to access the DLC. The new patch will also let you summon your faithful horse-goat Torrent during the Elden Beast fight, which will undoubtedly make that final encounter loads easier.

According to Bandai Namco <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-107">on the game’s website</a>, the patch intends to “encourage more versatility in terms of gameplay” — if “encourage” also means “make you a nigh unkillable god in single player.” A lot of weapons and spells were buffed, very few things were nerfed, and it seems like it’s going to get a lot harder to kill your friends in PVP. The patch notes are indeed massive, but I’ve picked out a few highlights.</p><p><strong>Glintstone Pebble / Shard Spiral: </strong>increased attack power </p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/13/23402616/elden-ring-dlc-patch-notes-update">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-25f0b8ed-7cd2-4ce1-a29e-5c990e2b8e10"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23009950/elden-ring-giant-map-game-design-from-software">All hail Elden Ring’s ever-growing map</a></h2><p>One of <em>Elden Ring’s</em> most polarizing features is its willingness to withhold information. While it’s less arcane than earlier FromSoftware titles like <em>Dark Souls</em>, the game constantly hands you items, quests, and mechanics <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954823/elden-ring-open-world-guide">with very little explanation</a>. But after 130 hours and counting in the Lands Between, I’m in love with how well it sometimes deploys that obscurity. And there’s no better example than <em>Elden Ring’s</em> map, which has transcended a simple open-world convention to become one of my very favorite pieces of the game.</p><p>If you’re still in the early areas of <em>Elden Ring</em>, you might want to skip this post because I’m going to talk about a mechanic that relies on mystery. But if you’ve played a bit of the game, you might know what I’m talking about. <em>Elden Ring’s </em>map offers a constant give-and-take of showing players new spaces to explore, then pulling back a curtain to more places that they didn’t even realize could <em>exist. </em>It withholds information only to reveal it in a way that’s delightful, satisfying, and entirely in keeping with the world’s vast scope. It’s not just an interface element — it’s a meta-game in its own right.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23009950/elden-ring-giant-map-game-design-from-software">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-1f35292d-22d9-439f-860e-b2081da09671"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22979436/elden-ring-speedrunners-world-record-race-30-minutes">Elden Ring speedrunners race to the bottom</a></h2><p><em>Elden Ring</em> is just so massive and its bosses are so tough that the average player will probably take over 60 hours to beat it. But speedrunners, assisted by some traditional speedrunning tricks and the game’s own open design, have somehow managed to beat the sprawling game in under 30 minutes.</p><p>For a speedrunning enthusiast, the first days of a game’s release are extremely exciting. New techniques and optimizations are constantly being discovered, as boss behaviors and the runner’s own luck work with or against them, making almost every run a possible world record. While every runner is ostensibly competing against the clock, two runners have emerged in the <em>Elden Ring</em> speed community, each racing to post lower and lower times.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22979436/elden-ring-speedrunners-world-record-race-30-minutes">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-09122418-f13d-437e-b87d-28b971708154"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/11/22973032/elden-ring-easy-rune-farm-dragon-caelid">I’ve made a huge mistake in Elden Ring</a></h2><p>In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, it’s killed or be killed — brutally. The game is designed to put you ever on the defensive, ready to lash out before you yourself can be lashed.

I killed a dragon, and I feel really awful about it.</p><p>In <em>Elden Ring</em>, even the damn flowers are dangerous, but contrary to the game’s reputation, not everything in the Lands Between wants to kill you. There are those cute rodents that scurry about and delightful little donut-rolling sheep that exist only to bleat at you as you zip by them on Torrent. I’ve had so many peaceful moments sitting on the edge of a cliff, gazing in wondrous awe at the golden Erdtree with a convocation of eagles for company. I’d never think to kill any of these creatures because, for one, they’re worth a pitiful amount of runes, and secondly, they’re harmless.&nbsp;(Editor’s note: <a href="https://twitter.com/A_Webster/status/1500278513567469568">killing the calm, wise old tortoises</a> should be punished by a full game restart, even if it’s an accident.)</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/11/22973032/elden-ring-easy-rune-farm-dragon-caelid">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-fbb524f6-1d69-4ae1-b31e-14edb14ee6c0"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954823/elden-ring-open-world-guide">Elden Ring’s world is full of mystery, but I’d rather wait for a guide</a></h2><p>It seems like everyone, even people who don’t usually partake in FromSoftware games, is playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>.

Though the many classes present a paralyzing wealth of options, it’s not the question of what class to play that has me stuck. It’s the character creator.

FromSoftware games have a bit of a reputation for being kinda bad at character creation, especially regarding skin. In <em>Bloodborne</em>, skin colors and textures were distinctly unnatural-looking.

I was too young to read these tales of sex and violence, but those hand-painted covers, full of dragons and swords and ancient ruins, held a promise of adventure that captivated me.

            <p>Picture a himbo tent. Now, see if you can get your mind around the concept of a flirtatious windmill. What exactly are the key architectural qualities of dwellings you might wish to go to bed with? Actually, don’t bother stretching your grey matter – you can just play Building Relationships, which is sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-short-hike">A Short Hike</a> but also, Love Island for anthropomorphic toy houses.

<p>I played a bit of Building Relationships at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everything-announced-and-featured-at-day-of-the-devs-2024-in-one-place">Day Of The Devs</a> booth at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/summer-game-fest">Summer Game Fest</a> last week. That particular booth is a smear of half-memories, because the organisers asked us to play five games inside an hour, and this being Day Of The Devs, it was a regular cornucopia of concepts, styles and subject matters. I went from playing While Waiting, a game about occupying your mind while you’re waiting, to After Love EP, a game about death, grief and rock music, to UFO50, which is 50 games that together form a mosaic of meta-gaming mystery. Also Phoenix Springs, a dystopian adventure notable for a clipped English voiceover so dispassionate I stepped away feeling dehydrated. Write-ups for those to follow once I've worked out where one game ended and the next began.</p>
<p>Building Relationships stands out the most in hindsight because it felt the most at ease in its own skin and also, because it's not every day you get to chat up a small apartment building. (I personally wouldn't date an apartment building because all the ones I've lived in had mold, but this one had a certain forlorn charisma, reminiscent of that friend who's too busy pairing off everybody else to find love himself.) It's a pocket open worlder with boisterous katamari physics in which you bounce about fluttering your curtains at bungalows and completing very simple quests, such as fishing (in this case, for cars). It is a game wholly invested in the act of enjoying a pun, which is surely the definition of a promising first date. It has pleasantly daft writing, blossoming biomes that remind me of Proteus a bit, and some amusing camera angle choices during conversation.</p>
<p>Building Relationships is the debut Steam release of Tanat Boozayaangool, who is also the creator of <a href="https://tanatb.itch.io/to-remember-a-massacre">sinister trivia games</a> and <a href="https://tanatb.itch.io/in-bed-cant-sleep">visual novels about not being able to sleep</a>. Here is a little excerpt from <a href="https://tanatb.carrd.co/">the developer’s web page</a>: "There's a joy in absurdity, suspending all levels of disbelief and immersing yourself in the wildest world. And there you'll find the most human story, anchoring the most ridiculous narrative."</p>

			<p>Today, publisher Focus Home Interactive and developer Saber Interactive released a 6-minute gameplay overview of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2. Creative Director Oliver Hollis-Leick explained:</p>
<p><em>The game's campaign mode allows you to experience this epic story either solo or with up to three players in co-op. The story of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 begins centuries after the events of the first game. Captain Dimitrian Titus is a genetically enhanced supersoldier and a hero of the Ultramarines. Titus has returned to the Ultramarines, where is demoted to Lieutenant and forced to prove his loyalty to the Imperium in the heat of battle. On a distant world, he must face one of humanity's most fearsome adversaries - the Tyranids. As you take control of Titus and his battle-brothers, you will be thrown into the thick of a war of galactic proportions. Thanks to our unique Swarm engine, allowing to render hundreds of real enemies on screen at the same time. You'll face seemingly endless waves of enemies, crawling and swarming as far as the eye can see. You must repel the Tyranid invasion and rid the system of the Xenos threat, battling in claustrophobic jungles, majestic planet-spanning metropolises, and other epic locations. After each successful mission, you'll return to the Battle Barge, a space fortress serving as the Ultramarines' orbital HQ. Here, you can gain crucial intel by interacting with onboard personnel. Review your next targets and tailor your loadout to the upcoming mission. Whether you prefer close combat or ranged warfare, the Ultramarines' wide range of equipment offers an array of devastating weapons and unique special abilities. A balanced approach is certainly wise since performing the brutal melee finisher replenishes your armor and keeps you in the fight for longer. </em></p>
<p><em>Beyond the story campaign of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2, you'll find <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-maine-2-co-op-operations-mode-6v6-pvp-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Operations mode</a>. Here, the focus is on cooperation and replayability. Play as one of six classes with unique skills and abilities. Then, develop and customize them to make them your own. Whether you prefer the Sniper, the Vanguard, or the Bulwark, your Space Marine specialty, along those of your squadmates, will be decisive on the battlefield. The more missions you play, the more you'll unlock cosmetics for your Space Marine. Also, XP and Armory Data can be spent on the Battle Barge's armory to unlock new class perks and improve your armament's performance. </em></p>
<p><em>If you're into more competitive challenges, enter the fray in the Eternal War mode, where you'll be able to pit yourself against other players. Six Space Marines clash against six of their sworn Chaos adversaries. Choose your preferred ruleset and engage in adrenaline-pumping matches that will test your skills against players from across the world. Each Skirmish offers you the chance to earn more XP and add more weapons to your arsenal as you prove your valor on the battlefield.</em></p>

<p>Warhammer 40 Space Marine 2 will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on September 9. We also know that the third-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-wont-have-any-in-game-mtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won't have any in-game microtransactions</a>.</p>

However, that’s exactly what’s happened with <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s launch trailer. If you are looking forward to exploring the Land of Shadow unspoiled then I warn you, do not watch the trailer!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196742" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The new trailer (which I will not link for your sake) dropped today and it sure is a wonderful showcase of what fans can expect to find in the sprawling expansion. I took one for the team and watched it, and I can confirm that it provides a hefty look at a lot of what awaits you in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. “Well, what exactly constitutes a spoiler?” you may ask. Everything! At this point, anything you see about the expansion before you get your hands on it is, arguably, a potential spoiler. FromSoft games are narratively and mechanically dense, with both aspects serving as sources of delight and frustration for players to discover on their own. Knowing any more hints about the story or seeing any new enemies feels like losing out on a special moment you could have experienced unspoiled.</p><p>Of course, if you have read reviews or seen some of the early trailers for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, you might not think it’s that big of a deal. I will say that reviews and early footage only hint at the larger reveals of the expansion and typically only offer details on early sections. According to a post on social media from the YouTube channel <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/writingongames/status/1803729352900673587&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/writingongames/status/1803729352900673587" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Writing on Games</a></span>, the launch trailer includes content they did not see until forty hours into the expansion.</p><hr><p>Ahead of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s release (which is so very close), all you need to know is that the expansion is very good. If you like <em>Elden Ring</em> you will like what FromSoftware has cooked up for you. Just make it through the next day without looking up stuff about the game and make liberal use of the mute features on social media.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a surprising turn of events, the official Fortnite Competitive account has relayed some intriguing information about existing and growing Fortnite Esports competitors. According to the latest <a href="https://x.com/FNCompetitive/status/1802784145510150607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a>, apart from FNCS competition, all other tournaments will remove the region lock feature. The new change will allow players to change their region for the season’s current and upcoming tournaments.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 Attention competitors!</p><p>Effective now (apart from FNCS) we will be removing region lock from all tournaments. </p><p>This also applies to this season's ongoing tournaments. If you previously played in one region for an event, you can now play in other regions in that event.</p></div>— Fortnite Competitive (@FNCompetitive) <a href="https://twitter.com/FNCompetitive/status/1802784145510150607?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>This change is a game-changer for the Fortnite esports community, and the palpable excitement of the fans in the comment section is a testament to that. Previously, players in Europe, North America, or other regions were confined to competitions limited to their area. Now, they are empowered to participate in their region’s competitions and beyond. </p>



<p>This decision is set to bolster Epic’s player count for Fortnite, with a surge of streamers and content creators joining the competitions across multiple regions. It’s a thrilling opportunity for existing Fortnite Pros to expand their field of competition and for the burgeoning players scattered across different areas worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other Fortnite news, Epic dropped a bombshell earlier this month with a massive update featuring the iconic British heavy metal band <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metallica-comes-to-fortnite-festival-alongside-new-game-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metallica</a>. The update introduced a new game mode, fresh cosmetics, and a playlist of headbanging tracks for the Fortnite Festival. On a different note, Epic recently addressed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-epic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issue of pay-to-win cars in Fortnite</a>, acknowledging their existence.&nbsp;</p>

Some of these bosses are aimed at players who've completed most of the base Elden Ring, meaning FromSoftware has "kind of really pushed the envelope in terms of what we think can be withstood by the player," he added.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>"Some bosses are a necessary part of the story development and arc, but some are not.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-will-go-to-drastic-lengths-to-make-its-sandstorms-matter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Go on vacation and you’ll come back to a brand-new game world.</h2></div><section><p>During an extremely short behind-closed-doors demo for Dune Awakening, I was given my first glimpse at what the team at Funcom is expecting from this open-world survival MMO: A huge time investment from players, a compelling take on the Dune story, and several factions you can choose to learn new skills and abilities from for your journeys into Arrakis. It’s clear that the developers who gave the demo are excited about the concepts at play, boasting that the desert section of the map alone is the size of all of Conan Exiles, and that they imagine you’ll spend 30-50 hours of the game leveling there. But that just seems to scratch the surface of what you’ll be able to do.</p><p>What makes Dune Awakening different and interesting is the fact that every single week, the sections of this world not protected by a shield will be hit by a sandstorm, wiping out all the buildings you and your opponents have constructed in the seven days leading up to this weekly event. The official website describes them as “cataclysmic Coriolis storms [that] regularly alter the landscape, uncovering new valuable resources and sweeping away player-built outposts. When the dust settles, the race is on. Scout the fresh new land and uncover the secrets of the sands.” This was demonstrated to us as a player journeyed into a radioactive crash site and showcased the ability to climb any geometry in the world while teasing secrets that can be found at the highest peaks.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dune Awakening June Preview</h3></div></output><p>But the one aspect they kept going back to was Survival. This aspect of Dune Awakening became clear during our hands-off demonstration when a Sandworm erupted from the ground and chased down the player we were following. Death is devastating, and you cannot fight a Sandworm. You can only survive or lose everything you’ve acquired to that point if you get eaten. The same will be true should you lose in PVP and become a refreshing beverage for your opponent, or fail to take cover during a world-changing event. Even becoming dehydrated in the desert if you don’t pay attention to your heat meter and get heatstroke will put you at a severe disadvantage. Surviving will be a key part of your journey.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Death is devastating, and you cannot fight a Sandworm. You can only survive or lose everything you’ve acquired to that point if you get eaten.</p></div><p>It’s also clear that Dune Awakening has a lot of ambitious gameplay elements the team is trying to tie together. For instance, a fictional story where the assassination of Paul Atreides doesn’t take place because he was never born – because his father survived. And because his mother had a daughter as she was instructed to, instead of a son. With these overarching story elements used as a jumping-off point, the team gets to play with a unique future and a new outcome for the factions, and key players of the Dune Universe interact in a way you wouldn’t see in the novels. There is a political system that pits players against each other in a battle for territory. Sandworms will eat you if you’re caught in their path and take all of the gear you had with them. And sweeping sandstorms that will obliterate any structure you’ve built on the map and create an entirely new landscape every week. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>All of these systems are doing their best to craft a template that will keep the world of Dune Awakening fresh and interesting for players. During our demonstration, the team estimated that you would spend your first 30-50 hours of the game in the starting location alone, and that was one of several on the map that we were shown as explorable. On the one hand, I do like the idea that the game world will be kept fresh via sandstorms that destroy all you’ve built up and unlock an entirely new overworld to explore. On the other hand, I am wondering what each new week will look like as teams scramble to utilize their building templates to prop up a new structure and claim a zone as their own to defend against combatants as each week begins. Here’s hoping it’s absolute pandemonium.</p><p>While there are story changes you should expect, the need for water and even more importantly alliances are intact. Eventually, you’ll be able to choose an NPC to train you. We were shown five skill trees that can be unlocked by doing said training, which will then allow you the option of three techniques you can mix and match as your main attacks. That’s in addition to the three passive skills you can also equip. To unlock all of the options available will take a significant amount of time, but getting the right build using different attacks from each will give you access to interesting abilities. The main ability I’ve seen as an example would be a scanner that shows more information about a location you plan to explore, including enemy NPC locations.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In my demo, the team promised two maps to start with and more to come. We got to peek at the Deep Desert, where most of the conflict will happen and hundreds of players will focus on collecting resources and fighting over key locations each week. There's the Hagga Basin which will have a 40-plus player cap. And two social hub locations Arrakeen and the Harko Village. There is, of course, a plan to add even more to the world as time goes by. </p><p>So far Dune Awakening seems incredibly ambitious. Abilities can be unlocked by the Mentats and Bene Gesserit. There will be cool gear to collect like Holtzman gadgets and templates of interesting firearms to unlock. There’s a heat system that will require you to stay hydrated by any means necessary. And giant sandworms that will eat entire convoys if you’re not careful. One speed-run demonstration from Funcom wasn’t enough to scratch the surface of the various systems and how they’ll interplay with one another, but I’m excited to see more.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="272" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Ubisoft has announced that the <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition</em> remaster will arrive on PC and Consoles on June 25th. If it sounds familiar, news of this <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked back in November</a>, along with an early build. But now it has an officially official release date.</p> <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="331" data-injectable="false">Alongside the announcement is a new trailer showing off all the upgrades. It looks similar to how I remember it but with fancier lighting effects and other touch-ups. Pretty nice. It’s being improved to run at 60FPS and 4K resolution. It will also have some new additions such as a “Treasure Hunt” and an anniversary gallery.</p> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="590" data-injectable="true">I played <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em> on GameCube around the time it was released in 2003. It had an interesting narrative for its time and good variety to its gameplay. It kind of fell into the era’s forced stealth section pitfall, but was otherwise solid.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">Despite not having played it in about 20 years, I still have a pretty solid memory of it, which says a lot. I mainly remember it for its exceptional soundtrack and phrases like “A box of K-bups will completely restore your energy.” However, I also remember the feel of the hover craft and various scenes from the game. If nothing else, it’s a stellar example of the early ‘00s period of games.</p>
 <p data-characters="37" data-current-count="37" data-injectable="false">I’ll probably pick up the remaster.</p> <p data-characters="132" data-current-count="169" data-injectable="false"><em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition</em> will arrive on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC on June 25, 2024.</p>

		<p>When Warren Spector was a producer at Origin Systems in the 1990s, he had a business model. “I would start up four projects, two internal and two external, and I’d kill two projects every year that weren’t going well,” he says in Jason Schreier’s book <em>Press Start: Ruin and Recovery in the Video Game Industry</em>. “I would tell people that’s what I was going to do. ‘Be one of the projects that’s going really well.’”</p><p>Victorious in Spector’s system were <em>Ultima Underworld</em> and <em>System Shock, </em>the forerunners of what became known as the immersive sim. Games in this genre present an obstacle and allow the player to surmount it in multiple ways: climb over it, blow it up, tell it to move, swim underneath it, whichever way they choose. Over time, the tools got more inventive: possess rats and squeeze through a sewer grate, hack a robot to destroy something, transform into a coffee cup and roll underneath an obstacle.</p><p>Spector repeated his approach for the 2000 title <em>Deus Ex</em>, still the apotheosis of the immersive sim, by constituting two design teams and pitting them in conflict, which he later called “<a href="https://mcvuk.com/business-news/history-lesson-the-story-of-deus-ex/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>probably the stupidest thing I’ve ever done</u></a>.” In that contest, designer Harvey Smith triumphed; he headed up <em>Deus Ex</em>’s sequel and, in 2012, moved onto <em>Dishonored</em>, with the studio Arkane Austin. “<em>Dishonored</em>,”<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/3/2/14798096/deus-ex-warren-spector-vr-virtual-reality-dumb-down-games?ref=remapradio.com"> <u>said Spector</u></a>, “is the series that best captures the spirit of <em>Deus Ex</em> now.”</p><p>Arkane, which at one point operated out of studios in Lyon, France, as well as Austin, Texas, has spent most of its life iterating on the immersive sim, as has Smith, becoming the foremost developer in this genre. So it’s no surprise that Arkane Austin’s latest and last game, <em>Redfall</em> — a multiplayer vampire shooter either a conscious departure from the immersive sim or an attempt to graft it upon a more commercial business model — evidently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda?ref=remapradio.com"><u>performed poorly enough to shutter the studio</u></a> earlier this year.</p><p>Immersive sims, despite their flexibility of approach, train players to be specialists. They can become a walking weapons platform, the queen of the shadows, the rat god who rides the wind. A studio of immersive sim experts can’t easily switch tracks and deliver a larger, more commercial title. But then, it’s not like they had a choice.</p><p>While Arkane had become better at making immersive sims through iteration, the games weren’t doing the business they once had. The <em>Dishonored </em>sequel from Arkane Lyon and Arkane Austin’s <em>Prey</em> underperformed. Whether or not it contributed directly, the quality that once made an immersive sim special — the ability to “play your own way” — has been absorbed pretty wholly into the broad open world playgrounds of <em>Skyrim, Fallout</em> and <em>Breath of the Wild. </em>“Most of the things that made immersive sims kind of cutting edge are everywhere in games [now],” <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/boss-level-2022-harvey-smith-arkane-studios-3312368?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Smith noted</u></a> before <em>Redfall</em>’s release.</p><p>If those games that drew so directly upon the values of the immersive sim could be huge hits, then perhaps the people best in the world at making immersive sims could play in that space, too. Well, we don’t know, because although Arkane went into the open world for <em>Redfall</em>, its ambitions were more lucrative. Not only were they chasing open-world trends, it was also creating an online-only co-op games-as-a-service shooter in the vein of <em>Borderlands</em>, <em>Destiny, </em>and <em>Overwatch</em>. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-01/arcane-s-redfall-misfire-for-xbox-panned-after-7-5-billion-microsoft-deal?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTY4NTYxODIzNywiZXhwIjoxNjg2MjIzMDM3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJSVktNS1VEV1gyUFMwMSIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.eeX5BYdsJhqgSi3aqDZTZUVYmm92ZItcoOCXfP7-j8Q&amp;embedded-checkout=true&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>In Schreier’s account at Bloomberg</u></a>, owner ZeniMax Media fancied the project would make itself a more attractive acquisition target for Microsoft, even as the change in direction confounded Arkane Austin hires old and new, who had signed up to work on single-player immersive sims. (Schreier estimates that during <em>Redfall’s</em> development, Arkane Austin lost 70% of the staff that had worked on its previous game, <em>Prey.</em>)&nbsp;</p><p>That is a different, though compatible, explanation than the one<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/big-in-2023-redfall-preview-interview-exclusive/?ref=remapradio.com"> <u>Smith gave</u></a>: “If you work on the same thing for long enough you eventually want to clear your head and stretch a little.” It makes sense for Smith since he has been working on these games since 1994. Though he added, “I think we will eventually go back to the very sealed immersive sim-like environments,” suggesting that “a little” might really be the extent of his interest.</p><p>But whether he was making immersive sims or not, there is the lure of getting back to a hit. “<em>Dishonored</em> was important to me because I was like, well, maybe I just got lucky that one time [with <em>Deus Ex</em>]?” <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/boss-level-2022-harvey-smith-arkane-studios-3312368?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Smith said in 2022</u></a>. “<em>Dishonored</em> was like, boom, the whole world paid attention. When that happens to you once it’s awesome. When it happens to you a second time, it validates all the bad moments.” <em>Redfall </em>was a commercial play for a studio that was out of power and wanted it back, if not for the glory, then just to survive.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Redfall</em> feels (and is) a termination of the story Arkane has been telling across all of its games since <em>Dishonored</em>, not just with immersive sims but where power is the central theme. In the <em>Dishonored </em>series, the player is a powerful character — an empress or her protector temporarily embarrassed by a coup — but the game is less interested in the power accorded to them by their positions at the head of empire than the toys they get to play with.&nbsp;</p><p>The true power, in so far as it is interesting to the designers, is supernatural, such as possession, teleportation, or slowing time. And it’s bestowed by a character called the Outsider. As a force, the Outsider is so enigmatic and grim that it’s logical to wonder if his powers are given at a price. What is the cost of a deal with dark forces, struck to advance your quest for the throne?&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing much, as it happens. “There are many myths about how if you want power there is something to trade,” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120909031200/http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/dishonoreds-two-lead-designers-talk-about-magic-breaking-the-game-and-amora"><u>observed Raphaël Colantonio</u></a>, who directed the first game with Smith. “When we started to design [<em>Dishonored</em>], we thought it would be interesting to tempt the player with powers, and if they decide to use them the world grows darker. Because it’s an interesting dilemma…. [But] we don’t want to punish players for having fun.” Though the Outsider cuts a brooding figure, he only a spokesman for the freeplay pleasures of the immersive sim: “How you will use what I have given you falls upon you… I will be watching you with great interest.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo: Bethesda Softworks</span></figcaption></figure><p>Fun wins, as it usually does in game development, but the original <em>Dishonored</em> was the last time Arkane was so indifferent to the narrative cost of power. <em>Prey</em>, directed by Colantonio, was built around the idea that the player should be tested on whether they deserve the extragenic powers they have been given. If they were found to have used them irresponsibly, they were destroyed. <em>Prey</em>, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/video-game-video-game-review-prey-sci-fi-legacy-gaming-gamers-595970?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Colantonio told</u></a> Newsweek<em> </em>in 2017, dealt with “identity, empathy and who you are…. What does it mean to be human?” (Hedging, designer Ricardo Bare added: “You can play it as a science- fiction action game. It’s super fun; the aliens are super deadly.”)</p><p>Not coincidentally, perhaps, as the games embraced nuance the studio’s commercial fortunes declined. Colantonio later said <em>Prey</em> sold horribly <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/bethesda-forced-arkane-to-call-its-game-prey-which-studio-founder-says-was-very-very-hurtful/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>and he left Arkane</u></a> in part over a corporate directive to title the game <em>Prey </em>— in reference to an unrelated IP owned by the parent company — over his objections. “I’m grateful that a company will give me the means to make a game and trust my ability with so many millions of dollars… but there is a bit of the artistic, creative side that is insulted when you tell this artist, ‘Your game is going to be called <em>Prey</em>,’” he said. “I’m not in control of my own boat at this point.”</p><p>In <em>Dishonored</em>, power was fun for its own sake, and when you got your characters back on the throne, a glossy if hazy golden age followed. But everything Arkane has made since <em>Prey </em>has been concerned with the idea of destroying power at its source, even though power is the thing that gives the player means and trusts in their ability.</p><p>The change is best observed with <em>Dishonored</em>’s Outsider, who at the peak of Arkane’s success was an esoteric but in practical terms benevolent stand-in for the game designer: here are your tools, go have fun, as power is play there should be no punishment for it. After <em>Prey </em>and <em>Dishonored 2 </em>didn’t sell up to expectations, the Outsider found himself on trial for his life in the latter game’s DLC: <em>Death of the Outsider</em>. The case for his murder is not well prosecuted, only that he represents a great wellspring of power, and that some of the individuals he chooses to let draw from it might inflict harm upon the world. “The Outsider’s gifts come with a price,” grumbled a character, which has been historically untrue.</p><p>But there <em>was</em> a price, the DLC reveals, one heretofore not glimpsed by the player: The Outsider, far from being a happy champion of play, was forced into his position as a child by a cult of wealthy weirdos. So power never came at a price <em>for the player</em>, but for the game designer figure, there were strings attached. There is a purity to the push-and-pull of the designer-player relationship, but the designer does not often get to be in that position without giving something up. The Outsider does not have to die at the end of the game, but in any event, he is removed from his role as a human transformer of supernatural power. Nobody should have that power, is the final message of the <em>Dishonored</em> series; nobody should make games.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo: Bethesda Softworks</span></figcaption></figure><p>The wealthy weirdos, a favorite archetype for this sort of thing, returned in Arkane Lyon’s <em>Deathloop</em>, where the power they had cultivated was of immortality on an island where a single day repeats itself eternally. The point of it is that there are no consequences to the free exercise of power — the design philosophy of the first <em>Dishonored</em>, in other words. But in the world of <em>Deathloop</em>, this philosophy reveals itself as grotesque and hedonistic. The player takes on the role of Colt, who is given a share in this power, but as we learn, we were complicit in its creation. His moral imperative is to master the power only for the purpose of destroying it — or revel in it, which is perceived as part of the same deadened hedonism that animates the game’s enemies.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, a player should play a game only for the sake of ending it, which is quite the opposite philosophy to, say, a game-as-a-service hero shooter. But in <em>Redfall</em>, with its always-online vision of Massachusetts as populated by immortal vampires, the object once again is to end power by killing vampires, not to celebrate it. Though the player possesses certain special abilities, the<em> </em>power — the advancement in human evolution that players spent <em>Dishonored, Deus Ex, Prey</em>,<em> </em>and <em>BioShock </em>cultivating in themselves — is now in others, and it codes them as enemies. “Come out,” some roaming goon mocks the player, shortly before they are shot in the head. “Don’t you want to be something better?” Yes! In fact, that used to be the whole point.</p><p><em>Redfall</em> is existentially mixed-up, a narrative about the rejection of power while also simultaneously a gambit by Arkane to get their power back. It’s easy to chalk <em>Redfall</em> up as a wrong turn in the evolution of the immersive sim, an attempt to extrapolate its principles to a demonstrably more popular genre. Except that Microsoft, which acquired Arkane’s parent company ZeniMax in 2021, packaged the announcement of Arkane Austin’s closure with three other studios, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157264/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-studio-closure?ref=remapradio.com"><u>at least one of which had recently delivered a critical hit</u></a>. The message was muddled, as if to say that the success or failure of a studio ultimately weighs little on its survival. Or rather, the message was muddled so as to say nothing at all, for the prerogative of power is not having to explain itself.</p><p>Arkane’s games have always been about power, not power bestowed by weapons or equipment, but concentrated in the individual. Killing the Outsider — and for that matter, spinning up a studio-saving hit in a buzzy, profitable genre — was a kind of fantasy that in the wake of Arkane Austin’s closure looks even more fantastically remote. “Could we kill God?” they ask in <em>Death of the Outsider.</em> “You found a way to kill God?” Can the individual become empowered enough to transcend and escape the systems that could kill it?&nbsp;</p><p>Arkane Austin made great games, on the whole, but it makes for a bad story of its own. Its lights were turned on and then off, in such a way as to emphasize how far out of its control Arkane's own fate had become. The end gave the lie to the premise of the immersive sim: Ultimately, it did not matter how they played it. The player is dead and the Outsider exists eternal, unknowable.</p>

Let’s start with that one: The new(ish) Dialogue Camera toggle.</p><h2 id="h7234"><a id=""></a>The best new option: Dialogue Camera toggle</h2><p>Tired of how <em>Starfield</em> zooms in and frames the NPC you’re talking to in a very rigid, tired sort of way? You can shut that off, and honestly, it’s kinda wild to me what a difference this makes. You’ll find this option in Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Dialogue Camera (on/off).</p><figure id="" data-id="e62125cc797e1574e28372925e02b6c5" data-recommend-id="image://e62125cc797e1574e28372925e02b6c5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An animated gif shows the protagonist of Starfield talking to shop owners." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An animated gif shows the protagonist of Starfield talking to shop owners." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e62125cc797e1574e28372925e02b6c5" data-recommend-id="image://e62125cc797e1574e28372925e02b6c5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An animated gif shows the protagonist of Starfield talking to shop owners." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-mods-creations-paid-worth-it-steam-review-1851541215&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-mods-creations-paid-worth-it-steam-review-1851541215"><em>Starfield</em>’s Paid Mods Ignite A Review Bombing On Steam</a></span></p><p>When you shut the Dialogue Camera off, the result is a more seamless transition from gameplay/exploration to NPC chats. It also keeps your character visible in third-person mode during dialogue as well.</p><h2 id="h7235"><a id=""></a>Environmental damage and survival mechanics</h2><p>These options are likely to be a little divisive as survival mechanics aren’t everyone’s cup of tea. But hey, when nearly all of these darn planets are virtually empty, adding survival mechanics like hunger, thirst, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-afflictions-environmental-hazard-healing-1850853815&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-afflictions-environmental-hazard-healing-1850853815">the effects of environmental hazards</a></span> to basic traversal can be a fun way to challenge yourself as you chart out across the stars. </p><figure id="" data-id="57fd35db4c7cda4dc0b03d05473404c2" data-recommend-id="image://57fd35db4c7cda4dc0b03d05473404c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the menus of Starfield shows a variety of difficulty options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the menus of Starfield shows a variety of difficulty options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="57fd35db4c7cda4dc0b03d05473404c2" data-recommend-id="image://57fd35db4c7cda4dc0b03d05473404c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the menus of Starfield shows a variety of difficulty options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll also earn more XP for the more challenging settings. And if you really don’t want any of these mechanics, even the ones that appeared in vanilla <em>Starfield</em>, you can also turn off environmental damage and afflictions entirely.</p><h3 id="h7236"><a id=""></a>Sustenance</h3><p>“Sustenance” is one of the new options and, as you might’ve guessed, it challenges you to maintain hunger and thirst levels in two different ways. In “Positive Only,” you won’t suffer for not eating or drinking, but doing so will still give you two new statuses, Fed and Hydrated. They work as follows: </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fed: Gained from eating food. Increases health by 30%, melee damage by 15%, and adds 25% additional carrying capacity.</li><li>Hydrated: Gained from drinking. Increases O2 recovery by 30%, sneak attack damage by 15%, and lets you reload guns 25% faster. </li></ul><p>That’s not all Sustenance has to offer. If you want a greater challenge, you can also select “Positive &amp; Negative” which will punish you for not consuming food and water. With this setting on, you’re at risk of the following: </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Malnourished: Gained from not eating food. Decreases health by 30%, reduces melee damage by 15%, and docks your carrying capacity by 25%.</li><li>Dehydrated: Gained from not drinking. Decreases O2 recovery by 30%, lowers sneak attack damage by 15%, and reduces reload speed of guns by 25%.</li></ul><p>Bethesda’s vanilla survival options via Sustenance are very simple. You can be in Fed and Hydrated status for just 30 minutes at a time. This means you’re likely to hit Malnourished and Dehydrated fairly often. I like mapping food and water to the left side of the Favorites quick menu to easily snack on something or grab a drink when needed, bypassing the need to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-release-menu-ui-starmap-inventory-xbox-review-1850797661&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-release-menu-ui-starmap-inventory-xbox-review-1850797661">dive into <em>Starfield</em>’s clunky menus</a></span>.</p><h3 id="h7237"><a id=""></a>Environmental damage and afflictions</h3><p>Not only can you entirely shut off environmental damage in these settings, you can also make things a little harder for yourself. If you change Environmental Damage &amp; Afflictions to Advanced, you’ll have to manage impacts to your health in addition to status afflictions. When you take on an affliction from the environment, you’ll also start losing health. A portion of your health meter will turn orange, blocking the amount of health you can heal up until your affliction is removed. </p><p>If you’re at all familiar with how radiation works in <em>Fallout</em>, this will sound very familiar. </p><p>There are also a collection of other affliction options that affect how treatment and prognosis works. You can disable whether or not you gain afflictions from combat and can adjust how easily they heal over time.</p><h2 id="h7238"><a id=""></a>Other cool difficulty tweaks</h2><p><em>Starfield</em> now has four difficulty options, spread out across how much damage Enemies output on foot and on ship, and how much damage you output on foot and on ship. These options list how they modify the game in the Gameplay Options menu.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-starfield-shattered-space-1851528944&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-starfield-shattered-space-1851528944"><em>Shattered Space </em>Looks Like The Dose Of Personality <em>Starfield</em> Needs</a></span></p><p>But that’s not all. You can also tweak settings that influence your overall carry capacity, how you heal, and alterations to the in-game economy.</p><h2 id="h7239"><a id=""></a>Carry capacity, vendor credits, healing, and more</h2><p>While these settings can enhance a survival experience, they can also just amplify <em>Starfield</em>’s original gameplay loop (or, if you prefer, attenuate certain aspects of it).</p><h3 id="h7240"><a id=""></a>Changes to item management, carrying capacity, and vendor credits.</h3><p>There are two handy settings to change up how much you can carry and how best you can manage it.

While your cargo capacity will still be limited by the size of your ship’s cargo hold, you can choose to restrict cargo access to only when you’re actively inside your ship, or allow unlimited access to your ship’s cargo no matter where you are. Another setting allows you cargo access only while in outposts in settlements.</p><p>In Gameplay Options, you’ll also find a setting to either increase or reduce the amount of credits that vendors have on hand.</p><h3 id="h7241"><a id=""></a>Healing settings</h3><p><em>Starfield</em> now offers you influence over three sources of healing: Medical Items, Food, and Sleep. For the first two options, you can influence how much or how little Med Packs, other healing-specific items, and food heals you. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-creations-mods-best-immersive-1851536437&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-creations-mods-best-immersive-1851536437"><em>Starfield</em>: 6 Free Mods For A More Immersive Experience</a></span></p><p>You can also adjust how much sleeping restores your health, and base it on where you sleep.

She’s also a major supporting character from the start of <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> 2.0.</p><p>Jade, a Quantum Erudition character, is the second featured five-star, and Topaz and Adventurine’s boss from the IPC Strategic Investment Department. Her name has popped up many times in the story, but she makes her official debut in the chapter during Phase 2.<br></p><p>Firefly is out now. She launched with the start of the 2.3 update on June 18. Jade launches in the later half of the update on July 10. Ruan Mei (Ice, Harmony) and Argenti (Erudition, Physical) will run alongside Firefly and Jade respectively.<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Honkai: Star Rail 2.3 Phase 1 (June 18-July 10): Firefly (Fire, Destruction), Ruan Mei (Ice, Harmony)</li><li><em>Boosted 4-Stars: Gallagher (Fire, Abundance), Misha (Ice, Destruction), Xueyi (Quantum, Destruction)</em></li><li>Honkai: Star Rail 2.3 Phase 2 (July 10-July 30): Jade (Quantum, Erudition), Argenti (Physical, Erudition)</li><li><em>Boosted 4-Stars: Serval (Lightning, Erudition), Natasha (Physical, Abundance), Asta (Fire, Harmony)</em></li></ul><figure id="" data-id="849440a12a0fbce99cfbb235b796664e" data-recommend-id="image://849440a12a0fbce99cfbb235b796664e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some promo art for Firefly." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Some promo art for Firefly." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->miHoYo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="849440a12a0fbce99cfbb235b796664e" data-recommend-id="image://849440a12a0fbce99cfbb235b796664e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some promo art for Firefly." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h7898"><a id=""></a>Should I pull for Firefly or Jade?</h2><p>If you like the look or personality of one character over the other, and only need a little bit of convincing based on their kit, seriously, just go for the one you want. Both Firefly and Jade both have enough strengths to keep you happy if you decide to pull for them.<br></p><p>That said, here are a few reasons why you might consider one or the other, and a few pros and cons for each.<br></p><h3 id="h7899"><a id=""></a>Firefly</h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Works well with F2P-friendly characters </li><li>Ultimate immediately makes her take action</li><li>Enhanced Skill and Talent implant Fire weakness</li><li>Takes less damage the lower her HP</li></ul><p>Firefly was already expected to be one of the strongest DPSes in the game upon launch. Now that she’s out and about, we’ve easily concluded that those suspicions are true. All her skills work together to restore health, regenerate energy, push her forward in the turn economy, and even implant weaknesses to enable her Break Effect. These skills make it easier to enable her without the help of popular support characters like Tingyun, Bronya, and Huohuo.<br></p><p>Her Skill increases power and charges her Ultimate, which is where she deals the most damage with enhanced attacks. These attacks don’t require you to use Skill Points, either. She also applies Fire weakness to enemies herself, eliminating the need to implant weaknesses with a character like Silver Wolf. Like many Destruction characters, she consumes HP to increase her attack power, but that isn’t much of an issue when she heals herself, and reduces damage the lower her health is.<br></p><p>She’s also easier to invest in for newer players because of how well she works with easy-to-obtain characters. Harmony Trailblazer is her best teammate thanks to how well she can utilize their Super Break effect. If that wasn’t enough to make you pull for her, Harmony Trailblazer is available for free right now through the “When Charmony Rings Out…” permanent event in the Travel Log section of Star Rail’s phone dashboard. That way, you don’t even need to catch up to Penacony if you just started to unlock Harmony Trailblazer.</p><p>Besides Trailblazer, you can use whichever healer you want and another Harmony or Nihility character to help with skill point management or maximize damage. Firefly notably works well with Ruan Mei, the other five-star running alongside her and a popular support in the Break Effect meta. Gallagher is the best healer because his outgoing healing and debuffs scale based with Break Effect. His Fire element ensures that he can help break Toughness because of Firefly’s implant ability, too.<br></p><p>Many other characters besides Ruan Mei and Gallagher can enable her, even if they won’t work as well. Maybe you raised Asta or still only have Natasha as a healer. Those two would work. I’d still say Ruan Mei is the second best teammate after Harmony Trailblazer, but she’s a five-star. In short, pull for Firefly if you want a strong, self-sufficient hypercarry DPS that leans into the Break Effect meta.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="568f7a82cdd4de010f54ddb36088bbf0" data-recommend-id="image://568f7a82cdd4de010f54ddb36088bbf0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2532" data-height="1170" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A busy character screen in Honkai." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A busy character screen in Honkai." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->miHoYo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="568f7a82cdd4de010f54ddb36088bbf0" data-recommend-id="image://568f7a82cdd4de010f54ddb36088bbf0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2532" data-height="1170" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A busy character screen in Honkai." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h7900"><a id=""></a>Jade</h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Can fit into more teams than Firefly</li><li>Buffs teammate with skill that increases speed and offers coordinated attack</li><li>Ultimate that buffs follow-up attack</li><li>Follow-up attack raises Crit DMG</li><li>Skill point friendly</li></ul><p>Jade might not be able to defeat loads of enemies on her own, but adding her to a well-equipped team can make taking down waves of foes easier than without. She fills an entirely different role than Firefly as a sub DPS and enabler. Even though she’s an Erudition character (multi-target-focused), she has Harmony-like traits and self-buffing that gives her more utility than the average.<br></p><p>Jade’s Skill significantly increases the speed of your ally of choice and turns them into a “Debt Collector.” The Debt Collector benefits from a hefty speed boost and coordinated attacks while this buff is active. As this is happening, Jade collects stacks (similar to Adventurine) from each attack, which eventually triggers a heavy-hitting follow-up attack. She works best when paired with Erudition or follow-up-focused teammates that can help build her stacks.<br></p><p>Unfortunately, Jade’s best teammates will be hard-hitting five-star characters like Blade or Argenti. Blade in particular works well because Jade can trigger his buffs with her Skill, which consumes HP from the target. Jingliu and Blade are one example of a popular pair that use the same mechanic. Jingliu eats Blade’s HP, which then triggers his heavy-hitting follow-up attack between turns. Jade fits a similar role for Blade.<br></p><p>Herta in particular is worth highlighting as a F2P teammate because she’s free, and you can earn her Eidolons from the Simulated Universe. Both Herta and Himeko benefit from Break Effect to trigger their follow-up attacks. Meanwhile, Argenti and Blade just do a lot of damage, but can be an expensive investment for newer players who don’t have enough resources to get them.<br></p><p>On the bright side, because Jade is a sub DPS or support, you might get more use out of her in the long run because she’ll fit into more teams. Many Erudition characters work well in double DPS teams that excel in clearing waves of enemies, and it’s just a matter of mix and matching depending on type weaknesses. In a Firefly team, Firefly is the star. She doesn’t have the means to support; her kit is mostly for her benefit rather than enabling others.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="f3b4f8ed386bd5082775e08b1ab73883" data-recommend-id="image://f3b4f8ed386bd5082775e08b1ab73883" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jumpy fighty blade-wielding action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jumpy fighty blade-wielding action." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->miHoYo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f3b4f8ed386bd5082775e08b1ab73883" data-recommend-id="image://f3b4f8ed386bd5082775e08b1ab73883" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jumpy fighty blade-wielding action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h7901"><a id=""></a>Who is better: Firefly or Jade?</h2><p>If you can only pull for one, I’d suggest going for <strong>Firefly</strong>. She can deal much more damage on her own, and can break Toughness on virtually any enemy. She doesn’t need other DPSes to enable her, and her best teammate is a free one that you’ve technically had since the beginning (therefore, have probably already raised). Firefly also has a lot of built in utility, like recharging her own Ultimate and implanting Fire weaknesses to enable her Break Effect abilities. While strong, Jade works best as part of a double DPS comp and still doesn’t offer as much utility as Firefly. </p><p>Again, this is just based on damage and investment. Jade is still a good choice if you don’t particularly want Firefly. I’d argue that you should still pull for Ruan Mei over her, but that’s besides the point. For a new player, Firefly is better value because her best teammates are easy to get. Therefore, investments will be cheaper. Jade requires other strong characters around her to be strong herself. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Funcom [77 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/funcom">Funcom</a> has released a new set of trailers and screenshots for <a title="Genres > Open-World [434 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> survival <a title="Genres > Massively Multiplayer Online [40 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/mmo">massively multiplayer online game</a> <em><a title="Games > Dune: Awakening [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a></em> as part of the game’s second <em>Dune: Awakening</em> Direct showcase. <span id="more-894315"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>The showcase offers 30 minutes of in-depth interviews and game footage showing character creation, the MMO-like server structure, the narrative ramifications of a world where Paul Atreides was never born, and the spiritual journey the player will undergo in the game, following in the footsteps of the Fremen.</p><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em>, which recently shot past one million wishlists on Steam, draws on the visual and aural identity created by Denis Villeneuve and Legendary’s recent blockbuster movies and is deeply rooted in the original masterpiece by Frank Herbert. The game unleashes you on a vast and open Arrakis torn by war, where you must survive and strive for control of the spice alongside hundreds of other players.</p><p>Premiered at Summer Game Fest, the story cinematic—<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/06/dune-awakening-the-vision-of-paul-atreides-cinematic-trailer">The Vision of Paul Atreides</a>—revealed the alternate timeline that Jessica Atreides creates by choosing to give birth to a daughter instead of Paul, beginning a cascading chain of events. Paul’s absence leads to a huge power vacuum into which players will venture, creating their own story.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_894305"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>“Expression and customization” is one of the core pillars of <em>Dune: Awakening</em>. To showcase a part of that, the Direct shows off the robust in-game character creation tool. Choose every detail of your appearance, then your home planet, and even your mentor’s specialization, such as Mentat, Swordmaster, or Bene Gesserit, which determines your starting abilities.</p><p>Creative director Joel Bylos also dived into the server structure and the Overland Map, which connects various massive sandbox maps, allowing for a larger number of players in each, both of which set <em>Dune: Awakening</em> apart from many other <a title="Genres > Survival [292 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival games</a>.</p><p>“Making the world feel seamless and connected has always been one of our goals on <em>Dune: Awakening</em>,” said creative director Joel Bylos. “We built this structure with the idea of making the game expandable, which is difficult with a single map. The idea with the overland map is that it allows us to just keep building the world and giving players new spaces to explore. Who knows what it will look like five years from now?”</p><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em> has recently entered its persistent closed Beta, giving access to the full breadth of the game, from the Hagga Basin starting area to the Deep Desert endgame. Sign up for a chance to join on the official website, and wishlist the game on Steam.</p><p>With Gamescom coming up in August, Funcom now prepares for an epic Dune: Awakening gameplay reveal.</p></blockquote><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em> is in development for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,336 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,608 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,514 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>).

<p data-characters="252" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Super Evil Megacorp has announced that their roguelite turtle game, <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate</em>, is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/store/products/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-splintered-fate-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to Switch</a> on July 17. It was <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-splintered-fate-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously available</a> for iOS via Apple Arcade and is now coming to a more thumb-friendly platform.</p> <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="455" data-injectable="true">I don’t like touching my phone, so I don’t have any experience with <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate</em>. It’s a top-down fighting game that looks pretty hack and slashy. There are dashes that probably have invincibility frames. It looks very <em>Hades-like</em>, but there’s co-op. There <em>has</em> to be co-op. It would be an affront to good taste if a <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> game didn’t have co-op. We’re not on the NES and Game Boy anymore.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate - Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fIaR93sOHRQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true"><em>Splintered Fate</em> is said to feature “an all-new story written by legendary comic book author Tom Waltz and Kevin Michael Johnson.” The roguelite angle seems strange to me because I’m pretty sure the turtles are married to their weapons, but apparently, there is a “diverse build system” that allows you to&nbsp; “create the elemental-infused Teenage Turtle of their dreams.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="97" data-current-count="97" data-injectable="false">I’ve never dreamed of infusing a Teenage Turtle with elements, but I get what they’re saying.</p> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="true">It also touts that it has received “over 22,000 5/5 radical player reviews,” which doesn’t mean much to me. Especially since the app store on my phone only says 1K ratings. Still, I looked up reviews and they’re pretty positive, if maybe not enthusiastic. Still, if you’re into ‘90s-locked turtle ‘tude, it may be worth checking out.</p>
 <p data-characters="84" data-current-count="84" data-injectable="false"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate</em> launches on Switch July 17 for $29.99.</p>

		<p>The classic (depending on your point of view) Marvel vs Capcom fighting games are return in one collection, backed up with a couple of Marvel only titles. The ridiculously named MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is coming to coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Steam later this year. You will note that Xbox players are left out, and there’s no specific PS5 version either.</p>
<p><iframe title="MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LLS4-W4Yq84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The games are:</p>
<p>– X-MEN CHILDREN OF THE ATOM<br>
– MARVEL SUPER HEROES<br>
– X-MEN VS. STREET FIGHTER<br>
– MARVEL SUPER HEROES vs. STREET FIGHTER<br>
– MARVEL vs. CAPCOM CLASH OF SUPER HEROES<br>
– MARVEL vs. CAPCOM 2 New Age of Heroes<br>
– THE PUNISHER</p>

<p>As usual there are a bunch of enhancements for the games including custom matches, spectator features, museum, music player, various display filters, one-button special moves and the ability to save and load the game at any point you wish. “Rollback netcode will make online battles even smother”, add <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/capcom/">Capcom.</a> The game will not have cross play support.</p>

			<p>Today, Funcom released its second <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-qa-creative-director-clarifies-mmo-size-hints-at-beyond-arrakis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune: Awakening</a> Direct, where Game Director Joel Bylos revealed more details of the upcoming survival MMO.</p>
<p>To start with, we learned that following the previous limited Closed Beta events, Dune: Awakening has recently entered the persistent Closed Beta phase, which is obviously a step toward the full release, allowing testers to check out the whole game. There's still no word on the launch, although Funcom has already promised an 'epic' gameplay reveal at Gamescom, and that might be the venue for such announcements.</p>
<p>Throughout the Dune: Awakening Direct, the studio showed the character creation tool, where players choose not only how their character looks but also their background, including their mentor's specialization, such as Mentat, Bene Gesserit, Trooper, and Swordmaster.</p>
<p>However, the juiciest part of the video was the overview of the world structure. Funcom explained that there is a top-down Overland map connecting the various huge maps, one of which supports hundreds of players at once. This choice allows the studio to expand the game more easily in the future with additional playable spaces than it could have with a single map. If you're interested in the full breakdown of how the MMO component of Dune: Awakening works, here's the excerpt from Bylos.</p>
<p><em>When players start to play Dune: Awakening, they choose a world. It's almost like choosing a server in an MMORPG, but it's a large infrastructure of connected servers. The idea is that as a player, you choose, you join, you start in a map, and from there, your experience should be relatively seamless in terms of how you explore and feel the world.</em></p>
<p><em>The reason we call it a survival MMO, as opposed to just a survival game, is that most survival games do one map, one server. But we have multiple connected servers running in a single world, and it also allows us to have a lot more players in this structure.</em></p>
<p><em>When you join the game, you start in the Hagga Basin map, which has a server with a minimum of 40 other players. It's a place where you can build, craft, survive, progress. If you want to play specifically with friends, you want to join the same version of Hagga Basin because it can have multiple versions. And then from there, you move outwards. </em></p>
<p><em>I can select which Hagga Basin I'm starting with. So if we start in Dune: Awakening at the same time, I can make sure that we're spawning in the same. Not only that, our server browser also tells you where your friends are playing. </em><em>Once you're ready to leave the Hagga Basin, you craft yourself an ornithopter and you fly out into what's called the Overland map, which allows you to see all the locations in the world. You physically fly between locations on the Overland map.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DA_OverlandMap_Infographic.gif"></a></figure>

<p><em>One of those options are the social hubs, Harko Village and Arrakeen, which are differently themed based on the different factions in the game. These are safe spaces, peaceful by the Canley Peace. There are bars, vendors, and home exchanges.&nbsp;And of course, you and your friends can go dancing in the clubs.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Then you'll go back to the Overland map and you'll fly to the Deep Desert. The Deep Desert is this massive area, a minimum of 500 square kilometers. It's actually a bit larger than that. That's where you can meet hundreds of other players in Dune: Awakening. There is probably going to be a player cap if too many people go there, but it should be able to handle quite a lot of people, and that's a completely seamless set of servers that are all connected together.</em></p>
<p><em>It's generally a PVP map with a strip of PVE as people enter so that they can be safe when they come into the map and don't get ganked. The cool thing about the Deep Desert map is that we have this thing called the Coriolis Storm, which every week wipes the Deep Desert and sets it with a new landscape and new points of interest, so it's an infinitely explorable space and a really cool place to hang with your friends.</em></p>

<p>Despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-will-be-released-when-its-ready-as-funcom-wants-to-reduce-its-famous-jank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lack of a release window,</a> Dune: Awakening remains on our radar as one of the most promising multiplayer games. It will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, though we don't know yet if it'll support cross-play.</p>

Meanwhile, watching from my desktop is Mustard, my new digital pet. He’s from a different game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/weyrdlets&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/weyrdlets"><em>Weyrdlets</em></a></span>, and he’s hanging out with me as I work and play games on my PC. After killing some guards in <em>Selaco</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>I make sure to pet Mustard before reloading and getting back into the mayhem. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196539" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Innovative Hades-Like Feels Built For Speedrunners" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="278" data-playlist="196539,193379,191355" data-current="196539"><div><p>This Innovative Hades-Like Feels Built For Speedrunners</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196539/196539_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196539/196539_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196539/196539_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196539/196539_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22094.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Mustard, a little pink lizard-like creature I created and named, is a good companion.  I wanted to know more about how he came to be and what it’s like making an indie game in 2024. So I spoke to Weyrdworks, the devs behind <em>Weyrdlets</em>, to find out how this game works and how you break through among all the other new games launching on Steam every day.</p><p>“<em>Weyrdlets </em>is a cozy virtual pet game centered around a community and a simulated virtual world of colorful characters,” explained game director Shawn Beck. “There aren’t any real objectives or goals to achieve. It’s all about caring for a pet in a wholesome community of friends. Think of it as a desktop companion that’s also an idle game.”</p><p>According to the game’s art director, JT Yean, <em>Weyderlets</em> was inspired by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-the-kotaku-review-1842321314&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-the-kotaku-review-1842321314"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a></span>, a game that is also mostly about vibes and chilling with cute critters. Yean says that Weyrdlets is meant to “fade into the background” as you do other things on your PC. </p><p>“Think Microsoft Clippy, but better,” adds social media specialist Wing Yee. </p><h2 id="h7479"><a id=""></a>A little digital friend on your big screen</h2><p>While you can play <em>Weyderlets </em>like any other game—with it taking over your screen as you help build a new home for your pet, train them, and play with them—the coolest feature of this virtual pet sim is when you free your buddy and let them run around on your desktop as you do other things. </p><p>According to Beck, the team had wanted to make a virtual pet game for some time but didn’t have a “hook” for it. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/untitled-goose-fan-game-unleashes-havoc-on-your-desktop-1841351806&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/untitled-goose-fan-game-unleashes-havoc-on-your-desktop-1841351806"><em>Desktop Goose</em> and other games</a></span> that put characters on your desktop helped guide the team. </p><p>“It’s not a new concept, for sure,” said Beck. “But we’ve tried a lot of other desktop pet games, and they were more toys than games. It just seemed like there was more to explore.”<br></p><p>The team says balancing the virtual pet on your desktop was tricky. The cute pet needs to require some of your attention, you’ll sometimes need to feed it or pet it, but they always had to make sure your cute critter never felt annoying. </p><p>How this all works, according to the devs, is that <em>Weyrdlets </em>is running on screen with a transparent background. So you can see and interact with your desktop as your virtual pet runs around and demands food. In my time with <em>Weyrdlets</em>, I’ve never been annoyed by Mustard, even when he would wander in front of my emails. And I was always able to get work done, watch videos, or play other games, too. </p><h2 id="h7480"><a id=""></a>Getting people to play your new game in 2024</h2><p>Of course, in 2024, even a cute virtual pet game inspired by <em>Animal Crossing</em> might struggle to find an audience. I asked the team if they were concerned about being buried by all the other <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/steam-breaks-another-annual-record-launching-more-than-14000-games-in-2023/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/steam-breaks-another-annual-record-launching-more-than-14000-games-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">big and small releases that seemingly launch every day on Steam</a></span>. </p><p>“We’re worried all the time,” admitted Beck. “Really, all we can do is put our best foot forward and build something focused on bringing value to our players. Though I hope being in a niche space of virtual pets will help separate us from the noise.”</p><figure id="" data-id="4edd54d99b5f18892d46edd0eabc9163" data-recommend-id="image://4edd54d99b5f18892d46edd0eabc9163" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="914" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows someone playing Weyrdlets.

I’m still new to the games industry, but being involved in the development of a game is really exciting, whether you’re on the dev team or cheering from the sidelines.”<br></p><p>Assuming Weyrdworks is able to get people playing and enjoying its desktop pet sim, the team has big plans for the future, including a soccer mode and more. </p><p>“<em>Weyrdlets </em>is a continuously evolving game, meaning it will continue to receive updates, events, minigames, and other exciting features even after launch,” said Yee. “The fun never stops.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366060/Weyrdlets/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366060/Weyrdlets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Weyrdlets </em>launches on July 23</a></span>. A Mac version of the game will arrive sometime after launch. You can currently download and play a free demo of the game on Steam. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PC gamers of a certain vintage will remember tales of <a href="https://projectvanburen.com/">Project Van Buren</a>, a title that early '00s Interplay intended as the sequel to 1998's hit <em>Fallout 2</em>. Now, original <em>Fallout</em> producer Timothy Cain <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwoWRj0cfag">is sharing some behind-the-scenes details</a> about how he contributed to the project's cancellation during a particularly difficult time for publisher Interplay.</p>
<p>Cain famously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGfaCXEu0tE&amp;t=0s">left Interplay during <em>Fallout 2</em>'s development</a> in the late '90s to help form <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2005/02/games-20050219/">short-lived</a> RPG house <a href="https://archive.arstechnica.com/reviews/01q3/arcanum/arcanum.html">Troika Games</a>. After his departure, though, he was still in touch with some people from his former employer, including an unnamed Interplay vice president looking for some outside opinions on the troubled Van Buren project.</p>
<p>"Would you mind coming over and playing one of my game prototypes?" Cain recalls this vice president asking him sometime in mid-2003. "We're making a <em>Fallout</em> game and I'm going to have to cancel it. I don't think they can get it done... but if you could come over and look at it and give me an estimate, there's a chance I wouldn't cancel it."</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OwoWRj0cfag?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>Cain discusses his memories of testing "Project Van Buren."</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Cain recalls walking "across the street" from Troika to the Interplay offices, motivated to help because, as he remembers it, "if you don't do it, bad things will happen to other people." There, he got to see the latest build of Project Van Buren, running on <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Jefferson_Engine">the 3D Jefferson Engine</a> that was intended to replace the sprite-based isometric view of the first two <em>Fallout</em> games. Cain said the version he played was similar or identical to <a href="https://www.nma-fallout.com/resources/van-burens-technical-demo.71/history">a tech demo obtained by fan site No Mutants Allowed in 2007</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD-LCsIiw2g&amp;t=0s">featured in a recent YouTube documentary</a> about the failed project.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>After playing for about two hours and talking to the team behind the project, Cain said the VP asked him directly how long the demo needed to become a shippable game. The answer Cain reportedly gave—18 months of standard development for "a really good game" or 12 months of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/05/the-death-march-the-problem-of-crunch-time-in-game-development/">"death march" crunch time</a> for an unbalanced, buggy mess—was too long for the financially strapped publisher to devote to funding the project.
</p><p>"He could not afford a development period of more than six months," Cain said. "To me, that time frame was out of the question... He thought it couldn't be done in six months; I just confirmed that."</p>
<h2>Show me the money</h2>
<p>Looking back today, Cain said it's hard to pinpoint a single "villain" responsible for Van Buren's failure. Even reusing the engine from the first <em>Fallout</em> game—as the <em>Fallout 2</em> team did for that title's quick 12-month development process—wouldn't have necessarily helped, Cain said. "Would that engine have been acceptable five years later [after <em>Fallout 2</em>]?" he asked rhetorically. "Had anyone really looked at it? I started the engine in 1994... it's creaky."</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DD-LCsIiw2g?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>Real "Van Buren"-heads will enjoy this in-depth look at the game's development, including details of Interplay's troubled financial situation in the early '00s.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the end, Van Buren's cancellation (and that of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/04/interplays-fallout-mmo-may-not-see-light-of-day/">a planned Interplay <em>Fallout</em> MMO</a> years later) simply "comes down to money," Cain said. "I do not believe that [with] the money they had left, the game in the state it was in, and the people who were working on it could have completed it within six months," he said. "And [if they did], I don't think it would have been a game you would have liked playing."
</p><p>Luckily, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/interplay-offices-closed-by-state-officials/1100-6100019/">all-but-name shuttering of Interplay</a> in the years after Van Buren's cancellation wouldn't spell the end of the <em>Fallout</em> series. Bethesda <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/04/bethesda-obtains-fallout-ip/">acquired the license in 2007</a>, leading to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/10/fallout-3-review/">a completely reimagined <em>Fallout 3</em></a> that has become the cornerstone of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/fallout-games-continue-seeing-big-player-jumps-after-the-tv-series-success/">a fan-favorite franchise</a> many years later. But for those still wondering what Interplay's original "Fallout 3" could have been, a group of fans is <a href="https://projectvanburen.com/">trying to rebuild the Project Van Buren demo from the ground up</a> for modern audiences.</p>

<section><p>Dune: Awakening looks to have a huge game map, and as you search for scarce resources, you'll potentially have to fight other players to claim them.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">We've heard a lot about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-dune-awakening-youll-fight-to-survive-sandworms-political-machinations-and-other-players/1100-6521543/" data-ref-id="1100-6521543">survival aspect</a> of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening</a>--such as the way you'll need to conserve water, stay out of the baking Arrakis sun, and carefully avoid ever-present sandworms. While it seems that staying alive on the least hospitable planet in the universe will take up a lot of your attention, the other part of Dune: Awakening is a slate of MMO elements, including the way you'll tangle with other players who are also doing their best to survive.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Fancom gave a hands-off demonstration of Dune: Awakening during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/summer-game-fest-2024/">Summer Game Fest 2024's Play Days event</a>, giving a quick new look at the survival MMO and particularly showing off a bit of its moment-to-moment gameplay. While we didn't get to play the game ourselves, we did see it <em>being</em> played, which gave a sense of the fact that while you're completing quests and keeping yourself alive, there will be times when you've got to contend with other players who might want what you have.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo picked up right after the player had cleared out an underground ecology lab, one of the locations that serves as Dune: Awakening's equivalent to a dungeon. We were told that this character was in about the midgame, around 60 hours in, having gone beyond basic survival to gather and craft elements like a suspensor belt--a special bit of levitation technology that allowed them to make very high jumps and to float down from high locations unscathed--and an ornithopter, a flying vehicle for getting around. Leaving the dungeon, the player jumped right into their ornithopter, lifted it up, and transitioned out of the dungeon and out into the desert at large.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the Hagga Basin, which looks like it'll be a main focus of much of Dune: Awakening, at least early on. As social and economic director Matt Woodward explained during the demo, the location supports around 40 players in an instance, and is made up of a variety of different locations. There are places like the lab, expanses of desert, and villages or outposts you can visit. The ornithopter did a pass over a few different parts of the location, including the open desert, where we landed for a quick look around.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321239-duneornithoptercombat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321239" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321239-duneornithoptercombat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321239"></a><figcaption>Ornithopters are a good way to get around the desert without attracting sandworm attention, but everything else is vulnerable.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321239-duneornithoptercombat.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In Frank Herbert's novel, the desert isn't uniform--the sand can sometimes compress to conduct sound extremely well, known as drum sand, and we also saw a bubbling area where subsurface liquid created quicksand. The player used the suspensor belt to jump free of the quicksand before sinking, but as all Dune fans know, messing around with that technology attracts the worm--which showed up a few seconds later. It was back to the ornithopter to avoid being eaten. Sandworms are a big hazard in Dune: Awakening, because while you retain your gear if you're killed by other means, anything on you when you're eaten by a sandworm (along with vehicles or anything else that gets consumed) is gone forever.</p><p dir="ltr">Next, the demo took us to a non-combat zone: a Harkonnen base. In this playthrough, the player had sided with the Harkonnen faction, making them allies to the great house but enemies with anyone loyal to the Atreides, the house of Dune's usual protagonists. The base, Woodward said, was created using the same building system that Dune: Awakening makes available to characters, with only a few developer-specific pieces. The gist is that you'll be able to construct your own bases and dwellings at the same level of quality as the developers, if you want.</p><p dir="ltr">The Harkonnen base was a spot where the player could pick up quests or talk to NPCs if they wanted to. This is also the kind of place where you can talk to trainer characters who can unlock new abilities for your character. You choose a role at the start of the game, like being a human computer called a Mentat, a swordmaster, or a Bene Gesserit who can deploy special abilities like the mind-controlling Voice. But you're not limited to just the abilities and skill trees you get when you choose your starting conditions. In the Harkonnen base, the demo showed us the Mentat trainer, who can help you start unlocking Mentat abilities for your character so you can mix and match how you play.</p><p dir="ltr">Leaving the Harkonnen base by grabbing another vehicle, a land-based buggy, we headed to a new location: a crashed spaceship. The ship had smashed through the surface of Arrakis and was located deep in a gorge. It was full of valuable stuff, so the Harkonnens and the Atreides had each set up a base at one end of the gorge, hoping to protect the wreck itself from the other faction. That had resulted in something of a stalemate between the two.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321240-da_harkovillage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321240" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321240-da_harkovillage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321240"></a><figcaption>Which social spaces you can enter, like Harko Village, is determined by your faction alignment.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321240-da_harkovillage.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The gorge was a good demonstration of the way locations are laid out in Dune: Awakening. The Harkonnen base is a non-combat area, essentially a social location. Outside of it, in the gorge, is a "Limited Warfare" area, which consists of PvE gameplay, where you'll take down enemy soldiers and NPCs. The shipwreck itself, however, is a "War of Assassins" area, named after the larger conflict between the Atreides and the Harkonnen--a full PvP zone.</p><p dir="ltr">The reason for that is because the shipwreck contains valuable, one-of-a-kind schematics you can use to create new gear. Venturing into the ship, your goal is to find that schematic and leave with it. In this case, it allowed the crafting of a new, powerful rifle, but since there's only one schematic in the shipwreck at a time, in order to liberate it for yourself, you'll have to deal with anyone else who's also trying to take it. The demo obviously didn't have anyone else contending for that schematic, but in the live game, heading into locations like this will be a risk.</p><p dir="ltr">Woodward explained that, when you get the schematic out of the ship and can craft the item, you'll get precisely one of them. If you want another rifle, you'll have to repeat the process of finding the schematic and getting it home safely. That gives you some economic power, though, allowing you to sell the schematic or the rifle to other players and charging the kind of price that a tough-to-get item like that should command.</p><p>The playthrough of the demo ended after leaving the crashed ship, but Woodward gave a little more context of just how large we can expect Dune: Awakening to be. The Hagga Basin, he said, is comparable to the size of Conan: Exile's map, about 64 square kilometers. Dune: Awakening will also have social locations like the capital city of Arrakeen, and the Harkonnen town Harko Village. Leaving the Hagga Basin by ornithopter takes you to an overworld map that lets you travel between major locales.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321241-da_overlandmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321241" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321241-da_overlandmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321241"></a><figcaption>The overworld map allows you to move between different major locations, like Hagga Basin and the deep desert.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321241-da_overlandmap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And then there's the deep desert--the high-level PvP area where you're seemingly going to put a lot of effort. Forming groups and guilds, you'll head into the deep desert to harvest spice, search labs, and find wrecked ships, among other things. Just like in the wrecked ship, you'll potentially fight other players as you try to claim unique schematics in the deep desert each week. Woodward said that the deep desert is the size of three of the 8-kilometer by 8-kilometer Hagga Basin map. Each week, a Coriolis Storm will reset the whole area, so not only are you going to be revisiting it over and over, but it's going to be a huge area that will take a while to explore after each sweep.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the demo only lasted a few minutes, it still gave an interesting new take on Dune: Awakening, and in particular, how the game's survival and MMO elements are going to work and meld together. There's still a lot of the game we need to see in action, and the demo only gave quick looks at things like actually exploring and interacting with the desert, or engaging in combat--which seems like it can be pretty different from one player to the next, depending on what path you decide to take. But the ideas of questing, surviving, and fighting other players for cool, finite resources all sound like intense and fun additions to Dune: Awakening and great uses of the Dune setting. We'll have to keep waiting to see even more, but what Funcom has shown so far looks promising.</p>
