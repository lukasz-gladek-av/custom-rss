		<p>What next for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> developer Poncle? Well, more Vampire Survivors, kind of. Vampire Crawlers: The Turbo Wildcard is a first person dungeon crawler with a streak of playing tons and tons of cards from your hand.</p>
<p>The game is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and it’ll be a day one game into Game Pass. It’s expected for release in 2026, but poncle just say it’ll be along when it’s good and ready.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire Crawlers coming day one with Xbox Game Pass in 2026 | Xbox Partner Preview 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-b6dkZH6XSo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Speaking on Xbox Wire, Poncle founder Luca said, “This is just a spin-off of Vampire Survivors – hopefully the first in a series of spin-offs! The idea is to take some of the core pillars behind the development of VS and to apply them to existing genres. I’m talking about accessibility, immediacy, affordability, replayability, and sparkly stuff. Tons of sparkly stuff! With regards to a sequel to Vampire Survivors, we’re working on something, but we’re not talking about that just yet.”</p>
<p>Such a tease!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>IO Interactive shared a little glimpse of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/007-first-light">007: First Light</a> during the Xbox Partner Preview stream today, showing off about the car in the game… the Aston Martin Valhalla.</p>
<p><iframe title="007 First Light - Aston Martin Valhalla Reveal | Xbox Partner Preview 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L0wLsLm8OlY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Valhalla is stuffed with F1 technology and really slots into the supercar category in a way that probably feels a bit excessive for a spy, even of Bond’s stature. You’ll have to earn the number first, though.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s all a little bit of a let down when thinking this would be a bigger gameplay reveal.</p>
<p>007: First Light is coming out on 27th March 2026&nbsp;across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and PC. The game is an Xbox Play Anywhere title, meaning you can buy it once and play across both Xbox and PC through the Microsoft Store.</p>

<p>The game is IOI’s first outside the Hitman series for quite a while, and as a licensed IP of this scale, it’s a pretty big deal for the studio. The story sees James Bond as a relative newcomer to MI6, working as part of a team as they race to catch and foil the plans of 009, who’s gone just a little bit rogue.</p>
<p>Last time out we saw a mission to intercept 009 at a chess tournament, showcasing the game’s evolved stealth action gameplay, before leading into a high speed car chase and then deadly combat as Bond chases his target to a fleeing cargo plane. Would you believe that the plane doesn’t have a smooth take off and landing?</p>
<p>We had an early preview of the gameplay reveal back at Gamescom and had the opportunity to speak with Franchise Art Director Rasmus Poulsen. Here’s a little tidbit, as we discuss Bond’s visits to Q Lab and whether they’re more Desmond Llewelyn or Ben Wishaw. “We have quite a bit of humour everywhere, but it’s important to mention that it is, first and foremost, a reasonably dry British wit, because otherwise it doesn’t feel quite like it belongs. And, you know, you’ll get to a Q lab and you’ll get to understand how that relationship was formed in that surprising way, I would say, so look forward to that!”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/007-first-light-preview-how-io-are-crafting-a-new-kind-of-bond-game/">Head here for our wider 007: First Light preview</a>, with insights on how they settled on James Bond’s look, brought cars, vehicles and high speed chases in alongside action set pieces and, of course, the more open stealth action style inherited from the Hitman franchise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Mintrocket’s diving and sushi bar running sensation, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dave-the-diver">Dave The Diver,</a> is out now for Xbox Series X|S, arriving as an Xbox Play Anywhere title that also nets you the game on PC via Microsoft and Xbox Cloud. This means you can play it on the Xbox ROG Ally X and Xbox Series after buying it once, which is nice.</p>
<p>Then, coming in early 2026, is a new expansion for the game that will take Dave over to the jungle. It’s quite simply called Into The Jungle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dave the Diver - Launch Trailer | Xbox Partner Preview 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PFbcVdZRKwE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’s been a couple years now since Dave the Diver arrived on PC. It was honoured with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/27/game-of-the-year-2023-best-pc-game-steam-deck/">Best PC Game award in our 2023 Game of the Year awards</a>, with Dom saying, <em>“With Dave the Diver you should prepare to be constantly surprised. On the surface, this is a game about diving with a portly man called Dave. You know he’s out of shape because everyone comments on it within the opening moments of the game, but it soon becomes clear that this is a man, and a game, with hidden depths.”</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-stunning-boss-fight-gameplay-showing-off-mirror-realm/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tides-of-annihilation-gets-new-stunning-boss-fight-gameplay-showing-off-the-game%E2%80%99s-mirror-realm.1359823/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After nearly a year of silence, Chinese developer Eclipse Glow Games has resurfaced during today's Xbox Partner Preview to showcase new gameplay of its upcoming action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-is-a-stunning-action-adventure-game-set-in-a-fantasy-london-inspired-by-arthurian-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tides of Annihilation</a>.</p>



<p>The trailer features the main character, Gwendolyn, fighting against a boss called Tyronoe the Ferryman, described as a powerful, shapeshifting witch. Gwendolyn is assisted by Sir Lamorak, a Knight of the Roundtable who wields a spear in combat. </p>



<p>Throughout Tides of Annihilation, Gwendolyn, the lone survivor of a cataclysmic 'Outworld invasion' of modern-day London, embarks on a high-stakes journey across two worlds: the devastated, fog-shrouded modern metropolis and the mythical realm of Avalon. Her goal is to save humanity and rescue her sister. As part of the journey, she'll encounter different stories and conflicts behind the Knights of the Roundtable and the evils behind this otherworldly invasion. In this mission, she's set to uncover the truth behind Sir Lamorak, whose suffering is caused by the witch Tyronoe. </p>



<p>One of the game's key unique features is the Knights System, which allows Gwendolyn to summon and command spectral Knights of the Roundtable during battles. The new footage reveals part of this system for the first time: the Dual Frontline Battle System, which lets the player control both Gwendolyn and Lamorak simultaneously, enabling them to attack Tyronoe and break down her magical barriers.</p>



<p>The boss fight against the witch also shows the Mirror Realm for the first time. The Folded Realm is a mysterious story element in Tides of Annihilation and Gwendolyn will encounter different types of<br>these otherworldly realms throughout the game. Tyronoe is among the few characters capable of traveling between the human world and the Mirror Folded Realm she creates, and can make use of powerful magic energies from this Mirror Realm.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As exciting as this new gameplay is, the press release does not include a release window for the game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-qa-2026-tentative-launch-30-hours-light-rpg-elements-exclusive-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When we spoke to the development team during Gamescom 2024</a>, they mentioned a tentative 2026 goal, but it was far from assured. Anyway, the game will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, and today, Eclipse Glow Games also confirmed that it will support Xbox Play Anywhere, enabling cross-buy and cross-progression across PC and Xbox.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-shows-off-trio-of-upcoming-action-games-running-at-up-to-500-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Tides of Annihilation will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation on PC to accelerate frame rate for GeForce RTX 50 Series owners.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/godfall-developer-counterplay-games-debuts-new-title-armatus-at-xbox-partner-preview.1359820/</guid>

			<p>Counterplay Games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/godfall-ultimate-edition-pc-five-realms-worth-of-content/">the studio behind Godfall</a>, which you might recall was the first game confirmed to be launching on current-gen consoles before the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S were even on shelves, has just debuted its new title, Armatus, which kicked off the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-xbox-partner-preview-thursday/">Xbox Partner Preview event today</a>. </p>



<p>Armatus looks like another dive down third-person action for Counterplay Games, but with an entirely different tone and vibe compared to what we saw in Godfall. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/armatus-xbox-partner-preview/">In an Xbox Wire post,</a> senior writer at Counterplay Games, Matt Cerami, describes the coming title as "<em>a product of our heart, soul, and fire-forged camaraderie; we've poured everything into this project, have harbored it through (seemingly) insurmountable challenges, and are thrilled to finally share it with the world</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ARMATUS - Reveal Trailer | Xbox Partner Preview 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6q28rgDKA3o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Armatus is set in a dystopian Paris, where reality is a mess and different planes of existence are colliding with each other. You are summoned by the four remaining members of the Armatus, an ancient religious order that was forsaken by God, and charged with being their champion to fight their battles on their path to heaven.</p>



<p>It's all an interesting concept and visually intriguing design for the game, the question, of course, is whether Counterplay Games will be able to deliver on the combat and the game's story. We'll see how it fares as we get closer to its launch, which is currently set for some time in 2026.</p>

              <p>Will the real Slim Shady please stand up? Okay, there he is, Agent 47! Take the shot!</p> <p>On November 20, during Xbox’s Partner Preview showcase, IO Interactive announced that <a href="https://kotaku.com/todays-games-are-too-complicated-for-eminem-5416286">rapper Eminem</a> would be the next elusive target coming to <em>Hitman: World of Assassination</em> in a free update arriving next month on all platforms.</p> <p>Here’s the strange trailer, which shows <a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-games-grand-theft-auto-movie-eminem-gta-6-1849787466">Eminem</a> teaming up with Ageny 47 to take out his alter ego, Slim Shady, who is hanging out in a strange medical facility in Japan.</p>  <p>You can read more about this odd event in<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/hitman-xbox-partner-preview/"> Xbox’s blog post about it</a>. You’ll have a limited time to take out Shady as the update goes live on December 1 and ends on December 31. Ring in the new year by headshotting Eminem’s past persona as a cloned super killer. A tradition as old as time.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-clears-out-eero-7-wifi-7-router-3-pack-at-an-almost-free-per-unit-price-in-a-bold-black-friday-move.1359805/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Save $70 on a 3-pack of the Eero mesh Wi-Fi 7 routers over at Amazon for a limited time.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Now that we’re in the thick of the holiday season, there is much gift shopping to be done. While it makes sense to hold out until Black Friday and Cyber Monday to see what sorts of deals all the major retailers are showcasing, you can actually get ahead of things and find some excellent savings opportunities right now. Perhaps it’s time to help your parents finally update their home Wi-Fi. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5757/">Amazon has its Eero 7 dual-band mesh Wi-Fi routers on sale right now for about 20% off.</a> For a limited time, you can save $35 on the one router which brings the price down from $170 to just $135.</p>
<p>Now the real value of a mesh Wi-Fi router can be attained with only one of them. You want to create a mesh Wi-Fi network by having multiple units working together. Luckily, Amazon has the Eero 7 dual-band mesh Wi-Fi routers available in bundles of two and three. The 2-pack normally goes for $280, but has been discounted down to $220 — saving you $60. then we have the 3-pack which is usually sitting at $350 now going for just $280 — saving you $70. So at its best value, you can secure yourself three of these mesh Wi-Fi routers for as little as $93 per router.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5757/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Total Coverage of Your Home</h2>
<p data-start="0" data-end="655">Unreliable internet can be one of the most annoying things to deal with at home. Few things are more frustrating than web pages that won’t load or devices constantly dropping their connection. A Wi-Fi 7 mesh system can make a huge difference. The Eero 7 mesh network is designed to deliver stable, high-speed coverage throughout your home. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5757/">Each Eero 7 node can cover up to 2,000 square feet and handle more than 120 connected devices.</a> With a three-pack, you can blanket up to 6,000 square feet and connect over 360 devices at once. And if your home needs even more range, you can easily expand your network later by adding additional nodes.</p>


<p data-start="657" data-end="1188">Between the three router units, you’ll get six Ethernet ports in total, giving you plenty of wired connection options. The Eero 7 can deliver speeds of up to 2.5Gbps (that’s 2,500Mbps), so streaming 4K video from anywhere in your house is no problem. Even cloud gaming becomes smooth and consistent, especially with the growing number of devices that support the Xbox app, such as Fire TV sticks and Samsung smart TVs. You can play games with minimal lag — even without owning a console — thanks to the strong, fast Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<p data-start="1190" data-end="1393" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Setup is also a breeze. The Eero app walks you through every step, making it quick and easy to get your mesh network running smoothly so you can finally say goodbye to dead zones and dropped connections.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-vampire-survivorssequel-was-just-revealed-and-its-a-dungeon-crawler-2000645860</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, during Xbox’s latest digital showcase event, Poncle announced <em>Vampire Crawlers</em>, a <em>Vampire Survivors</em> follow-up coming to Xbox and PC in 2026. But instead of being a top-down idle shooter or “reverse bullet hell” game like <a href="https://kotaku.com/castlevania-roguelike-vampire-survivors-steam-itch-io-1848402308">2021’s <em>Vampire Survivors,</em></a> this newly revealed game is a dungeon crawler with roguelike elements and cards.</p> <p>On November 20, during Xbox’s Partner Preview event, Poncle revealed the first look at<em> Vampire Crawlers.</em>&nbsp;Here’s the trailer, which is filled with a lot of the same enemies, jokes, and chaos you’d expect from <em>Vampire Survivors.&nbsp;</em></p>

  <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/vampire-crawlers-xbox-partner-preview/">In an Xbox interview with Poncle founder &amp; CEO Luca,</a> the creator behind <em>Vampire Survivors</em> explains that they have been working on this sequel/spin-off for roughly four years, starting work on it shortly after the OG game exploded on Steam. It is one of many possible spin-offs and experiments the team is working on. This just happened to be the first one to “hit its goal,” hence why it’s getting released first in 2026.</p>

 <p>When asked what kind of game <em>Vampire Crawlers</em> is, Luca joked that it’s a totally new genre called “Action TurboTurn™ Game (Turbo Turn System).”</p> <p>“Jokes aside, this game is just a dungeon crawler you play with cards,” admitted Luca. “It’s about mowing down hordes of enemies using cards, while you explore dungeons, playing as slowly or as fast as you prefer. You can take your time and be tactical, or play cards as fast as you humanly can, because the game is built to always provide accurate logical outcomes, regardless of the visual chaos that your abilities might cause.”</p>

 <p>Interestingly, Luca tells Xbox that <em>Vampire Crawlers</em> will launch as a full game, and not in early access, though Poncle does have plans to update it after launch if players like <em>Crawlers</em> and want more content and features.</p> <p>“Just like <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, we’ve built the game so that it could eventually be expanded,” said Luca. “We’ll leave it to the community to tell us if they want even more, and what they actually want from it going forward.”</p> <p><em>Vampire Crawlers</em> launches sometime in 2026 on Xbox, Game Pass, and PC. It will be available day one on Game Pass and will support Xbox Play Anywhere.</p>

<p>Eminem will be featured in the next elusive target mission in Hitman: World of Assassination, available to purchase between December 1 and December 31. </p>



<p>We have seen many huge personalities enter the world of Hitman: World of Assassination, but Eminem might just be the biggest one yet. Eminem has recently taken a liking to gaming. We saw him earlier come as a skin and host an in-game concert in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-next-concert-will-feature-snoop-dogg-eminem-juice-wrld-and-ice-spice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>, and now he has set foot in the world of Hitman.</p>

<p>Eminem will be the biggest highlight for the next Elusive Target mission in Hitman: World of Assassination. The artist will be a fellow operative for Agent 47, briefing him on his mission to help “untangle the twisted mind of Slim Shady.” The blog post’s character description states: “Eminem rose to his superstardom with the help of his alter ego, Slim Shady.” In his latest album, “The Death of Slim Shady,” the rapper tried to put his unhinged other self away, but it seems his past continues to haunt him.”</p>



<p>Players will explore psychological, dreamlike twists that mirror Slim Shady’s fractured reality in the new level. It is set in a medical facility in Hokkaido, which has been transformed into a Popsomp Hills Asylum.</p>



<p>Players as Agent 47 will be infiltrating this “surreal environment where doctors, patients, and performers blur into one.” Eminem will be found in a fully equipped broadcasting studio, where he delivers erratic live performances to a captive audience of staff and inmates. The mission will also feature Eminem-inspired details, including a poisoned Spaghetti Sandwich served in his restaurant. </p>



<p>The Eminem vs Slim Shady pack for Hitman: World of Assassination can be purchased for $4.99/€4.99/£3.99 from December 1 to December 31. It contains a new suit, four items, and home base cosmetics connected to the mission. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The creators of Little Nightmares, Tarsier Studios, shared a new look at Reanimal at Xbox Partner Preview. In addition to new gameplay, we now know the release date and a free demo.</p>







<p>While not much is known about the game, Reanimal looks like a darker version of Little Nightmares, which is pretty grim. A synopsis of the title says it follows a brother and sister as they escape a hellish version of their home and attempt to save their friends. The game can be played single-player or with a friend online or local. With a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarsier-studios-new-game-reanimal-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gory first teaser</a> last year, fans have been anxious to learn more. Fortunately, Xbox Partner Preview gave us a new look at Reanimal, as well as some new information.</p>



<h2 id="h-reanimal-releasing-on-february-13th-2026-free-demo-available-now">Reanimal Releasing on February 13th, 2026, Free Demo Available Now</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="REANIMAL | Xbox Partner Preview 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P9sEV58DC7w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer, shown above, we see new gameplay of Reanimal. The gory world looks incredible and is sure to bring in the scares. Furthermore, we finally get a release date for the title: February 13th, 2026. However, fans can get in on the action now with a free demo, available on Xbox Series X|S, PC, and PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>The demo will consist of Reanimal’s opening chapters, letting you and a friend explore the hellish scenery. If you were on the fence about the game, now’s the chance to try it out. The demo, as well as the release date, did leak prior to the announcement, but now it’s been confirmed.</p>



<p>Seeing as Tarsier Studios has been working on Reanimal for quite a while, it looks like it’s been worth the wait. The company did not work on Little Nightmares 3, which was released in October to mixed reviews. It’ll be interesting to see how similar and different it will be to the studio’s other titles.</p>







<p>What do you think of the new trailer for Reanimal? Excited for the February release date? Going to play the demo? Looking forward to it? Going in alone or with a friend? Let us know in the comments and on the official Insider Gaming!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new trailer for 007 First Light has been released during Xbox Partner Preview. The title, releasing on March 27th, 2026, looks to bring the films and books to life in a new way through an iconic car.</p>







<p>From IO Interactive, the creators of Hitman, 007 First Light is shaping up to be one of the biggest hits for next year. With an&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gemma-chan-announced-for-007-first-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all-star cast</a>, there’s a lot riding on it given the franchise’s pedigree. We’ve seen a lot so far thanks to the dedicated State of Play in September. Now, we have a lot more to go off of and it’s as thrilling as James Bond can be.</p>



<p>This article is currently in development and will be updated once more information is available.</p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-brings-aston-martin-valhalla-to-gaming">007 First Light Brings Aston Martin Valhalla to Gaming</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer for 007 First Light, shown above, we see James Bond driving an iconic brand from the series: the Aston Martin. Specifically, the car is the Valhalla, the company’s first-ever mid-engine PHEV hypercar. It will be one of many cars coming to the game.</p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see how the game shapes up given it’s legacy. James Bond has been an icon in many media, especially gaming with Goldeneye. While it won’t reach those heights, bringing the series to life in a new way is always a good thing.</p>

To be specific, the new Elusive Target mission coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hitman-3/">Hitman</a> will see Agent 47 tasked with killing Eminem's younger alter-ego by none other than Eminem himself. We promise we're not making this up.</p><p dir="ltr">Thanks to Slim Shady being a separate--and violent--entity, the real Eminem is fearful that his creation will eventually come for him. It's up to Agent 47 to step in and take down Slim Shady so that the real Eminem can keep on rapping till he collapses.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk6wSOEqMHU" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qk6wSOEqMHU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>If you're new to them, Elusive Targets are one of the more interesting challenges in Hitman.

That's because Tersier has been hard at work creating Reanimal, a new co-op horror game right around the corner. Today, we learned that the game will drop early next year, on February 13. Check out the trailer from today's Xbox Partner Preview below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P9sEV58DC7w"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P9sEV58DC7w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Reanimal follows a brother and sister making their way through Hell to rescue their missing friends. In dimly lit sewers, alleyways, and vaguely industrial spaces dark creatures chase the protagonists from one location to the next. While what we've seen of the co-op gameplay looks fine so far, the real draw for this studio is the dark, twisted atmosphere and art style, and today's trailer has both in spades.</p><p>To check out a glimpse of Reanimal today, you can download the demo on Xbox <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/reanimal/9n67dhnp2m0t">here</a> or on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4019420/REANIMAL_Demo/">here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/20/reanimal-the-next-game-from-the-little-nightmares-team-drops-in-february]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Cast your mind back to 2023 and you might recall a lot of PC players getting very excited about a bearded fellow named Dave and his adventures deep below the waves. Well, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a>'s steady arrival on other platforms, it's finally Xbox's turn; the peculiar exploration and bar management hybrid hits Xbox Series X/S today, and there's also confirmation Dave's long-promised Into the Jungle DLC arrives "early" next year.
</p>
<p>
If you're unfamiliar with its charms, Dave the Diver is brilliant thing - so good, in fact, that Eurogamer awarded it five stars back when it originally released. The gist is it whisks you - in the role of the titular Dave - to tropical climes for an adventure of two distinct halves. On the one side, you've a glorious ocean to explore, diving deep to, yes, admire the sights, but also to gather a whole shopping list of ingredients - fish, vegetations, and whatever else you can get your hands on - to turn into food  as you scramble to satisfy the whims of your patrons at the aforementioned sushi bar.
</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFbcVdZRKwE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
Both sides are pretty tense, but a satisfying loop of upgrades means you're soon able to tackle deadlier creatures, or carry more ingredients back to the surface, or explore further into stranger territories without the constant panic of your depleting oxygen. And you can hire more help at the restaurant, or perhaps indulge in a bit of fish breeding, to ease the bar management chaos.
</p><p>
That, though, barely scratches the surfaces; Dave the Diver is constantly throwing new twists and ideas into the mix, and it's all buoyed along by an endearingly ludicrous story campaign featuring some wonderfully memorable characters, plus it's beautifully presented too. "Wholesome, harmonious and completely unwilling to settle," is how Eurogamer contributor Christian Donlan put it in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-a-dizzying-game-of-many-parts-and-a-journey-into-deep-wonder">five star review</a>, "this is one of the most generous games in years."
</p>
<p>
So yes, Dave the Diver is good stuff, and it's finally available to play on Xbox Series X/S from today. As for that Into the Jungle DLC, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-in-the-jungle-announced">originally announced at the end of last year</a>, promising a new jungle setting, new freshwater fish, and more. Following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-delays-in-the-jungle-dlc-but-sure-knows-how-to-soften-the-blow-with-these-other-announcements">bit of a delay</a>, we now know it's due to arrive for all platforms - PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC - "early" 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="c8acb7e9785f2"><a title="Banjo-Tooie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c8acb7e9785f2/banjo-tooie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>One of the reasons I adore N64-gen Rare so much is because they loved testing the boundaries. What could they get away with in a cheeky, charming 3D platformer? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a> was already dipping its toe in the water in a few subtle (and less-subtle) ways. “How's your nuts, bark breath?” is funny, but perhaps funnier with that adult context. And the 1998 platformer was more than ready to get a little bit scary – did anyone else freak out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-which-scary-video-game-moments-gave-you-nightmares-as-a-kid">the first time they saw Clanker</a>? No?</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-tooie">Banjo-Tooie</a> pushes things to a whole new level. It rips the band-aid off and tosses it off of a steep cliff into the volcano of Hailfire Peaks, almost with complete disregard for what came before it. Rare is unafraid to tell you that this is a <em>very</em> different game tonally from the first. In fact, growing up, it was one of the scariest games I’d played. I still feel that way 25 years later. And I love it, warts and all, for that reason.</p>
<p>I should’ve known immediately something was different. While Banjo-Kazooie got a chirpy, cheerful intro song with the cast all playing the main theme together, Tooie just gets a slower, lower-pitch version playing as a camera pans over the abandoned Gruntilda’s Lair. Rare could’ve brought Grunty back as the green same, except she’s a walking skeleton.</p>
<figure data-uuid="14561ec8a88a2"><a title="Banjo-Tooie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/14561ec8a88a2/banjo-tooie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh, and just 20 minutes into the game, Grunty has murdered Bottles the mole by burning him to a crisp <em>and</em> turned King Jingaling into a zombie, who groans and attacks Banjo on sight. I stupidly left Banjo waiting inside the zombified throne room one time and remember hearing the king’s moaning as it pecked Banjo and Kazooie to death. I was but a simple eight-year-old, I didn’t expect previously friendly NPCs to be hostile, even if they were a walking corpse!</p>
<p>So much about Banjo-Tooie is bleak and disturbing, but the intro and the first few sections of the Isle O’ Hags really set the tone; the abandoned Jinjo Village where the HAG-1 tracks has ploughed right through one of the houses, is harrowing the first time you walk through it, made worse by the cheerful music. Walking into Bottles’ house and <em>hiding</em> the fact the patriarch of the family has passed away made me feel sick.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8ee582e6c9015"><a title="Banjo-Tooie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ee582e6c9015/banjo-tooie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Things don’t get any better when you start to explore any of the worlds, either. Mayahem Temple might be one of the gentler worlds on the nightmare fuel front, but something about Ssslumber the Snake always made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Maybe it’s because I had to do that darn sneaking section at least a dozen times, but those teeth are a little too big for my liking. And the Snapdragons that chomp at you while you’re gripping onto a ledge? No thank you.</p>
<p>Glitter Gulch Mine is where things start to ramp up again. If the toxic gas room where Banjo and Kazooie can choke to death isn’t enough (seriously, what is <em>up</em> with N64 drowning animations?), then how about the pitch-black generator room or the Power Hut where one wrong step means a fall to your death?</p>

<p>The level variety is much darker than it ever was in the original; sunny beaches are now replaced with a sprawling lagoon where terrifying sea creatures lurk deep underwater. There’s no room for swamps and crocodiles here, as giant lizards and amphibians roam the lands of Terrydactyland. And even though Rusty Bucket Bay might fill my heart with fear, the oil-slicked waters have nothing on Grunty Industries’ sprawling maze of a building, with abandoned electrics, dangerous traps, and a sentient welding torch that drags itself through a duct like a snake, with gnashing teeth to boot.</p>
<p>I have no idea who designed the bosses in Banjo-Tooie <em>[Ah, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/01/feature_banjo-tooie_turns_20_-_the_rare_team_tells_the_story_of_bombs_bugs_and_bottles">do I have an article for you!</a> - Ed.]</em>, but hats off to you – almost all of them have some shudder-worthing component to them. Targitzan's jewelled eyes mean the gigantic statue remains unblinking. Mingy Jongo is a complete rug-pull, tricking you into thinking he’s Mumbo Jumbo before attacking you mid-cutscene, with the encounter acting as a big T-800 reference.</p>

<p>The freakiest to me, besides pitting Banjo and Kazooie up against a gigantic drill at the end of the game, is Mr. Patch, the inflatable dinosaur in Witchyworld. Again, who decides to give the blow-up dino blow-up teeth? This should be a fairly innocent ‘creature’, but the combination of the huge, empty big top, the weird sneezing noise and hissing, and the difficulty of controlling and aiming Kazooie’s eggs while flying, has always made my palms sweaty.</p>
<p>In fact, Witchworld itself really seems to understand what kids are afraid of. Theme parks are meant to be fun, but clowns, crowds, and loud noises also come part and parcel with these places. These are three things I <em>didn’t</em> like when I was younger. So, throw me into an abandoned theme park and I’m instantly going to be unnerved.</p>
<figure data-uuid="f9c0beaee5d3e"><a title="Banjo-Tooie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f9c0beaee5d3e/banjo-tooie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s probably my favourite world in the game as a result; the music has echoes of delight, but is empty and haunting. The skies are blood red, and the fences around the park rusted; the food is gross, and the employees tired, grumpy, and rude. It’s the antithesis of a fun fair. Even the mascots attack you!</p>
<p>The thing is, a lot of these scares were projected in Banjo-Kazooie, but it was much gentler about creeping you out (for the most part – I don’t think I’ll ever stay calm when I touch the water in Treasure Trove Cove and Snacker starts chasing me). Tooie just leans into more of those adult tendencies, <em>barely</em> getting away with some of the more lewd stuff in most cases.</p>
<p>But as funny as Tooie is, and as messy as it can be as a sequel, it’s those creepy moments that have stuck with me for the past quarter of a century. Running from Stomponadon as he tries to squash the bear and bird is heart-pounding, and the first time I ran into a Minjo I panicked.</p>

<p>Essentially, if Banjo-Kazooie is a cheeky little kid testing the boundaries, Banjo-Tooie is the messy teenager ready to prank and scare you around every corner. Sometimes, it’s pure nightmare fuel. But I wouldn’t change it for the world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is the latest RPG from Owlcat Games and the studio's first attempt at delivering a third-person action RPG to players. It was first announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-is-owlcats-first-stab-at-third-person-action-rpg/">back at Summer Game Fest</a>, and today, as part of the Golden Joystick Awards, a new developer diary was showcased that reveals how the studio is looking to bring the world of The Expanse and space to life with the help of a former NASA astronaut.</p>



<p>Former NASA astronaut and ISS commander Leroy Chiao collaborated with Owlcat Games to help provide a realistic understanding of living and working in space and find ways around some of those realistic setbacks that would result in clunky gameplay that Owlcat Games knew players didn't want to deal with.</p>



<p>Like being constantly tethered to the ship while working outside of it, for example. Instead of players having to constantly watch out for a long leash, magnetic boots provide a smoother look and feel for players, without completely removing the constant threat that every astronaut fears when working outside the ship: somehow detaching and floating away.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new dev diary also gave us a look at more gameplay clips for The Expanse: Osiris Reborn, though much of those clips were cinematic and just followed characters around the ship. There was a small shot of some of the third-person cover shooting in space players will experience, but that's about it.</p>



<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is currently available to wishlist on PC and consoles, though there's no clear indication as to when it'll be available. Right now, it doesn't even look like it'll be out in 2026. In the meantime, though, instead of just watching the latest dev diaries over and over, you can check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-gamescom-qa-mass-effect-suicide-mission/">Wccftech's interview with Owlcat Games at Gamescom 2025, all about the upcoming sci-fi adventure</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/80-days">80 Days</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heavens-vault">Heaven's Vault</a> developers Inkle are making a new "narrative deduction game" and audio drama called TR-49, in which you fiddle with a bunch of creepy old machines. It's based - or so they tell us - on a family connection to World War 2 espionage, and takes inspiration from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/return-of-the-obra-dinn">Return of the Obra Dinn</a> and <a href="https://jjohnstongames.itch.io/the-roottrees-are-dead">The Roottrees Are Dead</a>.
</p>
<p>"The great-uncle of inkle's narrative director, Jon Ingold, worked at the Bletchley Park code-breaking facility during World War II," comments a press release. "What he did there is still secret, but last summer, while clearing out his uncle's attic, Jon stumbled on some odd electronics and a pile of dusty books. He'd never heard of the authors. There was no trace of them online.
</p><p> 
"For someone who makes his living playing with text, this was too good a mystery to pass up," the release continues. "Jon and the inkle team analyzed the fifty mysterious books in an attempt to discover their secrets, tearing the text apart and recompiling it in code. TR-49 is the result of that experiment."

</p><p>Being a bunch of debonair wisenheimers, the Inkle folk have seemingly made the press release part of the riddle, though it's possible that they've just swapped some letters around to mess with my head. Here are the relevant parts of the press release - I welcome your thoughts as to whether these are genuine ciphers or just malarkey. </p>
<blockquote>
TR-49 will senq plaoers<p>

HE-19</p><p>

dowf a rabbit holb of old boqks,</p><p>

HE-19 ME-91 EA-53</p><p>

analogue technzlogy, and famjly secrxts. Thk game featukes the voices of Rebekah McLoughlin (The SCP Archives, Eternal Threads), Paul Warren (A Highland Song, The Seancé of Blake Manor) and Phillipe Bosher (Baldur's Gate 3, Doctor Who).</p></blockquote>
<p>Hah! Who do they think they're fooling? There's no such thing as "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>". That's clearly Atbash for "Send reinforcements to Dunkirk". 
</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Inkle</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The press release comes with an image (see right) of what I assume is one of the above anomalous books, Images In The Water by Dorothea Pemberton, published by Hammerstone Classics. It looks a bit like a Penguin Classics edition and has a melancholy lady on the cover, her face half in shadow.</p>
<p>I entertain suspicions of the melancholy lady. Inkle aren't really in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a> business, but I do not like books that look at me like this. The apparent in-game art at the top of this article makes me think of the clockwork airlocks in Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs.
</p><p>The press release concludes that "PR-29 wxpl te gut in Janlary ot Stmam fkd iOP, witr a Liftewdg Switgh vetsiok to fowlon. Wrshlqsts are nog tten on Stexm ark ihe teqm plals to pzgt moke aiout tje zaqe'e baclgrquid on Bluesky iv the qoeisg wefks." 
</p>
<p>I have applied my firewall-smashing sleuthbrain to these sentences and come to the conclusion that TR-29 is out in January on Steam and iOS. Unless the whole press release is this year's Operation Mincemeat. Assuming it isn't, I might hold out for the handheld release - my Liftewdg Switgh has been gathering dust for so long, it might well have been retrieved from an attic full of menacing, made-up books. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/black-friday-2025-game-sale-kingdom-come-monster-hunter-2000645834</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/12-of-this-year%E2%80%99s-biggest-games-are-getting-decent-black-friday-discounts.1359694/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The season for patient players and procrastinators has arrived. Anyone who held off on buying new games this year can now get them for much cheaper. Not every new release is steeply discounted <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/black-friday-2025">for Black Friday 2025</a>, but there are definitely some exceptional deals this time around.</p> <p>In years past, when there were more AAA releases and physical games were more prevalent, the Black Friday deals were easier to pinpoint. Now, everything is on sale almost all the time, so it’s harder to figure out what’s worth paying attention to and actually grabbing at that new discounted price.</p>

 <p>Below is a quick list of 12 of the biggest games that came out this year and how cheap they are on various storefronts and platforms:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$30</strong> (57 percent off) at Amazon/GameStop</li> <li><strong><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$50</strong> (29 percent off) at Best Buy</li> <li><strong><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X) – <strong>$35</strong> (50 percent off) at Microsoft / $40 (43 percent off) at Target</li> <li><strong><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$35</strong> (50 percent off) at Best Buy</li> <li><strong><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$33.50</strong> (33 percent off) at Microsoft / $40 (20 percent off) at Best Buy</li> <li><strong><em>Death Stranding 2</em></strong> (PS5) – <strong>$50</strong> (29 percent off) at Target</li> <li><strong><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></strong> (PlayStation/Xbox) – <strong>$25</strong> (38 percent off) at Amazon</li> <li><strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong> – <strong>$30</strong> (57 percent off) at Amazon and Best Buy</li> <li><strong><em>Split Fiction </em></strong>– <strong>$40</strong> (20 percent off) at Amazon and Target</li> <li><strong><em>Silent Hill f</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$50</strong> (29 percent off) at Best Buy</li> <li><strong><em>Avowed</em></strong> (Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$47</strong> (33 percent off) at Microsoft</li> <li><strong><em>Borderlands 4</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$48</strong> (31 percent off) Amazon</li> </ul> <p>Anything that came out this year and is already half off or more is a decent pick-up. That includes <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, both of which are exceptionally crafted, sprawling games that you can snag for just $30. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> and <em>Doom: The Dark ages</em> are also both half-price, though only the digital version for Xbox when it comes to the latter.</p> <p>At the other end you have games that came out more recently and aren’t quite ready to hit that bargain bin status. Of these, <em>Borderlands 4</em> is the most decent find at less than $50 despite only being a couple of months old. <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>at just $20 off is borderline, but not too shabby for <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">a GOTY contender heading into awards season</a>. The biggest steal on this list is probably <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-forsaken-hollows-artorias-dark-souls-2000643101"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a><em>. </em>At $25 it’s not the biggest discount but it was already just $40 to begin with and it’s hands-down the best multiplayer action-RPG around right now.</p>

              <p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday are approaching fast, but you don’t actually have to wait until then to start saving. Some products are already seeing some early Black Friday Discounts over a week ahead of schedule. If you’re thinking about upgrading your old monitor or putting together a brand-new desk setup, the Asus TUF gaming monitor is definitely worth a look. Whether you play games regularly or just want a solid everyday display, this 27-inch QHD screen checks all the important boxes—and right now it comes with a surprisingly large discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5755/">For a short time, Amazon is taking 28% off the price. It normally sells for $249, but the current deal drops it to just $179, giving you a full $70 in savings.</a></p>
<p data-start="609" data-end="1082">The Asus TUF gaming monitor offers a comfortable 27-inch size that feels spacious without overwhelming your desk. It delivers a 2560 x 1440 QHD resolution, which is pretty much the sweet spot for a display of this size. HDR support helps produce rich, punchy colors with standout whites and dark, deep shadows. On top of that, the 180Hz refresh rate is impressively fast, and compatibility with both G-SYNC and FreeSync keeps your visuals smooth by reducing screen tearing. It utilized Asus Extreme Low Motion Blur Sync (ELMB Sync) which works to eliminate ghosting, increasing clarity for games with high frame rates.</p>

<p>It’s 1ms response time will keep the games you play feeling fast and snappy, allowing you to react nearly instantaneously. Since making the jump from being a console gamer to PC gamer, I’ve come to realize just how important this is. I didn’t know how bad I had it on my old Vizio TV until I played through <em>Silksong</em> on my gaming laptop, and then tried booting it up on my TV. Felt unplayable. I breezed through many of the platforming sections on my laptop but struggled with the simplest jumps when moving to my TV.</p>

              <p>Planning on going on an adventure and filming it? Your smartphone might not be the best gear for the job. You need a solid action camera that helps you film like a pro, even when things get complicated (hiking, swimming, cycling, etc).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5635/">The GoPro Hero 13 is made for just that, and Amazon is offering a chance to grab it for less right now.</a> This $400 camera is now going for $310, which is also the lowest price we have seen it drop to in 30 days. It’s an early Black Friday deal, which means it’s likely going to expire soon. Now is the time to improve your filming experience without shelling out big bucks.</p>

<h2>Sharp, Clear, and Stable Footage</h2>
<p>This tiny but mighty camera shoots in 5.3K at 60fps, which offers 91% more resolution than 4K and over six times the detail of standard 1080p. That means sharper, brighter footage for all your adventures, whether you’re filming in the day or at night. You will also be able to shoot slow-motion videos. In fact, the Hero 13 is GoPro’s slowest slow-mo camera yet, capable of capturing video slowed down by up to 13x. Use it for high-action shots where every frame counts!</p>
<p>For stunning photos, it offers 27MP still image capture, so you don’t need a separate camera for high-quality shots. It even turns into a webcam or live streaming camera when needed, which can be quite useful for remote workers.</p>



<p>There’s HB-Series lens compatibility as well, which lets you set up your camera for a wide range of specialty shots. Even better, the camera automatically detects which lens or filter you’ve attached and fine-tunes the settings for it. This way, you can spend more time doing what you love instead of worrying about complicated camera settings.</p>
<p>HyperSmooth 6.0 stabilization keeps the footage impressively stable, even when you’re on the move. Bumpy rides or a bit of chaotic running won’t leave you with shaky footage that’s tough to watch or headache-inducing. All things considered, the GoPro Hero 13 can be a great option for anyone who needs a reliable action camera to record all their indoor and outdoor adventures.</p>
<p>It offers high-quality footage, stunning stills, impressive stabilization, and a lot more. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5635/">The current deal drops the price to just $310, making the upgrade quite affordable. Grab it while the offer is still live.</a></p>
