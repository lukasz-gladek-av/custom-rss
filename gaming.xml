			<p>Marathon will not require a PlayStation network account to play on PC and Xbox Series X and S, Bungie confirmed today.</p>
<p>Speaking on the game's official Discord server, as reported by KAMI on <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1910157799314555338%7Ctwgr%5E64f43be216d92c4fc74c8f4f6bfdfce19b582d77%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FOkami13_%2Fstatus%2F1910157799314555338" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, a rep for the game's development team confirmed that an account will not be required to play on platforms other than PlayStation 5. This is definitely good news, considering that multiplayer games like Helldivers 2 still require a PlayStation Network account on PC, essentially making the game unavailable in regions that are not supported by the PlayStation online service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Bungie has confirmed that Marathon will not require a PlayStation Network account on PC and Xbox.</p>
<p>Gameplay reveal this Saturday, April 12th @ 10AM PT.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Marathon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Marathon</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarathontheGame?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MarathontheGame</a> <a href="https://t.co/cE0kYS830H">pic.twitter.com/cE0kYS830H</a></p>
<p>— KAMI (@Okami13_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Okami13_/status/1910157799314555338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Over a year after its official announcement, Marathon will finally be unveiled later this week, on <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gameplay-reveal-set-for-saturday-april-12/">April 12th</a>. Very little is currently known about the game other than the fact that it will be an extraction shooter featuring multiple different characters called Runners, who will all come with different abilities and some customization options. The game also promises to provide players with plenty of tools to achieve their objectives, such as weapons that alter character stats and more. Player action, additionally, is said to influence the game's persistent world, although it hasn't been specified in which ways and how it will impact the experience as a whole. Hopefully, these mechanics, alongside every other core mechanic, will get detailed in the game's grand reveal in two days.</p>

<p>At the BAFTA Games Awards in London, I had the phenomenal opportunity to catch up with Masumi, the talented performer behind Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ Naoe. The shinobi character took my expectations and firmly exceeded them, so much so that I labelled her the best Assassin’s Creed character we’ve seen in many years.</p>



<p>As I chatted with Masumi on the red carpet, I was curious to learn how she came to land the role of Naoe, given that it was her first ever job in video games.</p>



<p>What she revealed was quite surprising – but as I’ve learned, not entirely out of the ordinary.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview:</p>

<h2 id="h-it-was-a-gradual-realisation">‘It Was a Gradual Realisation’</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has delivered on bold promises made by Ubisoft. It’s a stunning game with a solid amount of meat on the bones, and it’s a turning point of sorts for the series. My only hope is that Ubisoft can capitalise on the game’s success and keep the ball rolling.</p>



<p>I asked Masumi, who plays Naoe in Shadows, about how she landed the role and how it felt to be such a pivotal part of this transformation. This is her <strong>first video game role</strong>, after all.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m so honored. I <strong>didn’t know what Assassin’s Creed was</strong> before I booked it, because I don’t play video games, so actually, it was like a gradual realisation of what I’m a part of, and I just feel so excited and honoured.</p>



<p>I got an audition for it but I prepped the role just like I would for film or TV. I had to spend two years – actually I’m still on it, so it’s like a long time – developing this character, so I got to really dive into Naoe, which was amazing. It was so layered, her character was.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We also discussed some of the more controversial topics, such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ac-shadows-lead-actress-shrine-destruction-hurt-heart/">‘shrine destruction’ theme</a> that was aired ahead of the game’s release. She explained how she didn’t know those elements were present in the game, but they ‘hurt her heart’ to see them.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be expanded in the coming months by expansions, and I, for one, am very excited to see them and to continue down this path with Masumi’s character.</p>



<p>Let me know what you think about Masumi’s performance on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

		<p>Sassy Chap Games and Team17 have confirmed that the bonkers dating game Date Everything! will be launching on June 17th for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch. When the title says Date Everything! it means you can date any object in the house you are in. Ever wanted to become closer for your sofa? You can do that. Your toilet has already seen everything, so why not treat it to a conversation?</p>
<p><iframe title="Date Everything! Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LRZe30oSy9A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Date Everything you will build up different relationships depending on how your conversations go, and how your stats stack up. Those will lead to three relationship outcomes; love, hate, or friendship. Whatever one you end up on will give you points to improve your own stats, opening up more avenues to explore with your household furniture. All you have to do is put on your special glasses and shoot love beams at the object of your desire. There are over 100 characters to date all of which are fully voiced by the likes of Felicia Day,&nbsp; Ben Starr,&nbsp; Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey, Neil Newbon, Troy Baker, and Ashley Burch plus a few others. Between them there are 70,000 lines of dialogue to hear as you get to know the objects in your house on a deeper level.</p>

			<p>In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-faces-lawsuit-for-allegedly-misleading-players-by-shutting-down-the-crew">November 2024</a>, two gamers from California sued <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-executive-says-gamers-have-been-slow-in-getting-comfortable-with-not-owning-their-titles/">Ubisoft</a> over the company's decision to shut down servers for <a href="http://wccftech.com/ubisofts-open-ended-racing-game-the-crew/">The Crew</a>. The two argued that Ubisoft shutting down the servers was equivalent to buying a pinball machine, then years later, the pinball manufacturer storms into your house, removes the pinball paddles, bumpers, balls, everything that makes it playable and leaves an empty shell.</p>
<p>They <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-faces-lawsuit-for-allegedly-misleading-players-by-shutting-down-the-crew">alleged</a> that Ubisoft "<em>misled consumers by telling them they were buying a game, when in fact, all they were renting was a limited license to access the game." </em>The plaintiff's pinball comparison also came from one of them having bought a physical disc for The Crew, which was rendered useless plastic once the servers shut down.</p>
<p>Following player backlash, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes/">announced</a> that The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest would receive an update that added offline modes for each game. This would allow players to continue to enjoy both games even after the servers for each were shut down in early 2024. The same effort has not been extended to The Crew, which was taken offline entirely in March 2024, another point of issue the prosecuting players took up with Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/555469/ubisoft-holds-firm-in-the-crew-lawsuit-you-dont-own-your-video-games">Polygon</a>, Ubisoft has responded to the lawsuit, firmly telling the prosecuting players that they should have known they were never buying a game to own when they each purchased a copy of The Crew and that it was clear they were buying a license.</p>
<p>"<em>Frustrated with Ubisoft's recent decision to retire the game following a notice period delineated on the product's packaging, Plaintiffs apply a kitchen sink approach on behalf of a putative class of nationwide customers,</em>" Ubisoft wrote in its response.</p>
<p>Ubisoft also argued that the plaintiffs had gotten more than their fair share of use out of The Crew, playing the game for years before the announcement of its shutdown in December 2023 and the actual closure in March 2024.</p>
<p>"<em>After making their purchases, Plaintiffs enjoyed access to The Crew for years before Ubisoft decided in late 2023 to retire and shut down the servers of the ten-year-old video game. Plaintiffs received the benefit of their bargain and cannot complain now that they were deceived simply because Ubisoft did not then create an offline version of the discontinued video game.</em>"</p>
<p>Following Ubisoft's response to the lawsuit, the prosecution amended several of their complaints, including a particular rebuttal against the claim that the players got their fill of The Crew. The plaintiffs claimed they had no reason to believe the servers would ever be shut down.</p>
<p>Late last year, before this lawsuit was filed, Valve <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-now-warns-players-theyre-only-buying-a-license-to-a-game-at-checkout/">issued a new warning</a> on Steam telling players that they were only purchasing a license for the games they bought and did not directly own the game. This was the first time a digital storefront had been directly clear about players purchasing a license to play the game, not the game itself.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the <em>Infinity</em> universe,&nbsp;PanOceania is the most powerful faction in the Human Sphere, boasting the most planets, a thriving economy, and cutting-edge technology. Standing against them are the combined nations of Yu Jing, united under the powers of the ruling Party and the Emperor, each backed up with their own military force. The Incincible Army makes sure the designs of the Party are adhered to, and the Imperial Service does whatever it takes to see that the desires of the Emperor are met. In this article, we'll take a look at the new <em>Infinity</em> Imperial Service Action Pack, and what lengths this determined group of enforcers will go to.</p>

<p><em>Infinity N5 </em>launched last year with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-operation-sandtrap-review-launch-of-infinity-n5" rel="nofollow">Operation Sandtrap</a> box, and those who've been reading my articles for a while will know that I started my own <em>Infinity</em> journey with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-jsa-army-pack-review-take-to-war-with-cyber-ninjas-and-samurai-power" rel="nofollow">JSA launch box</a> back in 2018 when the JSA broke away from Yu Jing and became a non-aligned army, before finally becoming their own standalone faction in <em>Infinity N5</em>.</p>




<h2>The Dragon's Claws</h2>

<p>The Imperial Service is made up of&nbsp;tactical units of Judicial and Military Police, criminal regiments, units transferred as reinforcements by the State Empire Army, and special troops in direct service to the Emperor. Its outward-facing mission is to preserve the rule of law and order and defend Yu Jing from any internal or external enemy. The rule of law and order they follow is that directed by the Emperor, and if that ever comes into conflict with anyone else, even the Party, they will do whatever is required to see their goals met.</p>

<p>This means that the Imperial Service is made up of empowered bad guys, given free rein to see that the wills of the Emperor are enforced, and their playstyle shows this. The Imperial Service has a combination of infiltration and camouflaged troops, as well as solid attacks when they need to eliminate their target.</p>

<p>The Imperial Service Action pack includes 9 Imperial Service units, some of them unique to the Imperial Service sectorial, and others can be used in other sectorials, and the wider Yu Jing faction. The action pack contains:</p>

<ul><li>3x Celestial Guards - The core line troops of the Imperial Service, armed with combi rifles.</li>
	<li>1x Imperial Agent Crane Rank - Armed with a heavy machine gun, this is the Lieutenant of the set, but I would look at replacing them with Sun Tze (who is an absolute beast).</li>
	<li>1x Imperial Agent Pheasant Rank - The backup Lieutenant armed with a red fury. They also have tactical awareness which gives them&nbsp;an extra order token each turn.</li>
	<li>1x Bayara with Light Shotgun - This unit is actually 2 units on the same base. Their purpose is to hunt down intruders into the palace, so their profile comes armed with several ways of discovering hidden foes.</li>
	<li>1x&nbsp;Wu Ming - This profile comes armed in this set with a submachine gun, and has its own Fireteam named after it. It can join&nbsp;up with a Zangying and the Imperial Agents if required for the fireteam bonuses they provide.</li>
	<li>1x Koga Ninja - I'm a huge fan of the ninjas in JSA, and this Imperial Service ninja doesn't disappoint. With all the usual sneakiness of ninja units, the Koga&nbsp;is armed with all kinds of electro-magnetic weapons, the target of their attacks has to make 2 saving throws per hit and half their usual saving throw bonus.</li>
	<li>1x Jinyao Drop Unit - This assault unit can super-jump for maximum board mobility and comes armed&nbsp;with a boarding shotgun and para mines, which can immobilize units that set them off.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-4.jpg?itok=Wt1J6tU0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-4.jpg?itok=hk5U31gA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Also avvialble as part of the Imperial Service revivial for&nbsp;<em>Infinity N5&nbsp;</em>are the Longwang TAG and specialist Dragon Lord.</figcaption></figure><h2>His Will</h2>

<p>Realising alongside the Imperial Service action pack are the Longwang, Imperial TAG police, and a special launch miniature, the Dragon Lord, Imperial Service Judges. The Longwang is an armored TAG unit, accurate at range with its heavy machine gun and its immobilizing adhesive launcher, and deadly up close with its para close combat weapon. It also gets a bonus order token to get things done. The Dragon Lord is a specialist troop to help you complete mission objectives, they're decent in close combat, and their ranged nanopulser is a template weapon for anyone trying to close with them.</p>

I'd also look to pick up a Su-Jian, who can fireteam up with another Su-Jian or the Longwang, and has 2 forms. Using a movement action to change between them, the Su-Jian has a high-mobility form, which allows them to close the distance quickly, and then change into the combat form when they're ready to bring the pain.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-2.jpg?itok=lSooVl44 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-2.jpg?itok=WwkSbH14 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The full list of Imperial Service units avialable in <em>Infinity N5</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>Infinity Imperial Service Action Pack Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>The <em>Infinity</em> Imperial Service action pack is a decent box, with some fantastic-looking miniatures. It goes some way to showing what the Imperial Service is capable of and combined with the Longwang, gives them some presence on the table. You will need to add some units to get the most out of them though, and they're not a super straight-forward faction to pilot if you're a brand new <em>Infinity</em> player. But they are fun, and have a lot of tricks and ways to hunt down hidden enemies, plus this box has the new Koga Ninja, who is pretty awesome.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-date-everything-release-date-summer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-date-everything-release-date-set-for-summer.1160460/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-date-everything-release-date-summer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Romantic dating sim&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has a brand new release date, and Team17 and Sassy Chap's "star-studded" adventure is arriving on PC and current-gen consoles just in time for summer.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>will now be launching on June 17th. The game was due to launch on what would have been the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-again" rel="nofollow">ideal date for its arrival</a>, but it was delayed (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day" rel="nofollow">not for the first time</a>) in order to ensure additional polish.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!</em>, you're equipped with a pair of "Dateviators", glasses that essentially allow you to see objects in your home as dateable people. It's probably best if you don't think about the implications of that too much.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/date-everything-release-date-summer-keyes.jpg?itok=ZNzcEnaP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/date-everything-release-date-summer-keyes.jpg?itok=MIlY9Vg0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has a new, and hopefully final, release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Equipped with said Dateviators, you'll be able to romance over 100 characters, with inanimate objects like laundry baskets, pianos, and vacuum cleaners available for romantic relationships. You can even date concepts like existential dread.</p>

<p>Not only can you date lots of characters, but you can also explore a "fully interactive 3D overworld", as Sassy Chap says, and the world of the game will change based on choices you make throughout your run.</p>

<p>Sassy Chap is also promising lots of branching dialogue and multiple endings for each character (not just for the game itself), as well as full voice acting for the game's romanceable roster.</p>

<p>The voice cast is pretty impressive, too; actors include the likes of&nbsp;<em>Supernatural</em>'s Felicia Day (with whom you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/felicia-day-is-new-guest-at-twenty-sided-tavern-key-to-improv-and-dungeons" rel="nofollow">check out our&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-themed interview here</a>),&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>'s Ben Starr, and&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s Neil Newbon, also known as Astarion.</p>




<p>With over a million words in its script,&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>might not be quite on the same level as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words" rel="nofollow"><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>for sheer volume</a>, but it promises to keep you busy nonetheless.</p>

<p><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>lands on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010892" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/date-everything/9n0ccpmbljq8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch on June 17th. No Nintendo Switch 2 version has yet been confirmed.</p>

But this is no ordinary manor. Its rooms--from twisting hallways and garden courtyards to sports facilities and curious dead ends--all reset at the start of each day. This leads to a fascinating roguelike mechanic, one where you need to create the best path to reach the fabled Room 46. Our Blue Prince guides hub has all the tips you need to help you get started with this deep dive into untold mysteries.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Blue_Prince_guides_hub">Blue Prince guides hub</a><ul><li><a href="#The_basics">The basics</a></li><li><a href="#Puzzle_rooms">Puzzle rooms</a></li><li><a href="#Passwords_and_safe_codes">Passwords and safe codes</a></li><li><a href="#Permanent_upgrades">Permanent upgrades</a></li><li><a href="#Progression__The_Antechamber__Room_46__and_the_Underground">Progression: The Antechamber, Room 46, and the Underground</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="Blue_Prince_guides_hub">Blue Prince guides hub</h2><p>Our Blue Prince guides hub is organized into several sections.

                <p dir="ltr">At the beginning of the year, Kinetic Games<a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-2025-roadmap" rel="nofollow "> announced an ambitious roadmap</a> for its first-person multiplayer scarefest Phasmophobia, which includes seasonal events, map reworks, and more. Today, the development team announced the first seasonal event of that roadmap, Cursed Hollow, which will run for three weeks starting April 17.</p><p dir="ltr">The Cursed Hollow event will bring Easter-themed decor--with a spooky twist, of course--to nine of the game's maps--with one of them being Bleasdale Farmhouse, which is one of the reworked maps from the roadmap. Jackalope totems will be available for collection during each run, but interacting with them will alter the rest of the run in both positive and negative ways.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4473638-dotsjackalope.png" data-ref-id="1300-4473638" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4473638-dotsjackalope.png" data-ref-id="1300-4473638"></a><figcaption>A jackalope totem from the new Cursed Hollow update.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4473638-dotsjackalope.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cursed Hollow will also bring a revamped reward system, as objectives and rewards will come in both Community and Personal categories. Completing Community tasks will contribute toward the Community goal, while Personal objectives are player-specific and will unlock after the first Community threshold is met.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the first of three seasonal events specified on the 2025 roadmap, with "Halloween" and "Holiday" also listed. Other updates on the roadmap include an overhaul of the player character options, a revamped evidence gathering system, and a new map along with the multiple reworks.</p><p dir="ltr">Kinetic Games's Phasmophobia first launched in 2020, when it rose to viral stardom after content creators picked up the game. It became the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phasmophobia-is-blowing-up-on-steam-and-twitch/1100-6483324/" data-ref-id="1100-6483324">sixth-most-popular game on Twitch in October 2020</a>, and it topped the sales leaderboards on Steam for multiple weeks between October and November 2020.</p><p dir="ltr">Phasmophobia is available now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

                <p>Onibi Studio--a newly founded game studio featuring industry veterans who worked on titles such as World of Warcraft, Baldur’s Gate 3, Fortnite, and League of Legends--has announced its first game. Tomo: Endless Sea is an anime-inspired, open-world action-RPG in which players will get the chance to tame mysterious creatures named Tomo, craft various contraptions, and explore a procedurally generated oceanic world known as Endless Blue. The game will also support online multiplayer, and is labeled as an MMO, in addition to its other genres. Tomo: Endless Blue is currently scheduled to release sometime in 2026.</p><p>Alongside its announcement, Onibi Studio shared a first-look at Tomo: Endless Blue in an adorable trailer that turns shockingly dark in its final moments. In it, two characters approach an island aboard a flying whale-like creature that is seemingly an island itself. The pair catch their first Tomo before delving into the ocean below, swimming to shore, and starting off on their own adventure on the voxel island. Throughout the entire trailer, an original song composed by Cécile Corbel--best known for her work on Arrietty--and sung by Ai Higuchi of Attack on Titan fame, plays. As for what happens next, well... you can see for yourself:</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Tomo: Endless Blue - Official Reveal Trailer (ft. Ai Higuchi and Cécile Corbel)</p>

<p>Though Minecraft-meets-Pokemon is an apt comparison for Tomo: Endless Sea, the studio has also expressed great emphasis on what sets it apart, such as the game's physics. On Tomo's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3301510/Tomo_Endless_Blue/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>, Onibi Studio wrote, "Blocks have physics and can be used to create vehicles and contraptions. Whether it's a boat, crane, or airship, build your own machines block by block--with your creativity, the possibilities are endless." Additionally, the Endless Blue will include other features, such as arenas, ancient ruins, and "vibrant, bustling worlds that feel truly alive." Villages, their architecture, culture, stories, quests, dialogues, and people are all dynamically generated, according to Onibi, in an attempt to ensure no two locations are the same.</p><p>"When worlds end, fragments of their civilizations become islands adrift in the Endless Blue. As players embark on a journey to uncover the story of each procedurally generated island, they discover vibrant villages filled with characters and Tomo living their lives, every island and village a microcosm of a unique culture," Onibi Studio wrote in the game's press release. "The trailer peeks into just one story of many in the Endless Blue, giving us a slice of life in this infinite world where one may uncover unexpected secrets lying in darkness."</p><p>Tomo: Endless Blue is available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3301510/Tomo_Endless_Blue/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a> but does not currently have a release date. Below are a few images that showcase what gameplay will look like.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474059-steam_screenshot_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474060-steam_screenshot_02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474061-steam_screenshot_03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474062-steam_screenshot_04.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474063-steam_screenshot_05.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474064-steam_screenshot_06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4474059,1300-4474060,1300-4474061,1300-4474062,1300-4474063,1300-4474064" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4474059-steam_screenshot_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4474060-steam_screenshot_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4474061-steam_screenshot_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4474062-steam_screenshot_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4474063-steam_screenshot_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4474064-steam_screenshot_06.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474059-steam_screenshot_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474060-steam_screenshot_02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474061-steam_screenshot_03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474062-steam_screenshot_04.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474063-steam_screenshot_05.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474064-steam_screenshot_06.png"></figure>

                <p>When Palworld was first released in early 2024, one of the criticisms levied against the game in some circles pertained to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/internet-reacts-to-palworld-and-its-massive-success/1100-6520490/" data-ref-id="1100-6520490">allegations of the developer using generative AI</a>. Palworld communications director and publishing manager, John "Bucky" Buckley, has now responded, discussing how these claims hurt the people at the studio. He also said the allegations are "complete nonsense."</p><p>Asked by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN </a>how the allegations of "AI slop" impacted the workers at Pocketpair, Buckley said, "Massively, massively, massively, massively."</p><p>"That is by far I would say the biggest kind of thing that was ever against us, still to this day. Go to any Palworld posts or any news article about Palworld, or Reddit post, you'll see someone say, 'I hate this company. They use AI,' and it's complete nonsense. It's upsetting," he added.</p><p>Everyone at Pocketpair was affected by these claims, Buckley said, especially the concept artists. "We have a few Pal concept artists, and two of them in particular who've been there since day one. They're not big fans of this kind of stuff, but it's very hard to counter this, which we did learn," Buckley said.</p><p>To counter these claims, Buckley said the studio considered asking its workers to make a video and discuss the matter, but "none of our people want to be on camera."</p><p>"The vast majority of our artists are female, and in Japan, it's not the way to go about things right now. So they don't want to be on camera, they don't want to be public, they don't want to have their names out there. And yeah, it's upsetting for them, still today it's very upsetting to hear these things," he said.</p><p>Buckley said that Pocketpair releasing an official Palworld art book "definitely made a big impact" to push back against the AI claims, but "not as much as we would've hoped, perhaps."</p><p>People connected Pocketpair with AI in part because its CEO responded positively to a post about AI years ago, Buckley said. Pocketpair also released a party game called AI: Art Imposter, in which players generate AI images and then the other people try to deduce what's real and what was made using AI. People took this to mean Pocketpair as a studio loves generative AI, but Buckley said this misses essential context.</p><p>Palworld has been steadily supported since release with ongoing updates, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-cross-play-update-officially-confirmed-for-late-march/1100-6530069/" data-ref-id="1100-6530069">latest of which arrived in mid-March and added cross-play.</a> Palworld is available now on PC and console. It's included with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass.</a></p>

            <p>
Sandbox matchmaking sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/date-everything">Date Everything!</a> has a final release date, after previously pushing back its earlier (and more romantic) 14th February launch plans.
</p>
<p>
Date Everything! will now arrive for PC, PlayStation 5, Switch and Xbox Series X/S on 17th June, publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/team17">Team17</a> confirmed today.
</p>
<p>
A romance game where you can hook up with anthropomorphic versions of pretty much anything in your flat - chairs, toilets, washing machines and more - Date Everything! tasks you with cosying up to as many things/people as possible to fill your Date-A-Dex (just don't tell The Pokémon Company).

<p>
There's more detail, from Felicia Day, on how the game's "Dateviator" glasses work in the release date trailer above.
</p>
<p>
A key draw to the game is its star-studded cast of video game voice actors being roped in for cameos, including Felicia Day as well as Laura Bailey, Ashley Johnson, Ashly Burch, Matt Mercer, Troy Baker, Roger Craig Smith, Ben Starr and dozens more.
</p>
<p>
If all of that sounds like your cup of tea, well, there's only two more months to wait. And if you really love cups of tea, you can probably date those too.
