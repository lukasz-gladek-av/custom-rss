			<p>The popular vampire-themed survival-RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/v-rising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">V Rising</a> had its full release (following a lengthy early access period) on PC earlier this month, and thankfully, console players won’t have to wait soon to sink their teeth into the game. Today it was announced that V Rising will be launching on PS5 (this one isn’t coming to Xbox for now) in June. You can check out a new PS5 trailer for V Rising, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="V Rising - Date Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IjEw901V7JE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007965/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-orders for the PS5 version of V Rising are open now</a>, with the standard edition of the game costing $40. You can also grab the $60 Castlevania Edition, which includes the recently-released Castlevania DLC, or the $100 Complete Edition which includes all DLC and cosmetics released to date. Those who pre-order any version of the game will get a 10 percent discount.</p>
<p>Haven’t been keeping up with V Rising? Wccftech’s Francesco De Meo found the full version of the game to be a bloody good time <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/v-rising-bloody-yet-fun-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his review</a>…</p>
<p><em>“Enriched by many additions, including endgame activities that promise to challenge even veteran players' knowledge of the mechanics and fighting skills, the 1.0 version of V Rising is the culmination of two years of hard work. The number of options and activities the game offers to those willing to delve deep into its complex yet satisfying mechanics make for a survival game like few others on the market.</em></p>
<p><em>V Rising may not have the deepest survival game mechanics around, but that is hardly a problem. The experience crafted by Stunlock Studios manages to masterfully weave together mechanics from very different genres to provide an experience like any other on the market. While solo players may find the experience becomes a little stale over time, everyone else will find plenty of reasons to remain in this world, whether it's to perfect their characters or build the most haunting vampire castle ever seen.”</em></p>
<p>V Rising can be played on PC. The game launches on PS5 on June 11. Castlevania and Complete Edition buyers will be able to access the game five days early on June 6.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-stories-2-preview-hands-on-with-playstation-4-port</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-stories-2-preview-hands-on-with-the-playstation-4-port.876234/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-stories-2-preview-hands-on-with-playstation-4-port<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following its success on Nintendo Switch and PC a few years ago, <em>Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin</em> is at last making itself known on PlayStation platforms. Releasing for PlayStation 4 on June 14 alongside a remastered version of the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-stories-preview-exploring-ps4-remaster"><em>Monster Hunter Stories</em></a>, Capcom is ready to bring the JRPG series to a whole new audience with both games in the series hitting at once.</p>

<p>As we did with the remastered <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em>, we had some time to sit down with the PlayStation release of <em>Monster Hunter Stories 2</em> and see just how it ended up working out on Sony’s machine. As this was also my chance to experience the game for the first time, having missed it before its original release, I wanted to take my time and dig into this fairly recent sequel.</p>

<p>From the outset<em>, Monster Hunter Stories 2</em> provides a massive jump across the board from its predecessor. From the opening cutscene, it’s obvious that unshackled from the constraints of a handheld platform, the game is being allowed to flourish.</p>

<p>The visuals are a huge step up – offering high-quality models, environments, and effects that showcase the anime <em>Monster Hunter</em> style taken to modern heights. The cel-shaded style is clean, and the overall direction gave me the impression that this RPG was going to be something big.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2_-wings-of-ruin_20240518224406_0.jpg?itok=5eDzlgG2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2_-wings-of-ruin_20240518224406_0.jpg?itok=8s2lWKlB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
As with <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em>, <em>Stories 2</em> opens its narrative with the disappearance of the Rathalos, but this time on a much bigger scale. Right away, several characters come into view as you’re tasked with creating one of your own who happens to be descended from a legendary Rider known as Red.</p>

<p>Without diving too much into spoiler territory (and because we reviewed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-stories-2-review">original release</a> a few years ago), the story seems to be a lot more mature – focusing on characters that are more mature, and the grand adventures framed by the opening hours keep at an exciting pace.</p>

<p>Character creation goes further in-depth compared to the previous game, with added options for each feature of whichever body type you choose. One thing in particular I liked was the ability to add two different hair tones depending on the style I picked. It’s a small detail, but it goes a long way towards adding some personal customizations.</p>

<p>From there, <em>Monster Hunter Stories 2</em> eases you into its systems. Your character, who is basically the protagonist and a newly minted Rider, then gets shown the ropes by a girl named Kayna who acts as a teacher of sorts. Said ropes include showing off the Velocidrome monsties, as well as basic tutorials to ease you into the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2_-wings-of-ruin_20240518223837.jpg?itok=zNw4DXJ_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2_-wings-of-ruin_20240518223837.jpg?itok=XJ6emBZW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
After playing through a bit of <em>Stories</em>, I was glad to see <em>Stories 2</em> puts you into the action a lot quicker. There’s far less exposition and more – here’s the world, get on your mount and get going attitude going on.</p>

<p>Outside of the village, the world opens up with larger zones, and plenty of enemies on the field and it’s there you can gather items or fight your way through to more experience.</p>

<p>The turn-based battle system from <em>Stories</em> is largely back in play here as well, although it adds a few mix-ups of its own to keep things fresh in its Rock Paper Scissors-inspired encounters whilst using Power, Strength, and Technical type attacks selected through the command menu.</p>

<p>This time you can attack different parts of the monsters, and battles are more engaging with the ability to swap out weapons mid-battle using the Skill change option. <em>Monster Hunter Stories 2</em> also adds a Kinship Gauge that fills up so you can perform fancy attacks with your companions.</p>

<p>It’s definitely a more fleshed-out experience, and on PlayStation, runs plenty smooth throughout even when there’s a lot going on on-screen in battles or exploring the colorful world.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2_-wings-of-ruin_20240518231708.jpg?itok=V9DCm9Od 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2_-wings-of-ruin_20240518231708.jpg?itok=uIcjJXCb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
I played the preview on PlayStation 5 since it’s compatible and didn’t run into any overt issues. The framerate seems solid, the colors are vibrant, and the upscaling to 4K works fine enough given this isn’t a native PS5 release. My only complaint is there is some aliasing present on the edges of the characters – mostly noticeable in hair and things like that, but it’s not a deal breaker.</p>

<p>Similar to the other platforms, <em>Monster Hunter Stories 2</em> on PS4 has maintained its multiplayer elements. That means you can play co-op or multiplayer versus battle with other people on the PlayStation Network.</p>

<p>Co-op quests are of note because there are areas only accessible via multiplayer, and it’s here you’ll be able to encounter exclusive monsters and collect monster eggs – which is a key component of the gameplay loop and monstie customization.</p>

<p>Overall, <em>Monster Hunter Stories 2</em> on PlayStation feels like a solid effort. It’s a clean port with everything present in the original releases and does well to run smoothly on the current generation platform. Having come from playing the original <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> back-to-back, the upgrade here is immense, and the effort in direction and crafting a bigger world can’t be understated.</p>

<p>What’s more, you could probably pick up <em>Stories 2</em> and get into it just fine on its own, so it does have strength as a standalone title despite its sequel status. Either way, it wouldn’t exactly be a bad jumping-in point if you’re new to the series like me, or if you just want to check out a traditional JRPG you can do just that when it launches on June 14.</p>

  <p id="wkMe26">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/multiversus-guides"><em>MultiVersus</em></a> roster is expanding again, this time with two big bad guys: Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th horror franchise and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22842967/agent-smith-matrix-resurrections-trilogy-sequels-casting-mission">Agent Smith</a> from the Matrix films. Those two villains will join a pair of recently confirmed additions to <em>MultiVersus</em>: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24155348/multiversus-joker-gameplay-mark-hamill-powerpuff-girls">the Joker</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT1zXiYqcfA"><em>Adventure Time</em>’s Banana Guard</a>. </p>
<p id="rXHsm9">Developer Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games confirmed Jason and Agent Smith in a new cinematic trailer hyping up the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23933735/multiversus-announcement-relaunch-release-date-warner-bros">impending relaunch of <em>MultiVersus</em></a>. And if you comb through Monday’s new <em>MultiVersus</em> trailer, you might spot teases for a few more unannounced characters. At one point (about 50 seconds in), we see Bugs Bunny crack open the Warner Bros. water tower, from which a few props escape. Those items appear to be Aquaman’s trident, Samurai Jack’s katana, and Octi, the beloved plush octopus of Bubbles from <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em>. There’s also a broomstick, which could belong to the Wicked Witch of the West from <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> or someone from the Harry Potter franchise.</p>
<p id="Cr70Yk">There are also background references to DC superheroes Green Lantern, Robin in his <em>Teen Titans Go!</em> form, and Raven, though it’s unclear if those are teases or simply stage dressing.</p>

<p id="XD1c4G">Player First and WB seem to be leaning toward bad guys for the debut season of <em>MultiVersus</em>’ relaunch, season 1 of which is titled Puns &amp; Villainy. So if you’re guessing at new additions in the coming weeks and months, think supervillains.</p>
<p id="9gb4ys"><em>MultiVersus</em> comes back on May 28, with new additions Joker, Jason Voorhees, and Banana Guard available at launch, and Agent Smith coming sometime later in season 1. They’ll join existing characters featured in the trailer: Wonder Woman; Velma; Bugs Bunny; Marvin the Martian; Iron Giant; Rick Sanchez (who apparently knows Batman’s secret identity); Stripe from Gremlins; Finn the Human; and Cake the Cat, a variant of <em>Adventure Time</em>’s Jake the Dog.</p>
<p id="vTPJYJ">WB’s free-to-play fighting game will be available again for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X next week. It will boast a major new feature called <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158526/multiversus-pve-mode-rifts-video">Rifts</a>, <em>MultiVersus</em>’ take on a PvE mode.</p>

<p>It was recently revealed that Stellar Blade’s developer, ShiftUp, is considering a PC version of the game – as well as a sequel. In a report published on a South Korean website (and shared <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/1792567131374031009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by KAMI on Twitter</a>), it’s detailed that ShiftUp will continue to expand and plans to release a new game every two or three years. Currently, the studio is working on a new IP called Project Witches which will be a cross-platform game spread between mobile, PC, and console platforms. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stellar-delivery">Stellar Delivery</h2>



<p>It has been reported that Stellar Blade is ‘exceeding expectations’ where sales are concerned. In certain regions, the game has sat at the top of the charts since being released exclusively on PlayStation 5 on April 26. This at-times controversial post-apocalyptic slasher has enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame in recent weeks, something that has really put ShiftUp on the map.</p>



<p>Like other PlayStation-exclusive games, fans have been requesting that Stellar Blade makes its way onto PC – and ShiftUp is at least considering that concept. Most recently, Ghost of Tsushima hit Steam and racked up big numbers despite having some niggling issues.</p>



<p>There’s a drive at ShiftUp to bolster the team and hire more developers as the fresh projects surface over time. It isn’t just new games, though – ShiftUp reportedly wants to secure existing IP and buy out some brands. It just hasn’t been confirmed <strong>what</strong>.</p>

MultiVersus officially shut down in June last year after launching with a battle pass, microtransactions, and DLC characters. This release was considered an open beta, but some expressed frustration at MultiVersus going dark after spending real money on it.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-review"><u>In our 8/10 review of the open beta</u></a>, IGN said: "MultiVersus may not be a must-play at social gatherings, but its refreshing team-based battles make it a great platform fighter online."</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Monster trucks, the apex predators of motorsport, have left an untold path of destruction over the decades. Now, the unstoppable brutes have added a fresh victim to their list as not even Fortnite's famed battle bus could withstand the crushing force of a 1,500-horsepower monster truck. During a recent Monster Jam event held at the Los Angeles SoFi stadium, a replica of the Battle Bus met its end when it was torn apart. This might just be the worst thing to happen to the Fortnite Battle Bus since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbJOTdZBX1g">YouTube Rewind 2018</a>.</p><p>You can see the full event in the video below, with the car-nage starting at around the four-minute mark.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HNcNtyE6Fk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="259">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6HNcNtyE6Fk?start=259" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For fans of freestyle monster-truck action, there are a few Monster Jam games out in the wild. THQ Nordic published two Monster Jam Steel Titan games in 2019 and 2021, respectively, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-jam-showdown/" data-ref-id="5000-620863">Monster Jam Showdown</a> has a release date of August 29 for PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch. An officially licensed game, it'll include iconic vehicles like Grave Digger and Megalodon in its launch lineup of 40 Monster Trucks, and 26 more will be added to the game as DLC.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fortnite is gearing up for some big crossovers soon. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-teases-fallout-crossover-ahead-of-post-apocalyptic-season-3/1100-6523546/" data-ref-id="1100-6523546">Fallout has already been teased</a> for Chapter Five: Season Three--good timing thanks to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-is-happening-amazon-confirms/1100-6522787/" data-ref-id="1100-6522787">megaton success of the Fallout TV series</a>--and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/furiosa-a-mad-max-saga-review-a-whole-new-gear/1900-6418226/">Furiosa</a> crossover looks like a certainty as well.

After all, Take-Two was among the first major companies to up the price of its topline games from $60 to $70, and now some believe Take-Two could charge even more for the next GTA game.</p><p>CEO Strauss Zelnick was recently asked for his thoughts about "pricing dynamics" for the GTA franchise and its entire portfolio. Zelnick did not comment directly or confirm anything about the price for GTA VI, but he did discuss Take-Two's general thoughts on pricing its products with "value" in mind.</p>

<p>"Look, there's more content constantly being made available, and we really aim to deliver great value at any given time," <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/u6vymezd/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he explained on an earnings call</a>. "We're so focused on delivering more value than what we charge. And that's sort of the rubric. And any time we establish a price, we want to make sure that it's good news for the consumer; that the experience vastly over delivers in the context of the cost. That's the goal."</p><p>While we don't know what the price of GTA VI will be--and no legitimate retailers are taking preorders for it yet--Take-Two has raised GTA ecosystem prices recently. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-gta-6-release-rockstar-raises-gta-price-by-33/1100-6522616/" data-ref-id="1100-6522616">GTA + membership recently raised its price by 33%, from $6/month to $8/month</a>. The price increase went into effect just as L.A. Noire was added to the service; Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption is already in the catalog, as is GTA: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. Rockstar's Bully is coming to GTA+ later this year.</p><p>Many are wondering how GTA+ might factor into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA VI</a> when it releases next year, and that remains unknown. Take-Two has not disclosed anything as of yet regarding the profitability or revenue results from GTA+, but the company has said over the years that GTA Online--which makes money from its microtransactions--has been a big revenue-driver.</p><p>As mentioned, Take-Two was one of the first publishers to charge $70 for new releases, beginning with NBA 2K21. Zelnick said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/charging-70-for-nba-2k21-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-was-the-right-call-take-two-ceo-says/1100-6487277/" data-ref-id="1100-6487277">raising prices by $10 was the right call and was accepted by consumers.</a></p><p>"In terms of frontline pricing for NBA 2K21, I think that worked out very much as expected. And as planned, it's in a premium offering at the highest possible level, the title was built from the ground up for next-gen, so first title here that has been created that way," the executive said. "And the acceptance by consumers has been nothing short of extraordinary."</p><p>Former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden predicted the price increase from $60 to $70 years ago, saying the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-aaa-game-development-/1100-6478908/" data-ref-id="1100-6478908">AAA market was "unsustainable"</a> and that $60 for a new release would become "difficult" for big games.</p>

<p data-characters="334" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Following confirmation that <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> will be <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/rockstar-narrows-window-for-grand-theft-auto-6-launch-to-fall-2025/">launching in the fall of 2025</a>, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick has said the company is “highly confident” it will meet that target, while also setting some rather lofty expectations by calling the game “an experience that no one has seen before.”</p> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="149" data-injectable="false">In a recent <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/17/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-take-two-interactive-ceo-strauss-zelnick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC interview</a> (spotted and <a href="https://x.com/_Dyllie_/status/1792241924738285669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared by Twitter user Dyllie</a>), Zelnick was asked about the decision-making behind choosing a release window.</p> <p data-characters="200" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">“Well, there is slippage in the industry, and we’re not immune from that,” said Zelnick. “However, we narrowed the timing because we are highly confident in that timing.”</p> <p data-characters="447" data-current-count="796" data-injectable="true">He explained there are multiple elements; one of which is determined by how many bugs are in the game. While the team at Rockstar will obviously be aiming to minimize that amount by launch, Zelnick added, “In the case of an extraordinary title, for which there are extraordinary expectations, it’s not really about bugs. It’s about creating an experience that no one has seen before, and&nbsp;Rockstar Games&nbsp;seeks perfection.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Strauss Zelnick (Take-Two CEO) was interviewed by CNBC on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTA6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GTA6</a></p><p>– The game was internally delayed because rockstar seeks perfection, it’s going to be a game NO ONE has EVER seen before. <a href="https://t.co/6rMF374VgR">pic.twitter.com/6rMF374VgR</a></p></div>— Dyllie (@_Dyllie_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_Dyllie_/status/1792241924738285669?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="596" data-current-count="896" data-injectable="true">I don’t doubt the team at Rockstar is working extremely hard on <em>GTA 6</em>, and it’ll probably be a very good game. However, fan expectations already incredibly high for it (it’s been over 10 years since <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-grand-theft-auto-v/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 5</a></em>, after all), and suggesting <em>GTA 6</em> won’t be like any other video game feels like going overboard. It’s bound to be technically impressive, but I can’t imagine it’ll be that much different from previous <em>GTA</em> games. If anything, if it’s nothing like those games, that only risks upsetting long-time fans who are looking for a new <em>GTA</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="640" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true">Zelnick’s comments can arguably be written off as him simply generating hype and not meant to be taken at face value. However, Take-Two itself likely has the highest expectations of all for <em>GTA 6</em>. <em>GTA 5</em> made $1 billion in just three days (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/20/gta-5-sales-hit-1-billion-in-three-days" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>) when it launched in 2013; is Take-Two expecting similar results? If anything, it may want even better results since<em> GTA 6</em> is no doubt proving more expensive to make than its predecessor, but a lot has changed in the past decade. Game prices have gone up and not everyone’s willing to drop $70 on a new release, especially when everything else has been getting more expensive too.</p>
 <p data-characters="587" data-current-count="587" data-injectable="false">As for that fall release date, Zelnick has acknowledged Take-Two isn’t immune to “slippage,” suggesting a delay isn’t entirely out of the question. That said, Take-Two will probably avoid pushing <em>GTA 6</em> back if it can, and only agree to a delay as a last resort. After all, given the fan expectations, <em>GTA 6</em> does stand to make a lot of money and Take-Two will want that income ASAP. It’s not going to want to wait till the game’s ‘perfect,’ since such a goal is frankly unobtainable, or at the very least take up even more development time.</p>

<p data-characters="181" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Vampires can be found in pretty much all media, going from classic books and movies to, of course, anime. The latter of which presents some truly novel interpretations of vampirism.</p> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="235" data-injectable="false">As you can imagine, however, not every series featuring them is sure to deliver. But don’t worry, as the ones that do are enough to make you fall in love with the concept even more. Here are the 10 best vampire anime of all time.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">10. Night Warriors: Darkstalkers’ Revenge</h2> <figure data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="40" data-injectable="false"> <li>Where to watch online: Not officially available for streaming in the US.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="532" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">Let’s be honest, the ’90s were the golden era for Capcom anime. <em>Night Warriors: Darkstalkers’ Revenge</em> is a four-part OVA series that covers the events of the second game of the <em>Darkstalkers</em> franchise. Although not without flaws, the series offers superb animations and a more sober retelling of the game’s plot. <em>Night Warriors: Darkstalkers’ Revenge</em> was produced by Madhouse. Among their best works, we also have the anime adaptations of <em>Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End</em> and <em>Hunter x Hunter</em> (2011). </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">9. Call of the Night</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon Prime Video</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"> <li>Where to watch online: <a href="https://www.primevideo.com/detail/Call-of-the-Night/0SK1DMJLCZPSKXS7GYT1E86CYZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prime Video</a></li> </ul> <p data-characters="483" data-current-count="823" data-injectable="true"><em>Call of the Night</em> follows the story of the student Kou Yamori and the vampire Nazuna Nanakusa, as they grow closer in the hopes of turning the former into a vampire, a feat only only possible after he’s fallen in love with her. The series succeeds in mixing standard shonen and slice-of-life elements, and a pairing that brings an exciting but, deep down, bittersweet feel very few can match. <em>Call of the Night</em> is an adaptation of the manga series of the same name by Kotoyama.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">8. Blood Blockade Battlefront</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"> <li>Where to watch online: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GRWEQEZER/blood-blockade-battlefront" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crunchyroll</a></li> </ul> <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="819" data-injectable="true">Based on the manga series by <em>Trigun</em>‘s Yasuhiro Nightow, <em>Blood Blockade Battlefront</em> follows the members of Libra, a secret organization whose mission is to protect the balance between Earth and the beyond. Apart from its cast, the series sets itself apart through a mix of explosive sequences and moments capable of making you laugh and cry in equal measure. You can also find a great protagonist in Leonardo Watch, whose character development is among anime’s best. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">7. Blood: The Last Vampire (2000)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>image via Production I.G</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"> <li>Where to watch online: Not officially available for streaming in the US.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="797" data-injectable="true">The movie that kickstarted the <em>Blood</em> franchise, <em>Blood: The Last Vampire</em> follows the vampire and chiropteran hunter Saya during one of her missions. In it, she must pose as a high school student to identify and eliminate any creatures lying in wait by an air base. Although featuring a short runtime of around 40 minutes, <em>Blood: The Last Vampire</em> tells a heart-racing tale, all while exploring each of its characters and keeping your eyes glued to the screen.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">6. The Case Study of Vanitas</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"> <li>Where to watch online: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GEXH3W8DG/the-case-study-of-vanitas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crunchyroll</a> / <a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/the-case-study-of-vanitas-1df7cad6-b21c-4635-ac24-a49101556dc5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hulu</a></li> </ul> <p data-characters="554" data-current-count="894" data-injectable="true"><em>The Case Study of Vanitas</em> is an adaptation of the manga of the same name by <em>Pandora Hearts</em>‘ Jun Mochizuki. The anime follows the story of a young vampire named Noé, whose life changes completely after a meeting with the human Vanitas, the latter of which is on a mission to save vampires through the use of a fabled book. The anime features the intricate storyline and cast we all expect of Mochizuki. Another huge plus lies in the relationship between our two leads, which is the core of the series and feels just like that of Holmes and Watson. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">5. Shiki</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"> <li>Where to watch online: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/G69P2WZDY/shiki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crunchyroll</a></li> </ul> <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="804" data-injectable="true">The ideal pick for all looking for a healthy dose of vampiric horror, <em>Shiki</em> takes place in a small town that has been plagued by mysterious deaths and inexplicable occurrences. We then follow the town’s hospital director Toshio Ozaki and high school freshman Natsuno Koide as they uncover the terrifying truth behind it. The anime is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Fuyumi Ono, and succeeds in bringing its anxiety-inducing feel to the screen.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">4. JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure (Phantom Blood to Stardust Crusaders)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"> <li>Where to watch online: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GYP8DP1MY/jojos-bizarre-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crunchyroll</a> / <a href="https://www.netflix.com/br-en/title/80179831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a></li> </ul> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="821" data-injectable="true">In fourth, we have the adaptations of the first three parts of <em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</em>: <em>Phantom Blood</em>, <em>Battle Tendency</em>, and <em>Stardust Crusaders</em>. The parts are direct sequels of one another and follow three generations of the Joestar line as they face off against the supernatural. <em>Phantom Blood</em> and <em>Stardust Crusaders</em> also feature the same antagonist, in the vampire Dio Brando. <em>Jojo’s</em> brings a fresh take on vampirism by pairing it with its iconic over-the-top style. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">3. Monogatari Series</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Prime Video</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"> <li>Where to watch online: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/G69PXP1EY/bakemonogatari" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crunchyroll</a></li> </ul> <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="786" data-injectable="true">An adaptation of the novel series by Nisio Isin, the <em>Monogatari</em> series currently spans multiple anime and three highly acclaimed movies. In it, we are presented with a visceral world through the eyes of Koyomi Araragi as he becomes entangled in a series of supernatural encounters. Featuring a loyal retelling of its source material, the series became a staple of quality given its jaw-dropping action scenes, woven together by a powerful story. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">2. Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime Video</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"> <li>Where to watch online: <a href="https://www.primevideo.com/detail/Vampire-Hunter-D-Bloodlust/0Q87P403WLXCE2EBEJ026DYIZU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prime Video</a></li> </ul> <p data-characters="526" data-current-count="866" data-injectable="true">A sequel to the 1985 movie, <em>Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust</em> adapts the third novel in the<em> Vampire Hunter</em> series. In it, we follow the legendary dhampir and vampire hunter D on a mission to recover a noble’s daughter, who was supposedly kidnapped by a vampire. Although the first movie in the series is also a classic, I decided to go with <em>Bloodlust</em>, given how well it portrays the unforgiving world of the series. The movie also pairs its excellence in narrative with some of the most beautiful animations I have ever seen. </p>
 <p data-characters="145" data-current-count="145" data-injectable="false">For those wondering, <em>Bloodlust’s</em> story is heavily self-contained, so feel free to watch it even if you haven’t seen<em> Vampire Hunter D</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-1-hellsing-ultimate" data-injectable="false">1. Hellsing Ultimate</h2> <figure data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>

The OVA series is the ultimate adaptation of Kohta Hirano’s masterpiece and follows its story from beginning to end, all while staying as loyal as possible to the manga. In it, we follow the members of the Hellsing Organisation — the true vampire Alucard, its leader Integra Hellsing, and Alucard’s recently turned minion Seras— in their mission to exterminate all supernatural threats. </p>
 <p data-characters="132" data-current-count="132" data-injectable="false">The series pairs the above with jaw-dropping action scenes and an unmistakable gothic style. The result? An all-timer vampire anime.</p>

		<p>Ah, Monster Hunter. It’s everybody’s favourite game series about hunting monsters, and then chopping off the useful bits to turn into even sharper and hardier stuff to hunt some more monsters. It’s a loop that’s been working for two decades, and we’re still not tired of it, or the spectacular menagerie of toothy antagonists. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/09/07/monster-hunter-stories-review/">Monster Hunter Stories</a> certainly has elements of the mainline series, but it’s safe to say that it’s a slightly different proposition.</p>
<p>Originally a tentpole 3DS title, back when Capcom was certain that the 3DS was the perfect home for the Monster Hunter series, Stories takes the beloved franchise and turns it into a turn-based JRPG, with bright, colourful graphics, and equally bright and colourful characters. As the Monster Hunter series has grown increasingly important to the company, it’s little surprise to find both Monster Hunter Stories and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/07/monster-hunter-stories-2-switch-review-pc-wings-of-ruin/">its sequel</a> finally being ported to the PlayStation, while the first game also arrives on PC and Nintendo Switch for the same time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Stories - Announcement Trailer | Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N5rgFruN1bg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monster Hunter Stories was, and is, a welcoming and easy-going introduction to the world of Monster Hunter. Instead of slaying the iconic beasts, here you’re more focused on forming a bond of friendship, riding them around the landscape and then utilising their special moves in turn-based combat. It’s like a How to Train Your Dragon RPG, but with more teeth.</p>
<p>There’s three different kind of attack: Power, Speed, and Technical. Much like Fire Emblem’s fabled weapon triangle, each type of move is stronger against one of the others, and choosing the correct type is the key to a successful battle. Each time you make a successful attack, you also build up your meter, allowing you to ‘Ride-On’ and hop on your Monstie, before unleashing a hugely powerful attack.</p>


<p>Successfully winning a battle will see a cavalcade of parts and bits shorn from that monster, and it’s here that the classic Monster Hunter loop comes into play, with parts accrued from battle then being crafted into new equipment to head back into battle with.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Stories certainly looks better than it ever has, with both its previous 3DS and mobile outings utterly trounced by the capability of the PS4, let alone the PS5. However, there are some clear signs that this is a fairly straightforward remaster, with some suspiciously low-res textures here and there, and a frame rate that somehow doesn’t feel as smooth as it should.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Monster Hunter Stories 2 is a match for the PC release, which in turn thoroughly trounced the somewhat disappointing performance of the Nintendo Switch version. It’s smoother, more modern, and expands the story and world in a meaningful way – where the original game feels a little outdated at times, that’s never the case with its sequel.</p>
<p>The great thing about Monster Hunter Stories is the way it opens up the world of Monster Hunter to a different demographic, and younger gamers will find a lot to love in its primary coloured take on the creature-centric series. If they’re wrapped up in it all, there’s also the accompanying anime which follows the storyline of the first game, and expands on some of the ideas and characters in a more well-rounded way.</p>

<p>Given how popular Monster Hunter has become it’s gratifying that fans of the series can now experience these enjoyable outings wherever they game – well, unless you’re an Xbox gamer. Where the original game is showing its age, both games weave a tale that’s well worth diving into, especially while fans wait for the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>

If you have been waiting patiently for the PlayStation 5 release date for vampiric survival game V Rising, I have some fang-tastic news for you to sink your teeth into. 
</p>
<p>
Developer Stunlock Studios announced V Rising will make its way to Sony's console next month, on 11th June. That being said (and as is becoming increasingly common these days), if you choose to pre-order one of the game's bundles, you will be able to get five days of early access.
</p>
<p>
But before I get into all that, you can check out V Rising's PS5 trailer below. 
</p>

<p>
On its PlayStation debut, V Rising will give a fresh wave of players the chance to embody a newly-awakened vampire, before setting about constructing an appropriately gothic not-so-humble-abode to live in. Oh, and there are of course bosses that need to be slain. 57 of them, in fact. 
</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-stories-preview-exploring-ps4-remaster<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> has had an interesting journey over the years. Having begun its life as a Nintendo 3DS title and later smartphone platforms, <em>Stories </em>marked a shift in priorities for the series by going all in on a more traditional JRPG aesthetic.&nbsp; Whilst other entries focused more on action such as the fairly recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-rise-review"><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></a>, <em>Stories</em> instead settles back on a turn-based battle system and monster collecting.</p>

<p>Now eight years later, Capcom is keen on reviving <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> for some more modern platforms – specifically, PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4. We had a chance to check out the HD port in an early preview and go hands-on with some early parts of the game.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Stories </em>opens up as one might expect from any RPG – a fancy cutscene sets the mood, there’s some character and monster introduction, and a glimpse of the colorful world to eventually explore. There’s then a shift to the real-time graphics and my first impression is that everything is very colorful and eye-catching.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories_20240518212840.jpg?itok=pvHTp4eG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories_20240518212840.jpg?itok=HrHjUWAz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
For a remaster, Capcom has done well to keep everything bright and cheery, despite the obvious limitations brought about by 3DS game design. This is immediately evident upon controlling a character – areas aren’t very big and tend to guide you down a linear path toward a marked objective. Not that there’s anything wrong with that – in fact I did appreciate that the game was telling me where to go.</p>

<p>After a short introduction, your character meets up with two characters known as Cheval and Lilia, who are searching for an egg. From here, you’re tasked with customizing your player avatar of sorts, and that includes selecting their gender as well as a limited number of hair, eye, skin color, and even voice options. You can even name them, if you’d like, or select a generated name to continue along the story.</p>

<p>The egg the group finds turns out to be a young Rathalos – named Ratha of course – who decides your character is their parent. Things seem well and good until you go back to the village of Hakum and a tragedy takes place killing others, including your new monster friend.</p>

<p>There’s a time skip and it’s from here that<em> Monster Hunter Stories</em> really gets going. With the threat of a sickness known as the Black Blight still around, you’ll be taking up a Kinship rite and a crystal in order to collect monsters and become what is known as a Rider.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories_20240518213841.jpg?itok=YVjHWvT2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories_20240518213841.jpg?itok=9AG1Ac4e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
With the monster hunting and capturing element now in play and a key element of the game, the player character leaves the village, encounters new characters, and ventures further into the mystery of the Blight corrupting the land.</p>

<p>While the narrative is front and center, <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> does eventually get you to the battle and other systems after some lengthy exposition. Hoisting up the traditional JRPG mantle means the main system is turn-based, or each party member and enemy take turns attacking after abilities are selected from a menu without a time limit.</p>

<p>Your created character has a bit of flexibility when it comes to their turn as attacks are divided into three types: Power, Technical, and Speed. Each of these types of attacks comes with their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, use a Speed attack if an enemy is striking at you with a Power ability.</p>

<p>A cut-in scene known as a Head-to-Head when the enemy is targeting the attacking character. The attack type that is stronger in these situations will win out, or if they’re the same, you will end the turn in a draw. The other examples of attack strengths include Power being stronger than Technical, and Technical over Speed. It’s important to keep these elements of sorts in mind during battle so you can chase those bonuses.</p>

<p>Battles can also be mixed up with a number of weapon types such as a great sword, or a hammer. There are also different skills and, of course, the monster collecting aspect to consider in customization.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories_20240518222521.jpg?itok=ff2W7JY0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories_20240518222521.jpg?itok=G4sYmoJK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
Beyond the single-player aspect, <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> lets you play around in multiplayer matches online, so there’s a lot to play around with here for anyone looking to get their turn-based itch.</p>

<p>Circling back around to the visual side of things, it’s important to remember that yes, <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> is a remaster of a game that was originally developed for a handheld system. It’s because of that that the models are rather simplistic, even for an anime cel-shaded style.</p>

<p>There’s also not a lot of environmental detail or animations going on. Most of the dialogue scenes are in a sort of visual novel side-by-side style, although there are some traditional cutscenes and multiple CG cutscenes included. All of these have been upconverted from their original resolution to fit an HD output, although the CG scenes haven't been redone to compensate for more pixels.</p>

<p>Otherwise, <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> is voiced in both English and Japanese, or if you want you can choose the original version’s voice track. I was even surprised the player character does have some canned lines and isn’t completely a silent protagonist. Despite other limitations, this does add a lot to the overall presentation.</p>

<p>Despite its origins on Nintendo 3DS, <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> does at least deserve its time in the sun. With its sequel out now on Nintendo Switch and PC, this remaster release looks to provide fans or even newcomers with a chance to experience the <em>Stories</em> series all on the same platforms. And for PS4 players, it’s just the beginning with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-stories-2-review">sequel</a> dropping simultaneously on June 14, 2024.</p>

<p id="uXTcnn">D&amp;D’s multiverse is extremely vast and complicated, and <em>Worlds &amp; Realms</em> seems to fill a much-needed gap to help both newcomers and long-time players make sense of its fantastical realms. Featuring artwork pulled from 50 years of sourcebooks and adventures, each chapter of this illustrated guide takes a close look at one of the many worlds, planes, and settings in the D&amp;D multiverse — from the beloved plane of Mystara, to the perilous Shadowfell, to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23308644/dnd-spelljammer-review-losers">Spelljammer</a>’s boundless Astral Sea. </p>
<p id="afzuL8">But this is no dry, matter-of-fact history book. Instead, readers will explore these settings through the narration of the archmage Mordenkainen, who shares his personal experiences of these locations and thoughts on the legendary characters who’ve lived there. Readers will dive deep into Mordenkainen’s beloved home of Greyhawk (the default setting for the soon to be released 2024 revision of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24067481/dnd-dungeons-dragons-onednd-delay-2024-rules-refresh-players-handbook-dmg-release-date-price"><em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em></a>), and learn how his belief in the Balance influences his run-ins with creatures across the multiverse.</p>
<p id="hVSw1b"><em>Worlds &amp; Realms</em> also features original stories by Jasmine Bhullar, Geoffrey Golden, Jody Houser and Eric Campbell, and Jaleigh Johnson.</p>
<p id="hpywYG">Polygon has an exclusive first look inside <em>Worlds &amp; Realms </em>below, revealing 22 of the book’s 368 pages. To guide you through them, we’ve enlisted our own narrator — author Adam Lee himself — to share insights into the historic art and how <em>Worlds &amp; Realms</em> came together.</p>

<p id="cQ2rBq">I want to say that it took a lot of time, staring at the blank page in artistic agony, crumpling page after page, before the first words came for the introduction.</p>
<p id="DIq6xj">But I became (my version) of Mordenkainen fairly quickly and his voice and his intentions were apparent. I had spent some time thinking about the world from his perspective while working on D&amp;D, so I wasn’t working from zero, but he flowed onto the page and there were times I had to write fast to keep up.</p>
<p id="9ANxqB">As always, amazing art inspires the imagination. When I first saw this piece come in after being commissioned, I felt like it revealed another dimension of the master mage.</p>

</p>
<p id="oHaeRN">One of the things about writing from the perspective of an archmage is to find out what actually strikes them as important. What do they notice? When their world is so fantastical, what compels them to look deeper?</p>
<p id="1bF2RT">Here’s a person who wields the power of magic, who has traveled across the multiverse, who has fought interdimensional monsters, and has dined with angelic beings. Why not leave humanity behind for all the splendor of a host of extreme and otherworldly experiences?</p>
<p id="wAdTNH">I wanted to shine a light on the value of humanity through the eyes of Mordenkainen. For some reason, he didn’t join the heavenly host, nor did he become a demigod, or a tyrant on some high mountain peak. He became a protector of the multiverse.</p>
<p id="CKpQ89">I think there’s something about humanity that he’s immensely curious about. There’s something sacred within each being. A mystery beyond mere magic.</p>

<p id="qvqdIr">Figuring out how to write this book — a combination of lore and story — was something that I thought about a lot.</p>
<p id="oVXWHT">I wanted to talk about the worlds and share the existing lore, but I also wanted to bring something new to it, something never before revealed so that no matter what your experience was with D&amp;D, you were going to find out new and interesting stuff.</p>
<p id="02QM3g">Writing from the point of view of Mordenkainen allowed me to stretch outside of canon lore to allow for a bit of wizardly speculation which I found to be exciting — I was on an adventure with Mordenkainen as he investigated his own mind and the mysteries of the multiverse.</p>

<p id="dvPC6p">Long before I worked on D&amp;D as a professional, I was a player and a fan of these worlds, and I had my own opinions about them.</p>
<p id="nAvO4R">While working on D&amp;D, I had a chance to dive into many of the worlds at varying depths, but usually from a very agnostic point of view — we set the stage of the adventure and described the world for the Dungeon Master to interpret as they will. The players would experience the story and then form their own opinions.</p>
<p id="v4enMj">When I played the character of Mordenkainen for this book, I got to write from his POV. After a while, I began to have different opinions of the worlds as seen through his eyes. The most surprising reaction to any of these worlds was his reaction to Krynn.</p>
<p id="fDWeEB">I must say, I learned a lot from seeing Krynn through his eyes.</p>

<p id="NwlU1W">When writing anything for D&amp;D, I am always thinking about a DM getting a great idea for a one shot or a character for their campaign. I’m always in “modular mode” where I know that any chunk of what I am writing can be taken out and put into someone’s game.</p>
<p id="PJGxcD">I wish when I go into the great beyond that I can sit in front of a cosmic TV and watch how many snippets of my silly writing made it into games or made people smile or laugh. Hopefully, I’d be watching for a long time. That would bring me great joy.</p>

We dealt with so many questions about the nature of evil, the story of Strahd, and the metaphysics of Barovia.</p>
<p id="Enczzh">It was, ironically, great fun to live in Barovia, walk with the people, explore the domain, and write a few locations that were certain to be disturbing.</p>

<p id="jYpYCY">Every version of D&amp;D has its take on the legendary monsters and villains of D&amp;D. For <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2015/9/2/9242155/out-of-the-abyss-into-the-underdark"><em>Out of the Abyss</em></a> we got the treat of revisiting all the superstar demon lords and do the 5th edition version of them to continue that creative legacy.</p>
<p id="V5NFv5">For me, D&amp;D is as much a visual experience as it is a written one, and the images from the game’s earliest of days to now have an iconic stature in my mind and are forever imprinted in my memory.</p>

<p id="4PkZBK">Throughout Mordenkainen’s journey, the Balance is what keeps him grounded, and potentially keeps him sane, as he explores the multiverse, encountering all manner of fantastical beings and bizarre entities.</p>
<p id="GFnkYp">The multiverse is a bewildering place, and without a purpose, it can become as confusing as a hall of mirrors. But through it all, Mordenkainen follows the beacon of the Balance like the string that allowed Theseus to navigate the labyrinth, slay the Minotaur, and emerge alive and victorious. </p>

The 11-minute video is mostly just gameplay of the mods in action, which turns the player into a full-blown Mandalorian, complete with jetpack and badass armor. A climactic action sequence shows the player fighting against Imperial soldiers and even an AT-ST, a large mechanical war machine on two legs. The most impressive part of the overhaul is just how extensive it is: Walking through the game world completely transports the player to a galaxy far far away, with NPCs now Imperial officers and rebels who are populating areas emblazoned with factions’ insignia from the franchise, and signs written in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/three-months-of-prep-made-our-star-wars-galaxys-edge-t-1838364921&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/three-months-of-prep-made-our-star-wars-galaxys-edge-t-1838364921">Aurebesh</a></span>, <em>Star Wars</em>’ in-universe language, added throughout.

They stress that (as with any modding process) the load order is crucial to get right, and you can follow along in the video to help avoid any issues.</p><p>DeityVengy points out that all the mods shown in their list aren’t actually turned on for the gameplay shown during the video, as some more experimental mods break things and prevent you from having a smooth gameplay experience. The overhaul mostly relies on pre-existing mods like <em>Star Wars</em> Replacer, with DeityVengy creating a custom HUD for the experience including weapon icons accurate to the modded guns. The full list of mods and the custom files are all linked in the video for players eager to try it out for themselves.

All other entertainment and app functionalities are unaffected.”</p><p>While saying “you can play video games in your car” is the kind of “we’re living in the future” nonsense big tech corporations want to tout when they’re trying to sell you something, I can’t get past that cars are death traps that do not need a million bells and whistles, when safety and ease of use are still so demonstrably short of where they should be.</p><p>Tesla’s Steam app doesn’t let you play games while the car is in motion, which was at least a bare minimum safety measure in this situation. But it also makes me wonder what was the imagined use case of this. I could see someone making the argument that maybe kids want to play games while their parents drive them somewhere, but if the app only works in park, it just seems like the most inconvenient way to play your games. If you can afford a Tesla, get yourself a Steam Deck.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It was a couple of days ago that Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, narrowed down the release window for Grand Theft Auto 6. Instead of ‘2025’, we’re now looking at a ‘Fall 2025’ launch window. In a follow-up statement, Zelnick met the community on transparent ground and acknowledged that delays can happen, but the reason the company pushed out the Fall 2025 window is because they are ‘highly confident in that timing’. </p>

<h2 id="h-have-faith">Have Faith</h2>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will be released in Fall 2025, and Take-Two is highly confident it’ll hit that timeframe. It’s not expected that there will be any delays, especially considering GTA 6 has likely been in development for the better part of a decade, but never say never.</p>



<p>Since being revealed by Rockstar Games in December 2023, GTA 6 has dominated newsfeeds worldwide. Every tidbit of information generates more hype, with the most recent topic of discussion being the matter of who is voicing the protagonist(s). There continues to be an immense sense of anticipation around GTA 6, and that won’t dissipate until it’s in the hands of gamers everywhere.</p>



<p>Here’s the full interview with CNBC, in which Zelnick makes his comments about the launch window:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>There are expectations that Grand Theft Auto 6 will be ‘the most important release’ in entertainment history. It’ll likely be the fastest-selling game ever made, and it’s easy to see the open-world epic pulling north of $1 billion in a single day.</p>

<p>A new claim regarding Black Myth: Wukong is giving some new insight into what players could expect to experience when it launches in August. This comes from leaker Lunatic Ignus <a href="https://x.com/ignusthewise/status/1792541397192528213">on Tw</a><a href="https://x.com/ignusthewise/status/1792541397192528213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">i</a><a href="https://x.com/ignusthewise/status/1792541397192528213">tter</a>.</p>



<p>According to Ignus, Black Myth: Wukong features “around 160 enemy types” and “80+ bosses”. They go on to say that the game will have New Game+ at launch as well as multiple endings to experience. </p>



<p>“The game is slightly easier than soulsborne games,” they added.</p>



<p>As always, take the latest claims with a grain of salt until it’s either confirmed by the developer or independently verified by Insider Gaming.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">GameSpot parent company Fandom has released its fourth annual Inside Gaming report, and one of the key takeaways is that personal expression within games is increasingly important to players. The Inside Gaming report is based on data from Fandom's 350 million monthly unique visitors, 45 million pages of content, and 250,000 wikis.</p><p dir="ltr">The report found that the main reason people play games is to unwind and relieve stress (54%), but a close second was "creation, imagination, and self-expression" (46%). This is up 10% from 2023, demonstrating a growing trend. Within games, the top five in-game customization players seek out to express themselves include character personalization (76%), Gamertags and usernames (48%), communication (35%), signatures and emblems (31%), and emotions and gestures (30%).</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4304876-screenshot2024-05-17at3.22.15pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4304876" data-ratio="0.81330868761553" data-width="1082" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4304876-screenshot2024-05-17at3.22.15pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4304876"></a><figcaption>Why do you play games?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4304876-screenshot2024-05-17at3.22.15pm.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The report also found that there is a significant gap between how people express themselves in real life versus online. 80% of respondents said their "gamer personality" is different than their real-life personality. And then 64% said it's easier to be themselves online rather than in person.</p><p dir="ltr">The Inside Gaming report went on to say that 60% of people believe self-expression in gaming is more important than ever before, with the study specifically calling out titles like Fortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox for offering extensive options to personalize their characters. Anyone who has played those games knows very well the depth and scope of what kinds of items, skins, and other in-game wares players can acquire to deck their character out as they see fit.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the report touched on how 64% of respondents said gaming communities represent "vital safe spaces" where they feel free to express themselves, unlike how they might be able to in real life.</p><p dir="ltr">"From character customization to cosplay and content creation, video games have empowered gamers to explore, express and enhance their identity--nearly two thirds of gamers claim it’s easier to be themselves with a controller in their hands," Fandom CMO Stephanie Fried said. "With the growing significance of gaming as a means for self-expression and personal evolution, it's crucial for brands to connect to these motivators to help players bring their gaming personas to life in the real world."</p><p dir="ltr">For more, <a href="https://about.fandom.com/press#_ga=2.10852339.69101175.1716216011-135910388.1674143870" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">check out the full study</a>.</p>

You can now download or watch the latest GamesIndustry.biz Microcast, offering you a quick dive into the biggest stories  from the past week.
</p>
<p>
This week, we discuss the news from Sony regarding retired CEO Jim Ryan's replacement. Or rather, replacements. Plural. We reflect on the benefits of having long-serving execs like <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-names-hermen-hulst-and-hideaki-nishino-as-its-new-ceos">Herman Hulst and Hideaki Nishino in charge of PlayStation</a>, as well as the challenges they face and the platform holder's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sonys-focus-on-engagement-time-over-units-sold-makes-sense-for-playstation-opinion">increased focus on player engagement over units sold</a>.
</p>
<p>
We also discuss the Stop Killing Games campaign, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-government-responds-to-stop-killing-games-campaign">the UK government's response to it</a>, and the wider shift we see in both the games industry and entertainment in general that is reflected by the rise of such a campaign. Brendan dives even deeper into this issue in the latest <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/disgraceful-degradation-this-week-in-business">This Week In Business</a>.

<p data-characters="259" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">You’ve likely heard the joke conspiracy theory that birds aren’t real and/or are government drones (if you haven’t, please <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/technology/birds-arent-real-gen-z-misinformation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treat yourself</a>). Well, one <em>Fallout 4</em> modder wondered what it would be like if that was a reality in the dystopian RPG.</p> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">Perhaps more out of general annoyance for the flying critters rather than confirming to an online joke, Nexus Mods user <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/83051" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capra</a> has turned <em>Fallout 4</em> into a birdless paradise. Specifically, the mod takes aim at crows and “seagulls” (though they’re likely referring to <a href="https://fallout.wiki/wiki/Radgull" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radgulls</a>).</p> <figure data-current-count="593" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Capra/Nexus Mods.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">After getting frustrated with them, Capra decided to take action, removing them from the game. It doesn’t affect gameplay or lore in any way, and chances are many of us who play can easily ignore any and all birds, but it’s there if you want it.</p> <h2 id="h-birdemic-or-lack-thereof" data-injectable="false">Birdemic, or lack thereof</h2> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true">Technically, the modder hasn’t actually deleted the birds from <em>Fallout 4</em>. What they’ve actually done is replace both the crows and gulls with “empty textures,” made them unkillable, and basically muted their sounds. In summary: they’re there but not there at the same time.</p>
 <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="222" data-injectable="false">Now, I’m wondering whether the concept of irradiated birds that are invisible, indestructible, and silent is actually more of an issue than them just not being in the game at all. I’ll leave you to ponder that.</p> <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">I looked into it, and apparently, <a href="https://fallout.wiki/wiki/Bird" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fallout 4</em> only has these two types of birds</a> throughout the whole game (with a brief mention of sparrows during some dialogue). This means you can wander the wastelands of Boston City assuredly confident that birds do not, in fact, exist.*</p>

            <p>
Free-to-play platform fighter MultiVersus has confirmed the inclusion of Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th and Agent Smith from The Matrix, ahead of the game going live (again) next week, on 28th May.
</p>
<p>
Warner Bros' take on Super Smash Bros originally launched in early access last summer, but has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-to-shut-down-until-2024-with-no-refunds-for-paying-players">offline for the past 11 months</a> while it was upgraded to Unreal Engine 5. 
</p>
<p>
MultiVersus will arrive next week compatible with cross-platform and cross-progression play for PC (Steam and Epic), PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. (No Nintendo support is a surprise, but at this point, it's probably best just to wait for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.)

<p>
27 unique <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-characters-roster-unlock-free-rotation-9024">characters are playable in MultiVersus</a>, taking from a rollcall of Warner Bros-owned franchises (and characters not already snapped up by Fortnite). 
</p>
<p>
The roster includes Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and Joker from DC Comics, Finn and Jake from Adventure Time, Gizmo and Stripe from Gremlins, Bugs Bunny, Marvin the Martian and Taz from Looney Tunes, LeBron James from Space Jam, Arya Stark from Game of Thrones, Shaggy and Velma from Scooby-Doo (but not actually Scooby-Doo himself), Rick and Morty from Rick and Morty, the Iron Giant from The Iron Giant, plus Tom and Jerry. 
</p>
<p>
As for the game's newest arrivals, Jason Voorhees will be available at launch, when Season 1: Puns &amp; Villainy begins. Agent Smith will then debut later in the season.
</p>
<p>In January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-wants-always-on-game-success-for-dc-game-of-thrones">Warner Bros said it wanted "always on success" for its biggest franchises</a>, four of which (DC, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter and Mortal Kombat) are valued at worth a billion dollars each. Live service games such as MultiVersus are designed to provide just this, with Warner Bros saying it wanted to make "sure we get as much engagement and time with fans as possible".</p>

<p>On April 18, Warhorse Studios lifted the lid on Kingdom Come: Deliverance II in the most epic way possible. With a stunning reveal trailer and a lengthy showcase that was equal parts explorative and regal, ‘KCDII’ was uncovered in full, filling fans worldwide with an immense sense of anticipation and excitement. It’s the direct follow-up to 2018’s Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and it has been in development for quite a while.</p>



<p>Recently, I had the pleasure of catching up with and interviewing <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thisistommckay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tom McKay</a>, the instantly recognisable actor and white-hot talent behind Henry of Skalitz, the lead in both Kingdom Come: Deliverance and the sequel, which is due to be released later this year. </p>



<p>This is what I’ve dubbed ‘Becoming Henry’.</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="h-on-the-road-to-kingdom-come">On The Road To Kingdom Come</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a stunning open-world game that’s rooted in realism. There is attention to detail in everything, from the period-accurate combat mechanics to the survival elements that make the game challenging. It’s even set in a real-world location that was painstakingly researched by what was once a very small team – <a href="https://www.instagram.com/warhorsestudios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Warhorse Studios</a>. </p>



<p>I’ve come to learn that the studio has expanded massively since the first game, and it’s now backed by PLAION. In my chat with Tom McKay, I was eager to rewind and learn how he came across the role in the first place, given that Kingdom Come: Deliverance was the first (and still the only) game franchise McKay has worked on.</p>



<p><strong>McKay:</strong> ‘<em>It comes through the same channels as most of your acting work, and more and more in a way that I think is good and exciting, the worlds are kind of blending. Historically, they were very separate beasts, and a lot of TV, film, and theatre actors wouldn’t necessarily move between gaming and vice versa, but that’s happening more and more and there are lots of brilliant, big names doing it. </em></p>



<p><em>It was very much the same way that I would audition for any other job, and then I went out to Prague in like 2016 to meet everybody and do essentially a final audition, and that was it. Then they offered me the job. I don’t think anybody at that point, certainly not me, thought we’d be having this conversation eight years later – but the second game is so anticipated and I think that is absolutely brilliant.</em></p>



<p><em>I’m biased, but I’m seeing a lot of the work that the guys have done at Warhorse and it is completely mindblowing. It’s not just the kind of next level from the last game, it’s like fifty levels up from there, I think.</em>‘</p>



<h2 id="h-the-transition">The Transition</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>I was interested to learn about the ‘switch’ between Kingdom Come: Deliverance and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. It’s a different world to the one that existed several years ago when the first game was being pieced together, and that’s something that McKay confirmed as he broke down the intricacies of playing Henry of Skalitz.</p>



<p><strong>McKay: </strong><em>‘The biggest technical difference was the facial capture. We didn’t do live facial capture for the motion capture the first time around, and this time we did. We had big head cams, which make you look like stag beetles, which are technically challenging in a way – intimate scenes and fight scenes are more challenging because you can’t get that close to each other.&nbsp;In terms of suits and the studio – we were in a different studio but it felt very similar.</em></p>



<p><em>In terms of extracurricular training, there isn’t a tonne. Most of us have done a basic level to get us to a good enough level, but when it becomes stunts, <strong>it becomes stunts</strong>, like it would on any other production. In terms of weaponry, we’ve got loads of photos and we’ll show them at various points, but the actual weapons are just hilarious, like polystyrene. That’s how they’re supposed to look, that’s how they look in every other motion capture studio, but they don’t look like the kind of beautiful, ornate, intimidating weapons you’ll see.</em>‘</p>



<p>It was recently revealed that the voice acting portion of the production had wrapped up after a whopping 500 hours of studio time. Not being familiar with how that worked from an acting perspective, I engaged McKay with a question about the process:</p>



<p><strong>McKay: </strong><em>‘The first chapter of our involvement is the motion capture. We finished about two years ago, and on this occasion, it was two big chunks of roughly about six or seven weeks each. Those were separated by a period of maybe about four or five months. That was very much the kind of first brick in the wall from the acting perspective. From a developmental perspective, there’s a huge amount of work and a huge amount of people heavily involved well before any of us actors turn up. That was the same for the first time, it was even more so the case for this game because it’s much bigger. We’re relatively late to the party in that respect.</em></p>



<p><em>The guys at Warhorse were very considerate about everything, but particularly about sort of ‘vocal stamina’ because there were so many lines for Henry. Anything the player can say in any iteration of the game has to be recorded, which is why it’s such a huge volume of material. I had to do eight-hour sessions, whereas most actors would do four-hour sessions because it’s more manageable vocally, but in terms of just getting through it, we realised that the only way we’d hit the targets and the deadlines was to just do eight-hour days. We started with the more vocally smooth stuff and then if there was any intense barking or anything like that, that was at the end of the day. And actually, the last day was about an hour of just absolute full-on screaming and yelling.’</em></p>



<p>Naturally, McKay couldn’t reveal any details about the game, but he did mention that the core ‘feel’ of the product is relatively the same as the first title:</p>



<p><strong>McKay: </strong><em>‘I’m not going to speak too much about that because I’m not sure how much I’m allowed to say. I’m very much understood from all the feedback that the realistic element was key and a big part of its USP and it’s what made it harder but my understanding is that it’s what made it really enjoyable. My understanding is that the very realistic element, the immersive element, is still very much the heart of this game.</em>‘</p>



<h2 id="h-deliverance">Deliverance</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is reportedly ‘at least twice the size’ of the first game, both in terms of the map space available and the overall scope of the project. It’s an ambitious undertaking that is much more technically advanced than the first game, which was made evident by the stunning trailer that Warhorse Studios showcased little more than a month ago. </p>



<p>McKay confirmed he’d never played the first game as he ‘isn’t a massive gamer’, but he pledged to give Kingdom Come: Deliverance II a shot:</p>



<p><strong>McKay: </strong><em>‘Most of the staff I know very well on a personal level now, we’ve become very good friends, because you would never work with a team like this for that length of time at those close quarters in any other game. I see more consistently just by being in the office what’s being executed day in, and day out, and it’s absolutely mindblowing. Yeah, I will definitely be playing this game. In terms of my technical ability to play it well, that’s another matter.’</em></p>



<p>It isn’t yet known when Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will be released, but we’ve been given a window of 2024 – so within a few months, we’ll be back and in control of Henry of Skalitz, continuing the vast adventure that was kicked off way back in 2018.</p>

      </div>
<p>The new team in Warsaw joins Larian's existing studios in Ghent, Barcelona, Dublin, Guildford, Quebec, and Kuala Lumpur. There are <a href="https://larian.com/careers/location/warsaw?location=warsaw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">numerous open positions available at the Warsaw office</a> across a variety of disciplines.</p><p>The announcement of Larian Studios Warsaw comes just days after Activision announced the opening of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-announces-new-studio-making-all-new-franchise/1100-6523503/" data-ref-id="1100-6523503">new studio Elsewhere Entertainment, which is also based in Warsaw.</a> Other gaming companies with offices in Warsaw include CD Projekt and 11 Bit.</p><p>Larian has not announced its next game, but it will not be another Dungeons &amp; Dragons title. Larian is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/" data-ref-id="1100-6522049">moving beyond the fantasy series and creating something new</a>, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-hopes-next-baldurs-gate-game-is-here-before-2050/1100-6522712/" data-ref-id="1100-6522712">Hasbro has said it intends to do more with Baldur's Gate in the gaming landscape.</a></p><p dir="ltr">"That's not what we were made for," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/" data-ref-id="1100-6522049">Larian boss Swen Vincke said about making Baldur's Gate 4</a>. "That's literally the opposite of what Larian is about. We want to do big, new things. We don't want to rehash the thing that we've done already."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-is-working-toward-an-rpg-that-dwarfs-it/1100-6522051/" data-ref-id="1100-6522051">Speaking to GameSpot</a>, Vincke explained that Larian's next game won't actually be the company's super-ambitious "very big RPG," but will be a step toward realizing it.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think there is some tech that we don't have yet," Vincke said. "And I don't know what the specs are on the next-gen [of gaming systems] yet, but I hope that it's going to bring us closer."</p>

<p data-characters="301" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Immersive sims are an <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/weekly-kusoge-die-hard-nes-immersive-sim-retro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">odd and exceedingly specific niche</a> that some players just don’t feel like dealing with, <em>but</em> those who enjoy them play all of them. If you’re a fan, too, then you’ll be thrilled to hear that <em>Gloomwood</em>‘s next major update is coming very, very soon. Kind of!</p> <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">More specifically, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gloomwood-is-a-fun-blend-of-survival-horror-and-immersive-sim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gloomwood</em> is an Early Access ImSim</a> that’s going through a slow and meticulous production process headed by the developer Dillon Rogers. The game’s next major update, titled ‘The Underport’ had been slated for mid-2024 for some time at this point, but plans have now changed, and the chunk of content featured in it was so substantial that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1150760/view/6009568738059053793" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it had to be sliced in half</a>. The Underport is now, therefore, <em>two</em> updates instead of one, and its first half, titled ‘The Power Station’ is coming later this month.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Dillon Rogers</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-gloomwood-s-power-station-level-is-coming-this-month-the-hive-is-on-the-horizon" data-injectable="false">Gloomwood’s Power Station level is coming this month, The Hive is on the horizon</h2> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="674" data-injectable="true"><em>Gloomwood</em> first launched via Steam Early Access in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gloomwood-early-access-august-16-trailer-pc-new-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 2022</a>, and the game has been iterating upon its immersive sim core ever since. While the fact that the Underport has bifurcated into two separate releases is a bit sad, the flip side of the equation is that we’ll soon have a sizeable new chunk of <em>Gloomwood</em> goodness to tide us over. A fair trade, I’d say.</p>
 <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">At this time, we don’t know when the second half of the Underport, now known as ‘The Hive’ might be coming out. Presumably, it’s still slated for 2024, but we’ll need to wait and see what Rogers has to say on that front.</p> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="686" data-injectable="true">The bit that we do know for a fact, though, is that <em>Gloomwood</em> still has a fairly long and storied road ahead of it. As per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1150760/view/4182228661134367002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous bit of news about the Underdark update</a>, Rogers intends to focus on the aptly titled Research Update after all of its content comes out: “[Research] will allow the doctor to take body parts from enemies back to the lab at the lighthouse in order to study them and gain new abilities.” Fun!</p>
 <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false">After the Research Update, Rogers explained his team will be working on the ‘Bank’ level, which is due to introduce a high-tech section of the city, which is a wholly different brand of excitement, all things considered.</p> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="false">So, it’s slow going, but <em>Gloomwood</em>‘s been nothing short of great so far, and ImSim fans are used to waiting anyway. Especially now, with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-people-making-the-games-keep-paying-the-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the studio behind the legendary <em>Prey</em></a> sadly about to close down. For those who’d like to play <em>Gloomwood</em> in its 1.0 form, all I can say is – stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-is-the-perfect-place-for-a-modern-take-on-assassins-creed-assassins-vs-templars/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xdefiant-is-the-perfect-place-for-a-modern-take-on-assassins-creed-assassins-vs-templars<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="358" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In Ubisoft’s <em>XDefiant</em>, factions from across the publisher’s various video game franchises battle it out for supremacy using equipment and abilities unique to them based on the way they behave in their respective properties. But I’ve noticed a shocking lack of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> factions, and I think they’d work incredibly well. </p> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="391" data-injectable="false">Since the original <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, the Assassins/Hidden Ones and Templars/The Order of the Ancients have been battling it out for control over Pieces of Eden and, in the greater scheme of things, the world. While the sci-fi elements of these Pieces of Eden give someone the power to influence the world, these factions have been fighting on a much more grounded level for centuries. </p> <figure data-current-count="691" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">Each game sees those who are part of or who work with both factions use weapons from the current time period to head into battle against one another or strike on a much more personal level. Even the iconic Hidden Blades are melee weapons that are ever so slightly altered over time to provide an advantage for that period or the protagonist wielding them. </p> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="704" data-injectable="true">The one aspect that many other fans and I think we don’t see enough of in the series is the modern-day Assassins and Templars going head-to-head. There are scenes where Templars are allegedly storming a building, or Assassins are coming to help, but we don’t often see the weapons they use or their tactics. <em>XDefiant</em> could change this. </p>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">Every <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-all-factions-and-their-abilities-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faction in <em>XDefiant</em></a> exists in roughly the same time period. For example, <em>The Division</em>‘s Cleaners and <em>Far Cry 6</em>‘s Libertad are arguably on the low-tech end of the scale, while Echelon, the Phantoms, and DedSec all use high-tech equipment, but they’re all balanced when it comes to weapons and abilities so none of them has a clear advantage. </p> <figure data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">This means you can play as a guerrilla fighter with equipment held together with duct tape, hopes, dreams, and something sticky from the side of the road against modern-day ninjas who can become invisible. Each faction feels like it’s been pulled directly from its setting without being altered too much, and they feel as though they fit with their own lore but also bring the lore of their own games together. </p>
 <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">With <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, we have two factions to choose from. The Assassins are definitely the more interesting of the two, so that’s the one I’d like to see implemented most. While they’d need guns to stand a chance in any match, they could follow Echelon and specialize in smaller, quieter weapons but double down on abilities and gear. </p> <p data-characters="444" data-current-count="805" data-injectable="true">For example, smoke grenades would provide a fantastic cover to get in close to enemies, especially if an altered camouflage can be used to hide them in their own smoke. From there, Assassins could use a stylized modern Hidden Blade to kill enemies, with a silenced pistol for close encounters that go wrong. At most, this faction should have a mid-range weapon, but it would need to be close-range focused to make the most of the Hidden Blade. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="708" data-injectable="true">As for the Templars, they specialize in control, so a faction that somehow dominates the battlefield would be best. I imagine them using advanced weaponry, including sniper rifles, to give them an advantage no matter where they are. I also think that abilities that buff damage when surrounded by enemies would feel right because they’ve always attempted to topple civilizations in groups from within. </p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">What would tie these factions together well are powerful abilities that mirror one another. For example, the Templars could have deployable spawn points for their allies, and Assassins could have an ability that draws their teammates to them and protects them as they approach, like Ezio whistling for backup before a kill. </p> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true">Ubisoft could use dozens of potential abilities to bring<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> into the <em>XDefiant</em> universe, and I believe it would do a great job of it. Regardless of how they work, I know I would be incredibly excited to see and play around as a modern-day Assassin and/or Templar. </p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">That aspect of the universe feels like the best storyline in a good novel, the one that’s told through a few pages every three chapters or so and ends up being the only reason you finish the book. I always desperately want to see a fight between an Assassin with a laser-edged Hidden Blade and a Templar with a high-tech sword in each game, but we never quite get to it. </p> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="744" data-injectable="false">I can understand developers wanting to keep that sort of thing out of a series that’s based on history, but <em>XDefiant</em> brings factions to life like never before. Just like how history is the playground for <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>XDefiant</em> could be the perfect playground for Assassins and Templars if Ubisoft is willing to take a leap of faith and throw them in. </p>

<p data-characters="291" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Call of Duty</em> fans were delighted to see Rebirth Island return to <em>Warzone</em> in April 2024, but now fans are wondering if it will leave, and when it could disappear if true. That’s why we’ve put together everything we know about <em>Warzone</em>‘s Rebirth Island and its possible exit. </p> <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="315" data-injectable="false">Rebirth Island made its triumphant return to <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s battle royale on April 3, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/warzone-players-are-demanding-changes-to-sick-joke-rebirth-island-audio/">despite issues with audio</a>, has been welcomed back with open arms. However, some players fear that <em>Warzone</em>‘s map rotation system will mean that it will disappear for months at a time, leaving us unable to play it. </p> <figure data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Rebirth Island is only back, but it could disappear again.

 <h2 id="h-is-rebirth-island-going-to-leave-warzone" data-injectable="false">Is <em>Rebirth Island </em>going to leave <em>Warzone</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="142" data-current-count="142" data-injectable="false">While it hasn’t been confirmed by Activision yet, <strong>we do expect that Rebirth Island will be included in the <em>Warzone</em> map rotation system.</strong> </p> <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">That means it could be swapped out for Fortune’s Keep, Ashika Island, or Vondel. This process also sees modes moved in and out of rotation, with Solo, Duos, Trios, and Quads all on the chopping list. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">When could Rebirth Island leave <em>Warzone</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">We don’t know for sure, but we know that Rebirth Island won’t leave until at least May 23, when the next rotation is set to be announced. <strong>The most likely</strong> scenario is that it exits the game on May 29 when <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-does-mw3-and-warzone-season-4-start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Warzone</em> Season 4</a> starts, but we’ll be sure to update this article when we get official confirmation. </p>
 <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">Don’t panic when it does eventually exit though, as the rotation system means it’s very likely to return before the next <em>CoD</em> game releases in autumn 2024. You’ll have plenty of opportunities to run Rebirth Island before the rumored return of Verdansk, that’s for sure. </p>

  <p id="I8gmhm">A good board game has a lot of layers to it. Narrative layers surround and define a board game’s storyline, while mechanical layers govern the moment-to-moment action. More complex games have a rich strategic layer, with players trying to outfox each other over multiple turns or games. There’s always a social layer as well, which can be as simple as gathering people together to play, or as nuanced as the communication and negotiation skills required to excel at <em>Catan</em>. But <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24091734/life-in-reterra-eric-lang-interview"><em>Life in Reterra</em></a>, a new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games">board game</a> designed by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/10/12416080/gencon-diana-jones-trophy-burned-book-eric-lang">Eric M. Lang</a> and Ken Gruhl with art by <a href="https://mendolaart.com/artists/hugo-cuellar/">Hugo Cuellar</a>, has a layer that many other games don’t — a creative layer. That makes it one of the year’s most interesting new titles.</p>

<p id="G257dd"><em>Life in Reterra</em> posits a far future where urban centers have been taken back by nature, and where notions of humanity’s past exist only as artifacts. It’s up to players to rebuild those cities as they see fit. The art style reflects that conceit well, with brightly colored tiles filled with different biomes as well as the occasional relic, like a smartphone. Players score points for organizing these biomes into contiguous sections, filling the table in front of them with green spaces, deserts, and cheerful lakes or streams.</p>
<p id="qAv3Ys">But the land itself is only the game’s first layer. As players place those tiles, they must constantly consider their orientation in order to create the largest and most valuable biomes that they can, but also to create the foundations needed to place specially shaped buildings on top. And it’s in the placement of these buildings that the game begins to show its true potential.</p>
<p id="cJEjm5">The buildings in <em>Life in Reterra</em> are organized into three different sets, each more complex than the last. In the game’s “starter set,” gardens are worth additional points, but only if you have the largest segment of contiguous terrain on the table. Schools are worth extra points for each different type of relic that you have on the board, and so on. There are three sets in all, presenting a total of 30 different buildings inside the box.</p>

<p id="OAhcCO">Beyond the starter set, the manual for <em>Life in Reterra</em> includes just four more “curated building sets.” The Unfriendly Neighbors Set is confrontational, with players using buildings in ways that dramatically impact the other players at the table. The Peace &amp; Quiet Set, has very very little interaction between players. Meanwhile, the Popularity Contest Set sits somewhere in between. In this way, the game’s mechanical layer can be swapped out at will. Once you make it deep enough into the manual, <em>Life in Reterra</em> becomes something of a platform, a system capable of being different games for different audiences at different times.</p>
<p id="4bZBp5">And then, on the 14th page of the manual, <em>Life in Reterra </em>does something remarkable: It asks players to curate their own sets of buildings to play with. “My Building Sets” reads the two-page spread, revealing a blank worksheet with room for four new ways to play that players can create all on their own.</p>
<p id="P7hNGX">With this final creative layer, <em>Life in Reterra</em> invites players to become designers themselves. The manual, as expertly written as it is, vanishes into the background to become merely a point of reference. The rules are there to facilitate play, not to dictate what the nature of that play should be. In the end, it’s up to individuals to make their own fun, rebuilding the game to meet their needs even as they rebuild the land itself. It’s a bold move — especially for a game targeted at mass market retailers.</p>
<p id="Z5xcKJ">At the same time that Lang, Gruhl, and publisher Hasbro have brought their multi-layered, open-ended design to the toy aisles at Target, they have also elected to bring some of high-end board gaming’s boutique fit and finish as well. <em>Life in Reterra</em> isn’t just a cheap box of cardboard bits and plastic movers. The cards are hefty with a nice linen finish, the wooden meeples are screen-printed, the elegant manual saddle-stitched, and all of the components are stored inside modular plastic trays with transparent lids. Cracking it open, this game looks and feels like something you’d get in the mail after a successful Kickstarter campaign.</p>

<p id="u4lsVb"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24091734/life-in-reterra-eric-lang-interview">When I interviewed Lang earlier this year</a>, he called <em>Life in Reterra </em>a “lifestyle game.” At the time, I took that to mean a game that would welcome novices into the larger board gaming hobby and encourage them to make board games a part of their lives. But something more like the opposite is true. <em>Life in Reterra</em> is an incredibly solid and resilient design, which like a collectible card game can be mixed and remixed into multiple different experiences. It is also a game that respects the player’s time, and a physical product that’s built to last. For that reason alone it’s found a permanent place in our home — not in the closet or on a shelf, but right in the middle of the coffee table.</p>
<p id="VnI7Ez">Now, mixed in with all the other urgent detritus of our modern lives — remote controls and smartphones, chewed-up pencils, junk mail, and half-finished homework — is our family’s new favorite board game. <em>Life in Reterra</em> has become something that we return to on a weekly basis, and even when we’re not playing, sometimes we just daydream about the building sets we might come up with for the next go-around.</p>
<p id="rH1MdH"><em>Life in Reterra</em> hasn’t changed our family’s lifestyle, but it has managed to worm its way into it. I think it might easily find a place in your home, too. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-arena-breakout-infinite-release-date-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>If you were one of the lucky few—or many, considering they were handing out beta keys like candy—then you’re likely pretty excited about the Arena Breakout Infinite release date, right? It plays like a free-to-play shooter but with a lot more complexity that should entice casual players from Escape From Tarkov. Being F2P certainly helps, too. So, when’s it coming out?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-arena-breakout-infinite-release-date">When is the Arena Breakout Infinite Release Date?</h2>



<p>As of right now, we don’t know the official release date for Arena Breakout Infinite. The studio is still working through the closed beta period, which they said they’ll extend. It’ll likely run until some point this week, around May 22. As for an actual release date for the full version of the game, no one knows just yet.</p>



<p>Considering how well-optimized the beta experience felt from a gameplay perspective, I don’t imagine it’ll take long to iron out any bugs and tweak gameplay mechanics and loadouts. Developer Morefun Studios genuinely wants to compete with many of the big-name extraction shooters, namely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-escape-from-tarkov-full-of-cheaters-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape From Tarkov</a>, and they’re seemingly willing to put in the work.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-arena-breakout-infinite-like-escape-from-tarkov">Is Arena Breakout Infinite Like Escape From Tarkov?</h2>



<p>In many ways, yeah, Arena Breakout Infinite is quite similar to Escape From Tarkov. It’s an extraction shooter, albeit with a bit more casual playstyle, that heavily focuses on action and loot, like the latter. </p>



<p>Straight off the bat, Arena Breakout Infinite introduces a tutorial that guides you through many of the key systems, including how to properly prepare for a raid with the inventory and loadout mechanics. It’s a useful tooltip that should help many new players find their footing.</p>



<p>Secondly, the overall combat feels more fluid and action-oriented. Whereas Escape From Tarkov is more realistic and hardcore, which can alienate many first-person shooter fans who want something more accessible.</p>



<p>I think both will have their place in the gaming sphere. Arena Breakout Infinite, being free-to-play and casual-friendly, will entice newcomers to the extraction shooter genre. Escape From Tarkov, on the other hand, caters to more hardcore players who enjoy the complexity and realism.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1792495491256664211" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X today, Larian Studios confirmed that it is opening a seventh studio located in Warsaw. </p>



<p>Larian plans to reveal more about Larian Studios Warsaw, including job openings, during the Digital Dragons event beginning today. The devs appear very interested in adding new talent to the Warsaw studio.</p>



<p>Larian Studios explains that it’s the right time to grow the team “with two very ambitious RPGs now starting development.”</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>*obtains condition Enlarged*</p><p>With two very ambitious RPGs now starting development, what better way to see our visions realised than by growing the team and opening a 7th studio in the heart of Poland’s lively gaming scene!</p><p>Welcome, Larian Studios Warsaw! <a href="https://t.co/hpm2aMdQmy">pic.twitter.com/hpm2aMdQmy</a></p></div>— Larian Studios (@larianstudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/larianstudios/status/1792495491256664211?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Larian <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-is-working-on-two-new-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially confirmed</a> it began work on two new games last April in a community post. However, the devs consistently make it clear they are not planning to develop new material for Baldur’s Gate.</p>



<p>Despite the enormous success of Baldur’s Gate 3, the devs confirmed they will not work on DLC or a sequel <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-baldurs-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during a GDC panel</a>. </p>



<p>This will surely disappoint fans of the popular RPG. However, Hasbro did announce in April that it’s still interested in making <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-4-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another Baldur’s Gate game</a>, even without Larian. In an interview, Hasbro’s Eugene Evans added that “we’re going to take our time and find the right partner.”</p>



<p>Larian Studios Warsaw will likely work on original IP, and the new studio marks a major opportunity as the industry continues to face layoffs. </p>



<p>Both large and small developers, such as Mighty Kingdom, recently reduced employees. Last month, GTA 6 publisher Take-Two announced it would lay off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-take-two-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5% of its workforce</a> and cancel anticipated games.</p>

Below, we recall how its vision of the future was more prescient than we'd realized at first glance.</em></p><p dir="ltr">In 2014, a singer having her voice captured and digitized against her will was a novel sci-fi conceit. Ten years later, it sounds eerily familiar. With the ever-increasing presence of AI and deep fakes, as well as digital homogenization all around us, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/transistor/">Transistor's</a> tale of payback against the Camerata doubles back as a prescient artistic rebellion.</p><p dir="ltr">Designers, journalists, and painters were all targeted by the elite group one by one. The Camerata methodically ripped the city of Cloudbank of not just key citizens, but also character and grace. As protagonist Red cruises through the fading streets of Cloudbank, she witnesses how her surroundings lose color, progressively matching the Camerata's attire. Yet, despite the odds, Transistor reminds us of the importance of latching onto mundanity, and what represents us.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the first examples you encounter is the work of Amelia Garbur, an associate editor who covers the slow decay of Cloudbank. The story of Transistor is told in snippets, emphasizing environmental cues and bite-sized details for you to piece together what transpired in a disappearing district or inside a room before your arrival. Therein come the OVC Terminals, which are posted across the city and offer either surveys or news reported by Garbur, informing the citizens of the latest developments outside their homes.</p><p dir="ltr">"Incident at the Empty Set," reads a headline detailing the events that transpired at the venue where Red was attacked. "Postponed: Hammers vs. Clientele," says another later that day, indicating that the two popular sports teams won't be playing after all. Toward the evening, "Traverson Hall Is Gone" marks a poignant beginning of the end.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the citizens you encounter are either soon-to-be or already deceased. Red, using the namesake sword that was originally held by the Camerata, is able to retrieve a fragment of theirs and take them inside. Mechanically, doing so gives you a new ability to mix and match during combat. But this process also adds them to a database, providing information about who they were and what influential role they had in the city.</p><p dir="ltr">Garbur is one of the few characters who avoids this digitization. Instead, her work speaks for herself, right until the bitter end.

href="https://futurism.com/sports-illustrated-ai-generated-writers" rel="nofollow ">Futurism</a> reported on a series of articles in Sports Illustrated that were written by fake writers, their personal information and their work being AI-generated. Despite <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/7/18/23798164/gizmodo-ai-g-o-bot-stories-jalopnik-av-club-peter-kafka-media-column" rel="nofollow ">resistance from staff</a> under its suite, G/O Media <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/6/23785645/go-media-ai-generated-articles-gizmodo-av-club-artificial-intelligence-bots" rel="nofollow ">rolled out AI tools</a> in mid 2023, which quickly proved to just churn <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/ai-articles-disinformation-future-g-o-media-rcna95944" rel="nofollow ">factually inaccurate pieces</a>. Others like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cnet-published-ai-generated-stories-then-its-staff-pushed-back/" rel="nofollow ">CNET</a> and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/buzzfeed-ai-creators-news-shut-down-1235483607/" rel="nofollow ">BuzzFeed</a>, the latter shuttering its news division in the process, followed suit. The integrity of the reporters doing the work every day was compromised for the sake of producing articles en masse, even when readers would quickly notice incongruences, as well as a simple lack of human touch.</p><p dir="ltr">The seemingly imposing push for AI extends beyond journalism. <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/fr-fr/2024/05/13/microsoft-announces-the-largest-investment-to-date-in-france-to-accelerate-the-adoption-of-ai-skilling-and-innovation/" rel="nofollow ">Microsoft</a> recently announced a 4 billion euro investment in cloud and AI infrastructure. If you've been trying to search for something on Google and received a garbled response, it's possible that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/05/13/google-ai-search-io-sge/">it wasn't written by a human being</a> at all. From dating apps like <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/ai-personas-are-future-dating-bumble-founder-says-many-arent-buying-rcna151738" rel="nofollow ">Bumble</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sag-aftra-approves-ai-voice-acting-for-video-games/1100-6520224/">voice acting</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-intends-to-be-aggressive-with-ai/1100-6520074/">development tools</a> for video games, CEOs and corporations are betting on a future where they can further automate not only jobs, but our everyday lives, despite the proven <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/22/ai-jobs-humans-cost-mit-study/" rel="nofollow ">monetary</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24066646/ai-electricity-energy-watts-generative-consumption" rel="nofollow ">environmental</a> costs, workers' livelihoods notwithstanding.</p><p dir="ltr">Sadly, AI also goes hand in hand with deep fakes, which are digitally generated images or videos that mimic the likeness of a real person, whether it is their image or their voice. During the Met Gala, images of artists like Rihanna and Katy Perry went viral, despite being fake. In Arizona, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/08/arizona-election-workers-trained-with-deepfakes-prepare-2024/">workers are being trained</a> to prepare themselves for misleading images ahead of the 2024 elections. In March, New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/aoc-deepfakes-defiance-act-1234979373/" rel="nofollow ">announced</a> she's co-leading the <a href="https://www.durbin.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/defiance_act_of_2024.pdf" rel="nofollow ">Defiance Act of 2024</a>, which would allow <a href="https://www.vox.com/24145522/ai-deepfake-apps-teens-ban-laws" rel="nofollow ">victims of deep-fake</a> creations to sue the people behind them.</p><p dir="ltr">The dystopian future depicted in Transistor isn't filled with one-on-one premonitions of our current reality. Yet, the parallels hit too close to home for comfort. There's an enemy type that "attacks" Red by taking pictures of her. During New Game Plus, one of the bosses sings a corrupted, digitized rendition of the song that was played during the fight originally, mimicking Red's voice. Witnessing Cloudbank being consumed by a rampant and uniform process resonates with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/05/arts/video-games-internet.html">digital homogenization</a>, and how human interactions are being diminished by the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/first-gen-social-media-users-have-nowhere-to-go/" rel="nofollow ">online spaces</a> we inhabit.</p><p dir="ltr">Revisiting these themes through a modern-day lens can leave us with a defeated feeling. But the central message of Transistor is one of hope, not despair, reminding us that the human touch can be mimicked, but never replaced.</p><p dir="ltr">Red leaves the sword outside a restroom before entering, being playful while maintaining a now begone boundary with his partner, who's stuck inside of the weapon. Further into the story, she uses one of the OVC Terminals to communicate with her companion, if only for a brief moment, twisting the original purpose of leaving a comment under an article. Even without her voice, she can't stop herself from humming over the heart-soothing songs that play in the background throughout her entire journey, refusing to abandon her artistic spirit.</p><p dir="ltr">As companies continue to be hellbent on attempting to replace human identities, obsessed with the idea of succumbing to a reality forged by algorithms and faux tech revolutions, Transistor remains inspiring 10 years later. It's comforting to know that the silk in Red's dress remains silk until the bitter end, despite the attempts to imitate her liking. There's a special solace in knowing she's reading news from an actual human being, even as the city collapses around her.</p>

                <p>At long last, a Figma figure of Link from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Breath-Wild-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B097B2YWFX?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> is on the way. Figma toys are some of the best when it comes to striking a pose, as they have an incredible range of articulation, plenty of accessories, and fantastic detail. Legend of Zelda fans can choose from two Link figures to add to their collection, as the standard version and the DX edition are both up for preorder. Amazon initially sold out of its preorders for the standard and DX versions of the figure, but the standard edition is back in stock for $70. The figure doesn't release until next summer, but you won't be charged for your preorder at Amazon until your order ships.</p><ul><li><strong>Amazon</strong><ul><li><a

figures feature the same overall design--a colorful and sharp sculpt from the talented hands of Shinji Koshinuma at Max Factory--and you can essentially make Link do any pose you want thanks to the wealth of joints on this figure. Want him to glide around your room, kneel on a rock to survey the land around him, or have him swing the Master Sword around to clear the space around him? You can do just that and more with this Figma figure.</p><p>Both figures come with three faces you can easily swap in or out--smiling, neutral, and shouting faces--a Master Sword, Hylian Shield, Hylian hood, and a base to pose Link on. The DX version comes with many extras, including a paraglider, rocket, rocket effect parts, Construct bow, arrows, Ascend ability effect parts, traveler's shield, rock hammer, and King Rauru's right arm. These are expected to ship out in 2025, but if you're looking for some other Legend of Zelda figures to help you pass the time, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=the+legend+of+zelda+figma&amp;crid=RWTCB7SFCJ67" rel="nofollow ">there are several options</a>.</p><p>The new Tears of the Kingdom Link figure isn't the only premium Zelda collectible on the horizon. Bandai Namco's Tamashii Nations collectible brand is releasing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-master-sword-replica-is-now-available-to-preorder/1100-6523376/" data-ref-id="1100-6523376">a beautiful replica of the Master Sword</a> later this year.

                <p dir="ltr">In what capacity remains to be seen, but Call of Duty: Warzone and Modern Warfare Season 4 will see mecha from Gundam appear in the game. A new teaser shows the shadow of one of the giant robots appearing on a building.</p><p dir="ltr">The official Call of Duty account <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1792238845557133808" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter) teased the Gundam crossover. Along with the short 10-second clip, the post says: "It's time for the shadows to rise up" with an emoji of crossed swords.

                <p>Take-Two recently announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> is now targeting a release in Fall 2025, and CEO Strauss Zelnick is pretty sure the game will make it out on time.</p><p>"There is slippage in the industry, and we're not immune from that. However, we narrowed the timing [of GTA 6] because we are highly confident in that timing," he told CNBC.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4KEJAdVXzo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r4KEJAdVXzo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Previously, GTA VI was set for release at an unspecified point in 2025. It's worth noting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">pretty much every Rockstar Games release gets delayed</a>, so it's possible GTA VI might slip, as Zelnick mentioned was possible.</p><p>Zelnick also recently talked about how GTA VI's release date <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-probably-doesnt-matter-anticipation-reaches-fever-pitch-take-two/1100-6523548/" data-ref-id="1100-6523548">"probably doesn't matter"</a> given the immense hype for it. However, he acknowledged that releasing in the fall--when people spend lots of money on gifts for the holidays--is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-probably-doesnt-matter-anticipation-reaches-fever-pitch-take-two/1100-6523548/" data-ref-id="1100-6523548">advantageous for GTA VI.</a></p><p>In the CNBC interview, Zelnick was pressed to say more about what makes GTA VI a step up over GTA V. He declined to get into specifics but noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-breakdown-easter-eggs-references-and-teases/2900-4973/" data-ref-id="2900-4973">the trailer</a>, released in December, teases a lot of what is "new and different" for GTA VI.</p><p>Zelnick also talked about how Rockstar's aim is to make GTA VI a game that <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1792239837098996117" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"no one has ever seen before."</a> He added, "Rockstar Games seeks perfection in what they do."</p><p>GTA VI's first trailer was described as "Trailer 1," so fans are expecting to see another trailer at some point in the future. There continue to be many unanswered questions about GTA VI, one of which is what will happen to GTA Online when the new game comes out.
