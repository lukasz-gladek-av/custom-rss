Despite having watched many hours of competitive <em>League</em>, whenever I’ve tried to play it myself, I’ve quickly bounced because of its complexity. WASD controls could lower the barrier to entry, and Riot says that they are “the first of a number of long-term projects we’re working on to help shape <em>League’s</em> future.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/758360/league-of-legends-wasd-keyboard-control-riot-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another union is forming at Blizzard as developers from the company’s story and franchise development (SFD) team have voted in favor of union representation. Announced via the Communication Workers of America (CWA) website, the vote came “either by signing a union authorization card or indicating that they wanted union representation via an online portal.”</p>



<p>All workers will be members of CWA Local 9510 in Orange County, California with Microsoft already recognizing their union.</p>



<p>The union <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/blizzards-story-and-franchise-development-workers-form-latest-video-game-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will cover those who work</a> on Blizzard’s in-house cinematics, animation, and narrative team who create game trailers, promotional videos, in-game cutscenes, and other narrative content for Blizzard franchises. It becomes the first group of its kind to form a union in the North American game industry.</p>



<p><strong>“After more than a decade working at Blizzard, I’ve seen all the highs and lows. For years, Blizzard has been a place where people could build their careers and stay for decades, but that stability’s been fading,”</strong>&nbsp;Bucky Fisk, a principal editor and member of the organizing committee, said via release.&nbsp;<strong>“With a union, we’re able to preserve what makes this place special, secure real transparency in how decisions are made, and make sure policies are applied fairly to everyone.”</strong></p>



<p>The new union joins the <strong>“nearly 3,000 workers at Microsoft-owned studios who have organized with CWA to build better standards across the video game industry.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“These workers are setting the standard for animation, cinematics, and storytelling across the video game industry, creating the breathtaking cutscenes, trailers, and other narrative content that fans have come to love across all Blizzard franchises. We are excited to have them join our union family,”&nbsp;</strong>CWA Local 9510 president Jason Justice said.</p>



<p>As of publishing, neither Activision-Blizzard nor Microsoft have made an official comment on the union.</p>

<section><p>This hour-long story stands toe-to-toe with the biggest games in the medium.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">From their massive open worlds, unfathomably large download sizes, and seemingly endless checklists of collectibles, missions, and side quests, games are so much nowadays. It's really no fault of the titles themselves that this formula works--it's tried, it's true, and it sells. But it does mean that I appreciate the occasional break from this exact mold of game. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/and-roger/" data-ref-id="5000-654160">And Roger</a>, a narrative game that can be completed within an hour and manages to do so much with so little, offers exactly that kind of break, and I'd love it if it became the standard rather than the exception.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm not too interested in giving away the most explicit details of And Roger right here and now. For just about five dollars on your PC and/or Switch, you can see all it has to say over the course of a slightly long lunch break. I've nothing to gain from telling you what it is, but you've got everything to lose by not just experiencing it firsthand. It covers a lot of ground in a pretty short amount of time, and its gut punches are as hard as they are dizzying.</p><p dir="ltr">And Roger plays like an interactive graphic novel--think 2018's Florence, which depicted the highs and lows of the titular character's romance and journey of self-discovery across comic-like panels and minigames. And Roger appears to take some cues from the award-winning narrative title, communicating its story largely through brief mechanical interludes that break up its often distressing narrative. However, where Florence basked in the glow of new love and the ennui of uncertainty, And Roger drops players into the confusing perspective of its main character and leads them on what can only be described as an expertly crafted emotional rollercoaster that tightly skirts the boundaries between different genres of stories.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, you'd be forgiven for thinking that And Roger was a horror game at first blush. Its opening certainly leaves that impression on the player as a brief examination takes a sharp turn for the bizarre and unsettling. And in truth, many of the events that come to follow--like the protagonist coming to and finding a strange man on her couch--do inspire a bit of terror.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4548821-3zmm608q.png" data-ref-id="1300-4548821" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4548821-3zmm608q.png" data-ref-id="1300-4548821"></a><figcaption>Two men in hats observe a young girl.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4548821-3zmm608q.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">But as you close in on and make your way through the second chapter, And Roger adopts a significantly lighter tone. Without giving too much away, the main character's life changes for the better, and the horrific sequences that make up the first chapter seem to fade from memory as they push forward into this new era. The break in tone almost appears disjointed from the rest of the narrative that preceded it, but it's really all quite intentional how the game keeps pushing the player through sometimes disorienting turns through the character's life.</p><p dir="ltr">You see, And Roger just gets it right. What do I mean by "it"? I mean most everything about the game is finely tuned in a way that bloat often obfuscates. The ambitions of its story are scoped precisely, allowing for gameplay and mechanics that align with it perfectly. Scenes where the player must focus the character's blurry vision on a clock face, smash a button over and over to get out of bed, and even just brush their teeth seem like mundane tasks, but they compound in such a way that the story is able to show more than tell, all the while building narrative tension that eventually explodes. In brief, And Roger doesn't feel like it loses sight of itself in pursuit of some mechanic, feature, or detour that wouldn't otherwise fit this tight experience, and while I'm sure much of that that stems from the precarity of indie development, it is also simply refreshing to play something so clear-cut and precise.</p><p dir="ltr">Because these pillars of And Roger are in such harmony, its pace, which could be misconstrued for brusque at an hour-long runtime, is actually pitch-perfect. And Roger is just more economical about how it tells its story and how it is conveyed to the player, proving that games don't have to look or feel like the standard we've grown used to in order to tell meaningful tales or even evoke a sense of satisfaction from the player.</p><p dir="ltr">And Roger doesn't have as many things for the player to do as, say, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, a game I enjoyed a great deal and completed earlier this year after about 70 hours, nor does it share much in common with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/">Elden Ring</a>, which I've replayed a good chunk of recently and whose massive expansion I just wrapped up. It also doesn't set itself up to rival a game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/slay-the-princess/">Slay The Princess</a>, which at least shares a propensity for narrative over mechanics like And Roger does, or a visual novel like Date Everything. It doesn't need to, either, because I was just as satisfied (not to mention, quietly devastated) by And Roger's ambitions and execution as any of the aforementioned games. In some cases, it even worked better for me.</p><p dir="ltr">My point is not that one way is right and the other is wrong. Games making is not binary in this way. But games like And Roger continue to crop up as proof that they don't all need to fit a predetermined, and lets just admit it, generously-sized mold. Games, like art in any other medium, can and should come in all shapes, sizes, and forms. And Roger functions as a near-perfect rebuke of the thinking that games should grow bigger in order to be better and due to that, it gets it just right.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official Story Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The game doesn't take any time to provide a "rationalization" for why this is possible. "You're literally in the air, and you hit the jump button again, and you'll get another jump out of it. Does it feel good? Is it fun? Then I don't give a s**t if it makes any sense," Pitchford said.</p><p>Beyond double-jumping, Borderlands 4 adds dashing and gliding movement abilities, while players can also use a grappling hook to move around the world and pull items toward themselves.</p><p>Borderlands 4 takes players to the planet of Kairos, and the game appears to have taken some inspiration from Bungie's Destiny series. Not only will you have a helpful droid called Echo-4 that can assist you in navigating your way across Kairos, but you'll also be able to instantly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-lets-you-glide-ride-and-find-vaults-on-the-side/1100-6531245/">catch a ride with a Sparrow-like vehicle</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">According to Pitchford</a>, Borderlands 4 will give players an expansive playground to explore, but it shouldn't be referred to as a traditional open-world game. "I wouldn't say 'open world' because that [term] will come with baggage. That isn't what we are. But it is seamless, and it is expansive, and it is larger than anything we've ever done, and it is filled like nothing we've ever done," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It's coming to Switch 2 on October 3.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Krafton has issued a response to a recent lawsuit filed by the former leads of Subnautica 2, offering rebuttals to the developers' claims and alleging they "resorted to litigation to demand a multimillion-dollar payout they haven't earned."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes in reply to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-leaders-accuse-krafton-of-hindering-games-release-firing-them-to-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus">legal complaint</a> filed by former Unknown Worlds CEO Ted Gill, and fellow co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, last month. In it, the former leads alleged that Krafton went out of its way to hinder Subnautica 2's development, delay the game, and ultimately fire them from their roles all in an effort to stop them and other employees from collecting a $250 million bonus payment that would have kicked in if the game's early access released on time later this year and reached certain sales milestones.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In its <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/900707287/Defendant-s-Answer-to-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=ha0mUjTuK1JQkOU4QaYn" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">response</a>, Krafton says the game was planned for a Q1 2024 release. However, "Cleveland and McGuire abandoned their roles as studio-wide Game Director and Technical Director to focus on their personal passion projects and quit making games for Unknown Worlds entirely. And Gill, who remained, focused on leveraging his operational control to maximize the earnout payment, rather than developing a successful game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Krafton goes on to allege that by 2023, Unknown Worlds' development director had commented on the founders being "checked out," and that Cleveland in particular had stated publicly he had abandoned video games to pursue filmmaking. The release date of Subnautica slipped to 2024 and then 2025. "An internal assessment of the first playable in March of 2024 made clear that the team had failed to deliver on their promise of developing sufficiently new content. But rather than roll up their sleeves and make the game they had promised, the Key Employees blamed others and overhauled the team." Krafton also says that the leads continued reducing the scope of the game over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The response says that by spring 2025, Krafton was trying to stop them from releasing the game, saying it was not ready. However, Krafton alleges the leads tried to release it anyway in order to get their maximum earnout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Krafton, fearing how an underbaked EA Subnautica 2 would be received by both existing fans and the broader market, urged Cleveland and McGuire to return to their posts to generate a market-ready product that would not disappoint fans. Cleveland and McGuire declined. In response to Krafton's request for the Key Employees to return to lead the development of Subnautica 2, Gill stated that '[t]here's no coming back to a job they didn't have.'" Krafton further alleges that the leads said they would self-publish the game without Krafton, and that they downloaded "massive amounts of confidential information" from Unknown Worlds.</p><blockquote>The Key Employees' insistence on releasing the game immediately was singularly driven by self-interest in obtaining the earnout. At every turn during development, the Key Employees were laser focused on avoiding "a timeline that doesn't tank the earnout opportunity" and scheduling the release to maximize their payments. Conversations throughout the post-acquisition period make clear the Key Employee's [sic] focus was on their payday, and not on the game. As early as 2022, an employee who was due to receive a portion of the earnout stated that despite the significant delays in the game, he was confident "Ted [Gill] will <em><strong>concoct a scheme to get us that earnout</strong></em>." [emphasis Krafton's]</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The response goes on to issue answers to every claim in the founders' lawsuit, paragraph by paragraph. Krafton asks the court to rule in its favor, deny the founders' claims for relief, and award Krafton costs, including attorney fees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This saga began in July, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-developers-entire-leadership-team-replaced-in-shock-move-krafton-said-will-bring-renewed-energy-and-momentum">Krafton seemingly out of the blue</a> announced it would replace Unknown Worlds' leads with former Striking Distance CEO Steve Papoutsis. In the weeks that followed, reports emerged surrounding the $250 million bonus promised to staff amid questions as to whether that payout would be honored. While the Subnautica leads claimed in various statements and in their lawsuit that Krafton had tried to delay Subnautica 2 and ultimately fired them to avoid paying them the bonus, Krafton accused them of neglecting their duties, saying Subnautica 2 was not ready to launch. That final claim remains up in the air, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaked documents</a> since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-drama-gets-even-messier-as-krafton-confirms-internal-document-leak-is-real">verified by Krafton</a> confirming that Unknown Worlds was receiving feedback from the publisher that the game was not ready for early access launch. However, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-16/-subnautica-2-leaders-say-krafton-sabotaged-game-over-payout" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report from Bloomberg</a> suggests this may not have been wholly true.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’d been excited for the return of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/studio-trigger-anime-new-panty-stocking-with-garterbelt-is-a-raunchy-foul-mouthed-riot-2000626852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>New Panty &amp; Stocking</em> <em>with Garterbelt</em></a> ever since it was first announced at <a href="https://kotaku.com/bleach-trigun-stampede-panty-stocking-anime-expo-1849144771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anime Expo 2022</a>. Since Studio Trigger is handling the edgy, cult classic anime instead of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gainax-bankruptcy-khara-evangelion-hideaki-anno-1851526631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gainax,</a> I trusted that the show would be in good hands. After all, Trigger is one of my favorite anime studios, and with <a href="https://gizmodo.com/hell-yeah-cyberpunk-edgerunners-ii-is-happening-2000624411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cyberpunk:</em> <em>Edgerunners</em></a> and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/delicious-in-dungeon-season-2-studio-trigger-1851542772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Delicious in Dungeon</em></a> follow-ups in the works, I had faith the show would live up to its thirteen-year cliffhanger. My trust has yet to be misplaced, but I was overwhelmed by the sex-driven show’s unexpectedly wholesome short about adopting a ghost cat, which turned me into a sobbing mess.</p><p><em>New Panty and Stocking</em> has been a nonstop riot. The show follows two angels, one named Panty, whose vice is that she likes to fuck, and the other named Stocking, who loves to eat sweets. They work for a priest named Garterbelt in Daten City, and they spend most of their time slaying demons. Why those names? The show operates under <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> naming conventions, trading produce references for underwear, naming characters Kneesocks and Brief to match its raunchy energy.</p><p>Every Wednesday, as if to make up for lost time since the cult classic premiered 13 years ago, the show has been moving quickly, incorporating plenty of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/new-panty-and-stocking-episode-3-mandalorian-reference-star-wars-2000633241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pop culture references</a> and sharply targeting Millennial and Gen-Z humor. One of my favorites is a <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> spoof that reimagines Dom’s family as sperm, and a <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> meets <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> episode where they joked about the rise of weed dispensaries popping up everywhere, doubling as GPS landmarks. They even managed to create that <em>Fantastic Four</em> spoof, combining Jack Kirby and <em>Space Ghost</em> art styles, just days after Marvel’s new movie was released, honoring the late <a href="https://gizmodo.com/george-lowe-star-of-adult-swims-space-ghost-has-died-2000571346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Space Ghost</em> voice actor, George Lowe</a>, in one fell swoop. All of this is even more commendable considering Prime Video hasn’t been promoting it (or any of its anime, for that matter) at all.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="【New PANTY &amp; STOCKING with GARTERBELT】#01 メイキング" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5GNQdNp2_uc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>A short segment in the third episode of <em>New Panty &amp; Stocking</em>, “Pet Cematary Hills, Panty Anarchy knocks over a tombstone on her walk home. The next morning, she wakes up to a kitten purring so loudly that it vibrates on her lap. It turns out to be the soul of a cat whose tombstone she knocked over. This is where the waterworks begin, but explaining will spoil the episode.</p><p><strong>So spoilers for that.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Because <em>Panty &amp; Stocking</em>’s world involves the Anarchy sisters earning coins like <em>Mario</em> for every demon they slay in the hope of buying their way into heaven, Panty considers murking the cat to get a coin and going about her debaucherous way. Everyone dislikes this, including their former rivals-turned-new roommates, the Daemon sisters, who have all fallen for the cat as their house pet. Plus, the kitten is so small that its death wouldn’t earn Panty a coin anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, Panty hatches a scheme to get the cat, which she names Vibe (named after a vibrator), nice and fat so that it’ll grow up to be worth a gold coin. Her methods to ensure this include hiding the pet toys her housemates bought for Vibe to limit her exercise and being heavy-handed with portion sizes at dinner time.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Prime Video/Studio Trigger</span></figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote><p>“Good girl, Vibe. Get nice and fat. Nice and fat, and we’ll both be the fattest cats around!”</p></blockquote></figure><p>In the blink of an eye, Vibe goes from being three apples tall to being a full-grown cat. So Panty decides now’s the time to put her pistol to Vibe’s temple. But she doesn’t pull the trigger. Like the Grinch, she acquiesces and remarks about how Vibe hasn’t been her usual energetic self. All the same, she pets Vibe and promises to bring back more of her favorite food.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>She just like me fr.<span></span><span>Prime Video/Studio Trigger</span></figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote><p>“Hey, Vibe, you’re not living up to your name so much these days. All right, all right. I’ll get you a nice, yummy Fish Ghost for when I get back. Be a good baby and look after the house, okay?”</p></blockquote></figure><p>But when Panty returns home, her housemates tell her something about Vibe, causing her to rush outside to see the black ghost cat turn into a transparent hue. Turns out, something was wrong with Vibe, and she’s going to disappear. In another twist, the something wrong wasn’t that she was dying for a bad reason, but that she was able to pass on properly because of the love she received from Panty.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>“That Ghost was abandoned by humans. She had never known love. But you loved her, Panty, and now she’s ready to move on.”</p></blockquote></figure><p>I’m honestly getting misty-eyed while typing this. Which of course doesn’t help, especially since Panty’s following line saying goodbye to Vibe with one last forehead boop obliterated me.</p><figure><blockquote><p>“I had big plans for you, you know? You were gonna give me so many Heaven Coins. Vibe…”</p></blockquote></figure><figure><figcaption>┗( T﹏T )┛<span></span><span>Prime Video/Studio Trigger</span></figcaption></figure><p>And there it is. I’m crying over a cat named after a vibrator passing on because the show’s selfish, bratty lead loved it enough to make up for its misfortunes in life. It also doesn’t help that I didn't cry during the show's memorializing of Vibe in the most <em>Logan</em>-esque final scene possible, by putting up a crucifix made out of pink vibrators outside their house with her name on it.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I'm in shambles. <span></span><span>Prime Video/Studio Trigger</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like, yo, what the fuck, man?</p><p>As someone who also owns an all-black cat named Majima, whom I adopted from PAWS Chicago—learning he was an alley cat for nine years—seeing this scene hit me hard. Like Vibe, Majima also grew accustomed to being called outside by his name, with me jokingly calling him an asshole or brat whenever we’re at home. Still, like Panty, we formed a bond. He’s my little guy, and Vibe was Panty’s baby girl.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Family portrait<span></span><span>Isaiah Colbert</span></figcaption></figure><p>Watching Panty, a crude, selfish character, have her tsundere walls break down unexpectedly floored me. Quips are kind of the heart of the anime, so seeing the show stick to telling a wholesome story in an episode where they <a href="https://x.com/PSGarchive/status/1954978577637839216" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kill the president</a> and <a href="https://x.com/d0nut2x/status/1950601031001190841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">become the <em>Fantastic Four</em></a> gave me the kind of tonal whiplash I’m still thinking about weeks later.&nbsp;</p><p>To my delight, the show didn’t just make a one-time reference to Vibe. In the latest episode, which featured Panty and Stocking battling knockoff <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, Panty joked about not giving a shit about pets. Panty’s sister, Stocking, promptly called her the fuck out by mentioning Vibe and how Panty loved her.&nbsp;</p><p>The lack of energy from Amazon Prime surrounding one of the most surprising comedy shows of the season—especially since Prime Video is a strong contender with two gems, including the spiritual successor to the best slice-of-life comedy of all time, <em>Nichijou</em>, <a href="https://www.primevideo.com/detail/CITY-THE-ANIMATION/0S1DSDV3YPNM8W8GZQK8FJTZ9H" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>City The Animation</em></a>, which is streaming exclusively on its platform—is not surprising but still disappointing.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/krafton-fires-back-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-subnautica-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/krafton-fires-back-at-unknown-worlds-founders%E2%80%99-lawsuit-alleges-absentee-founders-%E2%80%9Cimpacted%E2%80%9D-subnautica-2%E2%80%99s-development-team.1268343/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>KRAFTON, owner of Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds, has responded to the lawsuit filed by Unknown Worlds co-founders, doubling-down on allegations that co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire had "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles at the studio, and that their absence had been impacting the development team for Subnautica 2 as far back as July 2023.</p>



<p>Backing up slightly, Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill, each co-founder of Unknown Worlds and together creators of the original Subnautica, <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">sued their former employer, KRAFTON</a>, after KRAFTON fired all three of them and delayed Subnautica 2 from its initial 2025 release window into 2026. There's a whole whack of <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">events that led up to that lawsuit you can check out in a bullet-point list, here.</a></p>



<p>A key element that KRAFTON has pushed since the public dispute between Cleveland, McGuire, Gill, and KRAFTON began is KRAFTON's allegation that the co-founders<em> </em>weren't actually working on Subnautica 2 at all, and in the company's <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/900707287/Defendant-s-Answer-to-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=ha0mUjTuK1JQkOU4QaYn">response filing published August 12, 2025</a>, KRAFTON tries to drill that point home even further.</p>



<p>KRAFTON claims that once it had successfully acquired Unknown Worlds, Cleveland and McGuire took their earnings from the sale and "<em>quickly lost interest in developing Subnautica 2</em>," the filing reads.</p>



<p>"<em>Cleveland and McGuire abandoned their roles as studio-wide game director and technical director to focus on their personal passion projects and quit making games for Unknown Worlds entirely. And Gill, who remained, focused on leveraging his operational control to maximize the earnout payment, rather than developing a successful game</em>."</p>



<p>The filing continues to allege that Cleveland in particular had left his videogame development career to pursue filmmaking, another point that KRAFTON has brought up before.</p>



<p>KRAFTON goes on to allege that two months prior to Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill claiming the game was ready for an early access launch, the development lead on Subnautica 2 said the first stage of early access for the game would be "<em>about 12% of our intended 1.0 scope</em>," and that the lead joked the game "<em>would be in development for 30 years</em>" at the current pace it was going earlier this year.</p>



<p>To further its point about Cleveland and McGuire leaving their posts, KRAFTON claims the two co-founders declined to return to their roles as game director and technical director, and that Gill had even stated "<em>there's no coming back to a job they didn't have</em>." Following that, KRAFTON includes a statement allegedly from Cleveland, in which Cleveland admits that Subnautica 2's development began with the intention of having a younger generation of development talent at Unknown Worlds take the helm for the sequel, and that he knew that he "<em>wasn't going to be running that team</em>" from the beginning.</p>



<p>All of this will be worked out in the courts over the course of the coming months, potentially even years, and right now the dispute can be boiled down to both sides flinging claims at the other that we can't yet know to be totally true. </p>



<p>Whichever way it goes, it'll be interesting to see how this dispute ends, and which of the claims being flung end up sticking.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/aol-dial-up-ending-reminds-us-that-all-empires-collapse-eventually.1268331/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><span>Most of us probably moved on from dial-up decades ago, but AOL, or as most people who grew up in the ‘90s and early aughts might remember it, America Online, is </span><a href="https://help.aol.com/articles/dial-up-internet-to-be-discontinued"><span>only just now in 2025 fully discontinuing the service</span></a><span>. For the young’uns among us, dial-up is a wired internet connection that monopolizes your phone line–this dates back to when most people’s primary telephone service was over landline–in exchange for pretty slow internet speeds by today’s standards. Nowadays most people use broadband internet, so dial-up has become less and less common, but somehow, AOL has kept its service going for decades. It’s finally officially shutting down on September 30.</span></p> <p><span>For most people, this is a moment of “oh, I didn’t realize people were still using dial-up,” but according to the </span><a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2023.B28011?q=B28011"><span>Census Bureau</span></a><span>, an estimated 163,401 households were operating on dial-up as of 2023. I wouldn’t be surprised if most of those homes are older people who only use the internet for things like email and the occasional Google search.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Whatever the case, if you were alive and alert in the ‘90s, you were likely very aware of AOL and its internet services. And even if you </span><i><span>weren’t </span></i><span>alive then, you’ve probably heard the “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjnyY85-gp0"><span>You’ve got mail</span></a><span>’ sound effect AOL played out of your speakers when you got a new email. Good lord, imagining that clip playing with the frequency at which the average 2025 inbox receives email sounds miserable. I suppose it’s just an example of how far the internet has come since AOL’s heyday.</span></p>

 <p><span>My family couldn’t afford dial-up until I was near the end of elementary school, so a lot of my early dial-up memories are of getting online at a family friend’s house or my uncle’s place to print out pictures of Shadow the Hedgehog for my school binder and watch music videos that took so long to buffer they looked like slideshows. A lot of people who are a bit older than me probably have memories of playing online games on dial-up, but its unreliability is also part of why </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/15-years-later-heres-why-a-gamer-was-duct-taped-to-a-c-1796679499"><span>in-person LAN parties</span></a><span> were so prominent back then. Nowadays, the internet has gotten good enough that we create virtual facsimiles of what used to be our workarounds for poor internet. Discord calls and online lobbies are another part of the average gamer’s life, so somehow we’ve come full circle. But while the internet has long since outpaced dial-up’s capabilities, it’s hard to overstate just how prominent AOL and its services were.</span></p> <p><span>AOL’s folksy “You’ve got mail” voice clip, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/a-nostalgic-game-that-spills-out-into-your-internet-bro-1795666514"><span>its Instant Messenger app</span></a><span>, and the sound of a modem screaming to establish a dial-up connection are nearly as synonymous with ‘90s nostalgia as boy bands, the original 151 Pokemon, and the Internet Explorer logo. AOL’s dial-up, and the assortment of chatrooms and services it offered, were so embedded in the public image of the internet that our cultural perception of it as a kind of ISP/online hub has outlasted its actual providing of internet service.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Once it seemed poised to take over the world, buying Time Warner in 2001 in what was then the largest corporate merger in history. But those days are long gone. Did you know AOL merged with news website and search engine </span><i><span>Yahoo! </span></i><span>in 2015, and is now </span><a href="https://www.aol.com/"><span>mostly an aggregate site</span></a><span>? It’s a bit sad that something that was once so unifying as a cultural artifact is now unrecognizable. AOL’s shift is the result of decades of changing hands, </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/03/media/verizon-yahoo-sold-apollo/index.html"><span>private equity fuckery</span></a><span>, and massive changes in the market. It turns out even the biggest businesses can crater. If you live long enough, you, too, can outlive corporate gods as they topple into the abyss.</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-opening-night-live/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-will-be-shown-at-opening-night-live-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1268328/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resident Evil fans get ready because the next look at Resident Evil Requiem will be coming during Gamescom Opening Night Live.</p>



<p>First claimed by regular Resident Evil leaker <a href="https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955312103188992041" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dusk Golem</a>, there will be a “new showing” of the game during the show with a media embargo with more details on August 20.</p>



<p><strong>“[Then] it’ll be at Tokyo Game Show next month, too,”</strong> he said.</p>



<p>The Gamescom Opening Night Live appearance was then <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1955252938232021272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed by Geoff Keighley</a>.</p>



<p>Aside from the appearance at Gamescom, Dusk Golem also gave a bit more details on what players can expect from the game. Specifically, the role that Leon will have.</p>



<p><strong>“As far as I know, part of RE9’s whole “Long Awaited Endings &amp; New Beginnings” stuff is supposed be Leon’s last major role in the timeline (sure he’ll still pop up in CG movies &amp; earlier timeline stuff), so you got that to look forward to with Resident Evil Requiem then,”</strong> <a href="https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955309595418890576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said.</a></p>



<p>Gamescom Opening Night Live takes place on <strong>August 19 at 11am PT / 2pm ET / 7pm BST / 8pm CEST</strong>. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of everything Gamescom LIVE from Cologne, Germany.</p>



<p>During his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-returns-to-survival-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-off preview of the game</a> back in June, Insider Gaming’s Albert Perkins said that, <strong>“I could feel my shoulders tensing up as she peeked around the corner of each room and made her way down the dark, narrow hallway. And I mean – DARK to the point that the darkness nearly swallowed her into the abyss. Capcom does survival horror right, and this game will do its job of scaring the hell out of you early and often, I guarantee it.”</strong></p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is scheduled to release on February 27, 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. </p>



<p>What do you think the story holds in Resident Evil Requiem for Leon, and what are you hoping to see at Opening Night Live from the game? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

Coming hot off the heels of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d136e86e-6c14-4268-bc58-bad86cb9452c" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/discussing-magic-gathering-x-final-fantasy-with-daniel-holt-game-design-lead-for" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a>, Avatar: The Last Airbender is another fan favorite IP to get the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> treatment, most excitedly, this first look also explained how the different types of bending work as game mechanics.</p>

<h2><em>MTG Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> Set Details</h2>

<p><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> is coming to <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> on November 21st, 2025. It will contain cards that reference events throughout the original Avatar series following Aang, the last airbender on his journey to develop his powers to live up to the name of Avatar and stop the Fire Nation's assault against the world.</p>

<p>There are cards here for the casual fans, all the way down to those who will get a chuckle out of that one guy who got so excited to see the Avatar he began to foam at the mouth…</p>

</ul><h2><em>MTG Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> Legal</h2>

<p>It was outlined that all of the cards that have the <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> set code of TLA will be legal in all formats, and those with TLE will be commander, legacy, and vintage legal. In addition, any individual TLE cards are legal where already available in other formats.</p>

<h2>Bending Mechanics | <em>MTG x ATLA</em></h2>

<p>A unique aspect of the story of <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> is in the bending mechanics, where characters can be born with the ability to manipulate Water, Earth, Air, and Fire. These mechanics are coming to <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> with card abilities that invoke bending those elements.</p>

<h3><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Waterbending</h3>

<p>Waterbending allows you to set a base power and toughness across your field. In <em>Katara, Water Tribe's Hope,</em> we see that by using Waterbending Katara can "allow for creatures you control to have a base power and toughness X/X until end of turn."</p>

<p>With a strong amount of mana on your bench this could allow you to take normally weak creatures and buff them to deal big damage all at once. The ability also mentions "you can tap your artifacts and creatures to help. Each one pays for 1 mana."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mtg-avatar-preview-waterbending-and-earthbending.jpg?itok=yIzo9-X1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mtg-avatar-preview-waterbending-and-earthbending.jpg?itok=PQU0AWP6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h3><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Earthbending</h3>

<p>Earthbending lets you turn your lands into land creatures for as long as they survive. Much like an Earthbender, like <em>Toph, the First Metalbender</em> was able to hurl rocks you can activate Earthbending to turn your land into a 0/0 creature and add two +1/+1 tokens to it.</p>

<p>Thematically, this makes sense, and there couldn't have been any other way to adapt this ability to the mechanics of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. Additionally, if that land dies or is exiled it just goes back to being a land.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Airbending</h3>

<p>Airbending is interesting in that it pays very close attention to the pacifist nature of the Airbenders in that it "helps you control the board without getting violent."</p>

<p>Our example of Airbending is <em>Appa, Steadfast Guardian</em>. On entry you can airbend any of your non-land permanents by exiling them. To bring them back you pay 2 mana and when you cast a spell in this way Appa, Steadfast Guardian allows you to create a 1/1 white Ally creature token.</p>

<p>Definitely a more complex mechanic, forcing you to take things off the board and bring them back to bolster up your defences.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mtg-avatar-preview-airbending-and-firebending.jpg?itok=3BhoKTC2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mtg-avatar-preview-airbending-and-firebending.jpg?itok=eWcyAna4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h3><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Firebending</h3>

<p>Firebending is all about aggression and giving yourself a number of additional fire mana for use in Combat. <em>Fire Lord Zuko</em> lets him create X fire mana representative of his current power, while <em>Fire Lord Sozen</em> creates a standard 3.</p>

<p>This red mana is only around for as long as combat, but with Enchantment's like <em>Fated Firepower,</em> you can immediately capitalize on it.</p>

<h2>Special Card Treatments</h2>

<p>It wouldn't be a new Magic The Gathering set without some unique art treatments. Some specific artwork that was called out includes the Borderless Raised Foil <em>Avatar Aang</em> with art by series creator, Bryan Konietzko. There will also be Borderless Double-Faced Sagas like <em>The Rise of Sozen</em>, Borderless Field Notes like <em>Momo, Friendly Flyer</em>, Elemental Frame Cards like <em>Redirect Lightning </em>and <em>Katara, Water Tribe's Hope</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mtg-avatar-preview-additional-cards.jpg?itok=OLBz1qi6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mtg-avatar-preview-additional-cards.jpg?itok=U9o9avq6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For those who enjoy collecting a variety of different and unique lands from across the different sets there will also be a series of full-art Appa basic lands. These will depict "various moments during Aang's journey."</p>

<p>The next Minecraft Live date has been revealed, and it seems to have happened a bit earlier than planned. </p>



<p>In an FAQ section on the studio’s Spanish website, Mojang has confirmed that the next Minecraft Live event will take place on September 22 at 1pm ET.  As for publishing, the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/es-es/live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spanish site remains</a> but the English version of the site still lists March’s date.</p>



<p>It had been indexed on Google for a short time, as well, but that was removed.</p>



<p>The last Minecraft Live event took place back on March 22. That showcase featured a look at the Minecraft Movie ahead of its launch, game drops, a look at the game’s Vibrant Visuals update, and more. You can catch up on all that via the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-live-2025-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official recap</a>. </p>



<p>Neither Microsoft nor Mojang have confirmed the next Minecraft Live date. However, with it appearing on official websites, it appears to be only a matter of time before it’s made official.</p>



<p>What are you hoping to see announced at the next Minecraft Live in September? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

<p>He added: "We try not to pump expectations. Rockstar's whole stock and trade is to have these extraordinary expectations and still beat them. I know that's their goal. I know it's going to be an amazing game."</p><p>Zelnick has previously said Rockstar is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-aiming-for-perfection-take-two-says/1100-6520948/" data-ref-id="1100-6520948">seeking "perfection" with GTA 6, and that takes time. </a>More recently, Zelnick said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-boss-on-upcoming-launch-we-run-scared/1100-6533834/" data-ref-id="1100-6533834">he's not going to claim success before it occurs</a>, even if all the signs are pointing to GTA 6 become a smash hit.</p><p>"While I couldn't be more optimistic than I am, all of us have to do the work. We have to deliver something great to consumers and then the consumers are going to tell us just how great it is," he said.</p><p>GTA 6 was originally slated to arrive in Fall 2025 before Rockstar delayed the game to May 2026 to give the team more time to polish and refine it.

Cards like <a href="https://zdcs.link/985ZYw?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Raging Bolt ex</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QP8wRO?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iron Crown ex</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aebk66?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walking Wake ex</a> were once among the most sought-after pulls from the set, but all three have dropped from their spring peaks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raging Bolt ex is down <strong>11%</strong> from its May value of <strong>$82.36</strong> and now trades around <strong>$73.45</strong>, while Iron Crown ex has fallen <strong>13%</strong> in the same timeframe, moving from <strong>$55.74</strong> to <strong>$48.30</strong>. Walking Wake ex has taken the hardest hit of the trio, losing <strong>20%</strong> since May, with its price sliding from <strong>$50.37</strong> to <strong>$40.45</strong>. This downturn mirrors a wider cooling in the set’s high-end singles as both players and collectors reassess their priorities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Twilight Masquerade has seen a more mixed picture, with some cards losing steam while others continue to gain. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8jGO?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perrin</a> has eased down <strong>11%</strong> from March, moving from <strong>$106.43</strong> to <strong>$94.87</strong>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbbBer?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carmine</a> has dipped the same percentage since June, going from <strong>$78.70</strong> to <strong>$69.99</strong>. Both are Special Illustration Rare Supporters that enjoyed early interest thanks to their unique effects, but neither has become a fixture in competitive lists, leading to softer demand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, the set’s Illustration Rares and certain Pokémon ex cards are climbing in value as interest from both casual and competitive buyers grows.<a href="https://zdcs.link/92xnkW?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gastly</a> has risen <strong>13%</strong> since June, from <strong>$35.74</strong> to <strong>$40.99</strong>, helped by its role in Gengar evolution lines and appealing artwork. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpYV2?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greninja ex</a> has climbed <strong>17%</strong> since January, from <strong>$18.44</strong> to <strong>$21.59</strong>, thanks to its versatile attacks and solid HP. <a href="https://zdcs.link/z62r5R?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sinistcha ex</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3G0Pw?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tatsugiri</a> have each moved up <strong>10%</strong> since April, now priced at <strong>$21.59</strong> and <strong>$18.48</strong> respectively, while <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKg3xB?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eevee</a> has gained <strong>10%</strong> from early August to reach <strong>$21.59</strong>. These changes highlight how certain cards can gain value steadily over months due to competitive experimentation, collector interest, or them just being stunning cards. Let's break this all down:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/pixel-9-5-1754923308215.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For cards that saw heavy demand early on, the market has cooled. Some have slipped due to a lack of tournament use, others because collectors have shifted their focus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/985ZYw?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Raging Bolt ex</a> brings explosive plays with Bursting Roar to refill your hand and Climactic Descent to convert discarded Basic Energy into heavy damage. It looked set to become a staple in certain builds, but the high retreat cost and inconsistent setup have made it less reliable in practice. As competitive players experiment with more stable options, extra copies have been hitting the market. The Special Illustration Rare artwork still turns heads in a binder, but with demand slowing, Its price has slipped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QP8wRO?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iron Crown ex</a> offers useful bench support in Future decks through Cobalt Command, adding damage to your other Future Pokémon’s attacks. Twin Shotels provides a reliable way to apply pressure across the board, bypassing common defenses. Despite this, it has not found a consistent place in top tournament lists, and collector buying has eased off. Without strong competitive results to keep attention high, the price has edged down since May.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aebk66?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walking Wake ex</a> debuted with plenty of buzz thanks to Azure Wave, which ignores effects on the opponent’s Active Pokémon, and Cathartic Roar, which can hit 240 damage under the right conditions. The trick has been making those conditions happen consistently. Decks built around it have seen mixed success, and without the sustained performance to keep it in the spotlight, its Special Illustration Rare price has fallen noticeably from its early high.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8jGO?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perrin</a> gives players the option to cycle Pokémon from hand into the deck and fetch an equal number in return. It can be a valuable setup tool in certain builds, but it faces competition from other Supporters that fit more universally into current decks such as PRofessors Research. Collectors still appreciate the detailed Special Illustration Rare art, yet its price has eased back since March as demand from both has softened.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QbbBer?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carmine</a> is one of the few cards that can be used on the very first turn when going first, letting you discard your hand and draw five cards. It can enable quick starts, but the narrow conditions for use mean it often sits unused. As the metagame evolves, it's not become a fixture in competitive decks, and its Special Illustration Rare has seen its value slip since June. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/pixel-9-6-1754923437758.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Not every card is moving down. Loads of Twilight Masquerade singles have been gradually climbing in value over months, thanks to a mix of playability, collector interest, and unique artwork.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3G0Pw?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tatsugiri</a> is a small but effective utility card for certain strategies. Attract Customers can pull a Supporter from the top six cards of your deck if it is in the Active Spot, offering a low-maintenance way to find key cards. Its single retreat cost and light-hearted Illustration Rare artwork make it a popular pick for collectors as well. Since April, that mix of function and style has helped it hold steady gains.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z62r5R?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sinistcha ex</a> benefits from Re-Brew, an attack that spreads damage based on the Grass Energy in your discard before shuffling it back into your deck. Matcha Splash offers reliable damage while healing your team, which can matter in longer matches. As Grass-focused decks see more experimentation, this Special Illustration Rare has moved upward in value since April.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QKg3xB?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eevee</a> is always in demand among collectors, and the Twilight Masquerade Illustration Rare shows a group of them cuddled up on a comphy chair. Ascension allows it to evolve quickly, which can be useful in certain setups, though its main draw is its place in the franchise’s history. Since early August, interest has pushed the price up slightly. I expect this card go carry on growing in value indefinately, albiet in small increments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpYV2?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greninja ex</a> offers strong offensive options in Shinobi Blade and Mirage Barrage, the latter being able to hit two targets at once. That combination of damage output and flexibility makes it appealing for a variety of decks. The stunning Special Illustration Rare artwork and Greninja fighting for the starter Pokémon top spot with Charizard adds collector appeal, and trainers are willing to pay a premium to get their hands on one of the most valuable Pokémon cards in the Scarlet and Violet era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gastly combines a distinctive Illustration Rare design, showing and also evolving into competitive Gengar deck builds. Mysterious Beam offers potential energy disruption, and Suffocating Gas gives cheap damage when needed. Its appeal has been as much about binder displays as tournament tables, and since June it has been steadily rising in value.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Last Week's Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week’s Pokémon TCG market update saw Paldean Fates and Hidden Fates dominating the spotlight, with several Special Illustration Rares and Shiny Vault classics making notable moves.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> was one of the biggest games of 2023, and naturally, Wizards of the Coast wants to follow it up with a sequel. We already know that the developer behind Baldur's Gate 3, Larian Studios, is moving on to a new, unrelated project, and Wizards of the Coast has confirmed that the new studio being led by former Respawn Entertainment game director Stig Asmussen--Giant Skull--won't be working on it either. Instead, players can expect something more action-packed from the newly established studio.</p><p>"Baldur’s Gate is an incredible game," Wizards of the Coast president John Hight said to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/wizards-of-the-coast-will-bet-on" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "And of course, we're going to do a successor. This is not the successor to that game. We go to Stig and his team to tell an incredible story and bring Dungeons &amp; Dragons to a very broad audience. Ideally, the game will appeal to Dungeons &amp; Dragons players because it will help them realize their imagination. But it’s also going to hopefully appeal to people that love playing action games, that love the Jedi games, that love God of War games."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Baldur’s Gate 3: The Final Patch - An Animated Short</p>
      </div>
<p>Wizards of the Coast isn't in a big rush to get Baldur's Gate 4 out-- its parent company Hasbro is planning a number of other Dungeons &amp; Dragons games set to launch over the next five years--and several potential partners are being courted for the unenviable task of following in Larian's footsteps. "We're going to take our time and find the right partner, the right approach, and the right product that could represent the future of Baldur's Gate," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/">Hasbro's Eugene Evans said last year</a>.</p><p>As for Larian, it doesn't sound like the studio will be returning to Dungeons &amp; Dragons for its next game. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/">Speaking to GameSpot at GDC 2024</a>, Larian CEO Swen Vincke said that the studio did consider making Baldur's Gate 4, but the developer decided that it didn't want to "rehash" what it has already done. Recently, Vincke teased that the studio's next major game--codenamed "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-next-game-is-codenamed-excalibur-no-idea-what-it-is-yet/1100-6523807/">Excalibur</a>"--is years away, but it'll be "plenty of fun."</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://vrgamesshowcase.com/">VR</a> <a href="https://vrgamesshowcase.com/">Games Showcase</a> is an event usually reserved for announcing new games or updates on current VR games. It's one of the few digital showcases in a year that VR enthusiasts should pay attention to in order to find out what's on the docket for VR games on PCVR, Meta Quest, and a few PlayStation VR2 games as well. Today's show however, included its very first mod, as a VR mod for popular shooter Ready or Not was revealed.</p>



<p>Ready or Not is a new tactical first-person shooter from VOID Interactive that initially launched on PC in December 2023. In less than two years following that launch, it had <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-surpasses-9-million-copies-sold-ahead-of-its-console-launch-this-summer/">sold 9 million copies on PC</a>, a milestone reached a little less than three months before it arrived on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, where it went on to sell another <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-hits-2-million-copies-sold-console/">2 million copies</a> just two weeks after its July 15, 2025, arrival on consoles.</p>



<p>It's unusual, to say the least, for a mod announcement to be part of a showcase like the VR Games Showcase, which also noted that this VR mod was the first time the presentation had featured a mod, but given the current popularity of Ready or Not, the mod's inclusion does make sense.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ready or Not VR Mod Annoucement Trailer | VR Games Showcase 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yt0G1J9Dcug?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The mod is being made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@VirtualRealityOasis">Virtual Reality Oasis YouTuber Mike Cussell</a>, who is also a co-founder of a VR influencer marketing and game testing company, <a href="https://www.xrgamelabs.com/">XR Game Labs</a>. Cussell isn't alone in the project however, as he's developing it with modder KITT to bring the tactical gameplay of Ready or Not to life in VR.</p>



<p>When the mod is ready, it'll be available to everyone who owns the base game for free, and according to Cussell, it'll be ready "<em>soon</em>," though no actual release date or release window was confirmed. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There's also currently no indication that Cussell and KITT could work with VOID Interactive to help bring the game to VR for PlayStation players, though if the mod proves popular with PC players, it could potentially be something VOID Interactive looks into for the future. Until then, PlayStation VR2 owners are better off buying that adaptor to plug their headset into their PC and hope for the best when the mod arrives.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3-mod-%E2%80%98versus-mode%E2%80%99-is-the-closest-thing-there-is-to-a-game-master-mode.1268265/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur's Gate 3</a> is a better game than Larian's previous title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/divinity-original-sin-2-new-divine-born/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, in almost every regard, with one notable exception: the former game's lack of a Game Master mode. Divinity: Original Sin 2, on the other hand, allowed Game Masters (or Dungeon Masters, as they are usually called in tabletop RPGs) to recreate the atmosphere of a pen-and-paper game, crafting brand new adventures and quests where other players, the so-called 'party of heroes', were ultimately at their whims.</p>



<p>It was the closest thing gamers could find to a videogame version of a Dungeons &amp; Dragons session. It would stand to reason that Baldur's Gate 3, a game made on the D&amp;D license, would get that as well, but it did not. Larian Studios CEO and Game Director Swen Vincke explained a few years ago that it would have taken way too much time and effort, and given that Baldur's Gate 3 ended up being a gargantuan game (even larger than Divinity: Original Sin 2), the mode simply never materialized.</p>



<p>However, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did get proper modding tools about a year ago</a>, and now modder 786r786 has uploaded a 'Versus Mode' mod on both <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/17984?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexus Mods</a> and <a href="https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3/m/versus-mode4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mod.io</a>. While not nearly as extensive as the Game Master mode in Larian's previous game, it does allow the host of an online session to gain control of monsters:</p>



<p><em>When an enemy's turn starts, the game gives control to the host player allowing players to fight against each other by controlling enemies. Make sure to click the blue enemy portraits at the start of their turn to actually control them.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>This mod is intended to be used in multiplayer with two or more players.</strong> To use this mod correctly, have the host player spectate the other players until they enter combat at which point the host will be able to control the enemies on their turn.</em></p>



<p>Hopefully, this Versus Mode can be expanded in the future to allow something even closer to the aforementioned Game Master mode featured in Divinity: Original Sin 2.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/game-changer-dropout-sam-reich-interview-season-7-comedy-design-2000617191</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-sam-and-his-crew-design-all-the-devious-game-changer-episodes.1268256/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-changer-deja-vu-video-game-dropout-tv-1851449932"><em>Game Changer&nbsp;</em>has become a popular online TV show</a>, probably because it’s fun to watch such masterfully controlled chaos. The series, which just aired its seventh season finale exclusively on Dropout, is all about forcing comedians to play different, often bizarre games, without any of the contestants being told in advance what the game is, how it works, or how you even win.</p> <p>For example, in a recent episode, three comedians were placed in velcro body suits and then forced to spin a wheel covered in modifiers and rules that they had to apply to their bodies each time they spun the wheel. Stuff like “Always be smiling” or “Be rude.” As the rules piled up, the contestants began to turn on each other, and eventually it all resulted in the game’s host becoming a contestant. It’s weird, hilarious, and unlike anything else on TV. I wanted to learn more about how it all works, so I sat down with <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-changer-dropout-video-game-sam-reich-interview-dimension-20-2000616708">Dropout CEO and <em>Game Changer</em> host Sam Reich</a> to talk about how he and his crew design multiple unique, funny, and strange games for their comedians to play each season, and all the work involved. I was shocked to learn that for most of <em>Game Changer</em>‘s run, they’ve avoided playtesting and just hoped things would work out on the day.</p>  <p>“Yeah, people, I think, would be scandalized to know that [season seven is the first time] we did any game testing,” said Sam Reich during our Zoom interview. He laughed about it and explained that there were some exceptions, like an escape room episode in 2023, but for the most part, they historically haven’t done much playtesting at all, at least before the most recent season.</p>

 <p>So if the show has mostly avoided playtesting, I asked Reich how they knew a game or an episode idea was ready for production, and once again I was surprised by how wild <em>Game Changer</em>‘s production is. Reich told me, “I think there’s probably a few different answers to that question. One is we don’t. <span>And we do it anyway.” We both laughed at the response.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>“The second [answer] is that, particularly in earlier seasons of <em>Game Changer,</em> a lot of our games were loosely inspired by games that already exist, whether they’re improv games or other games. There’s a lot of ‘this-meets-that’ going on. And in that sense, we kind of know something like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EbvU8OZtqI">Like My Coffee</a> is going to work, because it’s based on a popular improv game that we’re just doing our spin on.”</p> <p><span>“The reason why game testing becomes more relevant now as the seasons climb up is because, by virtue of the show going on and by virtue of us backing ourselves into a corner where originality is more and more hard to come by, we can’t afford to be derivative anymore. Like we have to be more inventive,” explained Reich.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Sam Says | Game Changer [Full Episode]" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vT-zZsjwZKk?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Another common problem that Reich and his team of talented writers and creators run into when coming up with ideas for new <em>Game Changer</em> episodes is making sure an idea is funny for more than a minute and has places to go throughout a full episode. A common pitch involves having the host and others speak in a foreign or gibberish language the comedians have to figure out. But while that sounds funny, Reich says it really has nowhere to go. The same is true of episode pitches built around lots of tiny games that aren’t connected thematically, including a pitch for a <em>Conclave</em>-like episode to replace Sam Reich with someone else.</p> <p><span>[The <em>Conclave</em> idea] becomes a kind of ‘who can be the best game show host?’ competition,” explained Reich. “But, the games don’t relate to each other enough…there’s no sort of journey of competence or discovery there. This gets into game design wonkiness. I’m really big on game design and it’s rare these days…that I’ll get excited about a game that feels like it’s just a series of mini games.”</span></p>

 <h2>How Dropout’s Sam Reich became a game designer</h2> <p>Reich’s thinking on this has come a long way since he started <em>Game Changer</em> back in 2019. As he told me when I asked if he realized he was going to have to become a full-time game designer to create a show like <em>Game Changer</em>:</p> <p><span>“I loved games, but I wouldn’t say that I loved games, like, more than the average person. I wasn’t a big board gamer,” said Reich. “</span><span>I’d probably done three escape rooms in my life. And thank God, because I think if I had been–if I had started <em>Game Changer</em> as the game designer I am today, I would have had far less room to grow into the show. Like in a way, I think my competence as a game designer has sort of grown as the show has grown and the budget has grown. </span><span>So if you start <em>Game Changer</em> from the beginning, you can kind of watch my journey as a game designer, which I think is fun.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>Reich admitted to me that before starting <em>Game Changer</em>, he didn’t really know what the term “Balanced” meant in game design terms. Now, he consults often with table top, video game, and escape room designers as well as comedians to create the odd beast that is <em>Game Changer.</em> And while a lot of game design goes into the show, especially in its more recent seasons, it’s still a comedy series and the audience comes first, over rules, balance, or anything else.</p> <p><span>“Ultimately, I will break any rule in service of the audience or in service of entertainment,” said Reich. “It’s like, even if this isn’t a very well-balanced game, or even if it is a little clunky or whatever it is, we’ll plow forward with it if we think it’s going to be very entertaining. We’ve totally taken out clunky moments [in post-production].”</span></p>

 <h2><em>Game Changer</em> is falling apart, in a good way</h2> <p>And that clunky, sometimes messy, often chaotic nature of <em>Game Changer</em> is, according to Sam, one of the reasons it has connected with such a large audience. <span>“I would almost equate it to, like, <em>Saturday Night Live</em> in a way where it’s like, the fact that it’s live will always make it feel a little dangerous,” said Reich. “And that’s part of the fun.”</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Sam Stole Jacob's Blood For a Trivia Question 🩸" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tpwgC1Y2NDs?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>“There is sort of an excitement to every episode of <em>Game Changer</em>, which is like the excitement of: Is this even going to work? And I think that some games sort of require that more than others,” said Reich. “</span><span>Look, at the end of the day, we’re making a show and production schedules are what they are. And <em>Game Changer</em> always feels like a trust fall by the time we’re on the shoot day. [During the episode] Beat The Buzzer, I swear to you, five of those buzzers weren’t working in dress rehearsal. </span><span>We’re hanging on for dear life to this show,” explained Reich with a chuckle and a big smile.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>He did admit that he expects future episodes and seasons will feature a lot more playtesting as ideas get bigger and games get more complicated. But he also explained that he wants <em>Game Changer</em> to avoid the “sterile” and sometimes boring feel of popular big-budget game shows that have been on the air for decades, adding: </span><span>&nbsp;“In a way our show feels sort of like, um, it’s always falling apart a little bit. Just a little bit, which is a part of the fun, you know?” So don’t worry that future seasons of the hit series will playtest the life out of everything and make sure the game is perfectly balanced. There will still be plenty of chaos in the future.<br> </span></p> <p><a href="https://www.dropout.tv/game-changer"><em>Game Changer</em>‘s season seven finale is now live on Dropout</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/subnautica-2-publisher-says-it-fired-cofounders-to-avoid-another-kerbal-space-program-2-debacle.1268253/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101"><em>Subnautica 2</em> publisher Krafton</a> has filed its answer to a complaint by Unknown Worlds cofounders alleging breach of contract. It accuses Charles Cleveland, Adam “Max” McGuire, and Edward “Ted” Gill of prioritizing a $250 million payout over the successful launch of the second-most-wishlisted game on Steam. The company said the veteran developers were fired “to prevent {them] from permanently damaging Unknown Worlds’ most valuable IP, the company itself, and its goodwill with its fans.”</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-unknown-worlds-delay-1851786439">In a lawsuit filed last month</a>, the cofounders claimed Krafton tried to sabotage <em>Subnautica 2</em>‘s planned Early Access launch this year to avoid paying a $250 million bonus it had agreed to at the time Unknown Worlds was sold if the studio hit certain revenue targets in 2025 and early 2026. The legal complaint alleged that Krafton violated the terms of the deal by overriding the studio’s independence and firing the cofounders without cause.</p> <p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/900707287/Defendant-s-Answer-to-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=ha0mUjTuK1JQkOU4QaYn">In its response filed on August 12</a>, Krafton denies most of the allegations in the original complaint and argues that it was the cofounders who were trying to rush <em>Subnautica 2</em> out into the wild despite being behind on its expected content scope. When the company tried to enlist the cofounders, who were not directly involved in the game’s development, to get it back on track, it says it was rebuffed. Krafton claims it had no choice but to remove them from the studio in order to protect <em>Subnautica 2</em> and prevent a disastrous launch.</p>

 <p>According to Krafton’s response, a development director at Unknown Worlds told Gill in 2023 that “folks think…Max and Charlie are checked out as studio heads and are confused as to why.” It accuses the cofounders of being more involved in passion projects than in getting<em> Subnautica 2</em>—which suffered delays throughout 2024—ready to ship.</p> <p>“Krafton was not willing to take the risk of the resulting damage to the <em>Subnautica</em> franchise and the Company’s long-term reputation–a risk that, if materialized, would be irreversible, as shown with <a href="https://kotaku.com/olliolli-world-rollerdrome-kerbal-space-program-2-1851450223"><em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em></a>,” the filing reads. “As Unknown Worlds’ sole stockholder, Krafton had invested $500 million in the success of not only <em>Subnautica 2</em>, but also <em>Subnautica 3</em>, <em>Subnautica 4</em>, and any other future<em> Subnautica</em> franchise product.”</p> <p><em>Subnautica 2</em> is currently scheduled to arrive sometime in 2026 and Krafton has promised bonus payouts to the remaining staff at Unknown Worlds despite the delay. Many fans on the subreddit, initially incensed by the sudden upheaval at the studio, have sounded increasingly burnt out on the back-and-forth volleys of accusations. At the rate at which most legal battles unfold, they’ll likely be playing the sequel long before the $250 million dispute is settled.</p> <p>“We believe the facts speak for themselves,” Krafton wrote in a statement today. “This answer reflects our commitment to protecting both the<em> Subnautica</em> IP and the global community that has supported it for years.”</p>

When enabled, developers can integrate payments, allow in-game purchases, and create custom storefronts without the tie-in from closed platforms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Xsolla, users will be able to retain more revenue while maintaining full ownership of the checkout process, as well as player data and monetization strategy. The drop-in integration with Unity allows users to seamlessly integrate payments, web shops, and other direct-to-consumer solutions into Unity projects, with support across iOS, Android, PC, and web.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On mobile, for example, Unity iOS games allow for external link-outs via the Xsolla Buy Button for in-app purchases in the U.S. Meanwhile, the SDK allows for distributing Unity games in Europe via notarization, marketplaces, and side-loading, while enabling alternative billing. As per Android, the SDK allows distribution of Unity-built APKs globally through side-loading, and supports user choice billing (UCB and non-UCB) across Europe, India, and South Korea.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Unity developers are pushing creative boundaries every day, and they deserve the same freedom when it comes to monetization," said Chris Hewish, president, communication and strategy at Xsolla, in the announcement. "Our new SDK helps developers reach players directly, keep more revenue, and operate on their terms without giving up flexibility or global reach."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-microsoft-has-no-place-being-accomplice-of-a-genocide-arkane-union-workers-demand-microsoft-cut-ties-with-israeli-regime" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Microsoft has no place being accomplice of a genocide:' Arkane union workers demand Xbox maker sever ties with Israel</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Xsolla continues to push its direct-to-consumer strategy">Xsolla continues to push its direct-to-consumer strategy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In October of last year, Hewish, alongside senior VP of EMEA Chris Meredith, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/it-sure-seems-like-xsolla-wants-to-take-a-bite-out-platform-cuts-from-steam-other-platform-owners">spoke at length against</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> "gatekeepers," noting that it's an "awfully congested market" for developers. Without mentioning any specific examples or storefronts, the pair spoke about the idea of "democratizing the business of gaming" by allowing devs to sell digitally to players directly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For us, with the relationship with the advertisers bringing their products to market, we are very much aware of trying to put them on the track of the [direct-to-consumer] roadmap, and if you're a small three man developer, that's quite challenging," Meredith said at the time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Two months prior to the interview, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/lawsuits-allege-ceo-of-payment-processor-xsolla-misused-company-funds">a report surfaced</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that six former executives had filed lawsuits against CEO Aleksandr "Shurick" Agapitov since 2019, with two of the lawsuits voicing concerns about the company's financial practices or how Agapitov reportedly used cash from the platform. One allegation claimed he transferred $120 million in company money to his personal accounts between 2021 and 2023. Xsolla's president, chief business officer David Stelzer, dismissed the report's claims and called the documents "inaccurate," adding that the company manages its financial affairs "responsibly and in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/fortnite-and-epic-games-store-heading-to-ios-in-australia-following-federal-court-ruling" target="_self" data-discover="true">Fortnite and Epic Games Store heading to iOS in Australia following Federal Court ruling</a></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.
