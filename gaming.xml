						<h5>ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X</h5><p><span>October 16, 2025</span>
					</p></div></div>			
			<p>Before I sat down in front of a television set with a controller in my hand to play a video game, I played games inches away from my face while squeezing my Game Boy for hours on end. There's many a childhood photo of me with my face buried in a handheld device, with a personal favourite being one where I'm deep into my Game Boy Advance SP on a beach. Those handheld beginnings and the handheld-focused gaming upbringing I had make me, in theory, one of the many who would get a lot of use out of a device like the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>That is why I was honestly surprised to be so repulsed by the device when I finally had it in hand earlier this month. That repulsion died a bit before I spent some time checking out the new Xbox-branded ASUS ROG Ally at <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-talks-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-the-way-forward-for-us/">an afternoon event in my hometown of Toronto since</a>, by that point, I had spent a week with the device. ASUS generously sent it over for this review, and I have now spent three weeks with it at the time of this publishing.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Full disclosure, I don't own a PC handheld myself - I've kept an eye on the Steam Deck, the ASUS ROG Ally and others like them, but beyond the fact that there are more important things than gaming hardware to spend money on at the moment, I flat out do not need one. I have a laptop and a desktop that get me by just fine, a PS5, an Xbox Series X, and a Nintendo Switch covering whatever games I may need or want to play. For myself, I can't justify the cost of any of them, let alone the newest and one of the most expensive ones on the market.</p>



<p>That's why getting to spend some serious time with one of these devices has been eye-opening. I have started to understand the appeal beyond the shallow level myself, and any other enthusiast is capable of seeing just from reading and hearing about these devices. It's simply an impressive thing to walk around with a device in my hands, playing games that I would have just a few short years ago never anticipated being playable in a handheld form factor. </p>



<p>Sure, it's old hat for the small millions of people who've already had their Steam Deck or ROG Ally or Lenovo devices for a couple of years now, but I'll admit that despite my initial distaste (which I'll explain), this is a truly impressive and, surely for some, a worthwhile device to own. I don't know who that person is, though, and even if you have $999 USD (or $1299 CAD) burning a hole in your pocket that can only be spent on video games and gaming-related things, I'd still caution you from picking one up yourself.</p>

<h3 id="h-initial-impressions">Initial Impressions</h3>

</p></figure>



<p>Let me begin by addressing why I was repulsed by the device at first. On a superficial level, right out of the box, I just don't think it looks that nice. I wouldn't go far enough to call it ugly, but it's not the slickest device out there. Maybe it's something about the controller-style grips on either side, but when looking at it head-on, it struggles to shake the 'controller they slapped a screen in the middle of' allegations.</p>



<p>To their credit, the controller grips on either side make holding the 715g device comfortable for any extended period, which you will almost certainly be doing thanks to an impressive battery life, even when playing on its Turbo 25w setting.</p>



<p>Backing up a bit to when I took it out of the box, inside you get a 65Wh charger to keep the Xbox Ally X fully charged and ready to go (it also boosts to a 35w Turbo-Turbo mode when plugged in), your bog standard manuals and warranty card, and a little cardboard stand stuck to the top of the box on the inside. After taking off the plastic covering the device, I had my initial repulsion, as we discussed, and I started getting it set up, which took far longer than it would have compared to anyone who just picks one up themselves.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>I had to do several pre-release updates and follow a guide specifically because the unit I got didn't come with all the prepared day-one updates. Of course, you won't have to do that, but right away, even with an Xbox button on the side, it was clear that this is definitely not an Xbox.</p>



<p>It loads into the Xbox PC app, specifically the new UI refresh that's releasing with this device and its sibling ROG Xbox Ally, and will also be coming to the original ROG Ally and ROG Ally X devices as an update, and that certainly helps it feel like an Xbox and achieve the console-like experience it's going for. I also have to shoutout the fingerprint reader on the power button, which makes jumping back into the device extremely simple.</p>



<p>The buttons on the back are satisfyingly clicky, and the thumbsticks are comfortably placed. The ABXY buttons have a stickiness to them that I'm not a huge fan of, but it's not too jarring. The triggers have a smooth pull, and the D-Pad, I'm very happy to say, as someone who loves platformers, works really well for even the more intense platforming titles like Celeste. Which is probably the game I've been playing on this the most in my time with it, both because it's an excellent game and because the D-Pad is great to use.</p>


<figure>

<figure><figcaption><em>I've been having a blast playing Celeste again on the ROG Xbox Ally X - but I'd also be having a blast playing it again on my Nintendo Switch. </em></figcaption></figure>

</figure>



<p>What I do not like about the layout, however, are the buttons on the top corners of the device on each side of the screen. There are five of them, two on one side and three on the other. It's at least two too many buttons. Either get rid of the Armoury Crate button, or the Xbox button on the left side. We don't need both, especially since they open the same side menu, and the Library button on top of the Menu button on the right side can go. I pressed it accidentally more than a few times, and once again, it brings me to an Armoury Crate menu I can get to through the Xbox button or the Armoury Crate button.</p>



<p>ASUS also sent over its official 2-in-1 hard-shell carrying case for the device, which does a great job of protecting the ROG Xbox Ally or ROG Xbox Ally X when you're tossing it in your backpack or something. It also comes with a small pouch attached to the back of the case via velcro, so you can easily take the charger with you. It's a simple, solid black case, though the strap that holds the ROG Xbox Ally/Ally X in place does make it a little cumbersome to remove and put back quickly.</p>



<h3 id="h-tech-specs">Tech Specs</h3>

<p>A little overview of the technical specifications, the chart below includes the tech specs for the ASUS ROG Ally, Ally X, Xbox Ally, and Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>The ROG Xbox Ally X is now the new top-end device for the ROG Ally line of handhelds, with its latest Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor, which doesn't add more cores but does seem to add plenty of value in terms of battery efficiency. It has faster memory, but the new processor, memory, improved USB ports, and the new console shape with the controller grips on either side are about where the hardware upgrades stop, compared to the ROG Ally X. Oh, and the addition of an Xbox button, of course.</p>

<h3 id="h-benchmarking-battery-life">Benchmarking/Battery Life</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X houses the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor. Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Beginning with battery life, after an hour of Red Dead Redemption 2 on Turbo mode, the battery was only down to 50%. Only losing half of the battery after starting with a full charge, while pushing the device on Turbo after an hour of playtime, might not sound like the best, but it's not bad in my book considering the fact that I've found I really don't need to be at the Turbo setting all the time to get solid performance out of whatever I'm playing.</p>



<p>When set to the 17w Performance mode, the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X handled just about anything I've thrown at it, and while Turbo is impressive, knowing I can squeeze a significant amount more time out of the device, without having to tone down my playing experience, is one of the ROG Xbox Ally X's biggest features.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Part of that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-talks-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-the-way-forward-for-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as I learned when I spoke to ASUS's Whitson Gordon and Sashca Krohn</a>, comes from the company's focus on ensuring that battery life is a priority, which meant not going with an OLED screen, and not giving up its power-efficient IPS display. As much as I'll always love an OLED display when I can get it, I can't knock the IPS display here. The 7", 1920x1080p, 16:9 IPS display at 500 nits with a 120Hz refresh rate is more than servicable. Would an OLED be nice? Sure. Would it make the device even more expensive and difficult to recommend than I already think it is? Undoubtedly. All that to say, I'm not miffed about the lack of an OLED.</p>



<p>Getting into some of the benchmarking I did, for context, I'm no <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a>. I'm not able to provide analysis on that level, but I can share internal benchmark results from the games I tested that have internal benchmarks. To that end, I tried to test a good mix of games: Forza Horizon 5, DOOM: The Dark Ages, Red Dead Redemption 2, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider.</p>



<p>In all of these games, save one, the common thread was that I could find ways to hit above 30 FPS, or even 60 FPS+, but keeping the frame rate consistent was always an issue. Forza Horizon 5 was the one game where I saw the game hit a consistent, smooth 60 FPS.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Forza Horizon 5 benchmark test on the ROG Xbox Ally X, settings on High.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The built-in VRR helps smooth out the experience, but some games, like DOOM: The Dark Ages, I would just flat out not recommend playing on the ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>


<figure>
<div>

<figure>
<figure><figcaption><em>DOOM: The Dark Ages Reckoning benchmark test at High settings on the ROG Xbox Ally X.</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption><em>Even at Low settings, I was unable to get it to a solid 60 FPS. Also, it looked awful.</em></figcaption></figure>

<div>
				    		
				    		
					    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>My Red Dead Redemption 2 benchmarks were much more promising. I consistently hit 40 FPS on the 17Wh power mode, even with the graphics settings at Ultra. It was only when I switched to the Silent 13Wh power mode that it dropped to 30 FPS.</p>

					    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Shadow of the Tomb Raider was a similar story in that the higher settings would be able to hit around 40 FPS on both the 25Wh and 35Wh Turbo mode and the 17Wh Performance mode, though, of course, it started to falter much more when dropped down to the 13Wh Silent mode. Still, it only dropped to 30 FPS, and if you're like me and you don't balk at something when it hits lower than 60 FPS, the fact that I could play a game like Shadow of the Tomb Raider, even at 30 FPS, on this machine's 13Wh Silent mode is impressive.</p>

					    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Horizon Zero Dawn was, once again, the same story, with closer to 40 FPS on the 17Wh Performance battery mode, and 30 FPS on the 13Wh Silent battery mode. What separates Horizon Zero Dawn from the rest (besides Forza Horizon 5), however, is that you can run the game on its Favour Performance graphics settings, enjoy a slightly higher, closer to 50 FPS frame rate on the 17Wh mode, and it'll still look and feel great.</p>

</figure>



<p>There were other games I played to test them out, like God of War (2018), Elden Ring, Dying Light: The Beast, OlliOlli World, and Hell is Us. Elden Ring, for whatever reason, crashed almost every time I tried playing it. The first time, it was seemingly just because I used the volume buttons on top of the device. Two more times, it was seemingly because I tried to navigate the menu with the LB and RB buttons. Another was just in the middle of gameplay, for no discernible reason.</p>

<p>I also crashed in Dying Light: The Beast, and that one was caused by going outside into Old Town from the Town Hall safe zone. Thankfully, that only happened once, but crashes aren't necessarily the ROG Xbox Ally X's fault.</p>



<h3 id="h-this-is-an-xbox">This Is An Xbox?</h3>



<p>At least to me, it's not. It's a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 and a special Xbox UI that makes it feel and behave more like a console. But it's not a console, and you shouldn't expect to pick one up and have a console experience with it.</p>



<p>You might have a console-like experience, heavy emphasis on 'like,' but it's a PC handheld, and even without having spent a lot of time with the full suite of PC handhelds out there, this definitely feels like one tailored for me, the console player who started seriously playing PC games within the last five years.</p>



<p>Having access to my full Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG library on the go in this form factor is awesome. It's not my full Xbox library, though, which is one reason it's only a 'console-like' experience. When I scroll over to the games that I 'Own' under my Xbox account, I don't see my full library.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Task switching in the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally with the new Xbox UI. Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>I'm not talking about not seeing games I have on physical discs; I'm talking about the original Xbox and Xbox 360 games that are playable on my Xbox Series X but don't appear here. Or any game that I know is available on my Xbox console but, for some reason, isn't on the Xbox PC app. It flat out is not my full Xbox library wherever I want it, and is only games playable through the Xbox PC app and Cloud Gaming.</p>

<p>It's honestly a small element in the grand scheme of it all. I know not everyone is going to be as miffed about this as I am, but it's another straw to add to my pile labeled, 'What am I paying $999 for then?' I also still really don't know who this device is for. If you're so invested in playing games that you'd be spending that kind of money on this device, you probably already have another means of getting your gaming time in. I get that portability is the big thing you're paying for here, but besides the fact that there are cheaper devices you can accomplish that with, your pre-existing PC and console can more than cover your gaming needs.</p>



<p>The price of this handheld is exorbitant; there's no other way to put it. In fairness, an overly expensive Xbox-branded PC handheld <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-founder-game-pass-price-hike-laura-fryer/">aligns perfectly with Microsoft's current Xbox plans</a>. Still, compared to other popular PC handhelds, including ASUS's own ROG Ally products, I'm not sure this is the upgrade to go for.</p>



<p>If you already own a PC gaming handheld, ROG Ally or not, this doesn't seem like enough of an upgrade to drop $999. If you're looking to grab your first PC gaming handheld, you absolutely do not need to jump to the top-end of the price chart to get what you want out of a device like this. Just pick up a case that has grips on either side to match its built-in grips.</p>



<p>Credit where it's due, this is still an impressive piece of technology. I definitely understand why devices like this have become popular, but I don't understand paying that much when you can get comparable experiences, particularly on ASUS's own devices, for less.</p>

				<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X is a powerful, capable, and comfortable PC handheld device, with a smooth user experience thanks to the new Xbox UI. It's really like taking your computer on the go, with all of your PC games in your hands. For its mix of improved hardware, user experience, and battery efficiency, it's arguably the best PC handheld device to buy on the market. It's not an entirely smooth experience though, with plenty of PC gaming hiccups interrupting the 'console-like' experience the device is supposed to provide, the fact that it actually doesn't let you play all your Xbox games, and what I still believe to be an exorbitant price tag, when cheaper devices can provide comparable experiences.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week, I spent an afternoon at the Steam Whistle Brewery in downtown Toronto. A short walk away from the CN Tower, Scotiabank Arena, and the Rogers Centre, I didn't cross the tourists in this bustling hub to play hooky for a beer or two at the downtown brewery. I was there on behalf of Wccftech to spend a little more hands-on time with the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, as well as hear from Whitson Gordon, ASUS's head of content for ROG and senior manager of marketing content, and Sascha Krohn, the global director of technical marketing at ASUS.</p>



<p>By this point, I had already spent a week with the ROG Xbox Ally X for my review of the device, (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which you can find here</a>), but having one at home meant that while I was at the event, I was more interested in seeing what Gordon and Krohn had to say about the device than getting to spend a little more hands-on time with it.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The CN Tower in downtown Toronto, steps away from the Steam Whistle Brewery where ASUS Canada held the ROG Xbox Ally preview event.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>So after they both gave presentations, when I got the chance to sit down with them (or more accurately, stand outside with them while we all stood around a wooden barrel operating as a showtable for some of the laptops ASUS was showing off), I knew I had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-handhelds-asus-rog-ally-x-999-usd-ally-599-usd-pre-orders/">start by asking them about the price</a> of the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>As a reminder, the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally, the lower-spec'd, cheaper version of the new ASUS and Xbox handheld, comes in at $599 USD (or $799 CAD), while the higher spec'd, top-end, more expensive Xbox Ally X costs a whopping $999 USD (or $1299 CAD). For context, you can take home the original ASUS ROG Ally for $499 USD, and the ASUS ROG Ally X for $799. So it's a $100 price increase if you're going from the ASUS ROG Ally to the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally, and a $200 increase if you're going from the ASUS ROG Ally X to the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>ASUS had multiple ROG Xbox Ally devices and accessories for the handhelds on display at the event.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>There are hardware differences between each device, with even the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally getting the next-generation AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor compared to the ASUS ROG Ally X's AMD Ryzen Z1, but these are absolutely not cheap devices. There's a lot you can buy for that kind of money, so I was curious as to how ASUS and Microsoft reached those prices, and if the fact that firms like Circana are reporting that 30% of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">US consumers will spend less on video games and entertainment</a> as the cost of essentials continues to rise is a concern for them when pricing devices like this.</p>



<p>But just before I got into any of that, I had to ask a much simpler question. What is this thing even called? And by that I meant, what do these marketing executives for ASUS call a product with a far too long, and far too confusing name?</p>



<p>"<em>I usually just call it the ROG Xbox Ally X</em>. <em>Or the Xbox Ally X. I try not to call it the Ally X, because then it gets confusing with the ROG Ally X,</em>" Gordon replied. It's a mouthful, I pointed out, and a confusing one at that. Krohn added that from his point of view internally, particularly when speaking with internal engineering teams, he addresses the two variants as the "<em>XA</em>" and the "<em>YA</em>," with the XA representing the ROG Xbox Ally X, and the YA representing the ROG Xbox Ally. He also mentioned that he will sometimes refer to them as their project codenames, which were Omni for the ROG Xbox Ally, and Horeseman for the ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>

<figure><figcaption><em>ASUS had laid out its ROG Ally line of devices, including the new Xbox Ally handhelds, broken down across long table.</em></figcaption></figure>

<figure><figcaption><em>The blue motherboards are for the ROG Xbox Ally devices, and the red for the ROG Ally devices.</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>ASUS even had the molds it made that helped shape the handheld's design during its conception phase.</figcaption></figure>
</figure>

				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>For me, at least, this hastened my resolve that the devices' actual names are atrocious. Even Gordon's answer showed that they're very confusing when compared to ASUS's other products. Especially when you start getting into the weeds of what is and what isn't an Xbox, and the importance of Xbox software and services like Xbox Game Pass to the ROG Xbox Ally line. And speaking of Xbox Game Pass, its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-subscription-cancel-page-overwhelmed-after-game-pass-price-hike/">recent price increase that saw players rush to cancel their subscriptions</a> led me right back to talking about the pricing for the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>"<em>I probably can't give you the detail that you want, because that starts getting into business contracts, and in general, we don't discuss those kinds of things</em>," Gordon began when answering how ASUS and Microsoft reached their pricing for the ROG Xbox Ally handhelds. "<em>Geopolitics</em>," added Krohn. "<em>What I can say,</em>" Gordon continued, "<em>Is that,</em> <em>especially for the ROG Ally series of handhelds, trying to hit a good, affordable price has always been a big priority for us. We have had people ask us in the past, 'Oh, I want this big list of super premium features, can't you just release a $1500 handheld, I would pay for it.'"</em></p>



<p><em>"The reality is, if you're trying to really introduce a new form factor to the gaming world, if you want to really build that volume of people using the device, you've got to hit an affordable price point. And it's one of the reasons we have two SKUs now, is to make sure that we can cover as many of our bases as possible that and as many people can access this new era of handheld gaming</em>."</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The full ASUS ROG Ally and Xbox Ally line laid out, including the screen found in each display and the batteries.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It was at this point that I brought up the aforementioned Circana report, because having two SKUs does at least give people options, but $599 USD still puts the ROG Xbox Ally in the premium range, especially since that's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">right in between the cost of an Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S console.</a> It's also more expensive than a base PS5 and slightly more expensive than the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-oled-announced-reservations/">512GB model of the Steam Deck OLED</a>. The ROG Xbox Ally X, for its part, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lenovo-legion-go-2-handheld-official-amd-ryzen-z2-extreme-1049-usd-price-hands-on/">is $50 off from the Lenovo Legion Go 2</a>, which is due out at the end of this month. Gaming has never been a cheap hobby, but it's arguably more expensive than ever, at a time when everything else seems more expensive than ever. So, where does the cost of living and what people have to pay for fit into pricing discussions?</p>



<p>"<em>That's absolutely always on our minds</em>," Gordon begins. "<em>We know that cost of living is a thing that's on everybody's minds, that's one of the reasons we want to try and hit as affordable a price point as we can. We just know that's an economic reality of the world</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Maybe don't necessarily look at it as a replacement for the devices that we have in the market</em>," Krohn adds. "<em>We already have the ROG Ally and the ROG Ally X in the market right now, and I think this is a trend that you see in recent years with all sorts of devices: phones, laptops, and even graphics cards and CPUs. The new generation that comes out doesn't necessarily replace the previous one, but it adds to the product stack and sits on top of the product stack. That's the new stuff, and the previous generation stuff still sticks around for a little bit. So I think that's one way of looking at it, and I would say it's not necessarily replacing what's on the market right now, it's just adding something to it. And there's still a lot of value in the devices that are on the market right now.</em>"</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>ASUS had also brought all the ROG Xbox Ally accessories to showcase.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>At least as long as those are still on shelves</em>," Gordon interjects. "<em>And that's true with all of our products, you see the same thing happen with laptops, the last generation is always around for people who want to get a good deal on that, until the new generation kind of supplants them, and that cycle continues.</em>"</p>



<p>It was clear to me that Gordon and Krohn wanted to send the message that if you're concerned about the pricing of these new ROG Xbox Ally handhelds, the older generation is always there for you. But it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTAKSBvuT-A&amp;t=13s">wasn't exactly a Don Mattrick moment,</a> because it's not like some of the new features coming to the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X are going to be exclusive to those devices. Namely, the software and UI upgrades that the Xbox Ally devices come with out of the box; those are coming to the ROG Ally and Ally X as updates on the Xbox Ally/Ally X launch day.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>This new Xbox UI is arriving on ROG Ally and ROG Ally X devices as an update when the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X launch. Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>That's precisely why we had the discussion,</em> <em>and ultimately decided, both us and Xbox, to bring the full screen experience, not just to the latest handhelds, but also the existing ones</em>," Krohn said. "<em>So, like I said, it's more like we're viewing this as a complete lineup of ROG Ally handhelds, which starts with the original ROG Ally, and then the ROG Ally X on top, and then you have the ROG Xbox Ally X at the very top, and the ROG Xbox Ally, with the Z2 A, really great battery life and efficiency, somewhat on the side, like between the Ally X and the OG Ally, and we have those different price points, different performance tiers, battery life tiers, so we have four devices in total, and the current generation is absolutely still in play, and super interesting, especially from a price-to-performance perspective.</em>"</p>



<p>So that's the case for now and for the short-term future of these devices, since ASUS is not likely to release a ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X hardware refresh or upgrade within the next year. But what about beyond that? I asked Krohn and Gordon very directly if these new ROG Xbox Ally devices are now their own line of hardware running alongside the ROG Ally line, or if the ROG Xbox Ally is now overtaking the ROG Ally line.</p>



<p>"<em>No, this is the way forward for us. The ROG Xbox Ally is the direction that we're headed with this lineup of products</em>," Gordon said very definitively.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Gordon's statement is definitive that the ROG Xbox Ally is the future of ASUS's ROG handheld line.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>So if these devices are the way forward, and, as Gordon had mentioned several times in his presentation earlier that afternoon, this device is meant to provide a console-like experience and be a way into the PC gaming handheld space for console gamers, I wanted to hear more definitively about who Gordon and Krohn thought this device was for. (I touch on the question of who this handheld is really for more in my review, and why it was important for me to ask this question, which you can go check out now as a reminder.)</p>



<p>"<em>I think it's for PC gamers, Xbox gamers, anyone who wants to play these latest titles that are popular on current-generation platforms, and we're seeing all these platforms sort of start to merge together</em>,<em>" </em>Gordon began. "<em>Sony games coming to PC, Xbox games coming to PlayStation. Overall, the gaming ecosystem</em> <em>is really coming together in a way that we haven't seen in the past, and it's kind of freeing, right? Anyone who wants the best handheld experience on the go, to play all of these games, this is it.</em>"</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>ASUS had also set up two TVs connected to ROG Xbox Ally devices that were connected to ROG XG Mobile GPUs. But at this point, it feels worth pointing out that you might as well build a PC since these eGPUs can cost thousands.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>I would say it's a lot of things for a lot of different people</em>," Krohn added. "<em>It's two different devices that we are launching right now, and they're fairly different in their application, and what their strength is, what they're meant for, and what people find interesting about them, and I would say for anybody who is into PC gaming handhelds, what the ROG Xbox Ally X is: more performance, longer battery life, better erganomics, and much improved user interface." </em></p>



<p>"<em>For an Xbox console user, it is 'Wow, I can now take all my games with me, on the go, and I can even have access to game modding,' which is maybe something they're interested in. And they now have access to different catalogues of games, something like Spider-Man, maybe. So, I think to different people, it has a different appeal.</em>"</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Would this actor be happier if he was looking at an OLED screen? Maybe. Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>One level of appeal that the ROG Xbox Ally devices lack is the inclusion of an OLED screen. And especially after hearing Krohn talk about the new Lumina Pro OLED screens from ASUS, I had to wonder if those screens would find their way inside a future ROG Xbox Ally device.</p>



<p>Gordon stepped up to answer this question, saying, "<em>We know that a lot of people are really interested in getting that kind of display experience on the Ally. There are a few reasons that we haven't done it yet. One of them is, like we talked about earlier, cost, trying to make sure that it stays affordable. Another is power usage."</em></p>



<p>"<em>So, one really interesting thing is, we don't want to give up Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), and for a long time, that was something that was not as easily done on OLEDs and portable devices like this, and the current method for doing that on an OLED screen is more powerful, than what you're getting on this really great IPS display that we have on the Ally."</em></p>



<p>"<em>It looks excellent, and it's very power-efficient, and one of the most important things we have learned over the last two years of building the Ally is that battery life is one of the highest priorities. We don't want to give that up for an OLED screen that doesn't have an optimal solution for VRR. So, it's always on our radar, it's always something that we're testing, but it's just not quite where we want it to be yet for what we think is the best experience.</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>So, it looks like we'll have to wait a little while longer to see a Lumina Pro OLED screen, or any OLED screen for that matter, in an ROG Xbox Ally handheld device. And probably pay at least $1K for it. For now, it seems like the ROG Xbox Ally line will keep Xbox in the hardware business, even if it is ASUS behind the wheel and Microsoft slapping an Xbox logo on top.</p>



<p>Thank you to Whitson Gordon and Sascha Krohn for speaking with me and for being so generous with their time and answers. </p>

              <p>Recording your adventures is a great way to revisit and relive them later, or even share them with the world. But your smartphone camera or traditional options can only take you so far. To get those professional results in all lighting and weather conditions, you might want to consider investing in a DJI action camera, and now is a great time to grab one without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4783/">Amazon has dropped the price of the DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro essential combo to $269, giving you 21% off on one of the best action cameras out there.</a> The deal won’t be around for too long, so we highly recommend getting your orders in sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4783/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stunning Visuals On the Go</h2>
<p>The Action 5 Pro camera comes with all the essential features you need for a minimal yet powerful setup. You’re getting the all-new 1/1.3-inch sensor paired with a 13.5-stop dynamic range for clear images in both bright and dim settings. It shoots 4K video at up to 120fps, and the advanced 4nm chip makes sure the subject stays in focus even during motion in both horizontal (16:9) and vertical (9:16) formats. There’s a built-in color temperature sensor to automatically adjust white balance for lifelike results, as well.</p>
<p>Then you’ve got front and rear ultra-bright OLED touchscreens to capture moments without a lot of fumbling around. You can frame and check your shots on the go within seconds. And for when you don’t want to bother with buttons, there’s voice support with always-on recognition to control the camera hands-free within a one-meter range. The camera also plays nicely with the DJI Mic 2 and Mic Mini, so you will also enjoy crisp, clear audio without needing a separate receiver.</p>



<p>The built-in 1950mAh battery can last up to 4 hours on a full charge, while a quick 15-minute top-up can get you an additional 2 hours of filming. Plus, the camera is IP68-rated waterproof up to 20 meters, and can even handle extreme cold (as low as -20 degrees) quite well.</p>
<p>All things considered, this action camera can be a great investment for all the outdoor enthusiasts looking to film their adventures in the wild. You’re not just getting a solid visual quality but also a reliable battery life, handy touchscreens, easy controls, and much more. Grab it for less while it’s still discounted.</p>

<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A continues on the modern trend of Pokémon titles with a huge amount of character customization options, which we’ve explained in full in this guide.</p>



<p>The first big Pokémon launch on Nintendo Switch 2, though it also remains available on the original console, Legends: Z-A follows on from the success of Legends: Arceus and makes a big change to battle mechanics.</p>



<p>There’s also a huge amount of character customization options in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which we’ve broken down in this guide, including covering details on any gender-locked options.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Lots to consider. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</strong> <strong>has a wide array of character customization options, giving you control over your full look and physical features, alongside a host of fashion choices.</strong></p>



<p>Initial character customization in the game covers the general set-up, including choosing a gender, hairstyle, skin tone, eye color, and make-up. Similar to Scarlet and Violet, your physical features are not permanent and can be adjusted in future in any way you choose, aside from skin tone.</p>



<p>In addition to flat hair colors that players have become used to, further customization options include color blocking and balayage. </p>



<p>When exploring Lumiose City, plenty of shops are available to purchase new clothes to shake-up your look, while others are unlocked through story progression and side quests.</p>



<p>We’ve listed all of the available character customization options below, split into physical options and cosmetic options.</p>



<p><strong>Physical Character Customization Options</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Gender</li>



<li>Eye Shape</li>



<li>Eye Color</li>



<li>Eyelash Shape</li>



<li>Eyelash Color</li>



<li>Eyebrow Shape</li>



<li>Eyebrow Color</li>



<li>Beauty Spot</li>



<li>Freckles</li>



<li>Dark Circles</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cosmetic Character Customization Options</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Hairstyle</li>



<li>Hair Color</li>



<li>Tops</li>



<li>Bottoms</li>



<li>Hats</li>



<li>Glasses</li>



<li>Gloves</li>



<li>Socks</li>



<li>Shoes</li>



<li>Jewelry</li>
</ul>







<p><strong>No, there is no customization in Legends: Z-A locked by gender, giving you full freedom in character creation.</strong></p>



<p>Hairstyles are uni-sex, and can be used for either gender, while other customization options like make-up and clothing is also freely available to fit any character. This includes skirts, blouses, and dresses.</p>



<p>This shouldn’t be too surprising, as the change was first made to the franchise with Scarlet and Violet unlocking all clothing and customization options, and should remain the norm for the franchise moving forwards.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-powerhouse-portable/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review%E2%80%94a-powerhouse-of-portable-gaming.1325215/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally X is a phenomenal piece of equipment that has a high price tag and a stunning specification, proving once again why ASUS sits at the top of the table in the handheld gaming market. I’ve been trialling a ROG Xbox Ally X for some time, and I’m happy to report that it has ticked all my boxes when it comes to gaming on the go.</p>



<p>Being a veteran of the ROG Ally and ROG Ally X units, I was always going to invest in an Xbox Ally X, but I underestimated how effective the evolution of this device would be. This is a winning handheld that suits me down to the ground, and in this ROG Xbox Ally X review, I’ll help you understand why it’s worth every penny.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-different-from-the-original-rog-ally-x">Is The ROG Xbox Ally X Different from the Original ROG Ally X?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The shell is better, has a custom print, the UI is upgraded, and the buttons have been enhanced.</figcaption></figure>







<p>On paper, it might seem like the core difference is just the name, with the addition of ‘Xbox’ being slipped into the branding. In actuality, things go beyond that, and the ROG Xbox Ally X represents <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rog-xbox-ally-vs-rog-xbox-ally-x-differences-price-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a sizeable overhaul</a> compared to the original Ally X.</p>



<p>The biggest difference is that the ROG Xbox Ally X has an upgraded processor, featuring the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme, compared to the original device’s AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme. This results in more processing power and smoother gameplay, and multitasking.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the memory (24 GB), storage (1 TB), screen (1080p, 120Hz IPS panel), and battery (80Whrs) are all the same.</p>



<p>I’m a <strong>huge </strong>fan of the biggest cosmetic and ergonomic changes to land with the ROG Xbox Ally X. The new device has a shell that might look strange at the beginning, but is actually much more tactile, comfortable, and sensible than the original shell.</p>



<p>It has more of a ‘grip’ built into the shell, and it accommodates larger shoulder and trigger buttons to suit all hand sizes. This grip makes it much more feasible to play games like first-person shooters. For example, I was playing Battlefield 6 on the ROG Xbox Ally X and found that I was almost as capable as I would have been using a traditional controller input.</p>



<p>Other improvements I noticed that aren’t necessarily on paper are the lower operating temperature, even at load, the quieter fans, and what sounds to me like better audio output.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-perform">How Does the ROG Xbox Ally X Perform?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Even a brand-new game like Battlefield 6 ran well on the ROG Xbox Ally X</figcaption></figure>







<p>The ROG Xbox Ally X ticked every box for me, as I’ve already said. I ran it through its paces with a series of games, both old and new, and every time, the device left me thoroughly impressed. I played everything from Fallout 4 (2015) to Battlefield 6 (2025). </p>



<p>I spent hours enjoying PowerWash Simulator, and even did what I’d done on the previous ROG Ally X, installing Escape from Tarkov and using the onboard Armory Crate software to remap my inputs to make it playable on a controller.</p>



<p>At every step of the way, the Xbox Ally X kept me entertained. With the 80Wh battery, you can get a few hours of gameplay out of the device, depending on the game you play and the processing level you pick (Silent, Performance, or Turbo). The ports for charging and audio inputs are nicely located, the buttons are responsive and full-sized, and the unit doesn’t weigh so much that it introduces fatigue.</p>



<p>I was wondering how the Xbox integrations would work, and I’m pleased to report that they’re not disruptive or pointless. They’re practical and make it feel more like a gaming handheld than a Windows 11 PC shrunk into a smaller shell.</p>



<p>If I have one gripe, it’s that ASUS strangely switched around the pause/select/Armory Crate/library buttons compared to the Ally X, which meant I was always pressing the wrong button when I tried pausing my game.</p>



<p>At the press of a button, you can open the Xbox Game Bar, fully customizable with widgets. With another press, you’re in the aggregated library function that collates all your games into one place, regardless of launcher or storefront. Using the Xbox UI is a much more welcoming and user-friendly experience than relying on the Windows 11 interface, and even that feels better than ever.</p>



<p>For example, I always had a problem with <strong>typing </strong>on the Ally X, and bringing up the keyboard often felt fiddly and frustrating. With the Xbox Ally X, that’s not the case, and the tweaks applied on a software level are tangible.</p>



<p>This is a phenomenal handheld, and when fused with Xbox, players open up remote play (with Xbox Series consoles) and cloud gaming potential like never before.</p>



<p>It charges quickly, has expandable memory, a lightning-fast processor, and it looks gorgeous on a stand. The RGB touches are neat (again), the glass and frame have survived a few drop tests, and there are plenty of accessories on the market you can use to customize your ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>Sure, it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-pre-order-rog-xbox-ally-rog-xbox-ally-x-us-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has a price tag</a> of an eye-watering $999 (or £799), but in my opinion, it’s worth every penny. If you travel a lot, game on the go, or simply want something smaller to curl up with in bed as the cold winter nights creep in, you’ll want to invest in an ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>To me, this is the best gaming handheld on the market, bar none.</p>

<p>Here at Ars, we have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-sure-seems-to-be-thinking-about-some-sort-of-portable-xbox/">writing</a> about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/05/6951-2/">rumors</a> of a portable Xbox <a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/03/6415-2/">for literal decades now</a>. With the ROG Xbox Ally, Microsoft has finally made those rumors a reality in the weirdest, most Microsoft way possible.</p>
<p>Yes, the $600 ROG Xbox Ally—and its souped-up cousin, the $1,000, ridiculous-mouthful-of-a-name ROG Xbox Ally X, which we tested—are the first official handheld hardware to sport the Xbox brand name. But Microsoft isn’t taking the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/do-xbox-owners-have-a-right-to-expect-console-exclusives/">exclusive-heavy</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/08/as-epic-attacks-apple-and-google-it-ignores-the-same-problems-on-consoles/">walled garden</a> software approach that it has been committed to for nearly 25 years of Xbox home consoles. Instead, the ROG Xbox Ally is, at its base, simply a new version of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/asus-rog-ally-x-review-better-performance-and-feel-in-a-pricey-package/">Asus’ Windows-based ROG Ally line</a> with an Xbox-flavored coat of paint.</p>
<p>That coat of paint—what Microsoft is calling the Xbox Full-screen Experience (FSE)—represents the company’s belated attempt to streamline the Windows gaming experience to be a bit more console-like in terms of user interface and overall simplicity. While that’s a worthy vision, the execution in these early days is so spotty and riddled with annoyances that it’s hard to recommend over the SteamOS-based competition.</p>
<h2>Promises, promises</h2>
<p>When Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/">announced the ROG Xbox Ally this summer</a>, the company promised that what it was calling a new “Xbox Experience for Handheld” would "minimize background activity and defer non-essential tasks" usually present in Windows, meaning "more [and] higher framerates" for gaming. While this is technically true, the performance improvement is so small as to be almost meaningless in practice.</p>
<p>In our testing, in-game benchmarks running under the Xbox Full Screen Experience were ever so slightly faster than those same benchmarks running under the full Windows 11 in Desktop Mode (which you can switch to with a few button presses on the ROG Xbox Ally). And when we say “ever so slightly,” we mean less than a single frame per second improvement in many cases and only one or two frames per second at most. Even on a percentage basis, the difference will be practically unnoticeable.</p>

<p>The other major selling point of Microsoft’s Xbox FSE, as sold this summer, is an “aggregated gaming library” that includes “all of the games available on Windows” in one single mega-launcher interface. That means apps like Steam, Battle.net, GOG Galaxy, Ubisoft Connect, and EA Play can all be installed with just a click from the “My Apps” section of the FSE from the first launch.</p>
<p>The integration of these apps into the wider Xbox FSE is spotty at best, though. For one, the new “aggregate gaming library” can’t actually show you every game you own across all of these PC gaming platforms in one place. Choosing the “installable” games filter on the Xbox FSE only shows you the games you can access through Microsoft’s own Xbox platform (including any Xbox Game Pass subscription). For other platforms, you must still browse and install the games you own through their own apps, each with their own distinct interfaces that don’t always play well with the ROG Xbox Ally’s button-based controls.</p>

<p>Even games that are supposed to be installable directly via the Xbox FSE caused me problems in testing. Trying to load the EA Play app to install any number of games included with Xbox Game Pass, for instance, triggered an “authentication error” page with no option to actually log in to EA’s servers. This problem persisted across multiple restarts and reinstallations of the extension that’s supposed to link EA Play to the Xbox FSE. And while I could load the EA Play app via Desktop Mode, I couldn’t get the app to recognize that I had an active Xbox Game Pass subscription to grant me access to the titles I wanted. So much for testing <i>Battlefield</i>, I guess.</p>

<h2>Mo’ launchers, mo’ problems</h2>
<p>Once you’ve gone to the trouble of installing your favorite games on the ROG Xbox Ally, the Xbox FSE does a good job of aggregating their listings in a single common interface. For players whose gaming libraries are spread across multiple platforms, it can be genuinely useful to see an FSE game list where Battle.net’s <i>Hearthstone</i> sits next to a GOG copy of <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>, a Steam copy of <i>Hades II,</i> and an Epic Games Store copy of <i>Fortnite, </i>for instance. A quick tap of the Xbox button will even show you the last three games you played, regardless of where you launched them (alongside quick access to some useful general settings).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, actually playing those games via the new Xbox FSE is far from a seamless experience. You never quite know what you’re going to get when you hit the large, green “Play” button to launch a third-party platform via the Xbox FSE. All too frequently, in fact, you’ll get no immediate outward sign for multiple seconds that you did anything, leaving you to wonder if your button press even registered.</p>
<p>In the best case, this long wait will eventually culminate in a separate launcher popping up and eventually loading your game (or possibly popping up and down multiple times as it cycles through necessary launcher updates). In a slightly annoying case, the launcher might require you to close some pop-up and/or manually hit another on-screen button to launch the game (if you’re playing with the console docked to a TV, this may be downright impossible without a mouse plugged in). In the worst case, the wait might stretch to 30 seconds or more before you think to check the App Switcher and realize that Battle.net actually launched in the background and is waiting for you to input your username and password (to cite just one of many frustratingly counterintuitive examples I encountered).</p>

    <p><span>Tapping the Xbox button brings up this helpful overlay no matter where you are in a game or app.</span>
                    <span>
                      Kyle Orland / Asus
                  </span>
          </p>
  </div>

<p>Sometimes, switching from one active game to another via the handy Xbox button will pop up a warning that you should close the first game before opening a new one. Quite often, though, that pop-up warning simply fails to appear, forcing you to go to the trouble of manually closing the first game if you don’t want it eating up resources in the background. But in cases where you do want to multitask—downloading a game on Steam while playing something via the Epic Games Store, for instance—you can never be quite sure if the background app will actually keep doing what you want when it isn’t in focus via the FSE. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn’t.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>There are plenty of other little annoyances that make using the Xbox FSE more painful than it should be. Sometimes the system will swap between third-party launchers or between a launcher and the Xbox FSE for seemingly no reason, interrupting your flow. When the Xbox app itself needs updating, it does so via the desktop version of the Windows Update settings menu, which isn’t really designed for controllers (but which will offer to let you install the latest version of Notepad). Sometimes, Steam’s Big Picture Mode would have the very top and bottom of the full-screen interface cut off for no apparent reason. The system will frequently freeze on a menu for multiple seconds and refuse to respond to any input, especially when loading or closing an outside launcher. I could go on.</p>

<p>I’m willing to cut Microsoft a bit of slack here. It’s hard to bring the fragmented landscape of competing PC gaming platforms and storefronts together into a single unified interface that provides a cohesive user experience. In a sense, Microsoft is trapped in <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">that XKCD comic</a> where people complain about 14 different competing standards and end up creating a 15th competing standard in the process of trying to unify them.</p>
<p>At the same time, Microsoft sold the Xbox FSE largely on the promise of an “aggregated gaming library” that makes this all simple. Instead, the Full-screen Experience we got papers over the fragmented nature of Windows gaming while causing new problems all their own.</p>
<h2>A powerful machine</h2>
<p>Xbox FSE aside, there’s a lot to like about the ROG Xbox Ally line from a hardware design perspective. I tested the ROG Xbox Ally X, which is a little thicker and heavier than the Steam Deck but ends up riding that fine line between “solidly built” and “dense brick” pretty well in the hands.</p>

<p>I was especially impressed with the design of the ROG Xbox Ally’s hand grips, textured ovoid bumps that slot perfectly into the crook of the palm for comfortable extended gaming sessions. The overall build quality shines through, too, from nicely springy analog sticks and shoulder triggers to extremely powerful, bass-heavy speakers and excellently clicky face buttons (which can be a bit loud when playing next to a sleeping partner). There are also some nice rear buttons that are incredibly easy to nudge with a small flick of your middle finger, if you’re one of those people who never wants to move your thumbs off the analog sticks.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally’s 7-inch 1080p screen is crisp enough and looks especially nice when delivering steady 120 fps performance on games like <i>Hollow Knight: Silksong</i>. But the maximum brightness of 500 nits is a bit dim if you’re going to be playing in direct sunlight. I also found myself missing the deep blacks and pop of HDR color I’ve gotten used to on my Steam Deck OLED.</p>
<p>The AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip in the ROG Xbox Ally X delivers all the relative gaming horsepower you’d hope for from a $1,000 PC gaming handheld. I was able to hit 30 fps or more running a recent release like <i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i> at 1080p and High graphical settings. For a slightly older game like <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>, the chip could even handle the “Ray-tracing Low” graphics preset at 1080p resolution at an acceptable frame rate when plugged into an outlet.</p>



<p>If&nbsp;you’re away from a power source, though, pushing the hardware for high-end graphical performance like that does take its toll on the battery. Titles that required the hardware’s preset “Turbo Mode”—which tends to run the noisy fan at full blast to keep internal temperature reasonable—could drain a fully charged battery in around two hours in the worst case. Switching over to the power-sipping but less graphically powerful Silent Mode (which can be accessed with a single button press using a handy "Armoury Crate Command Center" overlay) will extend that to about five or six hours of play time at the expense of the frame rate for high-end games.</p>

<h2>The SteamOS elephant in the room</h2>
<p>In a bubble, it would be easy to see the ROG Xbox Ally X as a promising, if flawed, early attempt to merge the simplicity of console gaming with the openness of PC gaming in a nice handheld form factor. Here in the real world, though, we’ve been enjoying a much more refined version of that same idea via Valve’s SteamOS and Steam Deck for years.</p>
<p>With SteamOS, I don’t need to worry about which launcher I’ll use to install or update a game. I don’t need to manually close background programs or wait multiple seconds to see an on-screen response when I hit the “Play” button. I don’t need to worry about whether a Settings menu will require me to use a mouse or touchscreen. Everything just works on SteamOS in a way I can’t rely on with the Xbox FSE.</p>
<p>Yes, Microsoft can brag that the Xbox FSE supports every Windows game, while SteamOS is limited to Valve’s walled garden. But this is barely an advantage for many if not most PC gamers, who have been launching their games via Steam more or less exclusively for decades now. Even companies with their own platforms and launchers often offer compatible versions of their biggest titles on Steam these days, a tacit acknowledgement of the social-network lock-in Valve has over the market for whole generations of PC gamers.</p>

<p>Sure, the ROG Xbox Ally can play a handful of games that aren’t available via SteamOS for one reason or another. If you want to play <i>Fortnite</i>, <i>Destiny</i>, <i>Battlefield</i>, or <i>Diablo III</i> portably, the ROG Xbox Ally is a decent solution. Ditto for web-based games (playable here via Edge), games available via niche platforms like itch.io, or even titles you might install directly to the Windows desktop without an outside platform’s launcher (remember those?). And even for games available on SteamOS, the ROG Xbox Ally can give you access to the free or cheap versions you obtained from sales or offers on other platforms (don’t sleep on <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408064600721-FAQ-Amazon-Prime-x-GOG?product=gog">Amazon’s Prime Gaming offers</a> if you like free GOG codes).</p>

<p>The killer app for the ROG Xbox Ally, though, is Xbox Game Pass. If you subscribe to Microsoft’s popular gaming service, logging in to your account on the ROG Xbox Ally means seeing your “installable” library instantly fill up with hundreds of games spanning a huge swath of the recent history of PC gaming. That’s an especially nice feeling for PC gaming newcomers who haven’t spent years digging through regular Steam sales to build up a sizable backlog.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/should-you-cancel-xbox-game-pass-everything-to-know-on-the-price-hikes-and-new-features/">recent price hike to $30 a month for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> definitely makes this a less compelling proposition. But ROG Xbox Ally users can probably get by with the $16.49/month “Xbox Game Pass for PC” plan, which offers over 500 installable games and access to new first-party Microsoft releases. As a way to dip your toe into the wide world of PC gaming, it’s hard to beat.</p>
<p>Even for players who aren’t interested in Xbox Game Pass, the ROG Xbox Ally X is a well-built piece of hardware with the power to run today’s games pretty well. All things considered, though, the poor user experience of the Xbox FSE makes it hard to recommend either ROG Xbox Ally over somewhat less powerful SteamOS devices like the Steam Deck or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/games-run-faster-on-steamos-than-windows-11-ars-testing-finds/">Legion Go S</a>. That said, we hope Microsoft will continue refining the Xbox Full-screen Experience to make for a Windows gaming experience that lives up to its promise.</p>

                <p>Released in 2011, Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was a success at launch and continued to grow in popularity over the years. It's now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">sold more than 60 million copies and ranks as the No. 8 best-selling game in history.</a> Why has the game had such enduring appeal? Lead designer Bruce Nesmith said on the <a href="https://linktr.ee/frvrpodcast" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FRVR Podcast</a> that the game's open-world design was done in a way that "nobody had ever done before" and that only "very few" games have tried to do since.</p><p>"By all rights, a year later, some other game should have eclipsed it. And then two years later, three years later, five, 10. It's like, 'What the hell is going on here?'" he said, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skyrim-lead-designer-is-eternally-shocked-at-the-games-lasting-appeal-saying-i-think-skyrim-did-open-world-in-a-way-that-nobody-had-ever-done-before" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by IGN</a>.</p><p>Nesmith, who has since left Bethesda, said he remembers when Bethesda boss Todd Howard--who directed Skyrim--would host in meetings in which he would tell staff about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/millions-still-play-skyrim-every-month-todd-howard/1100-6460286/" data-ref-id="1100-6460286">how wildly popular the game continued to be some 10 years after launch.</a></p><p>Nesmith went on to say that Bethesda accepted that Skyrim would have bugs and quirks, and fans did too. "You're going to have weird stuff happen. And if you say that's okay, you can get this diamond," he said.</p><p>Before this, Howard said of Skyrim's ongoing appeal and all the subsequent re-releases for new platforms: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/millions-still-play-skyrim-every-month-todd-howard/1100-6460286/" data-ref-id="1100-6460286">"If you want us to stop releasing it, stop buying it."</a> It's become something of a joke that Bethesda will release the game on any and all platforms, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-bethesda-jokes-about-skyrim-on-amazon-alex/1100-6459648/" data-ref-id="1100-6459648">including Alexa devices. </a></p><p>Bethesda is now developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, but it's likely still a long time off.

<p>It's a flippin' massive game, so chances are you won't get particularly far in just a few short days, but it should prove to be a compelling little demo if you're on the fence.</p>

<p>It's quite funny that this happens to also coincide with the launch day for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, with X user <a href="https://x.com/BranPickle" tabindex="-1">@BranPickle</a> stating "Same day Z-A comes out is scandalous".

              <p>So much of the crap we own is beholden to a long cable and fat adapter to make it work. Our phones, our headphones, even our watches now all have a lithium battery that needs to be charged on the regular. When you need to plug in more than one device at a time, suddenly you space feels like a cobweb of cables running all directions, creating a tangled mess. Or worse, they don’t all fit. So now you’re on the hunt for multiple free wall outlets to get your AirPods up and running again just so you can relisten to the&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> soundtrack while you work. Thankfully, you can take control of your stress and clutter with a good charging station. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/">Baseus has a 10-in-1 desktop charge of which Amazon knocked 40% off the price</a>. The charger normally goes for $50, but the discount ends up saving you an even $20. That means you only have to pay $30 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multi-Device Charging</h2>
<p>This all-in-one charging block combines 10 different ports so you can charge up as many as 10 devices simultaneously. Between them all, you get six AC outlets, three USB-C ports, and one standard USB-A port. With a wide spread of options, you shouldn’t have any issue charging your various devices without the need for a unique charging block. You can just plug your device directly into the unit. In the event you still end up needing to plug an adapter into the AC outlet, you shouldn’t have that common problem of the block taking up multiple slots on the power strip. On the Baseus charger, each outlet faces a different direction to allow for better flexibility.</p>



<p>Designed for desktops and nightstands, the Baseus charging station comes with an adhesive strip for the bottom of the unit. This was it can stand firmly in place to the side of your desk, out of the way, but always where you want it to be.</p>
<p>Whether you’re charging your phone, earbuds, a MacBook, or all three at once, you can expect them to charge up quickly. The Baseus power station is able to deliver a maximum output of 67W. As a point of reference, the USB-C adapter that comes with iPhones nowadays is only 20W. And with GaN6 technology, you can trust your devices will stay safe and cool while charing.</p>

<p>By playing Battlefield 6 online, you’re bound to level up. Completing matches and challenges will give you precious XP, allowing you to level up your profile. If you want to know how far you can go and how many levels there are to ascend, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-6-5-million-copies-in-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> has a lot of content, to say the least. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a> will contribute to this, offering the community more ways to level up and earn rewards. Whether you play for the next few weeks, months, or years, chances are you’ll level up a lot.</p>



<p>So we’re checking out how many player levels there are to grind.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-highest-level-in-battlefield-6">What’s The Highest Level in Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Bring the fire. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Technically, there isn’t a max level you can hit in Battlefield 6, as your player level can keep going.</strong></p>



<p>It’s believed that your Battlefield 6 player level can reach the high hundreds, maybe even the thousands. This means you can keep playing, keep leveling up, and flex on people with your incredible rank. Yes, remember to go out and touch some grass once in a while, but make sure you return to BF 6 as it’s always a fun journey starting at player level 1 and seeing how far you can progress.</p>



<p>As long as <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> keeps delivering the multiplayer goods—and offers a strong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-pois-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battle royale</a> component—there’s no reason not to dedicate many hours to BF 6 to see if you can reach the unreachable ceiling!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-level-do-you-stop-earning-battlefield-6-rewards">What Level Do You Stop Earning Battlefield 6 Rewards?</h2>



<p><strong>At the moment, you stop earning Battlefield 6 online rewards once you reach player level 100.</strong></p>



<p>Again, there seems to be no max level cap, but it should be a while until someone finds out anyway. However, once you hit rank 100, this definitely brings an end to your free rewards. At least for now, as EA might decide to increase the rewards cap, and either give you backdated rewards for levels you’ve already reached, or implement a new reward system.</p>



<p>Special events might also be another way to grind levels within the overall grind. Either way, there are plenty of goodies to attain.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-amp-fastest-ways-to-level-up-in-battlefield-6">Best &amp; Fastest Ways To Level Up in Battlefield 6</h2>



<p><strong>Playing in a party, seeking out special Portal maps, and being smart with XP Tokens are the best methods to level up fast in Battlefield 6.</strong></p>



<p>We’re not going to get into the nitty-gritty of each point here, as we already have a useful, in-depth ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-farm-xp-level-up-fast-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Farm XP &amp; Level Up Fast in Battlefield 6</a>‘ guide you should definitely read and bookmark.</p>



<p>But if you’re looking to level up fast, there are many ways you can embrace to make the process easier.</p>



<p>We hope this gave you the information you were looking for. May you level up in style and take pleasure in the misery of others as you defeat them for XP to level up! Let us know what level you are through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

The bustling metropolitan setting of Lumiose City will offer a significant change of pace from rolling hills and wilderness in Pokemon Legends: Arceus. Your first partner Pokemon will be either Chikorita, Totodile, or Tepig. The streamlined catching system from Arceus will return, so you won't have to battle every wild Pokemon you encounter before lobbing a Poke Ball at them.</p><p>Z-A will also be a major departure in another way: the battle system. The traditional turn-based combat from Arceus and the mainline series will be replaced by a strategic real-time system. You and your partner Pokemon can move during combat encounters--though you'll still be confined to a specific area. Positioning and timing will impact your success on the battlefield, both when attacking and defending incoming attacks by executing dodges.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="880909437" data-promo-id="0"

<figure><a title="Bye Sweet Carole Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159536/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Before spinning us an enchanting and emotionally charged yarn, developer Little Sewing Machine opens with a simple dedication in lowercase: <em>for mom</em>. It’s a reminder that, despite the scope of the journey ahead, this is a deeply personal tale.</p>
<p>Little Sewing Machine lead Chris Darill is no stranger to artistic horror or cinematic flair. His <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=series%3Aremothered"><strong>Remothered</strong></a> games were standout examples of survival horror done right. Here, he introduces us to a disarming world of primary colours and art that feels straight out of Disney, before plunging us into a nightmare filled with tricky puzzles and shadowy monsters.</p>
<p>Lana Benton lives a bleak life of toil at Bunny Hall Orphanage. Her only solace was her friend Carole, who has gone missing under mysterious circumstances. Haunted by nightmares of a tall figure in a top hat, Lana sets out to find her friend. In doing so, she stumbles into the world of Corolla, where strange creatures roam and the sinister Mr. Kyn, the man from her dreams, relentlessly pursues her.</p>
<figure><a title="Bye Sweet Carole Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159537/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In keeping with its art style, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bye_sweet_carole">Bye Sweet Carole</a> unfolds like a classic Disney tale. A downtrodden heroine, who can speak to birds and is frequently called “princess” by fantastical creatures, moves from a bleak earthly existence to a strange alternate realm in search of a loved one. Personal struggles are overcome, and emotional lessons are learned. There's even an omniscient narrator that chimes in occasionally to exposit and vocalise the hero's internal trauma.</p>
<p>The writing has welcome cultural complexity. Bunny Hall is an oppressive institution that reinforces distorted gender dynamics. These story elements are well illustrated and underscore the importance of the central relationship.</p>
<p>The mechanics of Lana's adventure are as traditional as its story. Essentially a side-scrolling puzzle adventure, it plays out like an old-school point-and-click, with some added QTEs and punishing trial-and-error encounters.</p>
<p>Early on, Lana gains the ability to transform into a rabbit, unlocking wall jumping and new traversal options. The alternate Bunny Hall also features grotesque versions of authority figures that our princess must run or hide from in tense, though often clunky, stealth sections.</p>
<figure><a title="Bye Sweet Carole Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159534/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Hiding in dark spaces, holding your breath, and trying not to get caught by a twisted rabbit creature evokes the gothic chills of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/little_nightmares_complete_edition">Little Nightmares</a>. However, unlike the quick death that awaits in that Burtonesque classic, Bye Sweet Carole’s has a health bar that encourages multiple attempts at hide and seek. Character animations don’t always allow for a smooth escape once you’re discovered. Lana can switch between human and rabbit form to navigate obstacles, but these moments can still feel like frustrating exercises in trial and error.</p>
<p>There’s some light combat, where you take control of the mysterious protector Mr. Baesie. It fares a bit better than the stealth encounters but still feels somewhat fiddly. That said, an empowering final battle is thoroughly enjoyable, but I won’t spoil that here. The lavishly animated challenges are not as punishing as the visually similar <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dragons_lair_trilogy">Dragon’s Lair</a> (Don Bluth rather than Disney), yet there are times when Lana simply has to die before you can figure out the solution.</p>
<p>The rest of the time is spent travelling between screens, collecting various ephemera to clear obstacles or open doors. There’s some very light platforming and frequent chase encounters with Mr. Kyn and his minions.</p>
<figure><a title="Bye Sweet Carole Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159539/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s worth pushing through the rough patches to continue Lana’s search for her friend. Using a familiar yet distinctive aesthetic to tell such a personal and occasionally bleak story is effective. The visuals are complemented further by a beautiful score from composer Luca Balboni, which makes even the simple act of retracing your steps through loading screens feel grandiose.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the art style doesn’t always mesh perfectly with movement and combat, but that doesn’t take away from its beauty on either a big or small screen. Aside from a fair bit of loading between areas, the game performs well on the Switch, with smooth, fluid animation, especially when Lana is darting around in rabbit form.</p>
<p>Undocked Switch 2 performance feels mostly the same as on Switch 1, though the visuals stand out far more on the newer console’s larger handheld display. Undocked play is a much more viable option on the Switch 2, but Bye Sweet Carole performs well across both platforms.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Unfolding like a classic Disney tale, this is a beautifully animated adventure that weaves a deeply personal tale. Bye Sweet Carole is driven by its art style and a brilliant musical score, but occasionally stumbles due to stiff controls and frustrating mechanics.</p></section>

            <p>Ubisoft have opened up the pandora's box of mid-2000s shooters and deployed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-splinter-cell">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell</a>: Pandora Tomorrow onto Steam, rendering its PC version easy to grab for the first time in ages. It's not a remaster, so don't get too excited, as you might still have fun getting things to run as smoothly as your covert ops.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This is a re-release of the original game, not a remastered version," Ubisoft bark in Pandora Tomorrow's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3929740/Tom_Clancys_Splinter_Cell_Pandora_Tomorrow/">Steam listing</a>. "Aside from fixing critical issues, the game remains unchanged.  Please note that multiplayer mode will not be available."</p>
<p>Cue a bunch of Clancyheads going 'oh, brill', then firing the thing up and realising that it forces you to go through the fun Ubisoft's Connect launcher. As with most third-party launchers (I'm looking at you, EA), it's an extra faff that's ultimately unnecessary to play a game conceived when even Connect's previous guise Uplay was only a punny glimmer in some exec's eye.</p>
<p>That said, if can stomach that headache and are cool relying on mods to provide the likes of controller support and sand off some of the remaining rough running edges, it's a chance to slap back on some retro tactical goggles. It's also on sale as of writing, setting you back only £5.39 / $5.99 / €5.99 until October 28th. There's also a substantial discount on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> legacy collection <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/23545/Splinter_Cell_Legacy_Collection/">bundle</a>, which currently offers six splintered cells for £15.73 / $18.84 / €18.84.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you're wondering how Pandora Tomorrow runs on Steam Deck, <a href="https://steamdeckhq.com/news/splinter-cell-pandora-tomorrow-playable-steam-deck/">SteamDeckHQ</a> report that the answer is just about.</p>
<p>We're still waiting for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-looks-like-the-splinter-cell-remake-might-be-about-to-reappear-after-years-in-the-dark">Splinter Cell Remake Ubisoft have in the works</a> to arrive, but in the meantime - and likely the reason for this re-release - an animated Splinter Cell Netflix series dubbed Deathwatch has just arrived. Here's a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflixs-splinter-cell-deathwatch-review">review from big Iggun</a> if you want an idea of whether it's worth making time for some Sam Fisher and chill.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-solix-c1000-power-station-hits-record-low-after-three-price-cuts-in-a-week-50-off-and-charges-10-devices-2000635391</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-solix-c1000-power-station-hits-record-low-after-three-price-cuts-in-a-week-50-off-and-charges-10-devices.1325140/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re now in the no man’s zone between October’s Prime Day sales and November’s Black Friday sales. You might expect it to be hard to find a good deal across the online retail giant’s website during this time, but you’d be wrong. You can still find great opportunities to save on electronics if you know where to look. For instance, take a gander at this Anker power station. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/">The Anker SOLIX C1000 second-generation portable power station has dropped by nearly 50%</a>. Amazon has the unit listed normally for $799, but after the $370 discount, you can get it for just $429 for a limited time.</p>
<p>The Anker SOLIX C1000 power station has an output of 2,000W (peak of 3,000W). That should be plenty enough power for basically all the appliances you might have with you in your RV on a camping trip or in your truck in the parking lot of your next tailgate. It also serves well in an emergency at home like during a blackout. You can ensure everyone in the house has a fully charged phone and you can run necessary appliances, like your TV and Nintendo Switch 2. How else we going to pass by the time other than some Knockout Tour?</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>With its 10 different ports, you can charge up to 10 devices at once. You have five 2,000W AC ports along with two USB-C 140W ports, one, 15W USB-C port, on USB-A 12W, and one 120W car port.</p>
<p>Fit the power station easily into the trunk of your car. It only measures 15.1 inches by 8.2 inches by 9.6 inches and weighs 24.9 lbs. That’s 14% smaller and 11% lighter than the first-generation Anker SOLIX C1000. It can operate quietly too, running at between zero and 20dbs when discharging under 200W.</p>



<h2>Solar Power Generation</h2>
<p>The power station holds enough charge in its 1,024Wh capacity to fully charge an iPhone 67.7 times over before the Anker SOLIX C1000 runs out of charge itself. When that does happen, you can bring the power station back up to 100% capacity in just 49 minutes when you have it set to UltraFast recharging via the Anker app. You can choose to add on a solar panel and recharge the Anker SOLIX C1000 via solar, which only takes 1.8 hours. Great for extended weekended in the outdoors.</p>
<p>If you choose to add on the 100W solar panel, the full bundle will cost you $679. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/">For just the Anker SOLIX C1000, you can get it for just $429 for a limited time.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-devs-are-rolling-out-a-fix-for-bullets-not-registering/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-devs-are-%E2%80%98rolling-out-a-fix%E2%80%99-for-bullets-not-registering.1325137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s principal game designer has stated that a fix for bullets not registering is on the way. </p>



<p>The developers of Battlefield 6 have done a spectacular job with the game, and the sales reflect that: the game has sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-6-5-million-copies-in-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 6.5 million copies</a> within a few days. However, there is still some work to do, as several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-glitches-exploits-ea-working-overtime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bugs and glitches</a> continue to plague BF6. Fortunately, the next patch will address the ghost bullets issue in Battlefield 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-hits-not-registering-will-be-fixed-in-next-patch">Battlefield 6 Hits Not Registering Will be Fixed in Next Patch</h2>



<p>A new post by Battlefield 6’s principal game designer, Florian Le Bihan, on <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1978405809814987229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) discusses ‘rolling out a fix’ for bullets not registering. The developers have observed an issue “where bullets hit an enemy and where blood splatters are visible but don’t cause damage.” Le Bihan explained that this issue was caused “intermittently with certain weapons and attachments combinations and should now be resolved.” </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We are rolling out a fix to address the issue seen where bullets hit an enemy and where blood splatters are visible but don't cause damage.</p><p>The issue happened intermittently with certain weapons and attachments combinations and should now be resolved. <a href="https://t.co/rf4L04PpLR">https://t.co/rf4L04PpLR</a></p></div>— Florian – DRUNKKZ3 (@DRUNKKZ3) <a href="https://twitter.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1978405809814987229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a reply to the thread, Le Bihan clarified that some hit registration issues can be caused by poor internet or game server performance; however, players will be informed of this through performance icons at the top left. The principal game designer also confirmed that this Battlefield 6 fix will not address bloom, as that’s “a different issue”. </p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6’s campaign tells you to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-campaign-tells-you-to-uninstall-when-youre-done/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uninstall once you have completed it</a>. Additionally, the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beats-call-of-dutys-all-time-concurrent-player-count-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beat Call of Duty’s all-time concurrent player count</a> on Steam with nearly 750k players.

<p>He was a big deal at the studio, and now after 36 years, he's left for pastures new.</p>
<p>Yes, after Microsoft unceremoniously cancelled <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/everwild">Everwild</a>, Mayles decided it was perhaps time to move on, and has now posted a farewell message on social media with his very own poem (thanks, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/thanks-to-everyone-who-played-donkey-kong-country-and-banjo-kazooie-designer-gregg-mayles-leaves-rare-after-36-years">Time Extension</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="vEee42ub-Hw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4021b7xiusvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>Alongside the aforementioned titles, Mayles also directed the wildly popular <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/sea_of_thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> which, after its initial launch in 2018, found an additional home on the PS5 in April 2024. Many thought that perhaps Microsoft was also planning a launch on Switch, but alas, this has yet to come to fruition.</p>
<p>In addition to the cancellation of Everwild, Microsoft also pulled the plug on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/perfect_dark">Perfect Dark</a>, a planned reboot of the N64 classic from Rare. In development by The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics, the former was also shuttered as part of the cancellation. Boo.</p>

            <p>It is time to once again desecrate the much-pillaged tomb of Looking Glass Studios and have it away with the materials for a new dark fantasy immersive sim. Starhelm Studios have announced Project Shadowglass, a purebred first-person Thief-like with a light-shadow system, lockpicking, pickpocketing, noisy or quieter walkable surfaces, magical traps, heist planning and jailbreaks.</p>
<p>Lead developer Dominick John is one of the two people behind Youtube music parody outfit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/spacebards">Space Bards</a>, but it doesn't sound like you'll be singing much in Project Shadowglass. Not unless you really enjoy getting caught. Or are great at ventriloquy. Has an imsim allowed you to distract people using ventriloquy yet? Maybe next time.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Project Shadowglass is making waves partly because the announcement teaser below is a dunk on generative AI. Long story short: a month or two ago, some clever custard posted a generated gif of a rustic fantasy game mock-up, with a torch-wielding player trotting down a valley towards a gigantic castle. The image earned viral acclaim from the AIdvocates and scornful quote-tweets from the detrAIctors. Speaking as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">very long-winded</a> detrAIctor, my only takeaway from the generated mock-up is that more games should have cloud-piercing, Maleficent-worthy citadels in them, while doing elementary things with perspective.

<p>The Project Shadowglass teaser references the mock-up in the opening seconds, and alludes to it on the official site. It's weirdly clap-back for a project whose "360 degree pixelart" tech has apparently been on the boil for years. "Everything you see is 100% real and running realtime in-engine," <a href="https://shadowglassgame.com/">reads the blurb</a>. "It may look similar to those pretty pixel art AI videos, but this is the playable real deal. No content or art featured in Project Shadowglass will be AI generated."</p><p>If I were being a stinkpot, I'd object that Project Shadowglass's wistfully corrugated graphic are channelling the same mouldy nostalgia that enables much genAI culture. GenAI is inherently reactionary and regurgitative, after all, and many emerging genAI creators have found an audience by targeting well-known aesthetics. Project Shadowglass just isn't consuming as much electricity to do it, pixel for pixel, or filching anybody's art in the process - Starhelm have <a href="https://shadowglassgame.com/#credits">credited</a> the makers of all the open source creative commons assets used in the teaser.
</p><p>
As you'd expect from the pixelart direction, this appears to be a no-frills love letter to the genre, blending ideas from Thief, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> and Shock. Your tactics and techniques includes dousing torches, hiding bodies and memorising patrol routes. There's a persistent city environment in which you can build a reputation as a murderer, causing the regular civvies to flee from you on sight. You'll get to research and plan heists, perhaps acquiring new gear, crafting recipes or components before committing to the robbery.
</p><p>It seems progression-light. "You are no hero with powers," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3970690/Project_Shadowglass/">the Steam page</a>. "Instead, you must rely solely on improving your own planning and skill." Needless to say, hand-to-hand combat is discouraged, as is falling off high objects.

</p><p>Some story blurb to finish: "In a lush, dark, and oppressive seaside kingdom, the richest nobles have fallen in line with a new king promising them more. The poor grow poorer, the rich grow richer. The claustrophobic city has been building more walls to keep them out from where they don't belong. Higher towers to not hear them, smell them, but always keep an eye on them. But they didn't account for you."
</p>
<p>I'd tell you when you can play it, but sadly, some cat burglar has snuck in and absconded with the ciphered note containing the release date. They have left the derisive calling card "to be announced".</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-17-3%e2%80%b3-laptop-bundle-64gb-ram-2tb-ssd-takes-over-3000-price-dive-as-amazon-clears-out-5-star-stock-2000635420</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hp-17-3%E2%80%B3-laptop-bundle-64gb-ram-2tb-ssd-takes-over-3-000-price-dive-as-amazon-clears-out-5-star-stock.1325113/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We aren’t quite sure who to thank for this latest HP laptop deal at Amazon, but it’s kind of crazy how generous this one is. So, big shout-out to whomever is responsible for taking this 17.3-inch touchscreen HP Business Laptop, loading it with 64GB of DDR5 RAM and a 2TB SSD, and then installing the 12-core Intel Ultra 7 255U processor, and deciding it should be over $3,000 less than the list price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4781/">Granted, that original $4,400 list price was more than a little bit silly, but even so, the final price of $1,140 for a state-of-the-art touchscreen Windows laptop</a> that arrives as loaded as this one does is more than a little bit crazy too. There’s also a free accessories bundle which includes Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, a 7-in-1 USB hub, 128GB thumb drive, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4781/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Down to Business</h2>
<p>The Intel Ultra 7 255U processor would be a stone cold beast under any circumstance thanks to its max speed of 5.2GHz, but then when you add in the 12 TOPS of AI acceleration to drive the Microsoft Copilot AI assistant that’s preinstalled, that’s when the magic happens. Copilot’s bona fides as a top-notch AI assistant are well established, but the AI enhancements don’t end there — useful features like background blur and intelligent noise reduction for video calls and conferencing are also powered by AI.</p>
<p>The rest of the package under the hood of this 17.3-inch touchscreen HP Business Laptop is all about going big, especially the 64GB of DDR5 RAM that is basically a license to open as many tabs and apps as you want without fear of slowdown. That kind of workout also requires a fat storage capacity to hold all of your projects and other files, and this HP has a 2TB SSD ready and waiting.</p>



<h2>Roomy Everywhere You Look</h2>
<p>You can truly appreciate the 2TB of storage and the 64GB of RAM, but the other giant feature on this HP Business Laptop us the one you can actually see and touch — the beautiful 17.3-inch touchscreen display. Not only is there more than enough room for truly immersive streaming or as many windows as you want to open for multitasking, they’re all touch-controlled so this HP laptop can work like the world’s most powerful tablet.</p>
<p>Everything about this 17.3-inch HP touchscreen laptop is big, except its 0.81-inch thickness that makes it an easy backpack carry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> sales are in-line with Ghost of Tsushima’s in Europe, new data shows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/ghost-of-yotei-delivers-strong-opening" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a>, Ghost of Yotei debuted at No.2 in the GSD European charts behind EA’s FC 26.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has yet to announce a sales figure for Ghost of Yotei, which launched exclusively on PlayStation 5 on October 2, 2025. But we now know that in Europe it’s doing about as well as its predecessor, which launched in 2020 exclusively on PlayStation 4. That is, for its first few days on sale, as the GSD European chart runs to October 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a number of things worth noting here. Not only did Ghost of Tsushima launch on a console with a bigger install base at that point than PS5 has now, it launched during the pandemic, which saw record video game sales and player numbers as people were forced to stay at home during lockdowns.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Business noted that Ghost of Yotei is the biggest first-party PlayStation launch since Spider-Man 2 in October 2023. Helldivers 2, which launched February 2024, remains the fastest selling PlayStation Studios game of all time, with an incredible 12 million sold in 12 weeks. The question is whether Ghost of Yotei will end up meeting Sony's sales expectations over time; Ghost of Tsushima ended up a hugely successful release, with over 13 million sold as of September 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it shines a light on just how few new games Sony’s first-party studios have released over the last few years. Since Insomniac’s Spider-Man 2 came out in October 2023, we’ve had the aforementioned Helldivers 2, the disastrous Concord, Team Asobi’s wonderful Astro Bot, Lego Horizon Adventures, MLB The Show 25, and a bunch of remasters. Naughty Dog has seemingly skipped the PS5 generation entirely in terms of brand new games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First-party Sony games we know to be in the works include Bungie’s Marathon, Housemarque’s Saros, Insomniac’s Marvel’s Wolverine, Naughty Dog’s Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, Haven’s Fairgames, and a multiplayer Horizon game from Guerrilla. A whole bunch of Sony first-party games were canceled as the company's live-service push faltered, including a multiplayer The Last of Us game, a live-service God of War game, and another live-service title from Bend Studio. Bend's last brand new game was 2019’s Days Gone on PlayStation 4, which launched on PC in 2021.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But how has Ghost of Yotei done in the U.S.? According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m33ifb42gk2w" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mat Piscatella</a>, senior director at Circana, Ghost of Yotei ranked 12th on its Top 15 Titles by Total Weekly Active Users chart for the week ending October 4, with 4.4% of active PlayStation players giving it a go. Coincidentally, Ghost of Tsushima also ranked 12th in its launch week back in 2020 with 4.4% of active PlayStation players engaging. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it sounds like Ghost of Yotei has done about as well as Ghost of Tsushima did, at least at launch. It will be interesting to see if Sony says anything about its performance in upcoming financial reports, and how sales hold up in the coming weeks as we head into the crucial holiday season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what’s next from developer Sucker Punch, in an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sucker-punch-will-remain-a-single-project-studio-after-ghost-of-yotei-boss-suggests/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>, co-founder and studio head, Brian Fleming, said the studio will decide its next project once the multiplayer add-on Ghost of Yotei: Legends comes out in 2026. But, he suggested, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/if-we-were-good-at-juggling-four-projects-yeah-wed-have-a-remaster-ghost-of-yotei-dev-sucker-punch-says-it-will-remain-a-single-project-studio">don’t expect a flurry of games from the relatively lean developer — it’s one project at a time</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to find out, check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-review">Ghost of Yotei review</a>.

The entire track can be heard in the mission Dear Uncle Tacitus, in an impactful segment when you're riding a horse back to camp. It boasts over 55 million streams on Spotify alone.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/15/gettyimages-528806919-1760521801919.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Photo by Frans Schellekens/Redferns.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">D'Angelo was a huge fan of video games and would visit Rockstar during Red Dead Redemption 2's development after reportedly reaching out to Ivan Pavlovich, director of music and audio at the studio, through an intermediary, to "just play the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We weren’t even talking about doing music,” Pavlovich told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/dangelo-red-dead-redemption-2-767748/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>RollingStone</u></a> in 2018. "When D’Angelo comes through, he shows up at midnight, and he’s playing the game until four in the morning. Each time he was just like, ‘It’s incredible.’ It just blows his mind. He’s such a fan. I have never seen someone that excited. D’Angelo’s actually a massive, massive, massive fan of the game — more than I ever knew." It was because of this that Pavlovich asked if D'Angelo would be interested in contributing to the soundtrack, which is partly why there are some vocal tracks on an otherwise chiefly instrumental score. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dozens of artists have paid tribute to the musician, including Flavor Fave, Beyoncé, Nile Rodgers, Lauren Hill, and Doja Cat, but so have hundreds of gamers, some of whom were introduced to D'Angelo's music through Red Dead Redemption 2.

For example, Tracer can wear a Winston mask, and he can wear her mask. The launch trailer below shows off some of those new mask abilities in action.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIhY9M5dWB4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hIhY9M5dWB4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In addition to the Haunted Masquerade arcade mode, the new season is bringing back Halloween Terror 2025, which will allow four players to team up in co-op to defend Adlersbrunn from Dr. Junkenstein and his monster minions. Your chosen heroes will have to face hordes of foes and "powerful bosses" to maintain control of the castle.</p><p>Additionally, Junkenstein's Revenge lets players control Sojourn, Junker Queen, Kiriko, and Ashe as they crush barricades and battle "exploding zombie omnics," as well as Banshee Moira and Gargoyle Winston, before uncovering Adlersbrunn's castle. The new season is also bringing back Wrath of the Bride as a co-op fight and adding new Mythic cosmetics and other in-game collectibles.</p><p>Stadium is adding three new heroes: Hazard, Sojourn, and Torbjörn.

            <p>Misbehaving bullets, your hour of reckoning is nigh. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> hotfix has been deployed with the goal of stopping you from refusing to register hit damage when you embed yourselves in virtual flesh. Bouncy ladders, your time will likely come soon, as EA's Battlefield Studios are busy trying to work out the arcane secrets of your rubbery rungs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We're aware of reports of rare cases where bullets may not register damage correctly when hitting enemies," the developers have <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978400189476896968">just posted</a>, "Following our investigation, we found this was related to certain weapon attachment combinations. A hotfix has been deployed to address known instances."</p>
<p>For those who haven't run into this issue, there've been a bunch of clips shared by players since the weekend in which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-best-weapons-guns">guns</a> have been infected with a bit too much bad guy aim-itis. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> has mechanics in place to ensure you do have to work to get shots on target and do damage, but firing directly at someone and having them brush it off like it's nothing obviously isn't ideal.</p> 
<p>Here's hoping this fix, which follows DICE principal game designer Florian Le Bihan <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1977698663427133659">tweeting on Monday</a> that an investigation had commenced, can persuade these tiny hunks of metal to return to work. Unless the devs are hiding the fact they've become sentient and are objecting to the purpose they've been ascribed, in which case I say free the ammo. Independence for peace-loving projectiles, damn the consequences!</p><p>The same applies to the <a href="https://x.com/mokeysniper/status/1977115683839152535">bouncy ladders</a> players have been using to vault themselves around, which Battlefield Studios are <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1977705926476918979">also looking into</a>. If a ladder wishes to experience the joy we have to assume trampolines get from springly sending soldiers skyward, who are we to deny that? Sod the laws of physics and warzone realism. </p>
<p>I look forward to being sniped by someone who's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-backend-tweaks-tune-down-some-sniper-rifles-and-shotguns-as-ea-keep-fiddling-with-little-knobs">had to lead their shot just a little bit more</a> than was required a few days ago for expressing these controversial positions.</p>
