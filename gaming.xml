                <p>Sony's PS5 console will turn five years old in November, and with an eye on the future, the company recently revealed its thoughts on what's next for PlayStation. During a <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" rel="nofollow ">business presentation</a> hosted by several top Sony executives, president and CEO Hideaki Nishino responded to a query about future PlayStation hardware and if a next-gen PS6 console was even necessary when cloud gaming has improved over the years.</p><p>According to Nishino, while cloud gaming is "progressing well from a technical standpoint," certain challenging aspects like end-to-end network stability remain out of Sony's control. Nishino added that cloud-based gameplay is still a viable option for gamers and allows them to access more content, but the "local execution" of games--via physical media or content downloaded directly to console hardware--remains in high demand by the majority of PlayStation gamers.</p>

<p>"Cloud gaming is increasingly providing an additional option for players to access content, but our belief is that the majority of players continue to want to play and experience gaming through local execution without dependency on network conditions," Nishino said. "PS5 and PS5 Pro have validated this thesis, I believe."</p><p>On the topic of the next-gen PlayStation console, Nishino remained tight-lipped. "Our console business has evolved into a multi-faceted platform, and we now have a large ecosystem of highly engaged players across both the PS5 and PS4 generations, so naturally, there's a huge interest in our next-generation console strategy," Nishino said. "While we cannot share further details at this stage, the future of the platform is top of mind. We are committed to exploring a new and enhanced way for players to engage with our content and services."</p><p>What we do know about the PS6 is that it likely won't be out for quite a while yet. Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida recently said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/">if the next PlayStation comes out in 2028</a>, that would feel right to him, given how current console generations typically run for around seven years now.</p><p>In 2024, it was reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-powered-by-familiar-chipmaker-report/1100-6526499/">Intel made a big push to produce chips for the PS6</a>, but Sony decided to stick with AMD. While PlayStation gamers will be in for a long wait, Sony did introduce a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-review-powerful-on-paper-ordinary-in-action/1100-6527571/">mid-gen PS5 refresh last year in the form of the PS5 Pro</a>.</p>

			<p>During Sony's <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/movie/index.html">annual investors presentation</a>, the company confirmed that as of March 31, 2025, for the first time in this console generation, PS5 monthly active users have surpassed PS4 monthly active users, which means that more players on PlayStation are finally starting to make the transition to the current generation of hardware.</p>
<p>Just last year, when Sony gave this presentation in May 2024, Sony confirmed that the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-of-all-playstation-gamers-are-yet-to-upgrade-to-ps5-sony-stats-reveal">split between PS5 and PS4 players was still 50/50</a>. For one reason or another, four years into the PS4 generation, players were not leaving their old consoles behind. In the past year though, that's changed.</p>
<p>While Sony Interactive Entertainment president and chief executive officer Hideaki Nishino was speaking, the presentation featured this slide, showing that PS5 players are taking up the majority of PlayStation's 124 million monthly active users.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It's also worth noting that the new 124 million active users figure is an increase from the previously reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-network-registers-new-123-million-monthly-active-users-record-in-december-2023/">123 million active users PlayStation saw in 2023</a>, which was already a record-setting figure for Sony.</p>
<p>"<em>Our platform is stronger than ever</em>," said Nishino. "<em>We continue to attract more players, and we now have over 124M monthly active users. Through the wide range of content and services we provide, these players are more engaged than ever, which has resulted in record-high gameplay hours. Our platform is also more accessible than ever. The PlayStation 5 offers the best way for players to experience our content, and as such, this player base has continued to grow</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>These players are highly engaged, spending more on the content and services than in prior generations,</em>" Nishino continued. "<em>However, the PlayStation 4 remains an important access point for existing players to experience our content and services, and we remain committed to serving them</em>."</p>
<p>During the lead-up to the PlayStation 5's launch, there was plenty of talk about <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sonys-jim-ryan-its-time-to-give-fans-something-that-can-only-be-enjoyed-on-playstation-5">PlayStation believing in generations</a>, only for the company to confirm that most of its big titles coming to PS5 would also be coming to PS4.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dosa-divas-preview-cooking-up-storm<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to our establishment. On today's menu, our special is <em>Dosa Divas</em>, an upcoming title from developer Outerloop Games and publisher Outersloth. It mixes elements from popular JRPGs into one delicious meal. Here's our thoughts from the time we had with it at Summer Game Fest 2025.</p>

<p>Let me preface by saying&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;seems to focus heavily on narrative, but due to the nature of the demo, I wasn't able to get a real feel for it. With a timer giving me just 30 minutes, I wanted to consume as much gameplay as I could.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Taking Inspiration From the Greats</h2>

<p>From what I could gather, though, the story involves two sisters and an "ancient spirit-mech," which you can also control as a party member (it is pretty freakin' cool). An evil fast food empire is the main enemy faction we'll contend with throughout the duration of&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;playtime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I went into&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;fairly blind; I saw something that looking cool, so I decided I wanted to play it. Because of this, I was quite surprised to find how much&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;plays like some of my favorite JRPGs.</p>

<p>You have an overworld -- it's kind of this 3D, side-scrolling like area a la&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/series/paper-mario" rel="nofollow">Paper Mario</a> --&nbsp;</em>and combat is also inspired by the same game's timing mechanics. More recently, we can look at games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>&nbsp;using this more interactive, turn-based JRPG combat style.</p>



<h2>Food Fighting in&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em></h2>

<p>So when you engage in combat, you can pick your standard attacks, special attacks, and the like. There's a little visual indicator to showing players can press a button again, during combat animation, to get an extra attack. Timing seems pretty generous for this.</p>

<p>The timing for attacks will depend; for an example, attack has a boomerang effect that, if you keep timing it correctly, can bounce for quite a long time. Nothing I'm saying here is extraordinarily different from other JRPGs that have similar mechanics, but&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;has a few tricks up its sleeve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There's a culinary theme throughout the entire game. Attacks are based on cooking utensils for the most part, so you have your spatulas, pot lids, punches from a spirit-mech... okay, maybe the last one isn't a cooking utensil, but man, I can't get over how cool this mech is!</p>

<p>As I went around defeating enemies in the overworld, I helped liberate a village from the fast-food empire, the reputation with the settlement would increase. This actually gave me skills for my characters, so it seems like character progression is tied to these villages to some large degree.</p>



<h2><em>Dosa Divas</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Besides that, though, I love the way&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;handles items. You're not buying your standard health potion like a normal JRPG; instead, you cook it up yourself. There's a cooking aspect involved, and depending on what ingredients you use, you get a different result.</p>

<p>So while you might be able to buy certain ingredients, it seems like you'll have to make your own utility items. There are little mini-games that make this aspect more interactive, so cooking can be a grand 'ol time.</p>

<p>If anything,&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;seems like a neat little JRPG-inspired game. It doesn't necessarily do anything super new or wild, but it doesn't need to. It's an honest take on the genre that is legitimately fun, so I'm excited to see how this one pans out when it launches next year.</p>

            <p>Good news, people who're still interested in giving <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> a go for reasons that don't involve gleefully watching as a poor NPC undergoes a sudden glitchy elongation. Developers Build A Rocket Boy have just pushed out the first in a series of updates designed to swat a bunch of the performance and crash-related issues that've plagued the game's launch.
</p>
<p>If you were busy with other hobbies such as arctic exploration or hardcore spelunking earlier this week, the GTA/Cyberpunky Mindseye suffered a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mindseye-launches-to-clips-of-atvs-glitchily-spaghettifying-a-bloke-named-seb-but-a-patch-is-on-the-way">pretty nightmarish debut</a>. The user reviews weren't totally negative right out of the gate, but it's fair to say it didn't land in the fashion ex-Rockstar bigwig Leslie Benzies' studio probably hoped.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Cue the release of today's <a href="https://x.com/MindsEyeGame/status/1933482714444730741">first hotfix</a> for the game, which has arrived "on an expedited timeline as the first in a series of patches" designed to address the myriad of technical issues players have been having and act on their feedback.</p>
<p>Out now on PC and PS5, with Xbox soon to follow, the patch includes "CPU and GPU performance improvements, along with memory optimizations" - as part of that last bit, the memory leak that had been identified as the cause of a number of different crashes has been rectified. Build A Rocket Boy have also introduced new "pop-up warnings" on PC that'll tell you if Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling is disabled or if you've got a machine with a CPU which has "potential crash issues". I assume these pop-ups'll be something like little text boxes that say 'uh oh'.</p>
<p>The hotfix makes MindsEye's CPR mini-game easier, in what could be construed a as wonderfully ironic metaphor for the situation the game's ended up in performance-wise. It also adds in the ability to mess around with the depth of field, and fixes issues with "missing controls in the MineHunter and Run Dungeon mini-games".
</p>
<p>"Performance optimisation is our number one focus and an ongoing commitment that will take further time," Build A Rocket Boy pledge in the hotfix's notes, adding: "We will continue to provide frequent and transparent updates. Our team is committed to do everything possible to urgently action your feedback."</p>
<p>We'll have to see if these efforts are enough to turn the game's fortunes around, with first impressions being as important as ever for games, regardless of whether they've got ex-GTA bloke buzz.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>At Remap, we've never tried to separate politics from video games. It goes all the way back to the earliest days of Waypoint, which itself as born out of Austin and Patrick's previous experiences at places like Giant Bomb, wherein they encountered friction while keeping the two top of mind. </em></p><p><em>Depending on how you experienced Summer Game Fest last weekend, it either felt like equal parts ominous and impressive or merely a slideshow of trailers that blurred into nonsense. Patrick was playing games while helicopters circled, while Rob probably went on a long dog walk.</em></p><p><em>But while only one of them was in Los Angeles, both of them have actually lived in the city at different times. It is hardly the city portrayed on TV, even at its worst. To characterize "Los Angeles" with a broad brush reveals you've never spent meaningful time there. That is true of many cities, but especially true of one as sprawling as Los Angeles.</em></p><p><em>Which brings us to this week's letter series, as Rob and Patrick the strangeness of the past week and what it was like from both perspectives.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Finding your way to Sega’s section at Summer Game Fest requires you to briefly head outdoors. It’s a nice and semi-open space that made for an awfully comfortable way to play one of my favorite games at the show, a deliciously slick updated take on Sega’s <em>Shinobi</em> series called <em>Art of Vengeance</em>. The game rules. But in the opening moments, your clan is invaded, and in the background, you can faintly see tanks rolling through. I slowly blinked, and that’s when I realized I could also hear the soft hum of helicopters circling overhead, related to the ongoing anti-ICE protests that kicked off around the same time as Summer Game Fest itself.&nbsp;</p><p>(Just days prior, ICE raids had taken place in a notable LA area called the Fashion District that surrounds Summer Game Fest. Elements of the protest even began blocks from the event.)</p><p>I took a deep breath in-between my admiration for <em>Art of Vengeanc</em>e’s ugly beauty, a kinetic and satisfying mess of grace and violence, and tried to ignore my stomach turning into knots. When I left the demo, forcing me outside for a moment, the helicopters were closer, the buzzing louder. You could always look around and catch someone looking into the sky and trying to shake it off.</p><p>Moments later, tucked back inside with endless kiosks running a parade of different games, the aerial white noise disappeared. Here, I could be <em>a gamer</em>. I don’t even mean that as a joke, really. It was a welcomed relief from wondering whether I should just head back to the airport, a notion that was affirmed whenever my phone would buzz with a new alarming push notification.</p><p>“Trump is…”</p><p>“Trump announced..”</p><p>I flicked my notifications off 24 hours, shuffled over to an appointment for a game called <em>Relooted</em>, where a group of thieves decide to reclaim stolen African artifacts from Western museums. The game’s made (largely) in South Africa, and when I ask for an interview, the game’s (white) creative director sighs and informs me the other (black) members of his team that were supposed to be in attendance had their travel visa applications immediately denied.</p><p>The game—think <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> meets <em>Ocean’s 11 </em>with a little sci-fi—is looking cool, though.</p><p>Little moments like this were everywhere at Summer Game Fest. One team couldn’t have their planned dinner because part of the highway was shut down. Another developer asked to cut our interview time in half because they were afraid to stick around and wanted to head to the airport. Our server for dinner on Monday offered a heartfelt apology for departing halfway through the meal because the overzealous march of the police was reportedly gathering around their home.</p><p>We’ve joked in the past at the awkward ways Geoff Keighley tries to dance around politics, industry controversies, and the steady beat of crisis layoffs amidst what’s essentially a big ass marketing event. But what made this year’s Summer Game Fest notable, at least to the people who were attending in person, was how the outside world’s events became utterly inescapable.&nbsp;</p><p>I do not know how much that came through, or was felt, to outsiders. What was it like for you?</p><figure><figcaption><span>GameDiscoverCo is a really good newsletter, btw.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Far more normal, because news is covered as a series of discrete topics rather than events happening in a place where the rest of life is happening alongside the major news story. So “LA protests” are a thing that were all over my news pages, but not electronics or culture pages. I was startled every time I saw someone at SGF post about hearing the discharge of crowd control munitions of passing by a police rally point on their way to a hotel, because it served as such a vivid reminder that the neat division of subject matter that exists in how we consume news media is entirely artificial.</p><p>That feeling is probably amplified a bit by the New York and D.C. bias that exists in a lot of mainstream media, where LA is especially poorly understood because it’s so different from eastern cities. Janet talked a bit about this on the podcast, but I think you and I have both experienced it ourselves: we went to live in LA with a set of expectations for the city, and then found it mocked those expectations and generalizations. But in a moment like this, living outside LA, you see the city as it is so often depicted: flattened by a high-angle helicopter shot through clouds of tear gas, portraying acres of concrete covered in riot police and protestors.</p>

The recently released Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition, however, may be Warhammer 40,000’s first video game misstep in some time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition is a re-release of Relic Entertainment’s 2011 action game, Space Marine. Both Games Workshop and publisher Sega are not calling this a remaster. Instead they point to quality-of-life and graphical improvements "that take the Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine experience to the next level."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These include higher fidelity and improved textures, 4k resolution, "improved" character models, a modernized control scheme and interface overhaul, and remastered audio.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition launched on June 10 across Xbox Series X and S and PC, and straight into Game Pass (there’s no word on a PS5 version). It’s going down better on Game Pass, where gaming is often more disposable and subscribers are free to try games out and discard them on a whim if they don’t like what they see. On Steam, however, where Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition costs $39.99 / £34.99, it’s getting destroyed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition currently has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Valve’s platform. Complaints revolve around the high price of the game relative to the changes it makes over the Anniversary Edition, and, on those changes, bemusement in response to what many believe is worse usability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, coupled with struggles to find others to play with online, has caused some to call Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition a "cash grab."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was very excited for the idea of this being updated but honestly? I prefer the older version,” reads one negative Steam user review. “It feels better and looks better. Why couldn't this just be an update or something? And for the price tag it just feels very meh. And this is one of my all time favourite games too. Just gonna install the older version and play through that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Too bad, I really wanted to play this game,” reads another. “No players in PvP multiplayer. No players in co-op Exterminatus horde mode. FOV problem, aiming down sight makes 1000000x zoom. No option to change FOV. Maybe get it on sale after upgrades and updates and working enabled crossplay matchmaking. Refunded, sadly.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I bought and get refund” said one disgruntled customer. “Buy the Anniversary Edition, it's almost the same but it isn't a cash grab (around 7€ for a key).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Look how they massacred my boy,” declared another.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a similar sentiment across social media, Discords, and subreddits. “Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition is a mess,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1laagiu/warhammer_40000_space_marine_master_crafted/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor KitsuneLynx</a>, highlighting problems even on Xbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This game came out a few days ago and has shown itself to be an absolute mess and disappointment. When I heard this remake was coming out, I was so hyped, I was curious what they'd do and was excited to play it on Xbox after having played it on PC a while back. I was disappointed to say the least.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This game is a buggy, janky mess that didn't bother to fix anything and instead made a worse UI, odd visual changes, etc. Why make the Orks all Goffs now? The colors helped recognize each unit, now they all blend together to the point it's hard to decipher which is which. WHERE ARE THE DEDICATED SERVERS? Not to mention the NEW jank and bugs that came with this release that weren't present in the previous remaster. It didn't bother to fix the jank or make the game feel revitalized, this IS the definition of a lazy cash grab. Charging this game for 40+ USD is criminal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Crossplay is off by default which just leads to the game shooting itself in the foot when it comes to vacant servers. My wife also just experienced a bug which is more common than it should be where when you boot up the game, there is a chance for your save file to corrupt and reset ALL OF YOUR PROGRESS. Why hasn't this game received a patch yet? I can't imagine all the other bugs I haven't seen yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If you're planning on playing this game, either get it on Game Pass or wait for a sale and mega patch, otherwise stay on Space Marine 2 or play the remaster on PC.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that there <em>are </em>players who are having a reasonable time with the game, although anecdotally most of them appear to be on Game Pass. Similarly, those who have never played Space Marine before seem to be enjoying experiencing the events that lead into last year’s blockbuster hit, Space Marine 2. Steam, then, appears to be the focal point of the backlash.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hope is that Sega will announce incoming improvements sooner rather than later, as Space Marine is generally remembered fondly by those who played it back in the day. In 2025, with Warhammer 40,000 at the peak of its popularity and with a flood of newcomers sparked by the success of Space Marine 2, it’s important Space Marine gets it right. The Inquisition, after all, is always watching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/directive-8020-might-give-the-dark-pictures-saga-a-massive-upgrade<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">We played an early portion of the upcoming horror adventure game and had to reckon with some tough choices.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Supermassive Games really made their mark on the horror game landscape with 2015's Until Dawn, but the Dark Pictures Anthology really brought the heat by offering gaming's closest analog to Netflix's Black Mirror series. With the latest installment on the way, the developers have plans for an ambitious return that finally ventures into sci-fi horror while also putting players in more direct control of the tense encounters that await the characters in this dark story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At Summer Game Fest 2025, we got to play a particularly fateful encounter from the upcoming Directive 8020, which continues the Dark Pictures saga. We also saw just how the sci-fi horror adventure game mixes things up with more real-time gameplay encounters that bring the series and its strong narrative hooks closer to a true survival horror experience.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking place in the far future, where Earth is on the verge of collapse, a crew of scientists and space colonists travel to a distant planet poised to become humanity's next home. But as you'd guess for a horror game, the planet is home to another malevolent entity, and the crew is forced to survive against a mysterious alien presence that can mutate and take the form of any living person on board their ship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Actress Lashana Lynch – seen in The Day of the Jackal and Captain Marvel – leads the cast of characters as the pilot of the ship, and her early scenes in Directive 8020 make her such a compelling lead in this bleak story. The game leans into similar themes of paranoia, isolation, and fear of the unknown – which makes for an excellent setup for a Dark Pictures game. The developers were particularly inspired by sci-fi films like Event Horizon, Alien, and John Carpenter's The Thing, which helped establish the style of horror and sense of dread that Directive 8020 goes for.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to game director Will Doyle, who guided me through the SGF demo, Directive 8020 will still feature many of the hallmarks of a Dark Pictures experience. Still, it will also mark the start of more active gameplay sequences and choices that aim to increase the fear factor within this extended episode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've had this idea for more real-time threats in my mind for a long time and throughout season one of the Dark Pictures, and the main reason we wanted to do it was to increase the fear factor for the games," said the game director. "There's nothing more scary than when you're in direct control and the creatures are trying to hunt you down and kill you. That gets your heart pumping, and that was a significant part of our motivation. We also wanted to expand our audience with more engaging gameplay. It's still a cinematic, story-driven game, but it does have moments where you are making those decisions and actions with more direct control."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I got to see this real-time action sequence during a story segment where the Captain and another crew member were confronted by their alien impostors. Playing as the second crew member, the imposter mutates into a grotesque monster, and I have to evade it from within the maintenance area of the ship. This played out in a tense and unnerving stealth sequence that felt similar to Dead Space or Resident Evil, which lends Directive 8020 a classic survival horror-like feel. As this is a Dark Pictures game, permanent death is a thing, and if I hadn't gotten this character out away from his imposter, the main story would have evolved differently.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Permanent death is a thing, and if I hadn't gotten this character out away from his imposter, the main story would have evolved differently.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Directive 8020 heightens the sense of paranoia and tension when making fateful survival choices. Given that Supermassive Games' pedigree of horror adventure games is about making decisions to keep a group of survivors and friends alive to the end of the story – the added twist in Directive 8020's story with your crew being replaced by alien imposters presents an unsettling wrinkle.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A fateful moment occurred when the Captain returned to the crew and had to decide where to shoot a crew member who had seemingly come in contact with the alien entity. Much like the games from the developers, these flashpoint moments are among the most consequential points in the story. Without giving away spoilers, I made a decision that I would come to regret. Still, according to the game director, these moments can also be rolled back using the turning point system – which acts as an optional story tracker and rewind system, allowing players to view different moments and choose a different path if they wish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, Directive 8020 is set to be a welcome return to the Dark Pictures series. And with the focus on giving players more direct control of the action while also heightening the sense of distrust in your dwindling party of survivors, the next game looks to offer one of the more unique and game-changing episodes the series has seen yet.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It also reduces the difficulty for the CPR mini-game, adds a new setting to disable or modify Depth of Field, and fixes missing controls in the MineHunter and Run Dungeon mini-games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On PC, there are new pop-up warnings for PCs that have Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling disabled, and PCs with CPUs that have potential crash issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy said this patch also fixes the memory leak issue that had been causing most crashes reported by players. “Performance optimisation is our number one focus and an ongoing commitment that will take further time,” it added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We will continue to provide frequent and transparent updates. Our team is committed to do everything possible to urgently action your feedback,” Build A Rocket Boy said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy has said that by the end of June, players can expect ongoing performance and stability improvements, a rebalanced ‘hard’ difficulty setting, animation fixes, and AI improvements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question is whether the developer, which was founded by former Rockstar North chief Leslie Benzies, can turn MindsEye around. On Steam, which does not paint the whole picture of MindsEye’s current popularity, the game hit a peak concurrent player count of 3,302 on launch, but had a 24-hour peak of just 786 players. At the time of this article’s publication, 435 people were playing on Steam, with a 'mixed' user review rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/06/devil-may-cry-5-review">Devil May Cry 5 review</a> returned a 9.5. We said: "Devil May Cry 5's trio of outstanding combat styles set a new high bar for the series, and its mysterious story keeps things interesting along the way."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Six years later, Devil May Cry 5 must go down as a blockbuster success for Capcom. “The title has garnered strong support from users due to its exceptional gameplay experience, leading to expanded sales as a catalog title since its release,” the company said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Capcom provided an even more advanced story and action elements in the game with the addition of a new playable character, and more recently, on April 3, 2025, the company released the new Devil May Cry animated series on Netflix, in line with the company’s Single Content Multiple Usage strategy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The animated series has garnered critical acclaim from around the world, and with more than 5.3 million views it ranked fourth during its first week globally in the "Shows | English" category, while also ranking in the top 10 for seven consecutive days in Japan. As a result of the game’s exhilarating action, and due to efforts to enhance brand awareness by leveraging the title beyond the scope of video games, including television adaptations, the title has now exceeded 10 million units in cumulative sales worldwide.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Devil May Cry 5’s success (the franchise as whole has sold more than 33 million units since the first game came out in 2001), begs the question: when will Devil May Cry 6 be released? It seems inevitable that another game will be greenlit, if it hasn’t already, given DMC5 has sold 10 million in the six years since launch in 2019.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Devil May Cry Weapons, Ranked</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom isn’t giving anything away at this point, of course, and it has a lot on its plate already. Apart from continuing to work on already released games such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>, it has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-will-be-playable-in-both-first-and-third-person-at-launch-capcom-confirms">the just announced Resident Evil: Requiem</a> on the way as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcoms-pragmata-reemerges-at-sony-state-of-play">the re-revealed Pragmata</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Devil May Cry 5 is by some margin the best-selling Devil May Cry game, and has now cracked the top 10 best-selling Capcom games ever list.

For instance, the Switch 1 version of PokémonLegends Z-A is selling for <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWYYo7?object_uuid=49ee0e52-4913-467f-9a7f-722fcc5abcdb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">£49.99 both physically and digitally</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z11og?object_uuid=49ee0e52-4913-467f-9a7f-722fcc5abcdb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">physical version on Switch 2 is selling for £58.99</a>, but you can buy it digitally for £57.99 through the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qmnnb6?object_uuid=49ee0e52-4913-467f-9a7f-722fcc5abcdb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrade pack</a>.

Each variation contains both a Z-A starter Pokémon pin set, enclosed in a snazzy case, and a figurine each of Mega Charizard X (8 x 10 m) and Mega Charizard Y ( 8 x 8cm). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as the promo images go by, they seem like decent figurines considering the added price and included pins. On the other hand, if Pokémon swag is more your thing, then the <a href="https://zdcs.link/91jjGx?object_uuid=49ee0e52-4913-467f-9a7f-722fcc5abcdb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legends: Z-A Trainer Bundle</a> is more for you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For an extra £13/14 from the standard editions, £62.99 for the Switch 1 version &amp; £71.99 for the Switch 2 version, you’ll also get a Mega Evolution-themed umbrella, cap, and mug featuring Tepig, Chikorita, and Totodile. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The huge <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjppPe?object_uuid=49ee0e52-4913-467f-9a7f-722fcc5abcdb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Champion’s Choice Bundle</a>, for an added £20, though, gives you the entire lot from the Mega Evolution and Trainer Bundles.

<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-admits-marathon-feedback-has-been-varied-but-insists-it-will-avoid-repeating-concord-mistakes-and-commits-to-launch-by-end-of-march-2026" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">As reported by IGN</a>, Hulst said feedback from Marathon's latest alpha test was "varied," but he maintains that the live-service category remains a "great opportunity" for the company. Concord, Hulst said, was "insufficiently differentiated" in a "hyper competitive segment" of gaming, referring to live-service multiplayer games.</p><p>"We have reviewed our processes in light of this to deeply understand how and why that title failed to meet expectations and to ensure we're not going to make the same mistakes again," he said.</p><p>Hulst said Sony now has a "much more rigorous process" in place for "validating" the company's hypotheses as it relates to a game's creative and commercial possibilities.</p><p>For Marathon, Hulst said the aim is to create a "very bold, very innovative, and deeply engaging title." The response to the Marathon alpha test was mixed, and Hulst said the whole idea of offering early tests is to gain feedback that can then be used to improve the product.</p><p>"This cycle of test, of iterate, test again, that is such a key component of the live-service success, both leading up to launch but also throughout the life of the game," he said.</p><p>Hulst did not, however, comment on the controversy surrounding Marathon as it relates to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">Bungie admitting it found stolen art assets in Marathon.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/" data-ref-id="1100-6530826">GameSpot's Marathon preview</a> said, "In a world of free-to-play titles, a paid game that is light on content but full of hopes, dreams, and ambitions may not be enough to inspire in others the same confidence I have in Bungie."</p><p>Marathon is slated for release on September 23. Some theorized it could be delayed, but it remains on track, at least as of now.</p><p>In regards to Sony's live-service plans in general, Hulst said the company is "very, very committed to building a diverse and a resilient live-service portfolio."</p><p>In related news, it was confirmed this week that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-lays-off-30-of-days-gone-developer-bend-studio-after-canceling-live-service-game/1100-6532332/" data-ref-id="1100-6532332">Sony cut staff at the studio behind Days Gone after cancelling a live-service game at the studio.</a> Before this, Sony reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">canceled a live-service God of War title</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">developer Naughty Dog canceled The Last of Us Online</a> back in 2023.

			<p>PlayStation executives <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_01_ja/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engaged</a> in a fireside chat with investors earlier today. Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO and president Hideaki Nishino talked about the platform's future, as reported in this article, while Hermen Hulst, who now heads the Studio Business Group but reports to Nishino <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-leadership-changes-again-nishino-takes-over/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the latest shuffle</a>, talked about Sony's commitment to making and maintaining live service games following early successes (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helldivers 2</a>) and failures (<a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concord</a>). On that note, Hulst said that while much work went into Concord, the game launched into a hyper-competitive segment and was not unique enough to stand apart. Needless to say, the goal is to avoid repeating the same mistakes with PlayStation's next big live service launch, Marathon.</p>
<p><em>We remain very committed to building a diverse and resilient live service portfolio. We have MLB The Show, Destiny 2, and Helldivers 2. These are really good examples of the type of titles that we're looking to develop. These titles have already established an enduring set of player experiences and communities across quite a wide range of different genres. Together, that provides a really good foundation for our ambitions in this category. I would say that, additionally, we are continuing to invest in new live services, with Helldivers 2 providing such a great example of the level of success we can achieve if we get everything right. That game has been a true breakout success. It's been attracting and retaining a significant community. This ongoing success is further evidenced in how we deal with the monetization, as microtransactions now make more than half of that game's revenue. We're also very excited about Marathon's anticipated launch in this fiscal year.</em></p>
<p><em>With live service, we really see that as a great opportunity for us, but with that great opportunity, there are some unique challenges associated. We've talked about the early success with Helldivers 2, but we also faced some challenges with the release of Concord. I think that some really good work, actually, went into that title, some really big effort. But ultimately, that title entered a hyper-competitive segment of the market. I think it was insufficiently differentiated to be able to resonate with players. We have reviewed our processes to ensure that we're not going to make those mistakes again. We have introduced much more rigorous processes for validating our creative, commercial, and development assumptions, and we now do that on a much more ongoing basis.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>That plan will ensure we are investing in the right opportunities at the right time, all while maintaining much more predictable timelines. For Marathon, it's our goal to release a very bold, very innovative and deeply engaging title. It's going to be the first new Bungie title in over a decade, so we are really excited for that release. Going through the test cycle, we're monitoring the Closed Alpha that the team have just gone through. We're taking all the lessons learned and we're using the capabilities we've built to understand how audiences are engaging with the title. Some of that feedback, frankly, has been varied. But that's super useful; that's why you do this testing. When launch comes, we're going to give the title the optimal chance at success. This cycle of test, iterate, test again, it's such a key component of the live service success, both leading up to launch but also throughout the life of the game.</em></p>
<p>Marathon, an extraction first-person shooter game based on the old Bungie franchise, will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-marathon-gameplay-release-date-announced-for-september-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> on September 23 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-white-guardian-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Koei Tecmo has announced the release date for upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</em>.</p>

<p>The game, which was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-and-white-guardian" rel="nofollow">all the way back in September last year</a>, will be launching across PS5, Switch, and PC on September 26th. It doesn't appear that a native Switch 2 port will be available at launch, at the very least.</p>

<p><em>The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>will serve as a followup to&nbsp;the original&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-global-release-date" rel="nofollow">released last year as a free-to-play RPG</a>. Unlike its predecessor, however, this new game won't be an online-based gacha RPG, but instead a fully-fledged&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atelier-resleriana-the-red-alchemist-the-white-guardian-release-date-sophie.jpg?itok=U-Qq1I7y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atelier-resleriana-the-red-alchemist-the-white-guardian-release-date-sophie.jpg?itok=9PYlGqeY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>launches in September.</figcaption></figure><p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</em>&nbsp;aims to fuse familiar&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>elements with new, experimental features. It'll stand in contrast to&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia</em>, which, as Koei Tecmo says, "aimed to create the next generation of&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>games" (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-yumia-sales-300k-fastest-selling" rel="nofollow">rather successfully, it should be noted</a>).</p>

<p>The new game takes place in the fallen town of Hallfein, which has been devastated by a "mysterious disaster" that "caused most of its residents to disappear". After some time, however, two former residents of Hallfein, Rias and Slade, return to the town to discover the truth of what really happened.</p>

<p>Much like&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>will also feature characters from previous&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>games. Sophie, Wilbell, Totori, and Raze will all be making an appearance as playable characters "in segments of the game".</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo says&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>will revolve around "the core&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>series gameplay cycle of exploration, synthesis, and battles", but that you'll also be able to develop the town of Hallfein, operating your own shop and selling what you make.</p>




<p><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3259600/Atelier_Resleriana_The_Red_Alchemist__the_White_Guardian/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch on September 26th.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, Hideo Kojima admitted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2s-scoring-well-with-test-reviewers-but-kojima-isnt-satisfied/1100-6531555/" data-ref-id="1100-6531555">he felt conflicted about the positive reception</a> that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> received from game testers. At the time, Kojima said that he doesn't want to make blockbusters that "need an 80% approval rating" and preferred to remain controversial. Now, Kojima has revisited his comments and explained why he wants a divisive response from players.</p><p>While speaking through his interpreter, Kojima Productions' Aki Saito, Kojima told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOygCKsTMP0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Informer</a> that the reason he doesn't want a blockbuster is because those are the kind of games that are easily forgotten. Instead, he wants Death Stranding 2 to withstand the test of time over the next few decades.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Death Stranding 2: On The Beach – "Explore. Connect. Survive." Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"Recently, all the entertainment things are like easy to chew, easy to digest," explained Kojima. "But with Death Stranding, I thought it needs people who love it, and people who don't love it because it's a new thing. It's the same as Metal Gear. It took 10 years until Metal Gear was recognized as a good game. For Death Stranding 2, when I tested it, it wasn't like that. Everyone liked it. That's why I said, 'Maybe this is a problem.' It was more [liked] than my prediction."</p><p>Although Kojima has acknowledged leaving <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-reveals-he-has-a-usb-stick-of-game-ideas-for-his-studio-to-use-after-he-dies/1100-6531577/" data-ref-id="1100-6531577">a USB stick full of his ideas for video games</a> for use after his death, he recently indicated that he doesn't want his successors at Kojima Productions <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-doesnt-want-his-company-to-imitate-him-after-hes-gone/1100-6532356/" data-ref-id="1100-6532356">to simply make games the way he made them</a>. He feels that the company would fail if it takes that approach.</p><p>Death Stranding 2 is hitting PlayStation 5 on June 26. After that game, Kojima's next titles are the Xbox-exclusive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a> and the spy-action game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/" data-ref-id="5000-617596">Physint</a>. Kojima is also working with A24 on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-wants-the-death-stranding-movie-to-be-a-new-dimension-of-what-a-game-adaptation-can-be/1100-6528061/" data-ref-id="1100-6528061">Death Stranding movie</a> and planning to potentially direct his own original film.</p>

Paradox Soul made its debut in 2018, and it's yours for the taking if you grab it fast.</p><p>Paradox Soul was developed by Ritual Games and published on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/610570/Paradox_Soul/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> by GrabTheGames. The story is set in Iceland in 1987 and it places players in control of Dr. Alli Rose, a research scientist who is exploring a test facility filled with secrets and deadly robot enemies to fight. Much like many of the older video game titles, Paradox Soul's game art doesn't closely resemble the graphics used in the actual gameplay.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ7sih3hYxQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cZ7sih3hYxQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Physically, Alli is an ordinary woman, but she can collect suits in the game that upgrade her offensive capabilities, including a Samus Aran-like ball form that Alli can use to attack her foes. The game's description also teases "terrifyingly epic boss fights" and a "hand-crafted labyrinth of evil."</p><p>Paradox Soul has been released on consoles and it's currently on sale for $1 on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0891-CUSA15807_00-RATGAPARADOXSOUL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PSN</a>, and available on Xbox One and Nintendo Switch as well. But you can only get it for free on Steam through June 17. The Steam version comes with digital trading cards that include art from the game and "unique emoticons with a sci-fi edge."</p><p>This isn't the only retro throwback style game that is currently free on Steam. Furi Demake is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-this-free-steam-game-before-it-becomes-paid/1100-6531387/" data-ref-id="1100-6531387">available to players without charge</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Split Fiction Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/155171/large.jpg"></a></figure><p>In many ways, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> feels like the culmination of everything Hazelight Studios has accomplished in the co-op space.</p>
<p>The journey began with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/brothers_a_tale_of_two_sons">Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</a>, a charming fantasy that required solo players to coordinate both thumbs to control two characters simultaneously. The studio then progressed to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/a_way_out">A Way Out</a>, a jailbreak caper that introduced several clever mechanics for two players, including the now-standard Friend's Pass system (more on that later). With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a>, Hazelight pushed things even further, delivering a big adventure with a well-written, emotionally resonant story and great characters.</p>
<p>Now comes Split Fiction, a near-flawless dual odyssey that perfects the studio's formula and delivers an epic experience of staggering variety. The game’s many co-op trials might put your strongest relationships to the test, but you will never stop having fun.</p>
<figure><a title="Split Fiction Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156748/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The story is, fittingly, about stories. Mio and Zoe are two aspiring writers lured to the shady tech giant Rader Publishing by the promise of a no-strings book deal. Upon arrival, they’re suited up in <strong>Tron</strong>-like bodysuits and instructed to enter a set of strange, floating bubbles. Mio hesitates and, after a brief struggle, ends up inside Zoe’s bubble. They awaken inside the physical manifestation of their combined imagination. The two unlikely companions must survive their own ideas, while trying to stop Rader from stealing their IP.</p>
<p>The adventure unfolds across two vastly different mindscapes, built from the main characters' chosen theme. Mio’s choice of fiction is cyberpunk-style sci-fi, while Zoe prefers cosy fantasy. These contrasting settings give Hazelight the perfect excuse to drop partners into dramatically different environments that demand teamwork, creative problem solving, and synchronised playstyles.</p>
<p>At its heart, Split Fiction thrives on this collision of two distinct genres, using the stylistic clash as a narrative engine to drive inventive cooperative gameplay. The plot is built to sustain momentum; Mio and Zoe are constantly plunged into tense, in-media-res scenarios that keep the action moving and the players engaged.</p>

<p>After a brief introduction at Rader Corp, our deuteragonists are thrown straight into chaos, first piloting a spaceship in a frantic battle, then fleeing from a horde of giant ogres. Soon after, they’re swinging across the rooftop of a futuristic nightclub and bouncing around as a pair of pigs in a (surprisingly dark) fairytale scenario. This all happens in the opening chapter.</p>
<p>Each world is packed with elaborate set pieces, and the action rarely lets up. Mio and Zoe leap from one high-energy scenario to the next, pausing only occasionally for charming, character-driven moments that deepen their bond. Slowly bringing these two contrasting archetypes together in the middle of all this action is a storytelling masterstroke, one that pays off in the game's phenomenal final act.</p>
<p>So, what do you actually do in Split Fiction? What genre is it? The answer, quite simply, is all of them. It’s a puzzle game, a shooter, a brawler, and a platformer, sometimes all within the same level. Across its lengthy main story, there’s a little bit of everything. This grab-bag format means that you have a consistent grasp on what you will have to do next.</p>

<p>The only drawback is that, by its very nature, the game doesn't linger on any one activity for long. That’s unfortunate, because many of its ideas are strong enough to support a full game on their own.</p>
<p>Each chapter grants the aspiring writers a unique ability, and most of the level’s progression is built around using that power in creative ways. Often, both players are required to perform different tasks simultaneously, making strong communication and patience essential. These challenges never feel overwhelming, and the game’s generous checkpoint system ensures that frustration is kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>There are still moments that will really test the patience of you and your partner. Faster-paced sequences, like high-speed chases or boss fights, are often hilarious exercises in trial and error.</p>
<figure><a title="Split Fiction Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/155174/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>What makes Split Fiction exceptional is the sheer variety of challenges you face. There are hundreds of mechanically distinct minigames spread across this adventure and every single one feels thoughtfully crafted. Alongside the linear main story, optional side quests offer wild artistic swings and some of the most difficult activities in the game.</p>
<p>An unexpected bonus of this solid Switch 2 port is that it's a nice showcase of the console's capabilities, with the exception of mouse control, which is unfortunately missing.</p>
<p>Firstly, it looks great. This is a gorgeous game, with a vibrant art style and busy environments that often move at breakneck speeds. Performance remains stable throughout, with a locked 30fps that has only the slightest of stumbles in handheld mode for some of the bigger set pieces. It would be nice to have 60fps, but it runs incredibly well with the lower frame rate.</p>
<p>The big feature here is the Friend's Pass system. Like previous Hazelight titles, two separate consoles can share a single copy of the game. This time, too, you can use Switch 2 and Nintendo’s GameShare feature to host a session that an original Switch can join. This not only offers incredible value but also ensures that co-op partners who don’t own the new console aren’t left out. As it's running from the host console and not an installed version of the game, the performance on the OG Switch can be a tad unpredictable, but it's mostly steady.</p>
<figure><a title="Split Fiction Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156755/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Alongside GameShare — and the option to play local splitscreen and online — there’s also crossplay, so there’s a generous number of ways to play with others.</p>
<p>Split Fiction is a singular experience, one that you'll want to jump right back into after the credits roll. It's the crowning achievement of Hazelight, a studio whose every release is becoming a notable event. It's also a great time on Switch 2 and ranks among the very best of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-launch-games-all-day-one-releases">the launch lineup</a>.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Split Fiction feels like a gift. Its sole aim is to entertain and bring players together by testing them at every turn. Hazelight gives us two distinct worlds, each filled with a huge array of activities for co-op partners to enjoy and argue over. It serves as a surprising visual showcase for the Switch 2 and enhances the Friend's Pass feature, allowing our original Switch buddies to join in the fun.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/escape-academy-2-preview-puzzles-within-puzzles<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{11}" paraid="1549716025"><em>Escape Academy 2: Back 2 School</em> is everything you would want in a sequel. It’s bigger in scope, addresses its faults, and digs into what made the first one work even more.</p>

<h2 paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{11}" paraid="1549716025">A Story and Characters Full of Intrigue</h2>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{25}" paraid="706658818"><em>Escape Academy 2</em> takes place after the first game, with you returning to school as the hero of the first game that everyone knows. Of course, that means you’re understood to be a master puzzler and will challenged as such.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{47}" paraid="441155158">Getting to know the academy, its professors, the founders, and the overarching lore of where the game is set will be important this time around, too. It’s not that you’ll need intimate knowledge of it all, but there will be puzzles that use that information.</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{47}" paraid="441155158">There's hints at some sneaky business going on as well. I mean, they are professors of an insane academy to teach people how to escape elaborate puzzles. They have to be up to something.</p>



<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{61}" paraid="516747078">Moreover, there will be more context given to any one puzzle. Why am I in this one particular reason beyond solving a puzzle? The developers want players to be engaged more beyond "hey solve this problem we’ve put in front of you." In other words, they're hoping for some investment beyond the nature of the puzzle itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{73}" paraid="1391258185">They’ve taken a different approach to the escape room aspect as well. The first game featured a lot of countdowns and timers to ratchet up the tension as you tried to solve the puzzle to any one room.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{81}" paraid="2137528575">While <em>Escape Academy 2</em> will still feature that sometimes, like in the introductory classroom you must escape, they are much fewer and far between. The developers told us that they received a lot of feedback that people wanted more time to just figure out puzzles. The stress a timer put on everything just wasn't something they were looking for.</p>

<h2 paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{81}" paraid="2137528575">Escape Academy 2 Goes Open World Puzzling</h2>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{87}" paraid="2061573449">To that end, there are two different sets of puzzles and problems to solve. Many will be the classic, here’s a thing to figure out in this specific room. All the information and objects you’ll need will be found there.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{109}" paraid="1363664629">The big change in <em>Escape Academy 2</em> is that there will be some “open world” puzzling to get involved with as well. You’ll have the Academy to explore, which is of course full of many secrets to uncover. In my brief time with the game, it was hard not to look at every little detail or furnishing and not assume it was relevant to some puzzle somewhere.</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{109}" paraid="1363664629">Of course, progressing through the open world is gained by solving puzzles as well. That may be figuring out a certain puzzle in a hallway that then leads a nearby student to give you a key card as thanks, or something more. You'll need to gain access to new areas through solving things in the world.</p>



<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{155}" paraid="2132570097">As for the puzzles themselves, what I saw in my short time with the demo was really cool. Nothing was frustrating, I never felt like the information I needed was too far away, nor was there any of the moon logic nonsense some people worry about.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{163}" paraid="1716671636">Solving puzzles was always satisfying, and the pacing was impeccable. I was always just around the corner on some sort of breakthrough while I was maybe collecting some more problems to solve. It felt like I was always making progress even with the conveyer belt of puzzles heading right for me.</p>

<h2 paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{163}" paraid="1716671636">Awesome Visual Puzzle Design</h2>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{173}" paraid="994646972">Also, so many of them were wonderfully designed visually. It’s hard to not give away too much without explaining, but I wanted to give one pretty cool example.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{183}" paraid="959658166">I had to solve a few different puzzles to open up a large set of bookcases, but those gave me access to a series of books I could pull out or leave in. The puzzle was to figure out which books to pull out to let a beam of light either travel through it or be reflected off a mirror. I could see the titles of the books and had found a scrap of paper that told me what kinds of books to pull out, like removing the books that rhyme with "rocks", for example.</p>



<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{183}" paraid="959658166">While doing this, I wasn't quite sure what the beam of light would do or if it was just getting to some end goal. As I went further along, it became more apparent that the beam started to form giant numbers that I needed to input as a code to unlock something else in the room. It was a great reveal that I didn't see coming immediately but was so satisfying to see the finished product.</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{199}" paraid="2104756473">The most impressive part to me, however, was just how screwing up the books I pulled out could cause the light beam to line up in such a way that it made a different number. It wasn't simply just a bunch of screwed up lines, though it could be that at times too.</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{199}" paraid="2104756473">My short time with <em>Escape Academy 2: Back 2 School</em> was a wonderful time. I was engaged the whole time and the puzzles were so satisfying to solve. With a bit of a surge in puzzle games thanks to the likes of Blue Prince and others, I think people should keep an eye on this one.</p>

<hr><p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{199}" paraid="2104756473"><em>Escape Academy 2: Back 2 School </em>was previewed at Summer Game Fest.</p>

If you can raise multiple phantoms simultaneously, they can easily overwhelm enemies. The phantoms also serve as distractions for you and your teammates.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-paramount-plus-new-season-1851784460<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a streaming world where new series are decreasingly unlikely to get a second season (let alone a third) even if they appear to perform incredibly well, it’s something of a treat that Paramount keeps giving its various incarnations of <em>Star Trek</em> five season runs. The company has recently announced, ahead of the start of the third season of the best of all those shows, <em>Strange New Worlds</em>, that it’s to get a fourth <em>and</em> a fifth season too! Woo! Although that fifth run will be truncated, and be its last. Boo!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197585" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Hot-Fix Is On The Way For MindsEye's Frustrating CPR Mini-Game" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="120" data-playlist="197585,197583,197582" data-current="197585"><div><p>A Hot-Fix Is On The Way For MindsEye's Frustrating CPR Mini-Game</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197585/197585_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197585/197585_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197585/197585_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23106.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The experiments in the final frontier have had mixed results over the last decade. Beginning with the very promising <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em> in 2017, the long-abandoned television franchise returned from a 12-year hiatus since the (merciful) demise of <em>Star Trek: Enterprise </em>in 2005—a period that had otherwise only been populated by J. J. Abrams aimless and soon-abandoned reboot movies. This was then followed in 2020 by <em>Picard</em>, quickly accompanied by animated comedy <em>Lower Decks</em>, kids animation <em>Prodigy</em> in 2021, and then in 2022 the beginning of <em>Strange New Worlds</em>.</p><p>Now, clearly making judgement on anything <em>Star Trek</em> is a surefire way to get a person in all manner of trouble, but who cares: <em>Discovery</em>’s five seasons offered diminishing returns, its fourth series reaching a nadir of utter dreadfulness that was only mildly improved upon in its fifth meandering final run. <em>Picard</em> was so excruciatingly bad as to have been ruled illegal under the Geneva Convention, although its third and final season—while still rubbish—delivered joyfully silly fan-service as it reunited as much of the <em>The Next Generation</em> crew as would agree to stagger onto set. <em>Lower Decks</em> was utterly brilliant for five glorious years and you should watch it immediately. No one, not even the people who wrote and drew it, watched <em>Prodigy</em>. And <em>Strange New Worlds</em> has made the entire roller coaster worthwhile.</p><p>The mistake both <em>Discovery</em> and <em>Picard</em> made was to believe <em>Star Trek</em> was ever supposed to be more than people in pastel colors exchanging sci-fi gobbledegook, blowing up a spaceship, and then learning a jolly nice lesson in time for the credits. Presumably attempts to capture the lightning-in-a-bottle moments from the earlier series, like “The Best of Both Worlds” or “In The Pale Moonlight,” they failed to understand these only worked <em>because</em> they stood out from the usual amiable chatter. Both series just felt morose, hopeless, and as such, distinctly un-Trek.</p><p><em>Strange New Worlds</em> (and <em>Lower Decks</em> for that matter) understands the brief. Set before the events of the original 1960s <em>Star Trek</em> TV show (well, in between the events of the pilot and the rest of the series, nerds), it span off from one of <em>Discovery</em>’s finer moments, as we see Captain Pike faced with a vision of a gruesome accident that would ruin his life. But, put that aside, because now we’re off to enjoy the voyages of the Starship Enterprise before Kirk gets into the captain’s chair, and it’s going to be so much fun.</p><figure id="" data-id="409ac2511202a404526b31fea67d2185" data-recommend-id="image://409ac2511202a404526b31fea67d2185" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mr and Mrs Pike stare into a bright light." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mr and Mrs Pike stare into a bright light." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="409ac2511202a404526b31fea67d2185" data-recommend-id="image://409ac2511202a404526b31fea67d2185" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mr and Mrs Pike stare into a bright light." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The previous two seasons of <em>Strange New Worlds </em>have brought us some of the best <em>Star Trek </em>ever. It’s bright, and positive, and features an incredibly capable crew driven to be a force of good in the galaxy. They are very much on a five-year mission to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no humans have gone before. And if that means getting trapped in a fairy tale, or a space creature causing the entire crew to communicate in musical numbers, then dammit they’ll do that so flipping well. And they’ll do it with impeccable haircuts.</p><p>As such, when things do get more serious, they’re mostly earned, and you know aren’t going to end in inescapable doom. (Although, let’s be fair, S02E10's “Hegemony” was an embarrassing miss in its attempt to suddenly turn into <em>Alien</em>.) So, it is with absolute delight that I greet the news that Paramount is letting it serve its full five-year mission.</p><p>It’s vanishingly rare for any TV series, let alone streaming ones, to get guaranteed episodes for a further two seasons in advance. It means that on top of season three’s 10 episodes, we’re promised another 10 for season four, followed by an abbreviated six-episode run for season five. And yes, admittedly, the 26 episodes this assures us of is the same number as a single-season order for <em>Trek</em> in the 90s, but times have changed, and honestly, I’m grateful we get <em>any</em>.</p><p>Also, while I’d love the idea of the show running for as long as the cast and writers are willing, it does make a lot of sense to give <em>SNW</em> a termination date. As much as the joy of things as daft as seeing cartoon characters from <em>Lower Decks</em> appear in this live-action show distracts us, the reality is we <em>are</em> heading toward Pike’s accident, determined not only by his earlier vision, but also by August 23, 1969's episode of <em>Star Trek</em>, when the disfigured post-accident Pike appeared, sealing his fate some 56 years ago. They can’t keep putting it off forever.</p><p>But, we’ve got a solid 20 episodes before we need to worry about any of that! And the trailer for the new season, which starts July 17, suggests it’s going to be fun times. Including Patton Oswalt as a Vulcan! And, thank goodness, it doesn’t look like Nurse Chapel is going anywhere.</p><p>It’s all on Paramount Plus, which can more conveniently be accessed through Amazon Prime, along with all the episodes of the other mentioned shows. But honestly, just watch this and <em>Lower Decks</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony president Hideaki Nishino has stated the company is open to adjusting the price of PlayStation Plus in the future, as the company aims to "maximise profitability".</p>
<p>The comments come as <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/movie/index.html">part of a discussion</a> between Sony CEO Hermen Hulst and president Hideaki Nishino on PS Plus and the company's future. Discussing Sony's subscription service, Nishino stated: "We will continue to add more value and adjust our pricing strategy in a dynamic way to maximise profitability."</p>

<p>This statement, while not an indication that a price increase is necessarily on the cards, is essentially stating Sony will ensure the service will prioritise profitability going forward. Indeed it's a statement Sony has been aligned with for some time, given the spread of price increases PS Plus has received over the years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-price-hike-announced-for-europe">There was a European price hike back in 2017</a>, and as recently as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-12-month-subscriptions-getting-global-price-increase-from-september">2023 PS Plus saw a global price increase</a>, which Sony justified by stating it could "continue bringing high-quality games and value-added benefits to your PS Plus subscription service" as a result.</p>
<p>In the accompanying presentation, Hideaki noted some key shifts in PS Plus profitability over recent years. In 2024, 22 percent of PS Plus subscribers were paying for the most expensive PS Plus Premium, compared to 17 percent back in 2022.</p>
<p>PS Plus Extra, the next in terms of price-per-month, also saw an increase in subscribers, rising to 16 percent of subscribers compared with 13 percent back in 2022. In addition, in 2024 PS Plus made up 14 percent of total PlayStation revenue, an increase of only one percent from 2022.</p>
<p>What we can glean from these statistics is that while overall growth for PS Plus as a service remains slow, those who are subscribed are gradually forking out the cash for the pricier tiers.</p>
<p>Whether this is due to these subscribers increasingly believing the increased price point is worth it for the selection of games provided, a shift in attitude in favour of subscription services like PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass, or some alternative cause remains an interesting point of discussion.</p>
<p>A few years ago, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shuhei-yoshida-says-playstation-plus-should-be-used-to-manage-the-lifecycle-of-a-game">former head of PlayStation Shuhei Yoshida stated that services like PS Plus should be used to extend the life cycle of games</a>, and that the company still believed in premium games getting a standard release at launch. Maybe this approach has resulted in growth for PS Plus over the years?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A brand new world?</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a4e4c23e4d38/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is finally out, making it the first proper new mainline entry in over a decade. Chances are if you've bought a Switch 2, then you've probably bought Mario Kart World too, so we're eager to see exactly what you make of it so far.</p>
<p>Before we do, however, let's just remind ourselves of what we thought. Alana provided the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">big review</a> for the game and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"At first, this doesn't quite feel like the reinvention of Mario Kart that people wanted or expected, but the more time you spend in the open world and racing with friends, you’ll uncover a mechanically rich kart racer full of secrets and joy. Mario Kart World refines and expands the formula in meaningful ways while upping the charm in many others.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"Few games have brought me as much laughter as Mario Kart World has done since launch. If you need a pick-me-up, this game is sure to bring a smile, and it feels like a perfect start to Switch 2's life."</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182523 @ 1749825416 -->
<p>At the time of writing, Mario Kart World is currently sitting at 87 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mario-kart-world/">Metacritic</a>, which means that it's currently viewed as 'generally favourable' from a total of 75 critic reviews.</p>
<p>So now it's over to you. While we think it's unlikely you've completed 100% of the game with every possible secret uncovered, we imagine you've probably experienced all of the tracks by this point and have a solid understanding of the its many quirks.</p>
<p>Still, your chosen score isn't written in stone. Feel free to give it a preliminary verdict now and revisit at a later date. Alternatively, you can always come back here if you feel you simply can't provide a score just yet. So cast your verdict in the below poll and let us know exactly what you think of Mario Kart World after just over one week.</p>

<figure><a title="delivery driver throws switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1f6d199b6a5f9/delivery-driver-throws-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's a hectic old time, is this new console business. There are new games, new hardware, new bits and bobs of every description to read up on, buy and, if you're a delivery driver, to get safely from warehouse to customers' homes. Of course, not all delivery drivers are built the same or employ the same techniques to ensure that your goods — in this case a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a>, apparently — arrive as they should.</p>
<p>For us, regardless of the package, well, we would assume most would adopt a fairly routine method of walking right up to the door and handing it over to whoever lives there, who in this case is likely waiting for a shot on Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>However, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l9vi87/delivery_man_throws_my_nintendo_switch_2/">as seen on u/NintendoSwitch</a>, one gamer has apparently captured — via the magic of the humble doorbell camera — a delivery man using an entirely new method.</p>

<p>New skill unlocked! As you can see in the clip above, this particular technique involves throwing the parcel (hopefully they got some bubble wrap in there) in the general direction of a house.</p>
<p>This particular shot didn't make it all the way to the door, although it did fairly well. Maybe next time!</p>
<p>Happily, the poster also confirms <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l9vi87/comment/mxfporg">a little down the comments</a> underneath their video that the Switch 2 was, box aside, quite remarkably fine!</p>

<p>A happy ending.</p>

            <p>Remedy already has two major updates for its Control multiplayer spin-off FBC: Firebreak planned for this year, with more to hopefully follow.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak is set to release later this month, on 17th June. It will throw players back into the halls of Control's mysterious Federal Bureau of Control, letting them revisit a number of familiar locations from that game but with a fresh multiplayer twist.</p>

<p>Following its initial launch, the studio will then release a major update this autumn. This will include a new Job, codenamed Outbreak, and a new Jobsite: the Research Sector. Players will also find new gameplay systems and enemies, new free earnable rewards, and new (paid) Classified Requisitions. These will include unique armor sets, sprays, skins, and character voice packs.</p>
<p>Winter will then bring in a second major update. Again, this will add a new Job to FBC: Firebreak, with this one codenamed Blackout. There will also be a new Jobsite, but for now where that is located is a mystery. Along with the new Job and Jobsite, this update will also add new equipment and enemies, new free earnable rewards and new (paid) Classified Requisitions, including unique armor sets, sprays, skins, and character voice packs.</p>
<p>Writing on social media, <a href="https://x.com/RiotRMD/status/1933057792631259491">Remedy's communications director Thomas Puha</a> said the team also has plans afoot for 2026, but the team wants to "launch the game first, see what the reception is and what the community wants to see, what you might gravitate to before we make more decisions on what kind of content we'll be releasing".</p>

<p>Our Chris went hands-on with FBC: Firebreak earlier this year, when he called it a "frantic, electrifying run-based shooter, with difficulties feeling like gambles".</p>
<p>"Its potential is up there with the games other Remedy staff reference in casual chit-chat around the studio's corridors, from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, yes, to Darktide, Payday, Deep Rock Galactic or even Overcooked," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedys-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-has-only-come-together-at-the-last-minute-and-somehow-feels-better-for-it">Eurogamer's FBC: Firebreak preview</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/13/tainted-grail-fall-of-avalon-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>One of the worst things is when you see potential and promise in something, but it doesn’t reach the heights you know it can. That is probably the best way to describe my experience with Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon, the dark fantasy open world RPG which uses the King Arthur legend as the basis for the setting and story.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon - Official Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3hDQNtPceEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon begins strongly. You are a no-name character who is suffering from disease and is locked up on Asylum Island. You are freed by a mysterious character, but they do not help guide you to freedom, instead leaving you to figure out the path through the dangers for yourself.</p>


<p>It is only as you are broken out that you actually create your character, answering questions about what you were doing prior to ending up in the cell. Answering these questions feeds into which attributes get a boost at the beginning, and the playstyle you are considering. At the start you are weak, and Tainted Grail does an excellent job of showing just how that works as different enemy types cross your path and you are almost helpless to beat them, requiring quick thinking or running away.</p>
<p>Once you are away from Asylum Island and the first proper area, Horns of the South, things really do open up. There is the main quest to follow, which involves recovering some of King Arthur’s relics to restore his soul. Arthur’s soul just so happens to be in your body as a passenger and allows you to access various powers and abilities. You can also talk to him at bonfires and get his story, which comes in fragments since his memory is tied to the artifacts.</p>

<p>Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon has a lot of side quests and content within the world too. Many of the quests are pretty well put together and a few have some interesting and fun ways to resolve them, provided you meet the skill checks. You can tell the team have put the effort in to write some entertaining characters too, and the acting is decent too though not quite top tier.</p>

<p>Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon gives you some decent combat options. You can choose to use a sword and shield, dual wield weapons or spells, and combine them so you have a melee weapon in one hand and magic spells in the other. You can also put a few different combinations together so you can switch between quickly. For my playthrough I regularly used spell and sword, with two different combos. One allowed me to summon creatures while dealing heavy damage, while another featured a sword that had life steal and a spell that also stole health from enemies, which can be unstoppable at times.</p>
<p>The efficiency of your spells, weapons, armour are all linked to your attributes. As you level up you will get points to upgrade your attributes, be it physical, perception, spirituality, dexterity, and more, providing a baseline of stats to go alongside skills that you unlock in relation to these categories. Early on you can experiment, but as time goes on you should start focusing on a playstyle to really take full advantage. However, if you get bored of a particular style you can use an Origin potion to reset your points.</p>

<p>There’s something distinctly Oblivion to the visual style of Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon – the original, I mean, and not the remake. There is a good amount of things to discover within the world to discover, such as with dungeons that are hidden in plain sight. The Horns of the South is full of ruins showing how it has been ignored by Kamelot, while the second area of Cunacht has the show of somewhere falling apart as Kamelot tries to move everyone while locals want to stay. However, there is a clear quality divide between these regions, where Horns of the South just feels far more detailed in comparison to Cunacht.&nbsp;It gives a sense that Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon is quite front loaded.</p>
<p>Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon’s technical issues cannot be ignored, despite the regular patches that are being released. The game crashes multiple times, which can be triggered by moving from one place to another, or for some non-obvious reason. There is flickering in the environment that is distracting. There is also a bit of a weird issue when swimming where even if it looks like you are underwater, the oxygen bar doesn’t appear. On occasion, my summons did not engage with enemies or got stuck. Luckily, you can resummon so that is not a big deal, but you would still want it to be better.</p>
