		<p>Things are going very badly at the start of this trailer. Our protagonist, Takumi Sumino looks like he’s enjoying an idyllic anime walk with a friend, when suddenly, monsters attack. Admittedly, he’s decrying the fact that every day is exactly the same, and while I applaud his Nine Inch Nails references, he’s kind of asking for it.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ybTx8StTllQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A mysterious school mascot – he looks like a cross between Colonel Sanders and a ghost jelly bean – helps them to escape, but he’s then forced to enrol at the Last Defence Academy alongside fifteen other recruits. Their mission is to defend the school against massive, vicious and extremely ugly monsters, in seemingly turn-based tactical combat. The trailer briefly shows us a snapshot of what looks to be a grid-based system, and large enemy forces grouped together into units. We see one of the characters then performing a cool motorbike drift that certainly looks good, but seems to do little damage.</p>
<p>As well as that, we can expect a heap of school-based melodrama, with the anime cutscenes presenting lots of shouting and stern faces, as they prepare to face the oncoming hordes. The enemies are surprisingly bright and colourful – greens, blues and yellows – but during at least one cutscene they also appear to be corrupted, with gross black growths escaping from their many-eyed bodies. It’s certainly a cool and intriguing setup, and given that it’s coming from the team behind Daganronpa, it’s definitely one to keep an eye on.</p>


<p>The Danganronpa series is similarly themed around a group of teenagers who are drawn into catastrophic shenanigans, though they’re being forced to murder each other there, so this seems almost tame in comparison. Whether there’s also going to be elements of visual novels or dating simulators remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The Hundred Line – Last Defence Academy will launch in early 2025</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metroid-prime-4-gets-new-name-gameplay-footage-and-release-window.904824/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During today's Nintendo Direct show, we finally got to see&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>gameplay in all its glory, and not only that, but we got a new name and release window for the game as well.</p>
<p><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, as it's now called, will arrive on Nintendo Switch sometime in 2025, and the first gameplay footage sure makes the game look like it's been worth the (admittedly very long) wait.</p>
<p>In the trailer from today's Direct, we see Samus landing on a planet that appears to be besieged by the Space Pirates, some of whom she takes down in classic&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime&nbsp;</em>first-person shooter style.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-shooting.jpg?itok=jDWojzSz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-shooting.jpg?itok=xiE7gnwS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>looks like it'll bring some classic&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime&nbsp;</em>action next year.</figcaption></figure><p>We also get to see Samus switching to the Morph Ball to navigate some narrow passageways and above-ground railings, so it's all looking like the&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime&nbsp;</em>we know and love.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the trailer, we see what looks to be the bounty hunter&nbsp;Sylux, who's appeared in&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime&nbsp;</em>games before (albeit not in the main numbered series). He's flanked not only by Space Pirates, but also by two Metroids.</p>
<p>Finally, we get to see Samus emerging into a verdant, beautiful alien landscape, in the background of which can be seen a massive Yggdrasil-style tree.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, it's not clear how all of this fits together just yet, but it looks like&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>development is fully back on track, which is reassuring. You can check out today's gameplay trailer right here.</p>

<p><em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>has had a rather strange development cycle. It was first announced at E3 2017, but in January 2019, Nintendo revealed that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-reboots-metroid-prime-4-hands-development-to-retro-studios">development of the project had been rebooted</a> under original&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime&nbsp;</em>developer Retro Studios.</p>
<p>Following that announcement, the&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime&nbsp;</em>series went dormant for a number of years, although the release of last year's&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime Remastered&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/metroid-prime-remastered-is-perfect-test-run-for-metroid-prime-4">appeared to herald a resurgence</a> for the franchise.</p>
<p>Happily, it now appears that resurgence is well and truly here.&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>launches for Nintendo Switch in 2025. Stay tuned for more info, and in the meantime, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-june-2024">catch up on today's Nintendo Direct right here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced-for-september.904821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During today's Nintendo Direct presentation, Nintendo revealed a brand new&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda</em>&nbsp;game, and you won't be playing as Link in this one.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is coming on September 26th, and it uses the same cute art style espoused by 2019's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-links-awakening"><em>Link's Awakening&nbsp;</em>remake</a>.</p>
<p>Strange rifts have appeared throughout Hyrule, and Link has disappeared into one of them, so it's up to Princess Zelda to find him and save the land. She won't be alone in her attempts to do so, however.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-beds.jpg?itok=TzU1cB-o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-beds.jpg?itok=4IV8itDJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>adventure is coming later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>She'll be assisted by the fairy Tri, who will gift her the Tri-Rod, a rather intriguing artifact that allows her to memorize objects and conjure them at will.</p>
<p>In that sense,&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>looks like it's essentially a top-down&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game with some of the creative spirit that made&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild">Breath of the Wild</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>&nbsp;</em>so special.</p>
<p>The trailer shows Zelda memorizing objects like boxes, shrubs, and beds, and then using them to bypass obstacles, get to higher ledges, and solve puzzles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zelda can also be seen memorizing enemies and projectiles to help her in combat. She doesn't fight with a sword, unlike Link, so you'll need to use ingenuity and quick thinking to get around combat challenges.</p>

<p>Hopefully,&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>represents an attempt to do for&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>what Nintendo has done for&nbsp;<em>Mario</em>, which is to say creating two parallel series that offer different gameplay styles (although those hoping for a return to classic item-based&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>gameplay may be disappointed by this one).</p>
<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>arrives exclusively for Nintendo Switch on September 26th. If you want to see everything else that was announced during today's Nintendo Direct, we've got a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-june-2024">full roundup for you here</a>.</p>

			<p>One of the best platformers on the Switch is still <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a>, despite it being a pretty straight port of the Wii U game. But what about the original Donkey Kong Country Returns? Some people like that game even better than Tropical Freeze, and it’s currently stranded on the Wii and 3DS. Well, bust open the banana barrels, baby, because the game is coming back!</p>
<p>During today’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct</a>, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD was announced. In addition to bumping up the resolution of the game’s graphics, this version of the game will also have all the content that was added to the 3DS version. Whether any all-new content has been added, remains to be seen. You can check out the first trailer for DK Country Returns HD, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Country Returns HD – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qdjam3yHC-4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Still looking pretty damn good all these years later! I’ve always liked DK Country Returns a bit more than Tropical Freeze, so I’m happy to see the game getting its due. Need to know more? Here’s Nintendo’s official description of the game…</p>
<p><em>“Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong are back for some ground-pounding action in this HD version of Donkey Kong Country Returns, originally released on Wii. The villainous Tiki Tak Tribe has stolen Donkey Kong’s precious banana hoard and the Kongs are barrelling after them in pursuit. Play solo, or with a buddy in local two-player co-op, in an adventure brimming with hijinks where you can stomp obstacles, send mine carts careening, fly high on rocket barrels and even hitch a ride on Rambi the Rhino. Experience 80 a-peel-ing levels, including the additional ones from the Nintendo 3DS version, when Donkey Kong Country Returns HD swings onto Nintendo Switch.”</em></p>
<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD jumps and rolls onto Switch on January 16, 2025. What do you think? Eager to give this one another (or your first) try?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Throne and Liberty Preview - A Good WoW Alternative?]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/throne-and-liberty-preview-good-wow-alternative</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/throne-and-liberty-preview-a-good-wow-alternative.904815/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/throne-and-liberty-preview-good-wow-alternative<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When <em>World of Warcraft</em> was at the height of its popularity, so many companies tried (and failed) to create a <em>WoW</em> killer. <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> succeeded in carving a huge niche in the market, but Blizzard's MMO still persists to this day. <em>Throne and Liberty, </em>however, might just be another hit in the making and perhaps even steal some ex-<em>WoW </em>players with its familiarity and likeness to the MMO.</p>
<p>I got a chance to play developer NCSOFT and publisher Amazon Games' upcoming MMORPG, <em>Throne and Liberty</em> during Summer Game Fest. Though it was a brief look, my time with <em>Throne and Liberty</em> shows some promise.</p>


<h2>Making Your Character in <em>Throne and Liberty</em></h2>
<p>My demo begins with character creation, which is about as robust as one would come to expect from an MMORPG. There's a slider for damn near everything, from cheek size to eyebrows. I could have spent my entire hour-or-so demo just customizing, which is a promising sign for those who love expressing themselves as much as I do.</p>
<p>While a few more hairstyles would have been nice, this is a work-in-progress, so hopefully there's more to come. This is my chance to hop on a soapbox and say the customization options in <em>World of Warcraft</em> are ridiculously outdated and pale in comparison to the likes of <em>Throne and Liberty</em>, even if the rest of the game feels somewhat mechanically similar.</p>
<p>Understanding the intricacies of an MMO in one small slice is nearly impossible, but the gameplay portion for of my demo for <em>Throne and Liberty</em> gives me a decent taste, at least. I started with an already-leveled character and a slew of abilities, which is perfect for trying out one of the game's many dungeons.</p>

<h2>A Good ol' Dungeon Dive in <em>Throne and Liberty</em></h2>
<p>Along with a group of a few other players and guided by a developer, we seamlessly hop into a dungeon and embark into the unknown. One thing that's important to understand is there are no classes in <em>Throne and Liberty</em>; rather, you carve your role in the group based on the combination of weapons you choose.</p>
<p>In my case, I opted for a pure magical DPS build with the wand and staff. In the main game, you can mix and match a set of two weapons, so that's how you'll ultimately determine your role in a group. Having mained a troll mage in <em>World of Warcraft</em> for over a decade, two magic-based weapons felt like a fit for me.</p>
<p>Many MMOs tend to overwhelm a player with its large selection of abilities, but <em>Throne and Liberty</em> is a bit more restrained and allowed for a manageable selection. I didn't feel overwhelmed by the spells I had, and managed to contribute to the rest of the group.</p>

<h2>The Fight to King Chimaerus</h2>
<p>The dungeon layout, by the way, is pretty simple and felt like one of your traditional MMORPG dungeons. Mobs scattered out and about, a few mini-bosses along the way, and of course, the final boss of the dungeon. There's something cathartic about running a dungeon with the pals, and I could imagine myself losing plenty of hours in <em>Throne and Liberty</em>.</p>
<p>This dungeon was by no means groundbreaking, though I got a taste of a few other features <em>Throne and Liberty</em> has to offer. Players can morph into animals to glide, run, swim, and the like, which should prove as a useful tool in overworld. At one point, a large room started to flood and we all turned into otters to navigate the waters easier.</p>
<p>You can safely land from high jumps by pressing the jump button while dropping, allowing you to glide -- this was used several times throughout the dungeon. Again, nothing groundbreaking here, but I imagine there are some more creative uses for these abilities as players progress through the vast world and its dungeons.</p>

<p>The boss fight at the end of the dungeon is a giant chimera called King Chimaerus -- this should be familiar to those who have seen footage for <em>Throne and Liberty </em>before. Like <em>World of Warcraft</em> (or plenty of other MMOs), you'll have to learn his patterns and be aware of your surroundings if you want to survive.</p>
<p>There's one ability a tank needs to soak in order to mitigate damage to party members targeted by this attack. Chains holding this hanging object in the middle of the room need to be interacted with at a specific moment to stun the boss, all the while we avoid pools of poison from Chimaerus' viper tail.</p>
<p>In the end, <em>Throne and Liberty</em> is a very familiar-feeling game, especially for those who are used to <em>World of Warcraft</em> like I am. But that has me intrigued, since I know it's a mechanically solid and accessible MMO, which seems like a rare find these days. I'm excited to see how <em>Throne and Liberty</em> sets itself apart when it releases at some point in the future.</p>

  <p id="A0Xjor">The long-awaited “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23278977/live-a-live-hd-2d-remake-square-enix-jrpg">HD-2D</a>” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22456431/dragon-quest-12-announced-dq3-remake-treasures-keshi">remake of classic Enix role-playing game <em>Dragon Quest 3</em></a> is coming to Nintendo Switch this November, publisher Square Enix announced Tuesday during a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180900/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced-games">Nintendo Direct</a> showcase. But <em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D</em> isn’t the only classic Erdrick adventure coming from Square Enix — the collection <em>Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D</em> was also announced Tuesday, giving fans of Akira Toriyama and Yuji Horii’s RPG series a lavishly remade trilogy to enjoy over the next year.</p>
<p id="kJc63H"><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D</em> will send players on a remade fantasy adventure as The Hero to take down the archfiend Baramos, traveling to towns, dungeons, and underground caves, and battling <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24094509/akira-toriyama-dragon-quest-slime">slimes</a> and other Toriyama-designed monsters in turn-based battles. The original <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> is set before the events of the first two games in the series, so, chronologically, playing <em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D</em> first will prep you for the next two games.</p>
<p id="M4xSbL">Square Enix didn’t say much about what’s changing for <em>Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D</em>, or whether they will feature expanded narratives as <em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D</em> will, but that seems quite likely.</p>
<p id="8hCz8K"><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D</em> will be released on Nov. 14 on Nintendo Switch. <em>Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D</em> are due sometime in 2025.</p>
<p id="TOHIas">Square Enix’s brand of HD-2D games started with developer Acquire’s retro RPG <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/12/17563366/octopath-traveler-review-nintendo-switch-jrpg"><em>Octopath Traveler</em></a> in 2018. The RPG publisher saw the potential in HD-2D for both new releases and remakes; the style has since been employed for <em>Octopath Traveler 2</em> and tactics RPG <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22958989/triangle-strategy-review-nintendo-switch-jrpg"><em>Triangle Strategy</em></a>, with plans for more remakes beyond the early Dragon Quest games.</p>

    <div><p><a title="Platforms > Nintendo [20,306 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a></em> for <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,493 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>. It will launch on September 26. <span id="more-892870"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Nintendo:</p><blockquote><p>It’s up to Zelda and her wisdom to save the kingdom of Hyrule in a brand-new story in <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> series. The people of Hyrule are being stolen away by strange rifts that have appeared, with a certain swordsman among the missing. Team up with the mysterious fairy, Tri, and use the power of the Tri Rod to create echoes—imitations of things found in the environment. Then recreate those echoes whenever you like to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. Use echoes of water blocks to reach new heights, make bridges out of old beds, throw rocks at foes – or find your own creative combination of echoes to do things your way. You can even create echoes of monsters to fight at your side in combat. Join Zelda in her quest to rescue Hyrule.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

The book was published February 23, 2024 by CRC Press, a division of Taylor &amp; Francis, a sister company of Game Developer and Informa Tech.&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.routledge.com/Game-AI-Uncovered-Volume-One/Roberts/p/book/9781032343235">Use our discount code GDTF20 at checkout on Routledge.com to receive a 20% discount on your purchase</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>. Offer is valid through July 4, 2024.</span></span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="7.1 INTRODUCTION">7.1 INTRODUCTION</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While working on a yet to be announced title, the AI team hit a snag. Behaviour trees were the decision-making architecture of choice, but they are not reactive. And for a tree to respond to an event, the response, and the conditions leading up to it, must be part of the tree. Reactive Behaviour Trees (RBT) were designed to solve this problem, but before delving too deeply into the problem this architecture aims to solve and why you would choose to implement this approach, we need to take a brief look at traditional behaviour trees.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="7.2 BEHAVIOUR TREES">7.2 BEHAVIOUR TREES</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Behaviour trees have been around for a while. They were originally developed by Damian Isla as an improvement on Finite State Machines (FSM) in the development of Halo 2 (Isla, 2005). Since then, they have been used in a wide range of games and had numerous articles and had research papers written about them. Behaviour trees are now the preferred approach for AI behaviours across the industry. Epic’s Unreal Engine even has them built into the engine.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Traditionally, behaviour trees are graphs with a bunch of composite nodes that dictate the type of execution (branch nodes, in normal tree terminology), and behaviour/task nodes (leaf nodes), that execute some kind of logic, or more colloquially ‘do things’. They are almost always associated with a blackboard, which is essentially a common data store for trees to share data amongst one another. A blackboard has a one-to-many relationship with behaviour trees, meaning that a single blackboard can be associated to multiple behaviour trees but each behaviour tree can only ever be associated with the one blackboard. This greatly adds to the flexibility of the system because data can be set in one agent’s behaviour tree and then be used by another agent in a completely different behaviour tree.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On each update, the tree evaluates which task node is the best one to execute and goes through all the nodes in order, usually from top to bottom and left to right, until a particular task node returns true. The most commonly used composite nodes and a brief description of their purpose are as follows:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sequence – These composite nodes execute each of their child nodes from left to right until all of them return success.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Selector/Fallback – These composite nodes execute each of their child nodes in any order until at least one of them returns success.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Parallel – These composite nodes execute the child nodes at the same time. These composite nodes return success when some number m of n number of child nodes succeed and returns false when all n child nodes fail. The term ‘parallel’ is used but the process is not usually true parallelism. It is more akin to a coroutine. For example: on each tick, each child class will individually tick in sequence from left to right and be suspended until the next tick.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition to the blackboard, there are decorator nodes that usually modify a child node with a unique policy, for example, using the Loop/Repeat decorator at the root of a subtree to repeat a certain subtree or using the Invert decorator to flip success to failure and vice-versa. There are others, but this is plenty to get the point across.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Combining all the nodes mentioned above, one can create a great looking AI agent quickly. So, let us do just that.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="7.2.1 Patrolling Example with Traditional Behaviour Trees">7.2.1 Patrolling Example with Traditional Behaviour Trees</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Imagine you are developing a strategy game and have set up a group of units to patrol around the perimeter of your base camp. The group of units will, ideally, have a ‘leader’ who will be running a behaviour tree, with all other agents following their lead. The first thing we need to do is to set up the blackboard. In this case, our blackboard will have a couple of items – the current patrol location and a list of all patrol locations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From the root of the tree, we add a selector, and its first leaf node could be a task node called ‘UpdatePatrolList’ that checks to see if the list of patrol points is empty, which on the very first iteration would be. This list will be populated with data from the world using some form of query system.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From the second iteration onwards the patrol list does not need updating, so a branch that allows our agent to enact the patrol is needed. Next, a sequence node can be added to the selector whose child nodes will be a task node to set the current patrol location. A task node named ‘MoveTo’ can then be added that will move the agent to the designated patrol location and a task node named ‘Wait’ that will have the agent wait at the location for a set time. A depiction of the resulting behaviour tree can be seen in Image&nbsp;7.1.</span></p><p>IMAGE&nbsp;7.1 Basic patrolling behaviour tree.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The blackboard in the bottom left of Image&nbsp;7.1 is there only as a visual aid to show how the blackboard acts as a data store for the entire tree. In the later examples, the blackboard will not be visualised, but if any task is referring to a value, then it is most likely getting/setting it from/in the blackboard.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A good addition to this basic patrolling behaviour would be to have a behaviour to attack any enemy units that are close by. The perception systems will take care of setting a target in the blackboard, so all this behaviour needs to do is to move to said target and attack if a target is available. Image&nbsp;7.2 depicts how the behaviour tree now looks.</span></p><p>IMAGE&nbsp;7.2 Patrolling tree with attack logic.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The reason the new attack sequence has been added before the rest of the nodes is because that is the order in which a behaviour tree executes. Remember, the tree executes from top to bottom and left to right. The agent should attack the enemy if the target is set. Only if the target is not set should it continue its patrol. So far so good. All of this seems like sound system design. So, what is the problem?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Well, this is a very simple example. In a more tactical game, there will be a lot more things to consider. For example:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Are there items in the environment that can be used to the agent’s advantage (Oil drums, crates of explosives, and the like)?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Is this the right time to call in reinforcements (Air support, backup, etc.)?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Should they retreat?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Should long-ranged units fire at the oncoming target or pull back and let the melee units defend them?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Depending upon the game, the problem only gets worse when using behaviour trees for the AI. Consider a first person or third person shooter where we need to consider the following:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Is the player in cover?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Do they have allies?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Is there a way to flank the player?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Does the agent have enough grenades to blast the player out of cover?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Is the player in an armoured vehicle?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Can the AI do anything against armoured vehicles?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• The list goes on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To be fair, you may not want all the above, but you can see where this is going. Things can get very complicated very quickly, and this is not even considering the different archetypes of enemies you may have in your game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Behaviour trees are also not reactive in nature. If the tree needs to respond to an event that can happen in the world, the response, and the conditions leading up to it, must be part of the tree. This exhaustive approach is the reason why behaviour trees in big AAA games end up looking like a giant mass of spaghetti and as a result they become large, unreadable, and cumbersome to debug. You end up with a giant tree that is pruning or executing very large subtrees depending on the conditions of the game. The worst-case scenario is that the execution of decisions will be slowed down because traversing the tree itself will start to tax the system. Sometimes, the subtrees are authored as their own behaviour trees and the ‘master’ behaviour tree is the one that runs those behaviour trees via a ‘RunSubtree’ task node or something similar. With this approach, the subtrees become more readable, and it ensures you are not repeating code, but it does not do much else to resolve the overall structure. Debugging is still a pain and traversal, if the tree is large enough, and may still be slow. Which is exactly what led to the development of the RBT architecture.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="7.3 REACTIVE BEHAVIOUR TREES">7.3 REACTIVE BEHAVIOUR TREES</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Reactive behaviour trees take inspiration from the MARPO methodology (Lamming, 2008), an architecture that combines tasks (usually individual states) and academic goal-based reasoning to produce believable AI. MARPO is an acronym which stands for Movement, Avoidance, Routing, Planning, and Orders. The core of the ‘PO’ part of the methodology is self-contained tasks, with limited input and limited output that are arranged in multiple queues or stacks (whichever works for the game). The limited input is the current game state, and the limited output is the action the agent needs to perform. The queues or stacks add an element of ‘memory’ to the AI as the AI knows what it needs to do next or what it was doing in the past.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Reactive behaviour trees take advantage of MARPO’s multiple queue/stack approach, but for small, manageable behaviour trees. In the MARPO approach, a total of three stacks are used. One stack is tagged as the long-term stack, which is basically the agent’s end goal. A second stack, called the reactive stack, deals with the agent’s response to any world events, and the third is called the immediate stack, which allows the agent to handle the most pressing of concerns. Tasks are pushed onto these stacks by an external monitor, which interrupts the execution of the current active task and pushes a task onto one of the stacks. The immediate stack suppresses the execution of the reactive stack, which in turn suppresses the execution of the long-term stack.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Reactive behaviour trees use only a long-term stack and a reactive stack. More stacks will facilitate different types of reactions but will mean more processing. By having a second stack, you can flush the entire stack if the need arises and drop back to processing the long-term stack. The stacks in this architecture will consist of small, self-contained behaviour trees, rather than individual states as in MARPO.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The execution flow of the Reactive Behaviour Tree architecture is as follows:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• The AI System goes through each agent’s update cycle.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Each agent consists of a Behaviour Tree Component and a Monitor Component</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• The behaviour tree component is responsible for the execution of the stacks. Handling the updates of the topmost behaviour tree, backtracking, data storage from the blackboard, handling push and pop calls from the monitor, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• The monitor component is responsible for handling events from various game systems to push or pop behaviour trees to or from the stacks. The overall system architecture is depicted in Image&nbsp;7.3.</span></p><p>IMAGE&nbsp;7.3 Overall system architecture.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="7.3.1 Reactive Behaviour Tree Components">7.3.1 Reactive Behaviour Tree Components</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The principle of self-containment is simple to adhere to in RBTs by having behaviour trees that take care of one thing and only one thing. Consider the following: Does the ‘Patrolling’ behaviour tree need to know if an enemy is visible or not and how to attack them? The answer is no. The behaviour defined in that tree is patrolling, so why not only have that tree handle the logic for patrolling and define a separate tree for how to go about attacking the target(s)?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The long-term stack is the main stack which houses any behaviour trees that the agent would have by default. In the patrolling/attacking examples described earlier, using RBTs we could assign a default patrolling behaviour to the long-term stack to get the simple behaviour shown in Image&nbsp;7.1. It does not need any of the additional logic that was added in Image&nbsp;7.2. The RBT would look something like that shown in Image&nbsp;7.4.</span></p><p>IMAGE&nbsp;7.4 Reactive Behaviour Tree architecture – showing the two stacks, with the default patrol BT pointing to a version of the simplified BT it consists of.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is important to note that if an agent had a different purpose they should have a different default behaviour. For example: a sniper has no need to patrol. They will maintain a position and wait for targets, or a more complicated approach could have them hold position for a period of time before seeking out a more advantageous position. Either way, the sniper does not need a default patrolling behaviour. They require something bespoke to them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The behaviour tree at the top of either stack pushes any additional subtrees it wants to execute onto the current stack. The topmost behaviour tree on the stack would then get the update and the previous behaviour tree goes dormant. Once the execution of the topmost tree is complete it can pop itself off the stack and the execution returns to the previous tree which carries on with its logic. As is clearly demonstrated by the way the execution returns to the parent tree, the element of memory that is evident in the MARPO methodology is maintained.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is one key element missing – the monitor. The monitor controls the external pushing of behaviour trees onto a relevant stack should an event take place that our specific agent is capable of handling. It is a system that receives notifications from the perception system and/or other world systems of the game and responds only if our specific agent is interested. This means that a monitor is archetype specific. The benefit of this approach is that it allows for different agent types to react differently to world events. For example: a patrolling guard may be interested in the discovery of a dead body, but a sniper may not.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Each behaviour tree has access to the monitor, allowing them to fire events to the monitor themselves, which will then allow the monitor to determine how this particular agent should respond.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="7.3.2 Patrolling Example with Stack-Based Behaviour Trees">7.3.2 Patrolling Example with Stack-Based Behaviour Trees</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using the same patrolling example as before, while the agent is patrolling, it spots some disturbance and/or noise in the bushes or the tree line nearby. The monitor pushes an ‘Investigate’ behaviour tree onto the reactive stack, which now receives the update. The ‘Patrol’ behaviour tree now falls dormant. Image&nbsp;7.5 depicts the current state of the architecture.</span></p><p>IMAGE 7.5 The Monitor receives a perception event and pushes the ‘Investigate’ BT onto  the Reactive Stack.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The agent goes to the location and scouts to see what the disturbance could have been. If the player makes a sound or becomes visible while the agent is investigating, the ‘Investigate’ behaviour alerts the monitor of this event, which reacts by pushing an ‘Attack’ behaviour tree onto the reactive stack. As can be seen in Image&nbsp;7.6, the current top of the reactive stack pauses execution, and the ‘Attack’ behaviour begins.</span></p><p>IMAGE 7.6 The Monitor receives a perception event and pushes the ‘Attack’ BT onto the  Reactive Stack.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If the agent starts to come under fire while attacking, the ‘Attack’ behaviour tree alerts the monitor, which pushes a ‘TakeCover’ behaviour tree onto the reactive stack. The moment the player stops shooting or the agent reaches cover, the ‘TakeCover’ behaviour tree will pop itself off the reactive stack and the agent will immediately drop back into the ‘Attack’ behaviour tree and start shooting back. When the agent’s weapon is out of ammo or an ability is on cooldown, the monitor is alerted, and the ‘TakeCover’ behaviour tree is again pushed onto the stack while the agent reloads. Image&nbsp;7.7 depicts these two scenarios.</span></p><p>IMAGE 7.7 The Monitor receives the damage/reload event and pushes the ‘TakeCover’ BT  to the Reactive Stack.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the agent is in cover and reloading, the player cleverly uses stealth to duck away from the battle. Once our agent has finished reloading the ‘TakeCover’ behaviour tree is popped off the stack, but there is no target to attack, so the ‘Attack’ behaviour tree pops itself off the stack too. Now the agent drops back into the ‘Investigate’ behaviour tree. The player stealthily slinks away from the area at this point and the agent fails to find them. At this stage the ‘Investigate’ behaviour tree pops itself off the reactive stack and the agent goes back to the top of the long-term stack, which was its default, the ‘Patrol’ behaviour tree.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the entire scenario, which is depicted in Image&nbsp;7.8, everything happened without behaviours having any knowledge of how other behaviour tree’s function. A behaviour tree such as ‘Attack’ described above only needs to know that it is taking heavy damage and can send out an alert to the monitor that will prompt the ‘TakeCover’ behaviour tree being added.</span></p><p>IMAGE 7.8 First the ‘TakeCover’ BT pops off the stack, then the ‘Attack’ BT pops off as the  target was lost, and then the ‘Investigate’ BT gets popped off because no new target was found.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="7.4 CONSIDERATIONS">7.4 CONSIDERATIONS</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the huge benefits of this architecture is that it allows the team to create small, manageable behaviour trees that are reusable. However, if you do not hold the line on this, people will continue to develop behaviour trees that are large and unwieldy. This not only defeats the point but makes debugging more difficult than just sticking with the traditional behaviour tree approach.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before adding a behaviour tree to a stack, it is important to check to see if this behaviour tree is already on a stack somewhere.

It entered early access in January and had sold over 15 million copies on Steam by February. It also reached over 10 million players on Xbox. In April, developer Pocketpair revealed that players spent a collective </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1784553148201525505">1.3 billion hours</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> playing the game, which equates to 150,000 years.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It would be fair to say the survival-meets-monster-collecting game hit the ground running, but Pocketpair kept that momentum going by constantly pushing out patches and releasing new 'Pals,' the adorable collectible creatures in the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, Pocketpair is getting ready to launch </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s first big content drop, the Sakurajima update. It’s due out on June 27 for both PC and Xbox, and will be free for those who have the base game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At Summer Game Fest 2024, we sat down with Pocketpair CEO Takuro Mizobe and global community manager John Buckley to talk about why the game was so successful, what they learned from developing their previous game, and what the road ahead looks like for the surprise hit.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Palworld"><span>Palworld</span>’s secret ingredient: automation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Pocketpair developed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Craftopia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, an open-world adventure that combined many familiar mechanics such as hunting, farming, and hack-and-slash gameplay. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is similarly set up: crafting, monster taming, automation, and third-person shooting. While none of these mechanics are new, Mizobe explained that the way they come together is what makes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> unique.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/what-do-developers-think-about-the-success-of-palworld-" target="_self">What do developers think about the success of Palworld?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“There are similar game mechanics like automation and monster taming. You catch the pals and they work on the bases with us. This is kind of a new experience,” he said, in reference to how assigning Pals to various tasks activates automatic functions around the player’s base.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The automation aspect is a particularly interesting mechanic as it's present in both </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Craftopia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It’s commonly referred to as a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/tags/en/Automation/">tag on Steam</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and includes games where players automate assembly lines and build factories, such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Satisfactory</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astroneer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Factorio</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Buckley explained that, while it’s a very niche genre on Steam, many automation games are quite successful. "It's a very underserved genre. And I think putting those elements into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Craftopia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> seemed very weird at the beginning," he explained. "But the players loved it. I think we kind of realized that automation actually has a lot of potential. Not many games have automation, so exploring what else we could do turned out to be very good."</span></p><p>Image via Pocketpair.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mizobe mentioned that</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Craftopia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was inspired by games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It was hard to manage all of the different mechanics in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Craftopia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but the team learned from their own development on the game to make </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> an even better experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>"Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> doesn't have every element that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Craftopia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had, only certain ones. But the ones that worked well together? That's what we moved over to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, especially the automation stuff," added Buckley.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Implementing PvP would require rebalancing ">Implementing PvP would require rebalancing <span>Palworld</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the Sakurajima update, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is getting a brand new island, new Pals, and an Arena mode. In particular, the Arena mode is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s answer to the much demanded PvP mode, where players can battle against each other by picking three of their Pals, resulting in a 4v4 matchup. However, a different kind of PvP system is still in the works.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“[Arena] is just a little bit of fun at the moment that players can do while we work on the bigger kind of 'PvP.' How we're going to do that is still very undecided," Buckley said. While he didn’t divulge any additional details of what he meant by a "bigger kind of PvP," it seems like more details will be revealed at a later date. Basically, the Arena mode is just a taste of what's to come for now.</span></p><p>Image via Pocketpair.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pocketpair currently has several different PvP prototypes it's tinkering with. The main issue comes down to balancing over 130 Pals with their own abilities. "Nothing in the game is balanced for PvP, and to make traditional survival PvP would require rebalancing everything, which I don't think we want to do. So we're trying to find a better solution," continued Buckley.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The overnight success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> resulted in Pocketpair </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/Palworld_JP/status/1755520203428131152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1755520203428131152%7Ctwgr%5Eae78d26dd1cca770754862a11d75038482e9282a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.destructoid.com%2Fpalworld-dev-pocket-pair-announces-its-hiring-we-are-severely-lacking-in-friends%2F">going on a recruitment drive</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> so it could create additional content.

The game also received plenty of attention through people jokingly referring to it as "Pokemon with guns." Funnily enough, Mizobe wasn't aware of it at first, saying, "we didn't know the meme of 'Pokemon with guns' actually.

With many of the most classic titles already on <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/feature/2024/04/24/nintendo-switch-online-every-nes-snes-game-boy-n64-sega-genesis-and-gba-game">Nintendo Switch Online's various catalogs</a>, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today's Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.</p>

<p>Metroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you'll need to subscribe to that premium membership. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission join the Game Boy Advance library today, while Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter join the Nintendo 64 catalog today.</p>

Today, with the announcement of Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, Capcom is not just bringing another Japan-only release to Western gamers, but it's also made the entire library of Ace Attorney games available on modern consoles.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FtQcHQoZpps" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The Investigations games follow Miles Edgeworth, an antagonist turned reluctant ally from the original trilogy of Phoenix Wright games. Instead of defending suspects in court, Edgeworth is a prosecutor, so it's up to him to build a case against the main suspects. By collecting evidence and completing logic puzzles, he and the lovable Detective Gumshoe solve mysteries and serve justice. While the first game launched in the States as a DS title, the second never officially made it over, so this is many players' first chance to see its story.</p>

<p>Like other Ace Attorney collections, the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will have a number of modes and settings for fans to appreciate the art and music of the original game. While it&nbsp;includes new "hand-drawn character visuals" for a more modern look, it also allows players to switch to classic pixel sprites if they prefer the look of the original. Meanwhile, the gallery includes character art, a photo album, and music from the game, including orchestral arrangements.</p>

<p>While the announcement was made during the Nintendo Direct, Ace Attorney Investigations collection is far from a console exclusive – the two-game collection will launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 6.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/fantasian-neo-dimension-brings-square-enix-mobile-rpg-to-switch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you’re a mobile gamer, and in particular an Apple Arcade subscriber, you might know about Fantasian. Arguably, it remains one of the best RPG experiences on the iOS mobile platform, and if you have the hardware to play it I suggest you stop reading right now and go and download it. Go on then. What are you waiting for? However, if you haven’t played or heard of it then it’s time to rejoice, with Fantastian Neo Dimension bringing the Square Enix RPG to Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="FANTASIAN Neo Dimension – Nintendo Direct 6.18.2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZeUv0HH1pNQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>One of the main reasons to get excited by Fantasian Neo Dimension is the fact that it comes from Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi and the most lauded FInal Fantasy composer, Nobuo Uematsu. This pairing marked the game out as an RPG with huge potential, and they absolutely delivered on it, turning in an enticing fantasy world, compelling narrative and a glorious symphonic soundtrack.</p>
<p>Fantasian plays out in an extensive world, broken down into individual areas, with turn-based combat. That turn-based combat made excellent use of mobile touchscreens, and you can bend your attacks so that they curve through multiple enemies. It introduces a really interesting level of strategy to every attack, and I’m hoping that you’ll be able to use the touchscreen of the Nintendo Switch when you’re on the go. As proven by the Apple TV version, it works fine with traditional controls as well.</p>


<p>Leo, the central hero, is suffering a nasty dose of amnesia, and while that could be the start of any RPG, the setting and ongoing narrative will undoubtedly draw you in. He’s also joined by an intriguing group of characters along the way, with their own batch of special moves and narrative strands.</p>
<p>Fantasian Neo Dimension releases on Nintendo Switch later this year, at some point during Holiday 2024. Stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-june-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Nintendo held a new Nintendo Direct presentation to round off the summer showcase season and show off some of the games coming to the Switch throughout the rest of the year. Here's everything that was announced as part of that showcase!</p>
<hr><h2><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>&nbsp;brings back&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Luigi&nbsp;</em>RPGs in November</h2>
<p>First up, it's a look at a brand new&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Luigi&nbsp;</em>RPG in the form of&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>. It's bringing back the series' action-packed turn-based combat and cartoony visual style, and it's launching on November 7th.</p>

<h2><em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition&nbsp;</em>offers speedrunning fun</h2>
<p>We got a look at&nbsp;<em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition">collection of fun-looking speedrunning challenges</a> based around classic NES games. This one's coming on July 18th.</p>
<h2><em>Fairy Tail 2&nbsp;</em>is a followup to 2020's&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail</em>,&nbsp;launching in winter</h2>
<p>If you're a fan of the&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail&nbsp;</em>manga series (or the associated anime, or, indeed, the 2020 video game), then you'll be pleased to know&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail 2</em>, a new action-RPG based on the series, is on the way. It's coming in winter.</p>
<h2>Final Fantasy creator's&nbsp;<em>Fantasian&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch as&nbsp;<em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em></h2>
<p>Didn't get a chance to check out&nbsp;<em>Fantasian&nbsp;</em>on Apple devices via Apple Arcade? No problem - the diorama-based RPG from&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>creator Hironobu Sakaguchi is&nbsp;coming to Nintendo Switch as&nbsp;<em>Fantasian Neo Dimension&nbsp;</em>this holiday season.</p>

<h2><em>Nintendo Switch Sports&nbsp;</em>is getting basketball this summer</h2>
<p>Sometime this summer,&nbsp;<em>Nintendo Switch Sports&nbsp;</em>is getting a new sport in the form of basketball, which will offer solo play as well as local and online multiplayer modes.</p>
<h2><em>Mio: Memories in Orbit</em>&nbsp;is a desolate-looking Metroidvania coming in 2025</h2>
<p>Next, we got a look at&nbsp;<em>Mio: Memories in Orbit</em>, a rather stylish and stark-looking Metroidvania platformer with some very&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>-esque movement to it. It's coming to Switch in 2025.</p>

<h2>A roundup of cartoon classics</h2>
<p>Nintendo gave us a look at three cartoon classics on Switch. First,&nbsp;<em>Disney Illusion Island&nbsp;</em>is getting a new update with a brand new case to crack later today.</p>
<p>We also got to see&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>, a cute life sim launching next year, and&nbsp;<em>Looney Tunes: Wacky World of Sports</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Mario Sports</em>-style arcadey sports game starring Looney Tunes characters. That one's coming to Switch in fall.</p>
<h2><em>Among Us&nbsp;</em>is getting an update</h2>
<p>A major update is launching for&nbsp;<em>Among Us</em>, and it's bringing new crew roles, as well as a new impostor role to sink your teeth into. That update is set to arrive later today as well, and you can <a href="https://www.innersloth.com/new-roles-enter-the-fray-v2024-6-18-emergency-meeting-38/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">read more about it here</a>.</p>
<h2><em>Farmagia&nbsp;</em>is a plant-based action RPG with lots of monster-rearing</h2>
<p>Next up on the slate, it's monster-rearing action RPG&nbsp;<em>Farmagia</em>, which will have you growing monsters from plants and training them for battle&nbsp;<em>Ooblets</em>-style. You'll then engage in action-RPG combat with those monsters, and you can fuse them into mega-monsters for added oomph. It's coming on November 1st.</p>

<h2><em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD&nbsp;</em>is coming in January</h2>
<p>Since you can get&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze&nbsp;</em>on Switch, it stands to reason you should be able to get&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country Returns&nbsp;</em>as well, and lo and behold, a Switch version of the game is coming on January 16th.</p>
<h2><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>isn't all the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>you're getting</h2>
<p>Next up, it's time for a look at the rather spiffy&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</em>, which transposes the classic JRPG action of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3&nbsp;</em>into <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trademark-for-octopath-travelers-hd-2d-filed-by-square-enix">Square Enix's gorgeous HD-2D</a> world. It's launching for Switch on November 14th.</p>
<p>That's not all, though.&nbsp;Square Enix has also confirmed that remakes of the first two&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>games in the HD-2D style are also on the way next year!</p>

<h2><em>Funko Fusion&nbsp;</em>sure does have a lot of properties in it</h2>
<p>The next game on Nintendo's roster is&nbsp;<em>Funko Fusion</em>, an action-adventure game featuring a metric ton of Funko Pop characters from franchises like&nbsp;<em>Jurassic World</em>,&nbsp;<em>Jaws</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy's</em>. It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/funko-fusion-release-date">launching on September 13th</a>.</p>
<h2>A spooky, silly, strategic montage</h2>
<p>The theme for Nintendo's next rundown is "spooky, silly, strategic", and that's exactly what we got.&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD&nbsp;</em>is first up - it's coming to Switch on June 27th.</p>
<p>Then, it's time for the sheer weirdness of&nbsp;<em>The New Denpa Men</em>, a strange action-RPG that serves as a followup to the 3DS'&nbsp;<em>The Denpa Men: They Came By Wave</em>. This one's free-to-play and it's coming to Switch July 22nd as a timed console exclusive.</p>
<p>Two more games round out this montage: tower defense game&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug Attack Reloaded</em>, which launches today, and&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon 2</em>, which is coming to Switch on July 15th.</p>
<h2>Nintendo Switch Online classics abound</h2>
<p>Hey, guess what? More Nintendo Switch Online classics are coming! The GBA collection is getting&nbsp;<em>A Link to the Past&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Four Swords</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Metroid: Zero Mission</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The N64, meanwhile, is getting a new Mature 17+ collection, with&nbsp;<em>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>as its inaugural titles. All of them are coming later today.</p>
<h2><em>Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero&nbsp;</em>is a cutesy tactical RPG</h2>
<p>I didn't have a return for the <i>Phantom Brave&nbsp;</i>franchise on my bingo card, but here we are!&nbsp;<em>Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero&nbsp;</em>is a cute-looking tactical RPG in which you control phantoms in turn-based combat. It's coming in 2025.</p>
<h2>A massive Marvel fighting game collection</h2>
<p><em>Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics&nbsp;</em>is next, and it's a seven-game collection that includes classics like&nbsp;<em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>X-Men: Children of the Atom</em>, as well as a&nbsp;<em>Punisher&nbsp;</em>side-scroller. It's arriving this year.</p>
<h2><em>Super Mario Party Jamboree&nbsp;</em>brings the party in October</h2>
<p>That's right - it's time for a new <i>Mario Party&nbsp;</i>game, and Nintendo is promising that this one will be the biggest yet. It'll boast over 110 minigames across several new boards (and two returning ones from the N64's first two&nbsp;<em>Mario Party</em>&nbsp;games), and it arrives on October 17th.</p>

<h2><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is a brand new top-down&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game</h2>
<p>What's this? A remake of the&nbsp;<em>Oracle&nbsp;</em>games? No - it's a brand new&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>adventure that uses the chibi-esque art style utilized by the&nbsp;<em>Link's Awakening&nbsp;</em>remake.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>has players playing as Zelda, not Link. He's gone missing, and Zelda must adventure through Hyrule, which is now covered in strange purple rifts, to find him.</p>
<p><em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>features a mechanic by which you can "memorize" objects with "echoes", then spawn them wherever you like in order to solve puzzles. You can even "memorize" enemies to get them to fight for you!</p>
<p>This new&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game arrives on September 26th.</p>

<h2><em>Just Dance 2025&nbsp;</em>sure does exist</h2>
<p>After the adrenaline rush of a new&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game, it's time for a look at&nbsp;<em>Just Dance 2025</em>, which comes to Switch in October and brings a host of new songs, including Green Day's "Basket Case" and Ariana Grande's "yes, and?".</p>
<h2><em>Lego Horizon Adventures&nbsp;</em>looks like blocky fun</h2>
<p><i>Lego Horizon Adventures&nbsp;</i>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-summer-game-fest-2024-announcement">announced during the Summer Game Fest presentation</a>, and we got another look at it here. It looks like a cute adventure through the world of&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em>, and it's got co-op too, which is nice. It's coming this holiday.</p>
<h2><em>Stray&nbsp;</em>brings its feline fun to Switch this holiday</h2>
<p>If you haven't checked out Annapurna's&nbsp;<em>Stray&nbsp;</em>yet, you'll have another chance to do so on Switch this holiday season. You can play as a cat. What's not to like?</p>
<h2><em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>is a cozy hobbit sim coming this holiday</h2>
<p>Another game arriving on the Switch this holiday is&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire</em>, a cozy hobbit life sim in which you can live the idyllic and peaceful life of a hobbit in the town of Bywater. Hopefully, you won't be recruited for the kind of stirring adventures Bilbo and Frodo went on.</p>
<h2><em>Ace Attorney Investigations Collection&nbsp;</em>is on the case</h2>
<p>I have to be honest - this one blindsided me. Capcom is releasing&nbsp;<em>Ace Attorney Investigations Collection</em>, which collects the two DS detective adventures starring Miles Edgeworth, for Switch on September 6th. One of them has never been released in the West!</p>

<h2><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>is a tactical RPG from the&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>guys</h2>
<p>Coming to the Switch in early 2025,&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>is a new tactical RPG from the creators of&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa</em>. It looks very much like a game created by the guys behind&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa</em>.</p>
<h2><em>Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven&nbsp;</em>is a full remake of the classic RPG</h2>
<p>As its penultimate game, Nintendo revealed a remake of&nbsp;<em>Romancing SaGa 2</em>, titled&nbsp;<em>Revenge of the Seven</em>. Unlike the 2017 remaster, this one's a ground-up remake with modern visuals and gameplay tweaks. It's coming on October 24th.</p>
<h2><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>comes to Switch in 2025</h2>
<p>Finally, it's time for the big one. You guessed it:&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>is real, and we got to see some gameplay footage today.</p>
<p>The game, which is now called&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, looks a lot like a&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime&nbsp;</em>game alright; scanning, targeting, and switching to the Morph Ball are all back, and this time, it looks like Samus is doing battle with those dastardly Space Pirates again.</p>
<p><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>comes to Switch in 2025, and I'd be surprised if it wasn't a launch title for the much-mooted Switch successor.</p>

<hr><p>Well, that's everything for today's Nintendo Direct! Finally getting to see&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>after all these years really is a kick. Stay tuned for more, and here's the full show again in case you missed it!</p>

            <p>
Nintendo Switch Sports is getting a new addition: Basketball!
</p>
<p>
It will arrive later this summer as part of a free update. Nintendo made the announcement today, as part of its Direct showcase. 
</p>
<p>
"Dribble, pass and shoot in two-on-two matches, or aim for the highest score against up to three other players in Five Streak Battle," Nintedo says in its latest Switch Sports trailer, which you can see below.

We were quite taken with Nintendo Switch Sports on its original debut. 
</p>
<p>
"Ultimately, though, these games are so refined, and delivered with such odd, coffee-shop-and-library charm, that it doesn't matter how you play. My daughter is of the age where she completely missed the Wii, so when this new game arrived and we started moving the furniture around, she didn't have a clue what we were up to. But that afternoon we must have played together for hours, with breaks for when a diving header animation made her laugh so much she needed her breath back," our Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-sports-review-online-or-local-its-a-treat">Eurogamer's Nintendo Switch Sports review back in 2022</a> (poet and didn't know it). 
</p>
<p>
"The whole thing was intoxicating," he closed.
</p>

            <p>
Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Perfect Dark are heading to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-online-games-available-to-play-right-now">Nintendo Switch Online</a>, as part of the Expansion pack's new "mature" games app.
</p>
<p>

Nintendo made the announcement during this afternoon's Direct broadcast. Both N64 shooters are available from today. In addition, Perfect Dark will arrive with online multiplayer, so who is ready for a round or two later? 
</p>
<p>

As well as these mature games, Nintendo Switch Online users will be able to get their hands on GameBoy Advance's Metroid: Zero Mission and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords. You can see a little taste for what's in store via the video below.

Elsewhere during the Direct, Nintendo revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-coming-to-nintendo-switch">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD will be coming to Switch</a> in January next year. The Show's highlight, though? Nintendo only went and announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-finally-playable-in-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">new Legend of Zelda game where you actually play as the titular princess herself</a>!

The latest addition is </small><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24178014/inside-out-2-review"><small><em>Inside Out 2</em></small></a><small>, released on June 14.]</small></p>
<p id="Lcd2wN">Pixar Animation Studios’ drive for innovation has always been one of its biggest motivating forces. Pixar movies profoundly changed American studio animation, ushering in the age of computer-animated features and raising the bar on animated storytelling. They’ve consistently pushed the envelope on taboo subjects for family-friendly films, with the creative teams opening up conversations about everything from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/5/8733925/inside-out-review">the meaning of sadness</a> to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22918173/turning-red-disney-period-puberty-metaphor-domee-shi-pixar">menstruation</a> to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23660009/elemental-vs-zootopia-immigrant-story-director-peter-sohn">immigration and assimilation</a>. For cinephiles, knowing the Pixar library is crucial for understanding the field of modern animation.</p>
<p id="NVTvnX">Twenty-eight films is a lot to navigate, though, even for animation fans. So we’ve laid out which Pixar movies we think new fans (or new parents) should prioritize, or that existing fans might want to revisit or reassess. Our collective staff ranking, averaged from individual ranked lists, addresses which Pixar films we feel are most exciting, most ambitious, and most moving — the ones that most changed our perspectives on what animation and all-ages storytelling can do.</p>

<p id="Tv9ecu">The worst crime of <em>The Good Dinosaur</em>, which went <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-good-dinosaur-pixars-biggest-production-nightmare-crash-lands-into-theaters">through several incarnations and a lot of behind-the-scenes drama</a> as Pixar tried to figure out what do with its big dino film, isn’t the actual quality of the story or animation. It’s that it rarely lets viewers really care about its characters. </p>
<p id="mMMRlW">The idea of a world where dinosaurs never went extinct is rich. Certain scenes are breathtaking — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENOKlLFNaAM">Arlo the dinosaur sticking his head up into a sea of clouds</a>! A nightscape set aglow with luminous fireflies! — but the odd Western narrative (it’s basically a cowboy movie about a young rancher and his dog) doesn’t quite work for a land full of dinosaurs, where so much world-setting has to be done in order to build up the emotional core. <em>The Good Dinosaur</em> feels more like a panorama of this cool new world — cattle-rustling velociraptors! a farm run by apatosauruses! murderous pterodactyls! — than a transportive look at an alternate universe. —<em>Petrana Radulovic</em></p>

<p id="0GNsLG">2013’s <em>Monsters, Inc. </em>prequel <em>Monsters University</em> comes straight out of the unfortunate franchise mentality that says, “A popular film wrapped up its own story neatly and completely, without sequel-bait or spinoff material, so we have nowhere to go with that narrative. But what if we dug deeper into the backstory no one was asking about?” In this case, likely no one who watched <em>Monsters, Inc. </em>was obsessed with wondering what monsters Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sully (John Goodman) were like in college, or whether either of them had any dreams they had to give up on before they entered the workforce. <em>Monsters University</em> is a fun reunion for Crystal and Goodman, who have a strong dynamic together, and it’s a lively enough return to a compellingly weird world that provides a lot of opportunities for monster-y comedy riffs. But it also feels startlingly inessential for a Pixar movie, an agreeable enough feature without much new or innovative to recommend it. —<em>Tasha Robinson</em></p>

<p id="koOa5p">No one really <em>asked</em> for a <em>Toy Story 4</em>, but it might be the best “fourth movie in a 24-year-old franchise” that we could possibly get. </p>
<p id="g0cEy8">Separated from the first three movies, <em>Toy Story 4 </em>is a fun and heartwarming adventure, showing us a completely new set of characters (save for Woody and Buzz) and a new side to life as a toy. Villain Gabby Gabby has the same sort of motivation as Stinky Pete and Lotso before her: She wants to be loved by a child. But unlike the other two, her grand plan isn’t a grandiose villain scheme, but a pragmatic means to an end. Instead of declaring that no toy should be loved because she can’t be loved, she wants to fix her defective part. </p>
<p id="6V2Yv8">While <em>Toy Story 4</em> introduces some standout new characters — such as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/19/18684232/toy-story-4-forky-how-to-make-craft">beloved spork-turned-toy Forky</a> — the staple characters from the first three movies take a back seat. The movie’s emotional end, where Woody decides to part ways with the toys and Bonnie, doesn’t hit quite as hard when we’ve almost forgotten they exist. <em>—PR </em></p>

<p id="1ehZGF">I have already gone on record about how <a href="https://www.polygon.com/streaming/2021/3/1/22307039/watch-cars-2-disney-plus-new-on-shudder-criterion"><em>Cars 2</em></a> has been unfairly maligned for years. Just because it doesn’t have a big emotional tear jerking moment doesn’t mean it’s not a good movie! Unlike the other two Cars movies, <em>Cars 2</em> turns the spotlight to comedic relief Mater and thrusts him into a high-stakes spy adventure. Nothing about the Cars universe makes sense if you think about it for more than 10 seconds. In <em>Cars 2</em>, this is a feature, not a bug. It embraces all the weirdness that comes with a world full of cars. Car Pope? Sure! Car secret agents shooting wires from their tires? Hell yeah! Car mafia plotting to take over the Car world by commandeering oil reserves? Yeah, why the hell not? <em>Cars 2</em> is the perfect movie to put on and just go smooth brain and that is not a bad thing. And yeah, maybe the emotions aren’t as big and sweeping as typical Pixar fare, but seeing Mater finally embrace who he is despite the world telling him not to be himself is actually pretty touching. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="2Ek5yy">While <em>Cars 2 </em>was a funny one-off side adventure in the Cars universe — more for fun than any substance — <em>Cars 3 </em>is the natural continuation of Lightning McQueen’s character arc. Unlike some of the other <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/1/19102523/toy-story-4-ending-cars-3-pixar-movies-themes">superfluous late-2010 Pixar sequels</a>, it actually makes sense and brings Lightning’s story to a natural conclusion. He can’t be a hotshot race car forever! It’s a surprisingly poignant story about growing older and passing on your legacy to a new generation. Lightning is resistant at first, clinging to his status as a hotshot champion, but he does eventually realize that much like old racer Doc Hudson was a mentor to him, he can now be a mentor to young Cruz. It is a story that couldn’t really be told without the foundation of the first film (the fun romp of the second is basically untouched, but don’t let that deter you from <em>Cars 2</em>) and thus turns into a rare Disney sequel that feels warranted. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="h6ZTiP">In a way, all Pixar’s movies are fantasies, given their focus on living toys, talking animals, and grumpy monsters. But none of them explore the familiar tropes of epic fantasy like <em>Onward</em>, which takes place in a world full of elves, centaurs, fauns, and manticores, and follows two brothers on a quest to power a magical spell to briefly raise their father from the dead. Like <em>Shrek</em>, <em>Onward </em>takes place in a fantasy-skinned version of a familiar world, in this case one where cars and coffee shops live comfortably alongside illusion spells and pet house dragons. But the setting is almost incidental to the story, which is more about an angsty teen who never met his father and has become obsessed with everything he thinks he’s missing along with that relationship.</p>
<p id="JcQabb">There’s certainly some solid grist for emotional connection in that premise, but it doesn’t fully land until the end of the movie, which is more of a straight fetch-quest adventure than any previous Pixar film. There’s plenty of room in the story for car chases, tunnel traps, and magic-assisted problem-solving, to the point where it feels like a pretty decent D&amp;D session, with a powerful emotional punch at the end. It’s also a good-looking movie, packed with rich detail and color. It could just stand to have some of that emotional impact earlier on, to balance out the comedy and the chases. —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="CsklO6">Somewhere inside <em>Brave</em> is a fantasy film worthy of <em>Frozen, </em>but the finished product has vision issues. <em>Brave</em>’s creator — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/17/18131286/the-prince-of-egypt-director-brenda-chapman-dreamworks">experienced feature director Brenda Chapman</a>, the first woman to take a director credit at Pixar — was removed midway through production and replaced by Mark Andrews, who at that time had never directed a feature film. The reasons given amounted to disagreements between Chapman and disgraced Pixar chief creative officer John Lasseter, which was a bad look then <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/8/17443316/john-lasseter-leaving-pixar-disney">and is an even worse look now</a>. </p>
<p id="l8lCG1"><em>Brave</em> suffers for Pixar’s lack of faith. The dark tone of Chapman’s story, which is based partly on her relationship with her own daughter, feels muddied and the narrative splintered, in particular with the comedic sequences featuring Scottish princess Merida and her triplet brothers. But the forest sprites, the cursed bear, Merida and her mother’s turmoil, the entire “<em>I’ll be shootin’ fer me OWN hand!</em>” sequence — the promise of <em>Brave </em>is frustratingly present amid its pitfalls. </p>
<p id="b0zNkB">It’s also clear that Pixar was unprepared for the intense expectations placed on <em>Brave</em> as the first film in the studio’s nearly 20-year history to feature a female protagonist. The tomboy-princess marketing of <em>Brave</em> elided the fact that in the actual story, Merida isn’t rebelling against femininity, but rather her adult responsibilities — leading to much disappointment in an ending where she compromises rather than triumphs. —<em>Susana Polo</em></p>

<p id="d4LOc8">One of Pixar’s many belated sequels, <em>Finding Dory </em>shifts the focus to <em>Finding Nemo</em>’s bumbling sidekick character voiced by Ellen DeGeneres. Dory’s journey to find her parents tugs at the heartstrings, and baby Dory is incredibly, massively, intensely, super-duper adorable. <em>Finding Dory</em> brings back some iconic <em>Finding Nemo </em>characters, but only for brief appearances, choosing instead to focus on a slew of new characters. With the exception of Hank the grumpy septopus, most are forgettable.</p>
<p id="RDpZmC">The movie focuses on a specific aquarium, which offers an interesting take on the setting — watching Hank and Dory cross dry land is pretty fun — but never gets to show off the vast expanse of the ocean that made the first movie so visually stunning. <em>Finding Dory</em> is cute. It’s fun. It will make you laugh, maybe even tear up a bit. But unlike its predecessor, it doesn’t linger in the memory. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="yN81G9">In <em>Cars,</em> hotshot race car Lightning McQueen takes a hard left off the paved racetrack and into a small town in the middle of nowhere, where he is forced to confront what is important in life and makes friends for the first time ever. It’s easy to be jaded by the Cars movies and the deluge of merchandise they’ve gone on to spawn, but the first movie has a whole lot of heart. The animation is also gorgeous, especially the landscapes — the sweeping blue sky! The orange and pink-swathed desert! The soft glow of Radiator Springs’ neon and street lights when Lightning finally fixes them up! In the end, Lightning learns his lesson and gives up his top prize in order to help an old racing legend. The real Piston Cup are the friends we made along the way, truly. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="yOC5lR">With <em>Toy Story</em> now four stories deep, we maybe shouldn’t be surprised that Pixar can pull off a sequel. But the stakes were high for <em>The Incredibles 2</em>, a follow-up to an already delightfully whole tale about a family of superheroes. As sequels go, this one is still pretty  incandescent. Now Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) gets to be the one bringing home the bacon as a superhero, leading to some indelible action sequences as she hunts down the nefarious “Screenslaver.” Bob “Mr. Incredible” Parr (Craig T. Nelson) is left watching the kids and juggling their regular lives with their powered lives. Ultimately the thrust of the film isn’t quite as indescribably neat as this list’s reigning champ, but we get another day out to Edna Mode’s studio, which is no chump change. It might not quite as incisive as the first, but <em>Incredibles 2 </em>is a great sequel and an indelible extension of the super-family’s story. —<em>Zosha Millman</em></p>

<p id="d2c86u">Like the movie’s absent-minded hero Flik, <em>A Bug’s Life</em> wobbles while still carrying its weight. Pixar’s loose adaptation of Aesop’s The Ant and the Grasshopper, by way of <em>Seven Samurai</em> and the spaghetti Western, was an ambitious follow-up to the nostalgia-soaked <em>Toy Story</em>. But the animation technology of the time couldn’t quite realize the majesty and chaos of the insect conflict. (The water droplets, though — they were something!) </p>
<p id="2UVKwA">As in the best of Pixar’s films, it’s the characters of <em>A Bug’s Life</em> who save the day. Dave Foley as Flik is an underrated voice-over triumph, while his recruits, the Circus Bugs, have a rapport that the Toy Story gang never quite mustered. The ant-vs.-grasshopper battle stumbles under the weight of landscape textures and jerky arthropod motion, but the fear  and the life-or-death stakes come to life in the performances. —<em>Matt Patches</em></p>

<p id="mQYB77"><em>Lightyear </em>is about the <em>real</em> Buzz Lightyear — no, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22748569/real-buzz-lightyear-movie-explained">not an actual human person</a>, but a character in a fictional movie that <em>Toy Story</em>’s Andy loved when he was a kid, the film that inspired the toy character we see in the Toy Story movies. But don’t think too hard about the <em>Toy Story</em> connection, because in reality, <em>Lightyear</em>’s director, Angus MacLane, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23034598/lightyear-pixar-director-interview-early-press-day">wanted to make an epic science fiction film</a> that adults could enjoy too. And it’s <em>almost</em> that.</p>
<p id="fIN8Pn">Amid the stellar action sequences and the cool gadgetry, <em>Lightyear</em> is remarkably restrained. There are moments where it feels like the movie could really dig into its emotional beats, but for whatever reason, it holds back, never quite revealing its full hand, even when all the cards are right there. The plot its pretty standard sci-fi fare, but for kids watching, it may be the very first taste they get of the genre. And hey, since this is supposed to be the 1990s movie that became Andy’s first exposure to science fiction, that’s a feature, not a bug. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="pGo5rh">Pixar’s first movie to center on a Black protagonist lands a little oddly when it turns out the film’s big moral message is “The things you love most in life aren’t necessarily the things that give you purpose.” Directors Pete Docter and Kemp Powers blunt what could be a slam-dunk emotional ending by giving it a more adult spin, in a way that may make it hard for children to grasp. (Most 8-year-olds are going to have a hard time empathizing with a character who feels like a failure because he has to hang out in a school and work with kids.) </p>
<p id="s3hBGW">But <em>Soul</em>’s visual verve and pure emotions are hard to beat. Just as lead character Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx) finally gets the jazz-pianist gig that might finally let him drop his time-killing gig as a middle-school music teacher and pursue music full time, he dies in an accident and finds himself in the afterlife, fighting to make his way back to Earth. There are a lot of wacky incidents involving a bratty soul who’s never been incarnated and doesn’t want to be (voiced by Tina Fey), and a therapy cat, and a group of benevolent but neglectful pre-life counselors (voiced by Richard Ayoade and Alice Braga, among others). But <em>Soul</em>’s core is really in the unbeatable moments where Joe expresses himself through music, inspiring other people or pulling himself out of his day-to-day life for a few minutes. Sometimes it’s a goofy and playful movie, but it’s firmly entrenched in the idea that life is a rare and wondrous thing that shouldn’t be taken for granted. —<em>TR</em> </p>

<p id="UpeTrB">Pixar’s second film in two years (after <em>Turning Red</em>) about the tension between a second-generation immigrant girl and a demanding, traditional parent, <em>Elemental</em> looks too familiar at first glance, and the apparent Romeo-and-Juliet romance doesn’t help. But it’s all a lot more nuanced and effective than the surface elements suggest. </p>
<p id="GNBk1d">In a city where the inhabitants are based in the four elements, privileged water-person Wade (Mamoudou Athie) finds it hard to understand the bigotry and familial pressure that his new fire-person friend Ember (Leah Lewis) experiences every day. But the more time the two of them spend together, the more they come to see each other’s perspectives. Their slow-burn romance is just one thread among many in a story that sometimes seems overstuffed because it’s balancing so many themes and ideas, including thoughts on assimilation and integration, prejudice and stereotypes, the importance of family traditions, the oppression of bureaucracy and systemic failures, and even where anger comes from. </p>
<p id="HXzCue">It’s an awful lot for one story, but <em>The Good Dinosaur</em> director Peter Sohn still leaves time throughout for quiet moments of strikingly rich and beautifully composed imagery, and for some full-on goofy gags built around life as an element-person. Not every element of the film fits together or works together, but a tremendously engaging score (from<em> WALL-E</em> and <em>Finding Nemo</em> composer Thomas Newman) and a deep emotional grounding help boost this film and pave over the cracks. —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="VraXae">Before Domee Shi stepped up from directing the Pixar short <em>Bao</em> to the feature <em>Turning Red</em>, Pixar’s Enrico Casarosa went through the same process, starting with the 2011 Pixar short <em>La Luna </em>and graduating up to his own feature, <em>Luca</em>. Like Shi, Casarosa turned his fantasy-adventure into a personal story drawing from his own youth, while also experimenting with a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/22535601/luca-pixar-3d-cg-animation">more stylized, more cartoonish visual style</a> than past Pixar projects. All of which makes <em>Luca </em>lighter, fluffier, and lower-stakes than any of the classic tearjerker moments that made Pixar’s name in animation. <em>Luca </em>is another “kid rebels against smothering parents” story, with timid sea-monster kid Luca meeting bolder sea-monster kid Alberto and running off to a life on land among humans. There, he gets involved in some fairly small-stakes adventures. But a lot of the joy of <em>Luca </em>is the way it focuses in on the journey, on why a bike race winds up being so profoundly important to the character, and on the lazy, sunny childhood days that lead up to that race. It isn’t a film with profound, heavy impact, but it’s an unusually bright and pleasant look at childhood joys and obsessions, and how sharing them can instantly cement friendships.  —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="hnoawI">Young girls who watched their <em>Toy Story 2 </em>VHS tapes over and over (who may or not be me) were just about to go off to college when <em>Toy Story 3</em> came out. <em>Toy Story 2</em> set up an ominous future — what would happen to the toys when their owner Andy grew up? At the end of <em>Toy Story 2</em>, the toys agreed that a short life of love was better than eternity in a museum. But <em>Toy Story 3</em> brings us to the end of their time with Andy, who has long left his toys in their chest, and is moving on to higher education.</p>
<p id="gG1EUR">Woody and the gang are now desperate in a way only hinted at in <em>Toy Story 2. </em>They <em>need</em> love from Andy. Though the cowboy is the clear favorite to go along with the boy to college, he has to reassure the others that going into storage won’t be so bad. At the end, though, <em>Toy Story 3 </em>doesn’t take that easy path, and instead closes a chapter of the toys’ lives — and of Andy’s life as well. </p>
<p id="E9C85Q">One of the final moments, where Bonnie raises Woody’s hand to wave goodbye at Andy, and Andy’s expression catches for a moment, never fails to make me cry. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="32iBIT">The opening of Pete Doctor’s high-flying odyssey goes so hard people barely remember what makes it a great film. The preface of <em>Up</em>, set to Michael Giacchino’s memorable “Married Life” cue, chronicles Carl and Ellie Fredricksen’s courtship, marriage, buying of a home, dreams of a family, miscarriage, grief, hope, love, settling down, and Ellie’s death all in the span of five minutes. But the weight of Carl’s modestly lived life is no match for his dream of making it to the mythic Paradise Falls (or hundreds of helium-filled balloons, for that matter). Before nursing home goon squad can lock him up, he and stowaway scout Russell take to the skies, and embark on a journey that feels bespoke for animation. </p>
<p id="znhigI">Paradise Falls’ lush jungle setting combined with the corrupt explorer Charles Muntz’s airship and fleet to pilot dogs reimagines the covers of pulp novels in the vivid Pixar style. The aerial photography and action establishes a fantastical set of physics that even Christopher Nolan would struggle to match. The most daring choice might be focusing an entire movie on a crank like Carl. There is no room in the live-action blockbuster machine for an octogenarian with a walker, but in the magical realms of Pixar, our hero can grapple with villains <em>and </em>his late-life purpose. <em>Up</em>’s episodic nature keeps it from floating to the top tier of Pixar, but the ambition of the filmmaking is befitting of the dreamer at the heart of the action. —<em>MP</em></p>

<p id="nXeftU">Kelsey Mann’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131409/inside-out-2-preview-first-look-new-emotions-uncut-gems">2024 sequel to Pete Docter’s <em>Inside Out</em></a> gets dinged a few slots purely for not being as vitally original and groundbreaking as some of the other movies further up on the list. But it’s a winning, moving film with a lot to recommend it, even in comparison with one of Pixar’s best. This movie adds <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24155725/inside-out-2-character-design-same-face-female-characters-disney-princess">a new group of emotions</a> to the cast list, and sees them jockeying for what they think is best for their charge, 13-year-old Riley Andersen. There are a lot more of the first movie’s mental-landscape puns and visual gags here, and a similar clever attention paid to how emotions interact and come into conflict, particularly in puberty. But what really makes this movie land is how real and relatable Riley’s adolescent conflicts feel, and how well this movie follows up on the original’s investment in Riley’s development and her internal world. Like so many of the best Pixar movies, it’s a tearjerker. —<em>TR</em>  </p>

<p id="0GjiUX">The original <em>Toy Story</em> wondered, “What if toys were alive?” The second introduced the concept of their longevity, the fact that one day their kids would outgrow them. <em>Toy Story 2</em> is both a heartfelt examination of past, present, and future, and a sturdy step toward the more emotional territory of future sequels, introducing the juxtaposition of fleeting childhood and the permanence of toys.</p>
<p id="4rBg7X">Nothing sums up the emotional core of <em>Toy Story 2 </em>more than the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km4WiqKtZ-E">“When She Loved Me” montage</a>: Sarah McLachlan croons a bittersweet song over scenes of cowgirl doll Jessie and her owner Emily playing together, growing apart, and eventually completely parting ways. The sequence, swathed in a medley of autumn colors, is pure Pixar. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="K0Ghnt">The first <em>Toy Story</em> was something of a miracle: a technological revolution that still managed to tell a story. While the sequels really gnawed away at the existential questions dredged up by the first, the original movie just focuses on the toys and their love for their owner, Andy. The buddy-cop dynamic of Woody and Buzz shines as the two navigate a contentious relationship and an identity crisis. The entire concept could’ve been played straight for laughs, but instead turns into a heartwarming tale of friendship, conflict, and the halcyon days of childhood.</p>
<p id="eQdjaj">Pixar’s first film was born out of conflict — <a href="https://www.retrojunk.com/article/show/3197/a-history-of-toy-story">Disney hands tried to make the plot more adult </a>— but it’s a true testament to how animation can meld with human emotion. Equal parts humor and heart, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gthEMHhS9zI">terror</a> and triumph, <em>Toy Story</em> still holds up after all these years.<em> —PR</em></p>

<p id="seYKtG">The movie that launched a thousand ill-fated pet clownfish sends Marlin (Albert Brooks) across the ocean with a forgetful blue tang (Ellen DeGeneres) from an idyllic coral reef to an eerie sunken battleship, from the depths of the abyssal zone to the roaring East Australian Current. The movie switches between Marlin’s quest to find his son and Nemo’s new life in a fish tank. Neither storyline is dull, with Nemo’s basically turning into an escape plan helmed by Willem Dafoe’s Gill. The movie also boasts a colorful cast of side characters — from the struggling vegetarian sharks and Nemo’s precocious classmates to the quirky tank gang and Crush the surfer-dad turtle — who help the movie “just keep swimming.”</p>
<p id="IP36aW">At its heart, though, <em>Finding Nemo </em>is a story about being a parent, about doing whatever it takes to protect your child — and about learning when it’s time to let them go. —<em>PR</em> </p>

<p id="pcgohZ">Pixar has struggled to present perspectives outside of the experiences of Lasseter and the company’s elder creatives. You can see it in the long wait between <em>The Incredibles</em> and <em>Incredibles 2</em>. You can see it in <em>Brave</em>’s production woes. </p>
<p id="pcpasK">But you don’t see it in <em>Coco</em>. The musical adventure, from <em>Toy Story 3</em> director Lee Unkrich, mixes the best of the Pixar formula with the Disney formula, combining music, character, and a story-first approach to tell a tale of a boy who follows his dreams so hard that he fixes his whole dang family, living <em>and</em> dead.</p>
<p id="3RdyY3">As I said <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/8/16621900/coco-disney-pixar-review">in my review</a>, plenty of college kids on semesters abroad have discovered the aesthetics of the Mexican celebration of Día de Muertos, but Pixar’s vision of the Land of the Dead is rich, coherent, and a joy to inhabit. <em>Coco</em> charms; it has a surprisingly evil villain; it gets those Pixar Tears from your eyeballs. You’re probably still humming “Remember Me.” <em> —SP</em></p>

<p id="aeiysA">There are two kinds of people in this world: People who don’t like Domee Shi’s feature directorial debut <em>Turning Red</em> because it’s too specific about a whole lot of aspects of the teen-girl experience not normally seen in movies, and people who love it for exactly that reason. There’s a standard “kid rebels against overbearing family member” story buried in here, but Shi makes it anything but standard, by letting her 13-year-old Chinese-Canadian protagonist Mei contend with everything from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22918173/turning-red-disney-period-puberty-metaphor-domee-shi-pixar">menstruation talk</a> to a sudden obsession with drawing horny fan-art to <a href="https://twitter.com/TashaRobinson/status/1502366352383877126">getting absolutely messy</a> over her boy-band fandoms. And that’s all aside from her turning into a giant red panda when she’s emotional. <em>Turning Red</em> is weirdly frenetic and cartoony for a Pixar feature, with a hyper protagonist who introduces herself by shouting the details of her life directly into the camera for the audience. And that’s all highly deliberate, as Shi and co-writer Julia Cho navigate the big emotions and big problems of early adolescence, both on a symbolic level, with Mei’s sudden uncontrollable body changes, and on a very literal level, with her friendships and fandoms and school problems. It’s a joyous movie about identity and self-acceptance, but for those of us who like our movies distinctive, idiosyncratic, and voice-y, it’s also joyously weird and wild.  —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="H88zOR">Andrew Stanton’s science-fiction odyssey, set in 2185, is a triptych of disparate stories glued together with feels. There’s the dystopian tale of a worker bot tidying up a busted, deserted world that could easily stand alone as a short; there’s the love story of two robots, a pure blend of Asimov and Disney; and there’s the rescue mission, a galactic journey that whisks WALL-E to the Axiom mothership for an encounter with a HAL 9000-like A.I. Our li’l robot friend, brought to life through the beeps and boops of Star Wars sound designer Ben Burtt, beholds every narrative jump with binocular-eyed wonder. So do we.</p>
<p id="CUWyoA">Elegiac and eerie, <em>WALL-E</em> is a love letter to everything Stanton would miss about Earth (<em>Hello, Dolly!</em> chief among them) and an impassioned plea for us slovenly earthlings to do what we can to save it before it’s too late. We’ll see if humanity can get its act together, but even if we’re destined to decimate the planet and float around in hover chairs on a rocket-powered shopping mall for the rest of our days, we’ll always have WALL-E and EVE dancing among the stars, an ode to the beauty that once was. As is the ongoing mission of Pixar, <em>WALL-E</em> conjures romantic truth. —<em>MP</em></p>

<p id="rwQSzo">I love <em>Ratatouille</em> because the basic premise of this family-friendly film could also be read as horror. Think about it: If someone told you a rat <em>sat on their head</em> and then proceeded to <em>control their body by pulling their hair</em>, would you be rooting for the rat? Probably not. But in <em>Ratatouille</em> you will absolutely be rooting for Remy to succeed in his dream to become a French chef. </p>
<p id="hFILt1">That dream starts small. At first, Remy just wants to get to cook, since rats mostly forage for garbage. Many of us have felt that hopeless desire to make art even if we seemed ill-suited or if our friends and families doubt us. When Remy meets Linguini, the hapless human who can be operated like a hair-inette (an, erm, hair marinette), they create a mutually beneficial arrangement. Linguini, a garbage boy at a Parisian restaurant, will be the perfect vehicle for Remy to develop his cooking skills, allowing them to advance in the kitchen.</p>
<p id="k2R2YI"><em>Ratatouille</em>’s physical comedy is wonderful — the puppeteering technique takes time to perfect, as does learning the art of French cooking — and the food looks so tasty and aromatic. The film’s core takeaway “not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere,” turns a funny premise into a kind of parable about access and platform, and what might happen if we give more people opportunities to develop their craft. —<em>Nicole Clark</em></p>

<p id="fVij8N">When <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> was released, it was early enough in Pixar’s run that critics were still pointing out how the studio’s movies could delight parents and kids alike. You hear those remarks less and less as Pixar has proved time and again that those sensibilities don’t have to be at odds. But <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> is as good an encapsulation as any at what makes Pixar’s work stand the test of time: A creative and colorful new world, a concept that appeals to kids but has resonance beyond childhood, and alternatingly heartfelt and funny construction made <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> feel like an instant classic. There’s good action and good conflict, and with relatively few chinks in the armor. In the end, the world we came to know so well has shifted, and kids everywhere can rest easy with their closet door so nearby. That Pixar sweet spot that sits somewhere between “Mike Wazowski!” and “Kitty!” And our hearts are all the better for it.  —<em>ZM</em></p>

<p id="fvvecU"><em>Inside Out</em> takes place largely inside the mind of 11-year-old Riley, which allows the artists at Pixar to stretch their world-building and design imaginations. The aspects of the human psyche become bubbly personifications — Amy Poehler is terrifically cast as the embodiment of Joy, along with Mindy Kaling voicing the snooty Disgust — but the movie amounts to more than a wacky adventure into consciousness. <em>Inside Out </em>handles the delicate and complicated feelings of growing up. Joining Sadness and Joy on their quest through Riley’s mind is kooky imaginary friend Bing Bong, who gets a surprisingly poignant arc.</p>
<p id="DS4GXF">Pixar films never shy away from the big emotional beats, but by virtue of <em>Inside Out</em> being a film about emotion,<em> </em>its climax — the epiphany that Sadness (Phyllis Smith) is a <em>necessary</em> part of processing emotions — hits particularly hard. —<em>PR </em></p>

<p id="CifndZ">Back when superheroes were still a goofy thing for kids, or at most a guilty treat for adults, Brad Bird’s <em>The Incredibles</em> bounded onto the big screen, combining the Fantastic Four, the nuclear family sitcom, the entire mid-century-modern aesthetic, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/2017/11/9/16623570/watchmen-story-explained-creation-alan-moore">basically the same story setup as <em>Watchmen</em></a> into what might be the crispest, most tightly orchestrated action movie ever made. </p>
<p id="O7qF1a"><em>The Incredibles</em> is superbly plotted and paced, and skips along to a Giacchino soundtrack that wouldn’t sound out of place in a Bond film. There isn’t a single throwaway scene or line — nor are there throwaway characters. The Parr family makes up the heart of the film, of course, while the entitled Syndrome and his ambitions form the spine of the plot. But when you widen the net? No duds, people. </p>
<p id="OwdKFv">Frozone: Instantly beloved. Bob’s weaselly insurance boss, the weaseliest boss to ever exist. Superhero Relocation Agent Rick Dicker, shaped and voiced as if you had distilled every Tommy Lee Jones role down to its most concentrated essence. The Parrs’ hapless babysitter. Supervillain second-in-command Mirage. Even freakin’ gag villain Bomb Voyage — I bet you can picture every one of them. And is there a secondary character more instantly iconic than Edna Mode?</p>
<p id="LKMyRN">And to boot: this collection of memorable character designs, all in the first Pixar film in which the company attempted to present human figures as the leads. It’s nothing short of — well, you can guess. —<em>SP </em></p>

Takumi is part of a group of students at the school who must defend it against monsters in grid-based strategy encounters for 100 days. The academy is apparently very secretive and you will lose classmates over the course of the game, which is not surprising considering this game is from the creators of the Danganronpa series. In the Danganronpa games, the mortality of nearly every character is always on the line.</p>

While collections focusing on series like Street Fighter and Darkstalkers have proven popular, today's announcement might be the most anticipated collection Capcom can put out, as it is bringing back seven of its beloved Marvel-focused games in one package.</p>

<p>Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a bundle headlined by the iconic Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, but six other titles join the collection, dating back to 1994's X-Men: Children of the Atom. The full collection includes X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, and side-scrolling beat-'em-up The Punisher.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/ark-survival-ascended-crossover-makes-me-yearn-for-a-big-power-rangers/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ark-survival-ascended-crossover-makes-me-yearn-for-a-big-power-rangers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Did you know that <em>Ark: Survival Ascended</em>, a game all about surviving on a prehistoric island inhabited by dinosaurs, has added <em>Power Rangers</em>-themed content of all things? I didn’t until I woke up this morning, and it may just be the most bizarre gaming crossover of 2024.</p> <p data-characters="565" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">I suppose it does make some sense since the crossover is specifically with the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers team, whose giant Zords took the form of prehistoric creatures, like a tyrannosaurus rex and a saber-toothed tiger. It’s also a mod that’s <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/ark-survival-ascended/mods/mighty-morphin-cosmetic-pack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">completely free to download</a>, letting you dress your character up as one of the five original Rangers, complete with unique animations, and there are even optional skins for your weapons and specific dinosaurs, turning them into the Dinozords. Sadly, the Green Ranger and his Dragonzord are absent.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="ARK x Power Rangers" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f8JH-E9Cprg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="740" data-injectable="true">The image of roaming around the world with these giant robot dinosaurs while dressed as a Power Ranger is admittedly amusing, but watching the above trailer only makes me think there’s untapped potential in a big budget <em>Power Rangers</em> game. Imagine getting to run around Angel Grove fighting monsters with fun fighting moves and over-the-top weaponry. Then hopping into your Zord or the Megazord itself for large-scale monster battles.</p>
 <p data-characters="671" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">It wouldn’t even need to be open world; I’d happily take something more linear or mission-based so long as it had a lot of cool flair and tight combat. In my head, I’m picturing something akin to PlatinumGames’ sorely underappreciated <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-transformers-devastation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Transformers Devastation</a></em> (if you know, you know). In fact, Platinum’s expertise with action games makes it a perfect fit for the series. It even made <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-wonderful-101-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wonderful 101</a></em>, which drew a lot of influence from Japanese superhero media like <em>Super Sentai</em>, the source material for <em>Power Rangers</em>. I’m not even that big of a <em>Power Rangers</em> fan, but I’d be all over a PlatinumGames-made <em>Power Rangers</em> title.</p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">While it may not scratch that exact itch, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-looks-like-a-retro-tastic-good-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind</a></em> (which launches later this year) looks like it could be the next best thing. Announced at Summer Game Fest, this retro inspired beat ’em up is one big love letter to the original show, featuring co-op gameplay, some astounding pixel art visuals, and first-person Megazord fights.</p>

<p data-characters="441" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As part of today’s Nintendo Direct, Square Enix revealed the open RPG <em>Romancing SaGa 2</em>, originally released back in 1993, has gotten the full remake treatment. The <em>Romancing SaGa</em> series allows players to forge their own stories as they choose from an arsenal of main characters and expand their legacy, passing down powers and skills with each generation. <em>Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven</em> is headed to Switch on October 24, 2024.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven – Announce Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tj_cfyPw9tU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="152" data-current-count="452" data-injectable="true">Based on the trailer, it looks like <em>Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven</em> features some pretty substantial upgrades both graphically and gameplay-wise.</p>
 <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="278" data-injectable="false">In <em>Romancing Saga 2</em> players must oversee a Royal Court, leading an empire to longevity and prosperity by dictating its economy, technology, city construction, and magic. At its core, <em>Romancing SaGa 2</em> is about prospering over generations as opposed to focusing on the short term.</p> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="503" data-injectable="true">This is another one I’ve yet to play, primarily because it was originally released in Japan and I just never got around to playing. It looks like a great time to finally get into it with the <em>Revenge of the Seven</em> remake.</p>
 <p data-characters="102" data-current-count="102" data-injectable="false"><em>Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven</em> is scheduled to release on Nintendo Switch on October 24, 2024.</p>
