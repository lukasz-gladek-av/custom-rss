            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Control&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>studio Remedy has released its financial statement for the first half of the 2025 fiscal year, and the company has admitted it's not happy with the launch sales of its latest game&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a>, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala says that despite a 43% increase in revenue over last year's first half, as well as "an initial accrual from subscription service agreements with Sony and Microsoft",&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>"underperformed" on Steam, which Virtala describes as "the primary consumer sales channel on PC" for the game.</p>

<p>According to Virtala,&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>'s underperformance is due to its "initial onboarding experience and mission structure", which, when taken together, "resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews". These led to what Virtala calls a "rocky launch" for the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc-firebreak-launch-sales-remedy-financials-shooting.jpg?itok=165J9pCp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc-firebreak-launch-sales-remedy-financials-shooting.jpg?itok=aqHnfjNJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>FBC: Firebreak</em>'s initial sales haven't impressed developer and publisher Remedy.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite these initial wobbles, however, Virtala says he believes that&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>is "a solid game to build on", and that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-whats-next" rel="nofollow">major update coming in September</a>&nbsp;will serve as "the next key step" for the multiplayer shooter. Given that the game is currently <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at just 16 players</a> on Steam, with a 22-player 24-hour peak, let's hope Remedy can turn things around.</p>

<p>With regards to the studio's other upcoming games, Virtala says progress is brisk.&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, which Remedy says will move in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-action-rpg" rel="nofollow">a more action RPG-wards direction</a>, is "on track towards meeting its next milestones", Virtala says, with development currently focused on various core gameplay systems and world design elements.</p>

<p>As for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/max-payne-remakes-control-spinoff-remedy" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes</a>, they're still "in full production", and Remedy's collaboration with&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>IP holder Rockstar "remains close and productive", which is always nice to hear. Let's hope we get more info about those soon.</p>

<p>Remedy also says that sales for the original&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>crossed the five million mark during this year's second quarter, following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-control-franchise-rights" rel="nofollow">transferral of the franchise rights</a> from original owner 505 Games last year.</p>

              <p>Remedy, the creators of&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake</em> and&nbsp;<em>Control</em>, have had a good six months. The company’s revenue has risen by 63 percent, which is just the sort of good news you want to be able to tell your parents, and at the same time the company completed buying all the rights to&nbsp;<em>Control</em> from publishers 505 Games, as part of its plans to become fully independent of external publishers. Lovely to be them. However, despite all this good news, it seems Remedy’s latest game, three-player co-op shooter <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, is still struggling. But Remedy isn’t giving up on it.</p> <p>Back in July, while acknowledging the launch hadn’t gone as well as hoped, Remedy’s Thomas Punha <a href="https://kotaku.com/remedy-control-fbc-firebreak-lowplayer-count-update-1-3-1851785449">tried to downplay the significance of the very low player counts on Steam</a>. “Steam is a very important part of the business of&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>,” he told&nbsp;<em>GameSpot.</em>&nbsp;“The Steam [active player count] is a very easy statistic to dig up, but it isn’t everything.”</p> <p>However, it seems like it’s still an awful lot. In the <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5">company’s latest financial report</a>, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala concedes that PC was where <em>Firebreak</em> had been intended to best succeed, but it has instead fared vastly better on console thanks to subscription deals. “On Steam, which was planned as the primary consumer sales channel on PC, the launch underperformed,” says Virtala. “The game’s initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews. As players spent more time in the game and we released updates improving the game, sentiment in reviews turned more positive.”</p>

 <p>Well, that’s kinda true. The game remains on “Mixed” reviews on Steam, although it’s trending slightly more positively. Currently 68 percent of the 1,685 reviews are positive, although even this stat belies just how few people are playing. It’s all very well to say players are having a better time, but how many? To this day, the game has an all-time peak simultaneous player-count of 1,992, and that was two months ago. In the last 24 hours, the game peaked at 24 people. It’s a colossal flop.</p> <p>The higher (although not stated) numbers on console are likely because the game was included day-one on both Game Pass and PS Plus, meaning anyone with a sub can take a risk-free look, even, if they–like most humans–will struggle to coordinate three people to play at the same time. Still, you make money by putting your games on these services, as Virtala points out:</p> <blockquote><p>“Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>. Thus far,&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>’s commercial performance has largely been driven by the Xbox and PlayStation subscription service agreements. A considerable portion of the revenues from these agreements will still be recognized throughout the contract period.”</p></blockquote> <p>Despite all this, Remedy is valiantly sticking with <em>Firebreak</em>, even though I think anyone would give them a pass at this point. There’s still a “Major Update” coming in September, which the company plans to support with a marketing campaign in an effort to turn its fortunes around. Virtala adds, “We are committed to continuing to work on <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, engaging with the community, and expanding the game.”</p> <p>In better news, the report states that&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em> is meeting its milestones, and the <em>Max Payne 1 &amp; 2&nbsp;</em>remake “continues its progress and remains in full production.” Meanwhile, the original&nbsp;<em>Control</em> has now sold over 5 million copies, which is stunning. And the company is well on its way to becoming self-sustaining as a self-publishing studio freed from publisher pressure and fees.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You can’t deny FBC: Firebreak is ambitious, even if it is a game no one was necessarily clamoring for. The latter part of this is now evident, as Remedy has given deeper insight into FBC: Firebreak’s underwhelming launch and plans for the IP.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-fbc-firebreak-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a> was Remedy’s first new release since the Game of the Year-contending <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-over-2-million-copies-and-is-finally-profitable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>. Firebreak is set in Control’s (another Remedy IP) world and is a team-based FPS. This is quite a bold shift from the company’s other games. We’ve seen from gameplay and matches that the game has potential, but its launch has failed to land.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Firebreak hasn’t caught yet. Credit to Remedy</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s quite damning to hear that the FBC: Firebreak “launch underperformed.” This is the official word from Remedy’s Jan-Jun 2025 financial <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>.</p>



<p>“On Steam, which was planned as the primary consumer sales channel on PC, the launch underperformed. The game’s initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews.”</p>



<p>The company was happy that “The launch succeeded technically, reaching over 1 million players in its first 10 days,” but goes on to say: “Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of&nbsp;FBC: Firebreak.”</p>



<p>The majority of the shooter’s revenue has come from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreak-xbox-game-pass-playstation-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus</a>-subscribing users. Firebreak was free on both services at launch.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, despite the adversity, Remedy believes FBC: Firebreak is a “solid game” the team can build on: “Looking ahead, a larger ‘Major Update’ late September will be the next key step for&nbsp;FBC: Firebreak. This will be supported by targeted marketing activities, which we expect to drive interest in the title. We are committed to continuing to work on&nbsp;FBC: Firebreak, engaging with the community, and expanding the game.”</p>



<p>Do you think Firebreak can bounce back? With so many live-service games out there, it’s tough to stand out. Let me know if you think it can by heading to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>PlayerUnknown Productions has announced that an open beta for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prologue-go-wayback/">Prologue: Go Wayback</a> is now available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" rel="nofollow ">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/prologue-go-wayback-72ee27" rel="nofollow ">Epic Games Store</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creators-new-rust-inspired-survival-game-is-getting-a-free-steam-beta/1100-6531371/">A Rust-inspired survival game</a>, Prologue: Go Wayback combines hardcore roguelike survival gameplay with a dynamic weather system and machine-learning models to create a unique experience for every player. The next game from PUBG creator Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene, the open beta will run until the launch of the game's early access period on PC.</p><p>"After running playtests with our Discord community over the last six months--and receiving some fantastic feedback--we decided to take the time to add more ways to explore our generated worlds based on our community's suggestions," PlayerUnknown Productions said in a press release. "We have a great survival experience, with millions of maps for players to explore in the open beta, and over the coming months leading up to our Early Access launch, we plan to add more features to further customize your preferred way to play."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hU9eG0-Ep8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_hU9eG0-Ep8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players will have a 64km² map based on the Czech Bohemia region to explore, with the world being rendered with ML models in Unreal Engine 5 and then populated procedurally with custom assets such as trees, rivers, rocks, cliffs, hills, and shelters. PlayerUnknown Productions added that this ML model is trained on publicly available open-source data and vetted to prevent the use of any copyrighted material.</p><p>One of the other factors that sets Prologue: Go Wayback apart from other survival games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prologue-go-backs-first-trailer-pits-man-versus-dangerously-cold-weather/1100-6529755/">is an emphasis on body temperature</a>, as players will have to manage their internal heat by finding better clothes and by building fires to stay warm as they search for the fabled Weather Tower. Prologue: Go Wayback also serves as the foundation for Project Artemis, something that PlayerUnknown Productions refers to as a platform that will enable "massive-scale creation" for future projects.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Interestingly, Battlefield 2042 had the opposite problem, with players often complaining that the maps felt too big and often lifeless. In the BF6 beta, however, players are saying that the small map sizes mean they are pushed to engage far too often.</p><p>The criticism is far from universal, of course. Some players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ml9u97/psa_small_maps_are_not_a_new_thing_this_is_bf3s/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stand behind</a> the smaller maps, pointing out that some fan-favorite Battlefield maps like Sienne Crossing and Grand Bazaar were also small. Other players counter that the issue with the new maps may not be their actual size, but how combat and movement flow through them.</p><p>The largest of the beta maps, Liberation Peak, suffers from a different design issue that has been annoying players--terrain that heavily favors snipers. The abundance of snipers has been parodied in memes showing an absurd number of sniper glints coming from Liberation Peak's rocky terrain--though real screenshots posted in the replies show these edits aren't really that far from the truth.</p><p>Of course the point of a beta is that elements that don't work can be changed before the game's launch, which is scheduled for October 10 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. BF6 devs have publicly addressed some feedback, while EA also has a full <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-all-major-changes-confirmed-for-launch/2900-6845/" data-ref-id="2900-6845">list of changes</a> that will be implemented pre-launch. The developer has said it will be going over player feedback from the beta to identify what else needs to be modified before launch.</p><p>Players will have a chance to check out more Battlefield 6 maps and different modes when the open beta returns for a second weekend on August 14. For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">Battlefield 6 open beta breakdown.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Remedy has been distracted by other games in recent years. But Control 2 is one of the company’s biggest upcoming projects, and not only have we learned new details about the game’s progress, but the company has announced a huge milestone for the franchise.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-ultimate-editions-new-update-introduces-hideo-kojima-mission-for-all-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Control</a> felt interesting until the game’s final moments: The puzzles, the paranormal activity in the environment, and your powers. It felt like something was <em>always </em>happening. It could see-saw from horror to hot action in a heartbeat. The demand for a second game has been strong for a while, and it appears the sequel is getting closer.</p>



<h2 id="h-control-2-development-is-on-track-says-remedy-entertainment">Control 2 Development is “On Track,” Says Remedy Entertainment</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More Jessie is a good thing. Credit to Remedy</figcaption></figure>



<p>The 2025 Remedy Half-year financial report told us several things: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-games-working-closely-with-remedy-entertainment-on-max-payne-1-2-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar and Remedy are working together on the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake</a>, the Control franchise has surpassed 5 million lifetime copies sold and counting, and Control 2 is coming along nicely.</p>



<p>Here’s the official <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">word</a> on Control 2’s development: “Control 2&nbsp;development is on track towards meeting its next milestones. The focus is now on the gameplay, environments, and missions. Work continues on developing the game into a strong commercial offering.”</p>



<p>The next milestones could be an official reveal trailer or even a gameplay reveal right out of the gate. I think it’s safe to assume from this that we’re still quite some way off from Control 2 hitting shelves and digital storefronts, though.</p>



<p>One thing’s for sure: Remedy has a lot on its plate with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreaks-new-patch-introduces-faster-progression-and-economy-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBC Firebreak</a>, the Max Payne Remake, and Control 2.</p>



<p>What did you love most about the first Control? For me, it was all of it, to be honest. I want to hear what you think, and you can get a conversation underway courtesy of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Dixon to talk about what's new, when Phasmophobia will finally feel finished, the possibility of Phasmophobia 2, and what it's like working with Blumhouse Films on a movie adaptation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Tell us about the reworked maps. Why rework them at all?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>[Creator] Dan [Knight] wanted Phas[mophobia] to be the best thing it could be. And with the amount of asset packs that he had to use to create the game, there was a feeling of it not being his own thing. The design and the game and everything else inside of it was his baby — and it was successful because of that — but anyone could recreate Tanglewood. They just needed to buy the asset. So Dan was like: 'I want to make this the best puzzle horror game I can. Let's rework the maps.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I joined Kinetic Games about nine months after Phas came out, so it's just over four years now. Back then, there were only three of us. It was me, Dan, Ben [Lavender], and I was doing all the art myself. My first job was slowly replacing all the art assets, [and] we're still going four years later. But there's a lot more people now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Why was Grafton next on the list to get a revamp?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We do what we feel is best for players. Asylum was the most repetitive map. It was absolutely <em>huge</em> before. I'd had chats with Dan where he's like, 'Oh yeah, it took me so long, like I was just copy-pasting rooms because I'd made it so big,' and it just wasn't that enjoyable to make. That was the first target — we felt that that was the most repetitive, and could have the biggest uplift. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we did that one first, and then the farmhouses. There are two farmhouse maps, but they were almost identical. We had so many players who couldn't even tell the difference between Bleasdale and Grafton because they were the same asset pack. So we had the conversation, and I suggested that we should really spread them apart. Let's make one of them this kind of ornate, mansion-y, bigger map, and then take the other one in the opposite direction. Let's ruin it, destroy loads of it — give it that abandoned ghosthunting experience that a lot of people do in real life. I think it's worked — they feel completely different now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Do you have plans to rework anything else?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>Earlier this year, we announced we would be doing Tanglewood, and that's a fan-favorite map. Everyone absolutely <em>loves</em> Tanglewood. So we'll have to make sure we maintain a balance of, you know, giving it a fresh coat of paint, but not changing <em>too</em> much, because we know how much players absolutely adore it. But I'm pretty sure we'll find that balance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How do you manage demand from players who want smaller maps with those who want much bigger ones?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>It's a combination of things, the first mainly being the community. We've got statistics on what maps people play. We know that people play small maps, and we hear people talk about small maps all the time. That's a massive factor. We want to update and add things that players <em>want</em> to play. We understand there is a community of players that do like the larger maps, but the bigger the map, the longer it takes to make or redo. So, for us, if we're going to do, for example, three maps in a year, and if we [chose] a large map, that might mean we only get to do one or maybe two a year. So players are missing out because we're doing something that takes much longer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's kind of weighing up what the benefit is for the community versus how long it takes. We would like to rework all of the base game maps eventually — it's just how long that takes, and in what order.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Have you ever considered expanding beyond four-player co-op?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>A lot of the community have asked for that, especially on the big maps! Yeah, more players means you'll find the ghost and identify it quicker. But it's not really something we're looking into. The whole game is locked in around four players. And it's a 10-year project. Now, for Dan, he's [already] worked on the game that long, and the code base is kind of locked in, there's a lot of linking, intertwining systems, and it all kind of works together. So even if we wanted to do that, it would be an absolutely huge project.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Phasmophobia Nell's Diner Map Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You've also recently revealed that the next new map coming to Phasmo is Nell's Diner. Tell us about it.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We planned for a new, small map this year and, again, looked at the community. People suggest things all the time. We have a <em>massive</em> list that has all of the things the community has suggested, so we reference that and see what we think, what we think would work or not. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We need to make sure that small maps make sense, because the way that the game plays, you're restricted in what kind of maps you can do. A lot of people have suggested a theater or an amusement park, and while those would be absolutely amazing art tasks — they'd be so fun to make, gameplay-wise — they'd be really difficult. Massive open spaces mean you don't have ghost rooms, and you need to have things on the floor or things for the ghost to interact with. So a diner just kind of made sense. You can split it up into these nice little chunks — you've got the dining area, the counter, the kitchen, the staff areas at the back, and then some toilets. It's a perfect little, small map. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also a familiar thing. People love the house maps because they play Phas in a familiar environment, which is just a house that doesn't look creepy or abandoned. They stop playing [for the night] and walk around their house at night and go, 'Oh my God. This is so similar. This is my house, and I'm scared of looking around at night.' And a diner is very familiar for a lot of people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The theming is super unique. We've never done a retro American style or really embraced the culture of it all. Shout out to the art team!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is that because you have a bigger team now? One of the criticisms we see is about the pace of development, which has felt sluggish at times.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>Oh, yeah. Definitely. If you compare our updates this year to last year — I think last year was just the console update, and then we did [new map] Point Hope. This year, we've already done the Bleasdale update. Grafton. The Chronicle update — which was a huge shake-up of the gameplay — came out a couple of months ago, and we're still on track with our roadmap. We did Easter, we've got the Halloween holiday, and then Nell's Diner as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You recently said the diner was a chance to use a little environmental storytelling, too?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We're trying to push that as much as possible. Phas doesn't have a story, per se, but even back when I did the asylum map, I tried to add a bit of storytelling there about, like, maybe there's an origin story there for one of the ghosts, or maybe it's just a crazed lunatic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're trying to let players think about what happened here without being too hand-holding. We've dropped these little bits and pieces around, and people absolutely love it. We did some stuff in Bleasdale that even referenced Grafton. [Our community] absolutely loves it. So we're just trying to push that Phas is not just a ghost-hunting game with these environments that look pretty but don't mean anything. It's a living, breathing world. We've got a lore update coming at some point that's just going to push the storytelling in the game as far as we can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Does this mean we're closer to a 1.0 release?  Phasmophobia's been in early access since its 2020 debut.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We definitely have plans for 1.0, probably in line with our Horror 2.0 update [<a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-2025-roadmap" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>slated for 2026</u></a>] is where we feel the game is feature-complete. It doesn't mean we'll stop working on it — we still want map reworks and new maps and stuff in the future, so there'll be more stuff for the game. But I think once the Horror 2.0 has been redone, which is the next thing we work on after the [2025's] Player Update, the game will feel finished. Once that's in, I think it will be in a good spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's really difficult to know [when it may be finished]. Our community is constantly putting out, 'Oh, it should have this!' so we can look at that and just keep doing it! We'd love to work on it until we're really happy with it. We haven't set a date or an update that's like: we're done. I think we'll just know: there'll be that company-wide feeling that this project is done now, we've made it the best it can be, which is what Dan wanted Day One. I think we'll know when we hit that milestone — I don't think we can plan for that. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Phasmophobia Grafton Farmhouse Map Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How do you keep the horror sequences fresh (and scary) for veteran players while keeping the gameplay loop simple enough for new ghosthunters?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We just try and maintain a balance. Like with the Chronicle update, we wanted to make it make sense. Before, something would be dropped on the floor, and you take a photo and go to the person you're selling them to, and say: 'I promised the ghost threw this! It wasn't me!' So that was the main goal of the update: let's make the evidence system make sense, right? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">People come up with crazy ideas, and some of them are great. Going back to the first anniversary, and we did a mini update where we redid the journal, because that was a big pain point for players. And people were posting designs on Reddit. It meant that when we came to do it, we had <em>tons</em> of reference, and we knew what players wanted feature-wise, and we just had to make it kind of look pretty, and we haven't touched it since. The community's great, it's almost like you don't need anyone [on the development team] with a brain now. We could just be developers that don't have any thought, and we just follow the Reddit thread and just churn out stuff, because there's <em>so</em> many good ideas on there!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When we got to the gameplay design of the Chronicle Update, it was just about maintaining that interest for new players, but having it complicated enough so that experienced players would enjoy it as well. With the unique and duplicate system, you can go in and take whatever photos, videos, and sounds you want, and not worry about the unique and duplicates, and you'll still get a pretty good payout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But veteran players with thousands of hours [in the game] — they know every nook and cranny. They can kind of curate their own really difficult game mode in custom difficulty, and they can go for a perfect investigation, and they can make each game the hardest they want it to be, and then end up with these <em>huge</em> payouts. The custom update is kind of 'play your way.' We noticed so many people were making their own little challenges, and we were like, let's just put it in the game. Let's just spend the time and put it in. We did a few updates to get the rewards right, but now it's super solid. It's rewarding when it needs to be, and it's less rewarding when it doesn't. I'm really happy with how that turned out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Given how much Phasmophobia has changed since its launch half a decade ago, have you ever considered starting from scratch with a sequel?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>I wouldn't write it off. It would be a fun challenge to see if we could do another one. There are a lot of things that I know we would change as a company if we went into Phas fresh. There's definitely things we would all probably say, 'Oh, let's not do that!' Or 'that would be awesome. We should do that instead.' So, yeah, you never know. It's definitely not off the cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What about a Nintendo Switch 2 version?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We want what's best for the game, and if the opportunity arises, we'd love to. But there's no news or anything I can share. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Before we go — the Blumhouse movie adaptation. How can Phasmophobia's genre-defining gameplay translate to a movie?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We've got a really good partnership with Blumhouse. It's brilliant. It <em>will</em> be a Phasmophobia film, it won't just be a ghost hunting film — we're going to make sure it's a film that fans want to watch, and we're going to work with them really closely. They're really willing to work with us, and, obviously, we want to work with them. So yeah, we've got a really good partnership, and I think fans are going to love it when it comes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Phasmophobia's Grafton Farmhouse reworked map is now live across all platforms, including PC via Steam, PS5, PS VR2, and Xbox Series X and S.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

As a new set of high-difficulty quests, 9★ monsters will start appearing when you are HR 100 or higher.</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting with Ver. 1.021, Tempered Monsters (9★) of nine monster species will begin appearing in locales.<br>Following that, our third title update in late September will see additional 9★ monsters appear in event quests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For veteran players who have experienced end-game content in previous Monster Hunter titles, we understand that the difficulty of Tempered Monsters at launch may have felt lacking. Therefore, starting with Title Update 2, we've introduced a system for more detailed monster parameter customization, as well as other adjustments to ensure a challenging and rewarding experience.</p><strong>2. We're adding the Glowing Stone appraisal item as a quest reward for quests with 9★ monsters.</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon quest completion, the Glowing Stone appraisal item — a quest reward for quests with 9★ monsters — will transform into an Appraised Talisman with randomly assigned skills.<br>Unlike other talismans which can be crafted and upgraded at the Smithy, Appraised Talismans cannot be upgraded. However, they can be randomly granted not only armor skills but weapon skills and decoration slots (both weapon skill and armor skill decoration slots), allowing for more customization and experimentation with builds. We hope this leads to more engaging gameplay and encourages hunters to try different weapons and armor based on the talismans they obtain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, we recognized that end-game content early after the game's release was slightly skewed around Arkveld. This, combined with the fact that Arkveld is relatively resistant to elements, resulted in limited opportunities to try out diverse builds. In response, we have adjusted the difficulty, average hunting time, and rewards for each of the 9★ monsters being added in an effort to ensure that all monsters offer balanced rewards fitting with the effort spent hunting them. We encourage you to select your hunts based on your own individual skill, equipment, or needs, and enjoy each challenge.</p><strong>9★ Monster Adjustments</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">In light of the addition of 9★ monsters, we've lengthened the duration of meal effects so that they're less likely to expire if the hunts go on a little long. We also raised the upgrade limit for armor of rarity 5 or above, so that players can squeeze in a little more defense before they go up against these challenging new monsters.<br>Additionally, from HR 100 and higher, Rey Dau and Nu Udra will now appear in the Wounded Hollow, and each region's apex predator will be more likely to appear even with that region is not experiencing an inclemency.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Title Update 3
</strong>As mentioned previously, Title Update 3 will see the gradual introduction of 9★ monsters in Event Quests as well.<br>We are also adjusting the strength of support hunters in line with the addition of 9★ monsters. We apologize that the timing of these adjustments are in stages and come after the implementation of the monsters themselves, but we hope you understand that this is a result of expediting the monster implementation.<br>In order to diversify the lineup of quests, we are working to make it possible for Lagiacrus to appear in the Wounded Hollow, as well as other additions such as more hunts targeting packs of monsters. We are also implementing adjustments to improve gameplay convenience, such as preventing monsters from spontaneously destroying pop-up camps and resetting the cooldown for mantles upon beginning a quest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, we can also assure you that any new monsters added in Title Update 3 will also feature 9★ difficulty quests.<br>We hope you look forward to the new contents for Title Update 3, and that in the meantime you can enjoy the new additions from Ver. 1.021 to strengthen your equipment and collect Appraised Talismans in preparation for the challenging hunts ahead.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Weapon Balance Changes</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously announced, we had been planning balance adjustments for 5 weapon types. However, in the end we have expanded the scope and will be implementing adjustments (upward adjustments) for 11 total weapon types.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Affected Weapon Types:
</strong>Great Sword, Long Sword, Sword &amp; Shield, Dual Blades, Hunting Horn, Lance, Switch Axe, Charge Blade, Insect Glaive, Light Bowgun, Heavy Bowgun</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bug Fixes Only: </strong>Gunlance, Bow</p><strong>Overall Direction</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">In previous updates, we aimed for greater diversity in hunting styles and equipment builds, including equipment with elemental properties. We performed balance adjustments, including some downward adjustments, to ensure no single strategy was overly effective against monsters introduced later on. However, this resulted in some hunting styles becoming less viable and certain weapon types experiencing lower-than-intended viability.<br>We apologize for the results and that we did not communicate our balancing intentions clearly enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This update will mitigate the excessive downward adjustments made in Title Update 2, and will focus on enhancing each weapon type's individuality while strengthening their ability to face high-difficulty monsters planned in the future. We will be implementing upward adjustments for 11 weapon types.</p><strong>Revisiting Downward Adjustments</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">For sword &amp; shield, charge blade, light bowgun, and heavy bowgun, we will be revisiting the downward adjustments made in Title Update 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sword &amp; Shield
</strong>In Wilds, we've been particularly focused on making the weapon easy to handle even for beginners, making adjustments to its moveset so that a certain level of damage can be dealt with any action.<br>Among these, the damage output of some actions was found to be too high in relation to their ease of use when compared to other weapon types. Therefore, we made some downward adjustments in Title Update 2.<br>Among those adjustments, we found that the downward adjustment to Guard Slash reduced the usage frequency of Counter Slash, so we're applying a slight power increase to Guard Slash to compensate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Charge Blade
</strong>In Title Update 2, we aimed to balance Amped Element Discharge so that it could offer another reliable source of damage beyond multi-hit attacks in Axe Mode. However, the adjustment resulted in less power than intended, and also failed to expand player options.<br>To address this, we revisited these adjustments and made it so that increased damage via enhanced phials is reflected while in Power Axe Mode, making it easier to maintain high damage output while keeping Power Axe Mode active.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Light Bowgun &amp; Heavy Bowgun
</strong>In the Ver. 1.011 update, we introduced downwards adjustments to elemental and pierce ammo to prevent them from being overpowered against future high-difficulty monsters, like the recently-introduced Arch-tempered Uth Duna, and to ensure that a variety of weapon types were viable. However, we're reviewing this change and will be slightly increasing the power of elemental ammo for light bowguns.<br>We will also relax the downward adjustment to the amount of rapid fire and ignition gauge recovery when using pierce ammo. Finally, we'll increase the amount of gauge recovery for various ammo types and improve the handling and power of special ammo in order to expand viable ammo selections for more situations.</p><strong>Other Weapons</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">We will perform some upward adjustments for weapons like the great sword and insect glaive as well, which previously have not been the subject of balance changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For dual blades, we focused on improving usability, such as making Demon Boost Mode easier to maintain and making Focus Strikes easier to use. In particular, based on player feedback, we added a Focus Strike action (which can be chained into others) that provides another option for continuing attacks without changing your position.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have implemented upwards adjustments for each weapon type, focusing on expanding playstyle options. We encourage hunters to try each of the weapons out again after the update is live.<br>Details on the adjustments made for each weapon type will be included in Guild Reports on our official social media accounts, so please check the reports for more information that we weren't able to share here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also plan to adjust some series skills that were previously difficult to use, with the overall goal of increasing equipment build options.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Efforts to Improve Game Stability</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">We'd also like to touch on our efforts to improve game stability, particularly for the Steam version, in response to numerous player comments.</p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">We are currently aware of an issue across all platforms where the game may crash when a player gesture, such as the Water Gun gesture, hits another player at the same time that a specific type of communication error has occurred.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We plan to fix this issue in the Ver. 1.021 update.<br>We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and ask that you please wait a little longer for the fix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We are strengthening our checking system to prevent game crashes caused by issues on the application side. In the event that a bug is found, we will investigate and fix it promptly.</p><strong>CPU Usage Optimization (Steam Version)</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">In Title Update 2, we fixed bugs related to shader compilation and reduced the impact of anti-cheat measures on processing load by about 90%. In addition, as an option to reduce CPU load while improving frame rate, we implemented support for the latest super-resolution technologies, DLSS4 and FSR4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition, in Title Update 2 we improved our texture loading process, reducing instances where low-quality textures are displayed when monsters suddenly enter the player's field of view.<br>Title Update 3 will see similar improvements for NPCs and Seikret mounts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Future Plans
</strong>In general, increasing the native frame rate will also increase CPU usage. If the frame rate limit is set to unlimited or a high value in the options, CPU performance will be maximized(*) in the attempt to increase the frame rate, which may result in a very high CPU usage. Please adjust your graphics options to limit the frame rate in accordance with your hardware's specifications.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">*In cases where GPU performance is bottlenecked, CPU performance may not be fully utilized.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We are aware that some players may be concerned about the potential strain on their PCs, particularly those using CPUs known to have stability issues (as reported by various manufacturers), due to prolonged high CPU usage during extended play sessions.<br>On the other hand, as making changes to CPU processing could affect the game's overall performance, we plan to proceed with caution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In regards to CPU load reduction, we plan to address this issue in the fourth title update scheduled for this winter. Once the initial implementation is complete, we will proceed with a second stage of further mitigation measures.<br>We will also address GPU load reduction in a similar manner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We will continue to work on improving the game's stability so that more players can enjoy the game on PC with peace of mind. Thank you for your understanding.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Looking Ahead!</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all of you who have provided us with valuable feedback and requests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We will continue to share the development team's progress on these through our Guild Reports. For detailed information on adjustments, including those we were unable to cover in this update, please refer to our <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official social media accounts</a> and <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Note: Information will be published on our social media accounts first, and later posted on our official website as well. For the absolute latest, please check social media.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We will continue to make various fixes and adjustments through future updates, as well as implement additional exciting new content.<br>We also plan to address improvements that were not included in the Ver. 1.021 update in future title updates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Please also look forward to more details we'll be announcing soon about Title Update 3, scheduled for release at the end of September.<br>For our fourth title update this winter, on top of new monsters, we are also considering additional weapon-related end-game features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll continue to work hard to make Monster Hunter Wilds as enjoyable as possible for hunters throughout the world. Thank you for your continued support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

                <p>In its financial results for the first half of 2025, Remedy Entertainment says that it is "unsatisfied" by the post-launch sales of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fbc-firebreak-review-controlled-chaos/1900-6418376/">FBC: Firebreak</a>. While the company says that its co-op PvE game reached 1 million players after launch in June--with high numbers from PS5 and Xbox Series X|S specifically--PC sales underperformed and weren't enough to cover the low sales on console. It's worth noting that FBC: Firebreak was available day-one through PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass, with those playerbases likely being responsible for the game reaching 1 million players in 10 days.</p><p>Remedy's first self-published game, FBC: Firebreak did receive a payment from Microsoft and Sony for allowing its game to be distributed via the respective subscription services of those two companies, with Remedy aiming for Steam to be "the primary consumer sales channel" on PC. FBC: Firebreak was met with negative feedback and poor post-launch sales, Remedy says, but it's still committed to turning the game around, and it says that it has a solid foundation to build on, going forward.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FBC: Firebreak GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"FBC: Firebreak was designed as a game that evolves over time," <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Remedy said</a>. "Despite the rocky launch, we believe we have a solid game to build on. Players who spent over an hour with the game reviewed the game mostly positive--showing us that the core experience of the game is entertaining. We have already rolled out patches and communicated on how the game will continue to develop. Looking ahead, a larger 'Major Update' late September will be the next key step for FBC: Firebreak."</p><p>Remedy says that it will launch targeted marketing activities to further drive interest in the title, as well as work with the game's community to help expand it over time. One of the changes that players can expect in September is a reworked opening, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-fbc-firebreak-update-will-address-the-game-frustrating-opening-hour/1100-6533265/">as Remedy plans to address the "frustrating" first hour of FBC: Firebreak</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Remedy posted positive results in Q2 2025, as it says that revenue increased by 63.5% to $19.6 million, Alan Wake 2 and Control continued to sell steadily, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-alan-wake-2-every-game-remedy-is-working-on-right-now/1100-6514998/" data-ref-id="1100-6514998">and progress on Control 2</a> is on track. "The focus is now on the gameplay, environments, and missions. Work continues on developing the game into a strong commercial offering," Remedy said.</p><p>As for the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake project, Remedy says it remains in "full production" and development on it alongside Rockstar Games remains productive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Magnus APU will reportedly power the Xbox next-generation console and a line of Xbox PCs, employing a strategy that will greatly benefit AMD.</p>



<p>Speaking on the NeoGAF forums, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-ps6-early-specs-leak-amd-rdna-5-lower-price-than-ps5-pro.1686842/post-270705701">known AMD leaker Kepler L2</a> outright said that the Magnus APU leaked <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-next-xbox-amd-zen-6-magnus-apu-11-cores-384-bit-memory-bus/">last month</a> is not only going to power the next-generation Microsoft console but also <em>"Xbox PCs"</em> with the APU getting licensed out to OEM partners. Bar a few likely differences, these systems should be essentially the same, as another known insider, HeisenbergFX4, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-ps6-early-specs-leak-amd-rdna-5-lower-price-than-ps5-pro.1686842/post-270705260">believes</a> there won't be any special development required for the Xbox next-generation console, since no developer would put in additional work for what is setting out to be a small, niche market.</p>



<p>Ultimately, having a desktop chiplet powering the next-generation Xbox system as well as regular Xbox-branded PCs will be a big win for AMD, as highlighted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a> in a new video going over the leaked APUs for the next-generation consoles. Not only will production numbers be high, but AMD will likely be able to get better prices from TSMC while also benefiting from the optimization work done for the Xbox next-generation system. Considering how game optimization issues are rampant in the PC space nowadays, this could also become a great marketing point for the company and the Xbox partner OEMs.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Xbox next-generation Magnus APU is set to mark a massive change in the console space. Its chiplet design, featuring separate CPU and GPU dies, is very different from the most recent console APUs, and will potentially power <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/">a more iterative approach to console design</a>, allowing Microsoft to offer more frequent upgrades and possibly do away with the traditional console cycle. With console-exclusive games quickly becoming a thing of the past, it's not surprising to see how all console manufacturers seem to be going in different directions, an approach set to make the next generation of consoles one of the most interesting to date.</p>

               <p>I’m here to start the campaign to replace the term “4X” with “4E”. Call me a pedant, but if you look very carefully the words “Explore,” “Expand,” “Exploit” and “Exterminate” all begin with an E. I’ll compromise on “4Ex” games–I’m nothing if not magnanimous. So, the good news is, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/4x_strategy">Steam is having a big sale on 4Ex games this week</a>! We’ve gone through and picked out some highlights from the world/space-conquering genre.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Steam 4X Fest 2025: Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q6D0DG2VUEA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p>4X (I relented already) is a genre that covers an awful lot of territory. Pun grimly intended. It stretches from Earth to all of space, from&nbsp;<em>Civilization</em> to&nbsp;<em>Stellaris</em>, via the historical strategy of&nbsp;<em>Hearts of Iron</em> to the magical fantasy of&nbsp;<em>Age of Wonders</em>. All of which, happily are in this extraordinarily comprehensive sale.</p> <p>It’s worth noting that Steam’s “Fest” collections pull together every example of the genre, but not all are on sale. For some bizarre reason, none of the&nbsp;<em>Total War</em> games are discounted, for example. Despite this, just the added attention has pulled <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III?snr=1_49_4_xstrategy_100726"><em>Total War: Warhammer III</em></a> into the top selling list at its full price of $60. However, other big-name franchises&nbsp;<em>are</em> showing some enormous price drops, as high as 90 percent. Here’s a selection from the many games available, picking out some all-time classics and perhaps a couple you’ve not heard of before. And just in case you thought my headline was exaggerating, yes, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/410980/Master_of_Orion_2/"><em>Masters of Orion 1 </em>and<em> 2</em></a> are in there for just over $2. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/4x_strategy">You can browse all 356 games here</a>.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Sid Meier’s Civilization VII - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kK_JrrP9m2U?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2><em>Sid Meier’s Civilization VII</em></h2> <p>Perhaps the headline discount is <em>Civilization VII</em>, the latest entry in the 34-year-long franchise. It’s still sitting on “Mixed” for its Steam reviews, after <a href="https://kotaku.com/civilization-7-patch-notes-ui-steam-reviews-crossplay-1851760312">a very rocky launch</a> in February this year, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/civilization-7-patch-notes-1-2-0-switch-steam-reviews-1851777269">a long, slow attempt to recover</a>, but given it’s reached from an astonishing 45,000 reviews, it’s not for want of sales. Perhaps a 30 percent discount to $49 can help to bring in new players now so much of the game has been patched? Still, if you want a&nbsp;<em>Civ</em> that’s tried and tested, you could always pick up&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/289070/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VI?snr=1_49_4_xstrategy_100709"><em>Civ 6</em> for $6</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/8930/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_V/"><em>Civ 5</em> for $7.50</a>, maybe&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3900/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_IV/"><em>Civ 4</em> at $6</a> (or just £3 in the UK for some reason), or even&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3910/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_III_Complete/"><em>Civ III</em> with all the trimmings for just 99c</a>.</p> <h2><em>Galactic Civilizations IV</em></h2> <p>At the other end of the universe, you’ve got the&nbsp;<em>GalCiv</em> series from Stardock. These space-conquering epics have been appearing for 13 years, and all four of them are on sale. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/226860/Galactic_Civilizations_III/"><em>GalCiv 3</em></a> is 67 percent off, now $10, while 2023’s most recent,&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1357210/Galactic_Civilizations_IV/"><em>GalCiv 4</em></a>, is half off at $20. (<em>Disclosure: I did a lot of script editing on the text in GalCiv 4. Still couldn’t actually figure out how to play the game.</em>)</p> <h2><em>Stellaris</em></h2> <p>Paradox’s&nbsp;<em>Stellaris</em> made such a massive splash when it came out in 2016. It breathed life back into the 4X genre, with a bunch of bold new approaches to taking over the galaxy, as well as more tool tips than a Home Depot catalog. With its mix of playable alien races and huge regions of space to explore, it’s one of those games that became legendary for generating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diary-multicultural-turtle-utopia-stellaris-part-1">original and fascinating stories</a>. But despite being almost ten years old, it’s still receiving regular free patches and both free and paid updates, most recently patching the Wilderness Open Beta last week. This week you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/">grab the base game</a> for a quarter of its usual price at $10, or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/">pick up every last bit of content for the game</a> for 45 percent less than usual, at $140.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Europa Universalis IV - 8th Anniversary Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWQ8AXwHPQg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2><em>Europa Universalis IV</em></h2> <p>Despite being 12 years old,&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/Europa_Universalis_IV/"><em>Europa Universalis IV</em></a> remains so popular that it’s shot straight into the top 10 most popular games in this 4X Fest. That the epic and historically accurate sim is 90 percent off so just $5 definitely helps. The pitch is that you can pick any nation in the world, then be in charge of it across four hundred years, from the end of the middle ages to the beginning of the Napoleonic era. There’s also a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/1134298/">Starter Edition</a> that adds in three expansions, 80 percent off at $12, and an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/22085/Europa_Universalis_IV_Ultimate_Bundle/">Ultimate Bundle</a> which compiles 12 years of updates and expansions for 40 percent off at $105.</p> <h2><em>Victoria 3</em></h2> <p>To complete a trio of Paradox games (certainly one of the biggest players in the 4X field), 2022’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/"><em>Victoria 3</em></a> has a tidy 70 percent drop making it just $15 during the Fest, along with around 50 percent off the more expensive bundles of DLC. Far more focused than the enormous nature of most 4X grand strategy games,&nbsp;<em>Victoria 3</em> zooms in on, as you might have guessed, the 19th century. It’s about controlling a society more than an army, although given you can play as dozens of nations in the era, expansion was something of an issue at the time.</p>

 <h2><em>Sins of a Solar Empire II</em></h2> <p>Another Stardock entry, <em>Sins of a Solar Empire II</em>–the follow-up to the 2008 original–comes from the original development team, Ironclad Games. Most think of it as a 2024 game, given that’s when it released on Steam, along with a wealth of DLC and extra content. However, it originally appeared on the Epic Games Store in 2022 as an early access release, presumably as one of the lucrative deals Epic was handing out at the time. It’s Steam release coincided with the game having as much content as the original game’s peak. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1575940/Sins_of_a_Solar_Empire_II/">get the base game</a> for a 30 percent discount this week, making it $35, or for $70 you can pick up the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/1108073/">Premium Edition</a> that contains the base game, this year’s&nbsp;<em>Paths To Power&nbsp;</em>expansion, plus three as-yet unreleased expansions, also 30 percent down.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dune: Spice Wars – 1.0 Release Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmLKKenSn5c?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2><em>Dune: Spice Wars</em></h2> <p>Before&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>, in 2023 Funcom published a game by Shiro Games called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1605220/Dune_Spice_Wars/"><em>Dune: Spice Wars</em></a>, a 4X RTS by the same team who made&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/466560/Northgard/">Northgard</a>&nbsp;</em>(84 percent off at under $5). It’s all about taking control of Arrakis with one of a number of factions, along with all the spice trading you could wish for. It’s 60 percent off, $14. You can also pick up the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/38656/Dune_Spice_Wars__The_Ixian_Edition/">Ixian Edition</a> which includes DLC&nbsp;<em>House Vernius of Ix&nbsp;</em>for 55 percent less, $20.</p>

 <h2><em>Zephon</em></h2> <p>Let’s get a bit more niche.&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1481170/ZEPHON/"><em>Zephon</em></a> comes from indie team Proxy Studios, who previously created 4X title&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/489630/Warhammer_40000_Gladius__Relics_of_War/">Warhammer 40,000: Gladius – Relics of War</a>&nbsp;</em>(90 percent off, $4), then came back with their own property. This time you’re turn-based 4Xing in a post-apocalypse which features both eldritch monsters and cyberpunk horrors. The game only came out late last year, and has already received a DLC expansion. You can get the base game this week for a 25 percent discount at $30, or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/54708/ZEPHON__Complete_Edition/">pick it up with the DLC and various support bumph</a> for $60.</p> <h2><em>Heart of the Machine</em></h2> <p>Getting right up to date,&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001070/Heart_of_the_Machine/"><em>Heart of the Machine</em></a> by Arcen is so new it’s still in Early Access. Released at the beginning of this year, the RPG/RTS hybrid has proven very popular with players. You play as the first sentient AI, waking up in a city and trying to take control, but with an enormous amount of freedom about how you go about this. There’s still another six months of Early Access intended, the game patching and changing in response to player feedback, but it’s already fully playable. And right now it’s included in both the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/isometricrpgsale2025">Isometric Sale</a>, and the 4X Fest, knocking 35 percent off the price to just under $20.</p>

<p>Attack Vector and Sleeper Case get a facelift</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Genki Sleeper Case / Attack Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/907ba70c1f128/genki-sleeper-case-attack-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The relationship between Genki and Switch 2 might forever be defined by that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/accessory-maker-genki-to-discuss-switch-2-info-and-products-at-ces-2025">pre-reveal CES showcase</a>, but the accessory manufacturer has produced a lot of gear for the new hybrid in the months since. While we have liked most of the Switch 2 accessories we've seen so far from the company, select items have not been without their issues, with early teething problems like tricky zippers and too-snug designs. Fortunately, the problematic products have now received an upgrade.</p>
<p>Genki has informed us that both the Attack Vector modular case and the Sleeper Case are now available without any of the issues that both came with at launch. Previously, several users reported that the Attack Vector was too tight in the Switch 2 Dock, making it difficult to play the console up on the big screen, while many found the Sleeper Case's zip to be too tough.</p>
<p>We similarly took issue with the Sleeper Case's zipper in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-sleeper-case-a-virtually-indestructible-switch-2-carry-case-that-looks-as-good-as-it-protects">our review</a>, and while we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-opts-for-comfort-over-protection">didn't have any docking issues with the Attack Vector</a>, it's still nice to hear that the accessory manufacturer is listening to its customers.</p>
<p>Both items are now available on the Genki website in their new and improved forms — the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/attack-vector">Attack Vector</a> will set you back <strong>£42/$49.99</strong>, while the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/sleeper-case">Sleeper Case</a> is listed for <strong>£36/$42.99</strong>. These two items accompany the rest of Genki's Switch 2 lineup, including screen protectors, a charging base and more.</p>

<p>Although these teething problems appear to be on the mend, Genki isn't out of the woods yet. Following the company's much-discussed CES presentation back in January (where Switch 2 prototypes were freely shown off, despite Nintendo not yet officially lifting the lid on the system), Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/the-company-that-leaked-switch-2-is-being-sued-by-nintendo">opened a lawsuit</a> against the company, claiming that Genki "demoed and promoted unauthorized purported mockups and renderings of the Nintendo Switch 2 and its accessories".</p>
<p>Genki has since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/accessory-manufacturer-genki-responds-to-nintendos-switch-2-lawsuit">released a statement</a>, claiming that it is "taking [Nintendo's case] seriously and working with legal counsel to respond thoughtfully," and promised that it will "share more when we can".</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-game-ready-driver-is-optimized-for-gta-v-enhanced-and-senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-both-games-get-dlss-4-mfg/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA has released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 580.97) today, optimized for Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced and Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced.</p>



<p>While Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-enhanced-makes-the-12-year-old-game-look-great-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released a while ago</a>, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced is coming out today, simultaneously with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-unreal-engine-5-updated-playstation-5-pro-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 launch</a>. On PC, when the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in May 2024</a>, it already supported NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. With the Enhanced version, though, GeForce RTX 50 GPU owners can enable DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation to boost performance even further. That is quite welcome, since this new version adds a 'Very High' graphics preset that was not available at launch:</p>



<p><em>Rather than dialling everything up, our team carefully considered where we could make the most impactful improvements for a visual quality bump at a reasonable performance cost. The result sees more detailed and accurate shadows, improved AntiAliasing, better post-processing such as depth of field, motion blur and bloom.</em></p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>As to GTA V Enhanced, Rockstar's game is also getting NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Frame Generation and Multi Frame Generation. Even with all the ray-traced effects activated (ambient occlusion, global illumination lighting, shadows, and reflections), the RTX 5090 averages 485 frames per second at 4K resolution and max settings, with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode and the latest transformer model enabled. On average, GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards can expect an uplift of 3.9X.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This Friday, the first-person-puzzle-Metroidvania game Supraworld <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1869290/Supraworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will debut on Steam Early Access</a> with day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Multi Frame Generation, and DLAA.</p>



<p>Taking a step back, Titan Quest II launched last week on Steam Early Access and <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-sold-over-300k-less-3-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quickly sold over 300K units</a>. The game already supports NVIDIA DLSS 4 with all its technologies (Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Multi Frame Generation, and DLAA).</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-games-working-closely-with-remedy-entertainment-on-max-payne-1-2-remake/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rockstar-games-working-closely-with-remedy-entertainment-on-max-payne-1-2-remake.1267815/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake is still moving along nicely, according to Remedy in its 2025 half-year financial report. It’s also been revealed that Rockstar Games and Remedy Entertainment are teaming up for the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake.</p>



<p>Remedy’s work on the original Max Payne games was exceptional. Both games sold well and became iconic for their revolutionary bullet-time feature (popularized by The Matrix) and their unique presentation and style. Remedy handed over the franchise to Take-Two, leading to Rockstar Games handling Max Payne 3—another success.</p>



<p>We learned early details about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/remedy-gives-update-on-control-2-and-max-payne/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake in 2023</a>, and the game went into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-2-is-now-playable-as-max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full production in 2024</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-max-payne-1-amp-2-remake-remains-in-full-production">Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake “Remains in Full Production”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Could it lead to a Max Payne 4? Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Remedy’s “Half year financial report January–June 2025” covered many aspects of Remedy, including upcoming projects. There was a new update on the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake, revealing a cool detail.</p>



<p>“The&nbsp;Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake&nbsp;project continues its progress and remains in full production. In the second quarter, the team built on steady momentum from earlier in the year. Collaboration with Rockstar Games remains close and productive, ensuring alignment as the project advances toward its next major phase,” the statement <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>



<p>This means both of Max Payne’s key developers are working together on the project. It’s unclear if this is a 50/50 split of the workload or how much input either team is contributing.</p>



<p>Regardless, long-term Max Payne fans should rest easy knowing Remedy and Rockstar Games are on the case. Can the two companies synergize perfectly to recapture the Max Payne magic? Or do you think there could be some crossed wires? Share your thoughts through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Stellar Blade's PC launch has been a smashing success, as the game has been confirmed to be the fastest- selling Korean game on the platform.</p>



<p>In its <a href="https://t.co/CkPC5KqbI6">financial report </a>for the second quarter of the current fiscal year, Shift Up reported an all-time best performance since the founding of the company, with an operating revenue of 112bn KRW and an operating profit of 68bn KRW. Much of this record-breaking performance is thanks to Stellar Blade, as 58% of the quarterly revenue was from the action RPG. By all metrics, the game continues to be successful even one year after its debut on PlayStation 5, as the game is the fastest-selling Korean game on Steam with <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-1-million-units-on-pc-in-3-days-ceo-hopes-sequel-comes-out-in-2027/">1 million units sold in three days</a>, and a total of 3 million sales across PC and console. The nearly 200,000 concurrent users peak on Steam also confirms the game's commercial success, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-more-than-doubles-sonys-previous-steam-ccu-record-for-single-player-games/">beating every other flasgship AAA games published by Sony</a>, including Ghost of Tsushima (77K peak Steam CCU), God of War (73K), Spider-Man (66K), Horizon: Zero Dawn (57K), and The Last of Us Part 1 (37K).</p>



<p>Seeing how Stellar Blade continues to be successful, it's not surprising to see Shift Up continuing to support it on both PC and PlayStation 5. Earlier this month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-1-3-0-pc-patch-amd-fsr/">a new patch</a> went live on all formats, introducing improvements and bug fixes for a more enjoyable experience.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PC and PlayStation 5, and may hit Nintendo Switch 2 at some point in the future. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review of the PlayStation 5 release.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Marvel Rivals player base has dwindled in recent times, and many in the community believe EOMM is a big reason. NetEase has publicly acknowledged the belief and says it’s not the case. The developer is preparing a video set to break down how the game’s matchmaking works.</p>



<p>When you think of matchmaking in major FPS games, you probably default to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-sbmm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SBMM</a>. This is known as Skill-Based Matchmaking, and is a contentious (and constant) frustration across multiplayer games. It favors an algorithm that keeps players in matches with similarly skilled players. EOMM doesn’t get the headlines SBMM does, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-marvel-rivals-planning-collaborations-with-other-marvel-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> has been linked with the controversial system for a while.</p>

<p>Presumably tired of the speculation, the Marvel Rivals <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account posted an update on August 12.</p>



<p>“Hi Rivals! As our game continues to thrive, we want to reiterate that Marvel Rivals does not use EOMM. We are currently working on a video to demonstrate our developer insights on the matchmaking and ranking system, which is expected to be released next week,” it said.”</p>



<p>EOMM stands for ‘Engagement Optimized Matchmaking.’ Whereas SBMM targets competitive matches and lobbies, EOMM focuses on player retention and engagement. The long-standing belief is that EOMM is designed to give you regular doses of the highs and lows of online gaming.</p>



<p>One second you’re wrecking lobbies multiple games running—racking up a nasty K/D and W/L ratio—the next, you’re on an unexplainable losing streak. The idea is that the wins keep you playing because you feel powerful, and the losses encourage you to keep playing to secure the next win.</p>



<p>It sounds similar to SBMM. However, the underlying motive is to keep you playing and coming back for more, increasing the likelihood of you spending money on microtransactions.</p>

<p>The video should be a fascinating peek behind the curtain. Will NetEase be completely transparent, or do you think the developer will retain some of the finer details?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/viral-vtuber-%E2%80%98rileycs%E2%80%99-has-been-banned-on-twitch-following-battlefield-6-cheating-allegations.1267785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A VTuber has been banned on Twitch after her Battlefield 6 gameplay clip amassed tens of millions of views.</p>



<p>The Vtuber, named RileyCS posted her Battlefield 6 clips on X on August 8, which prompted many users to accuse her of cheating. The discourse around the clip has resulted in the video accumulating 47.8 million views at the time of writing. </p>



<p>Presumably, the viral tweet has resulted in her being reported to Twitch by those who think she’s been cheating, which has resulted in her ban.</p>



<p>You can watch the clip below to decide for yourself if you think she’s cheating:</p>

<h2 id="h-the-battlefield-6-cheating-allegations">The Battlefield 6 Cheating Allegations</h2>



<p>At first glance, it isn’t difficult to jump to the conclusion that Riley is indeed cheating after watching the footage. Her unique playstyle, which requires her to ‘flick’ onto enemies to get gameplay clips for content, does have all the traits of cheating. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-the-battlefield-6-beta-end/"><strong>RELATED – When Does The Battlefield 6 Beta End? Open Beta End Times Explained</strong></a></p>



<p>However, some have argued in favour of Riley, stating that she’s known within the community for this type of content. Battlefield YouTuber Enders has also analysed the clips, which makes for an interesting watch if you have the time. But then again, the counterargument is that you can turn aimbot on and off very easily (with a foot pedal for instance). </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Whether Riely is cheating or not is something that will probably be hotly debated for the foreseeable future until either EA comes out to debunk the claims, or Riely plays at some kind of LAN event.</p>



<p>Regardless, the viral clip has prompted dozens more players to capture similar clips and post them to X. So, the cheating accusations within the community against players, regardless if they are legit or not, will likely continue. </p>



<p><strong>UPDATE – Rileycs has now been unbanned from Twitch.</strong></p>



<p>What do you think of Riley’s clips? Do you think she was cheating in Battlefield 6? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

<p>As covered by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/palworld-ripoff-palland-on-nintendo-switch/">The Gamer</a>, a new title by the name of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/palland">Palland</a> is now available via the Switch eShop, and everything from its basic description to its screenshots indicate that it's a blatant rip-off of Palworld. Does that also make it a rip-off of <strong>Pokémon</strong>..? Well, Nintendo would probably say so, yes. We're not so sure about Pocketpair.</p>
<p>Developed by BoggySoft (lovely), Palland was released on <strong>31st July 2025</strong> yet has already been heavily discounted by 60% to a paltry <strong>£3.99 / $5.99</strong>. Just goes to show how much faith BoggySoft has in its product, huh?</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kxoiyn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>We should also point out that the screenshots included on the eShop page (which you can view below) don't appear to be indicative of the actual experience. If you check out gameplay videos on YouTube from channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UebFsxkHwM">Nintendo Hall</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW4CCT5C7hQ">Game Buoy Games</a>, you can see that the visuals aren't even remotely comparable. Where's all the grass?! It's almost on par with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet and Violet</a>, for goodness' sake (<em>joking</em> - gosh).</p>
<p>Anyway, it's interesting (and funny) that the game responsible for Nintendo's recent lawsuit against Pocketpair now has its own rip-off – on the Switch, no less! Guffaw.</p>

<p>We're fascinated to see whether Pocketpair takes any action against BoggySoft and Palland while it's still knee-deep in its own legal battle against Nintendo. Chances are it probably won't, but who knows.</p>

            <p>Right, stop eating your mate for a minute. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a>'s had a big update from developers Aggro Crab and Landfall Games, and it adds a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monument-valley">Monument Valley</a>-esque location for you to scale the cliffs of.</p>
<p>Before you can go mountaineering among the sandy cacti and roaring tornadoes, though, you'll want to put on some suncream. Yes, I know you now do the cannibalism thanks to co-op climber's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-cannibalism-is-delivered-by-the-co-op-climbers-latest-patch">most recent patch</a>, but you've still got to take your skincare seriously. Come on, at least take a parasol.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Mesa biome is Peak's first alternative to its standard Alpine island, with the two set to settle into a rotation once Mesa's had an initial week in the sun. "Explore the sandy terrain under the blistering sun... alongside plenty of mysteries that lie within the shade," the devs write of what to expect. It appears one of these hidden surprises is waiting for you inside a kiln (nobody tell <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2onuBxhafg">the Aunty Donna boys</a>).</p>
<p>You'll be trying not to succumb to the heat, while dodging the likes of whirling tornadoes and tumbleweeds, which the update's trailer seems to suggest are more lethal than you might expect of your average meandering plantlife. That's in addition to the age-old Peak threat of just falling to your death from a great height, something I'd imagine won't be helped by the fact the update adds in sticks of dynamite that you and your fellow climbers can run across and make go boom. Hey, at least you can now point at a fuse whenever someone starts licking their chops at the idea of chewing your fingers.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>🌵 THE MESA UPDATE IS OUT NOW 🌵</p><p>a new PEAK biome has dropped on an island near you ‼️ </p><p>explore the sandy terrain under the blistering sun... alongside plenty of mysteries that lie within the shade. <a href="https://t.co/Ni6YGCpQLd">pic.twitter.com/Ni6YGCpQLd</a></p></div>— AGGRO CRAB 💥 (@AggroCrabGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1954936000045805590?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Among the other new items added in are balloons, scout cannons, parasols, sunscreen, and aloe vera. So, it seems the devs have popped into their local health and beauty shop after raiding Wile E. Coyote's ACME surplus. Armed with this stuff, you're tasked with earning a bunch of new badges that dish out fresh gear.</p>
<p>The Mesa update also adds an optional no-insects mode for creepy crawlyphobes, makes some performance improvements, and dishes out some bug fixes. Among the latter are tweaks that prevent legs getting stuck in luggage, as well as one that stops you fiddling with your backpack after you've passed out.</p>
<p>"A lot of you are asking about future updates and to be as honest as possible - we aren't quite sure yet," Aggro Crab and Landfall wrote to close out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498328557405079710?l=english">the update's notes</a>. "We don't want to promise a bunch of stuff and not deliver. BUT we will continue to update the community on what we're cooking as soon as we can. At this stage, keep expecting bug + stability patches for now!"</p>
<p>Right, off you go to climb those buttes. You'd better not come back glowing pink or your mum'll be furious.</p>
