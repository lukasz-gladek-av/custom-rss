            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/awesome-games-done-quick-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Charity speedrunning event Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 has come to a close, and the event has raised a huge amount of money for charity organization Prevent Cancer Foundation.</p>

<p>Per a press release, AGDQ 2025 has raised a grand total of $2,556,305 for the cancer charity, which advocates for cancer prevention and early detection. That's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/awesome-games-done-quick-raises-26-million-for-prevent-cancer-foundation" rel="nofollow">around the same amount raised</a> during Awesome Games Done Quick 2023 and slightly more than AGDQ 2024's total.</p>

<p>Like last year's event (but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/awesome-games-done-quick-2023-cancels-in-person-event" rel="nofollow">not the previous year's</a>), AGDQ 2025 took place over a seven-day period in Pittsburgh, PA, with over 2,000 people attending the event and "tens of thousands" of people streaming it online.</p>

<p>Highlights, as a press release points out, include Dr. Doot's saxophone-driven&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>stream (which you can see below), as well as an actual opera performance by Xem upon completion of his&nbsp;run of&nbsp;<em>Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando</em>.</p>

<p>You may also have seen FunkopotamusWes playing&nbsp;<em>New Super Mario Bros. Wii&nbsp;</em>using his head and feet while using his hands to play the piano, then doing the same while blindfolded. No wonder the amount raised for charity was so high.</p>

<p>Lest you think AGDQ 2025 focused only on good games, though, think again; the Awful Block segment featured streamers playing through games like the legendarily godawful&nbsp;<em>Superman 64&nbsp;</em>and the just-plain-weird&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Grandmother</em>.</p>




<p>Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 concluded on Sunday morning with a&nbsp;<em>Super Metroid&nbsp;</em>run, which feels like a nice, classic way to bring proceedings to a close.</p>

<p>If you missed any of the runs that took place during AGDQ 2025, you can check them all out via the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamesdonequick" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Games Done Quick YouTube channel</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechwarrior-5-mercenaries">MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries</a> support studio Toadman Interactive have been shuttered by parent company Enad Global 7 as part of "<a href="https://www.enadglobal7.com/press-releases/enad-global-7-initiates-a-wind-down-of-the-operations-in-toadman/">cost-saving measures</a>". This follows the studio closing down offices in Stockholm, Visby, and Oslo last November, as well as a number of redundancies at their Berlin studio. Toadman - who also developed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">soulslike</a> Immortal: Unchained and provided support work for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>   - employed 69 people at the time of closure.</p>

<p>This coincides with Enad Global 7 laying off "approximately" 38 people at Piranha Games, whose latest series entry <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechwarrior">MechWarrior</a> 5: Clans "performed below expectations". Enad Global 7's CEO Ji Ham said <a href="https://www.enadglobal7.com/press-releases/eg7-undertakes-business-optimization-at-one-of-its-studios/">the following</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The team at Piranha truly delivered a high-quality game that exceeded both internal as well as external expectations in terms of quality, story and gameplay. Despite the phenomenal work by the team at Piranha, the game failed to reach new audiences and expand its core audience as anticipated and therefore has not met the necessary sales targets, which has forced us to undertake necessary actions."</p></blockquote>
<p>Piranha have been the de facto custodians of the MechWarrior series since releasing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechwarrior-online">MechWarrior Online</a> in 2013.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-weeks-into-2025-three-studios-are-already-closing-down">Eurogamer report</a>, Enad Global 7's restructuring echoes a spate of other recent studio closures in 2025 already, those being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/robocraft-2-canceled-freejam-shuts-down">Robocraft 2 developer Freejam</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/godfall">Godfall</a>'s Counterplay Games. Last week, we learned that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-tactics">Gears Tactics</a> developer Splash Damage had cancelled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/transformers-reactivate">Transformers: Reactivate</a>, with "a number of roles…potentially at risk of redundancy".</p><p>Best wishes to all affected. A Toadman developer once sent me a key for Immortal: Unchained after I met him at a bar in Stockholm. He also showed me where the tube station was at 4am. I was not in a fit state to otherwise locate the tube station on my own initiative, so this was much appreciated.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-is-reportedly-returning-to-warzone-in-season-3/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Verdansk is reportedly returning to Warzone during Season 3, which will be around mid-April 2025.</p>



<p>That’s according to TheGhostofHope, who has accurately leaked Call of Duty details in the past.</p>



<p>Taking to X (formerly Twitter), <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1878501659413754048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hope replied</a> to someone asking him to “leak Verdansk to wake them [Activision] up,” to which Hope replied, “S3,” referring to Season 3.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming first heard that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-map-verdansk-return-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk would return in December 2023</a>, which was said to be a move directly following the success of OG Fortnite, where Epic Games brought back the game’s original map with tremendous success. Originally slated for a December 2024 release, the map would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-verdansk-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed to Spring 2025</a>. </p>



<p>Activision confirmed the leaks in August 2024 during CODNEXT, where it was announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-warzone-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk would return in 2025</a>. Hope’s tweet suggests that we will not be getting it during Season 2, and instead in Season 3, meaning that we’re still a few months away from release. </p>



<p>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 1 lasted 70 days, suggesting that we’ll get the return of Verdansk around mid-April, unless the map is released during a mid-Season update, which would come around late May.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdansk-took-call-of-duty-to-new-heights">Verdansk Took Call of Duty to New Heights</h2>



<p>First released in 2020, Verdansk and Call of Duty Warzone took the Call of Duty franchise to new heights. The game, which was the first free-to-play Call of Duty ever was a tremendous success with Call of Duty players and saw the game reach its highest concrruent player numbers in history.Revenue also followed, making Activision billions of dollars in revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Following the successful release of OG Fortnite, which saw Fortnite’s player base revived, Activision are seemingly hoping that Verdansk will have similar results. </p>



<p>But as of the time of writing, Call of Duty has had serious issues with bugs and hackers, making the game unplayable to most. So here’s hoping that those issues will be squashed before the release of Verdansk.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-verdansk-coming-back-to-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk’s return</a>?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-will-have-lower-pc-requirements-than-remedys-single-player-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a>, Finnish developer Remedy Entertainment is entering a new venture in more ways than one. The main thing is, obviously, that they are going to publish their first multiplayer game (with the exception of Death Really, which is really a unique title in their portfolio) since their foundation in 1995. This means having to come up with entirely different level design approaches and character progression systems, not to mention needing to inject some actual teamwork into the gameplay and, of course, making sure that the online infrastructure is solid.</p>
<p>But there's another noteworthy way in which FBC: Firebreak will differ from previous Remedy titles. Historically, the studio always pushed the graphics and technological envelop, from Max Payne to Alan Wake, Control (one of the best ray tracing showcases), and Alan Wake 2 (one of the only path traced games on the market). This inevitably came with relatively high PC requirements at the time of the titles' respective releases.&nbsp;However, that won't be the case with FBC: Firebreak, as Remedy Communications Director Thomas Puha <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/after-alan-wake-2-and-control-fbc-firebreak-represents-a-bold-new-frontier-for-remedy-its-time-to-expand-the-remedy-connected-universe-into-shared-spaces-and-brave-something-new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Gamesradar</a>.</p>
<p><em>We are pretty conscious of keeping the minimum required PC spec reasonable, and not going so high with the requirements as we did with Control and Alan Wake 2. We'll still have great graphics and visual effects, all that you expect from Remedy, but in a multiplayer experience like this, framerate is king as well as the responsiveness of the controls.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, the screenshots and footage released so far clearly show that it won't be a visual showcase like their usual single player games. However, as Puha said, that's understandable; after all, most multiplayer games follow the same pattern.</p>
<p>In the Gamesradar interview, Remedy also explained that they want to get the game into as many hands as possible, which is why it'll be available on both PlayStation Plus and Game Pass at launch. There's no launch window yet, but FBC: Firebreak is expected to debut later this year.</p>

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</h2>



<p>Developer: Saber Interactive | Release Date: September 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Otton</p>

<p>It seems crazy that it took this long for someone to really nail what it feels like to play as a Space Marine for the <em>Warhammer 40K </em>universe. Obviously, this is a sequel to a first solid attempt at that game, but it wasn't quite there. Now, though, <em>Space Marine 2</em> is the ultimate <em>40K </em>fantasy.</p>

<p><em>Space Marine 2</em>'s co-op is set up in a classic way. Honestly, there's nothing more to it than you can just join up with some friends to absolutely demolish people as a squad of Space Marines. Because the gameplay is so visceral and the visual design so perfectly captures that universe, you can't help yourself but have a good time.</p>

<p>It isn't often we're treated with some really fun co-op experiences, but you owe it to yourself to try out <em>Space Marine 2</em>, especially if you're into <em>Warhammer</em>.</p>

<h2>Second Place - Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>Developer: NetEase Games | Release Date: December 6th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p>

<p>Ever since I played it while it was in beta over the summer, I felt something I hadn't felt in a while: low-pressure competitive joy. It reminds me of the early days of <em>Overwatch </em>(in more ways than one). No matter which character you play, it's fairly easy to feel effective, but games are also just short enough that if you royally screw up, the opportunity to redeem yourself is around the corner.</p>

<p>The Team-Up Abilities also feel like an innovative take on hero selection. Pairing up two heroes who benefit each other gives you a slight edge, but it never feels like it breaks the game. Instead, it's a lore-friendly way to strategize your picks, playing into the rich history of Marvel stories that are on offer.</p>

<p>We're just getting into season 1 now, which has introduced Reed Richards and the Invisible Woman, with The Thing and the Human Torch just around the corner. Already, that's an impressive amount of support for a hero shooter that could really shake up the somewhat stale genre.</p>

<h2>Winner - Helldivers 2</h2>



<p>Developer: Arrowhead Game Studios | Release Date: February 8th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Dan Rockwood</p>

<p>In 2024, no game captured the chaos and camaraderie of fighting on a united front better than <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Not only is it super fun to coordinate calling in stratagems that will bomb entire acres of a map, but on higher difficulty levels <em>Helldivers 2</em> requires optimized teamwork to keep from being overrun by Terminids, Automatons and, most recently, the Illuminate.</p>

<p>When you are battling alone, outgunned and outnumbered, there's no greater feeling than a friendly ship coming out of hyperspace, the fresh Hellpod deploying, screaming through the atmosphere like a missile until it slams into the ground, releasing a new Helldiver to help turn the tide of battle.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2</em> seamlessly integrates and relies on cross-platform coordination and cooperative play to win missions but doesn't shy away from the hilarity of accidentally (or intentionally) dropping a 500 kg bomb on one of your friends or napalming an extraction point moments before evacuation. <em>Helldivers 2</em> is among the greatest multiplayer experiences of the past decade, and with frequent updates and an ever-evolving story, it shows no signs of slowing down.</p>

<p>The heavily rumored Hatsune Miku Fortnite skin has leaked online and players are not happy with the design.</p>



<p>Hatsune Miku’s Fortnite skin came courtesy of Fortnite leaker and dataminer <a href="https://x.com/Wensoing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@Wensoing</a>, who posted the images over on their X (formerly Twitter) account. You can see the skin below: </p>



<div><article><p><span>dread it. run from it. destiny arrives all the same. and now it’s here.</span></p></article></div>



<p>According to the dataminer, Miku will also have a Fortnite Lego skin, but images are yet to be posted online.</p>



<p>Despite the rumored skin having fans wondering when it will come for months, fans of Hatsune Miku seem to be somewhat disappointed by how the skin looks, with many criticizing how her face looks in-game. </p>



<p>“That face is so wrong lol. The rest is very solid but it’s incredibly distracting at how off the face is,” said Reddit user suika_melon. “looks nothing like her official models,” said LolcatP. </p>



<p>Fortnite Festival launches on January 14, 2026, and brings local multiplayer for the first time.</p>



<p>“Get the band back together on January 14! The launch of Festival Season 7 comes with a new local multiplayer feature on Xbox and PlayStation! In a local play session of Festival Main Stage, up to four players can play together on the same console,” the official gamer description of Fortnite Festival Season 7 reads.</p>



<p>Will you be playing Fortnite Festival on Jan 14th? What do you think of the new Hatsune Miku skin? Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>The animator behind the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> film credits has detailed the creation of its low poly character models, including the first ever Classic Shadow.</p>
<p>Each of the Sonic films has had a retro-themed credits sequence, gradually moving from 2D pixels to the low poly 3D models in this film, which were based on arcade game Sonic the Fighters.</p>
<p>However, with the inclusion of Shadow the Hedgehog in the film, this provided an opportunity to create a Classic Shadow model for the first time.</p>

<p>Back in 2023, Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka told GameInformer (thanks <a href="https://www.sonicstadium.org/news/games/takashi-iizuka-says-it-again-shadow-will-not-appear-in-classic-sonic-games-r1352/">Sonic Stadium</a>) during a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-superstars">Sonic Superstars</a> preview that Shadow would not be mixing with classic characters.</p>
<p>"Shadow is from the Modern series of characters and gameplay that we have introduced," he said. "The Classic series exists before the Modern series, so they haven't met at that time. There's no relationship, so we won't be bringing Shadow into the Classic series."</p>
<p>Then, with last year's Sonic x Shadow Generations,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-is-the-best-of-00s-sonic-with-a-big-dash-of-nostalgia"> Iizuka confirmed to Eurogamer before its release</a> there would be no Classic Shadow.</p>
<p>Yet animator suitNtie managed to do it, which he's detailed in a new video discussing the creation of the credits.</p>
<p>"[Shadow's design] is something that is probably one of the most important things to me on the project," he said.</p>
<p>"It feels almost like [Sega is] allergic to this idea completely. So I was really sceptical if I was going to be able to."</p>
<p>The model itself was based on the same used for Sonic, but with a few tweaks: the colour scheme, of course, as well as the shoes and eyeliner.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/I-worked-on-Sonic-3.-13-22-screenshot.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>These low poly models are such a thrill for fans | <span>Image credit: <cite>Sega / Paramount / Picturemill</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"But then it came down to the torso - what I would consider Classic Sonic's main thing is the torso and also the proportions," he continued, pointing to the model's round body design. "Will they want the more normal <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-adventure">Sonic Adventure</a>-style body, instead of this Classic one?</p>
<p>"If you watch the movie you see that it's Classic Shadow! I got Classic Shadow in an official Sonic product!"</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the video, suitNtie discusses how he got the job. At the end of 2023 he was laid off from his job as a VFX artist in the games industry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">similarly to so many employees</a>. It's great, therefore, to see such a success story emerging from its aftermath.</p>
<p>In addition to the video, the animator has shared a thread on X discussing some extra titbits, including how he tried to sneak a Dreamcast console into the background.</p>

<p>Pokemon GO developers have revealed that support for 32-bit Android devices will be discontinued in 2025. The list of affected devices is below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/32-bit-android-discontinued-support-2025?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Pokemon GO devs revealed that support for 32-bit Android devices will be stopped to “streamline” their development process and shift resources to support “newer operating systems and technologies.” After the upcoming update, only 32-bit Android devices will be affected; 64-bit and iOS users don’t have to do anything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From March 2025, Pokemon GO will no longer be accessible for 32-bit users who downloaded the game from the Samsung Galaxy Store. Support for players who downloaded the game from the Google Play Store will end in June 2025. After this date, players will not be able to access their Pokemon GO accounts, items, or PokéCoins once the update is live. They must log in with the same credentials on a new 64-bit device to continue playing the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is a list of 32-bit Android devices that you won’t be able to play Pokemon GO on in the near future:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Samsung Galaxy S4, S5, Note 3, J3</li>



<li>Sony Xperia Z2, Z3</li>



<li>Motorola Moto G (1st generation)</li>



<li>LG Fortune, Tribute</li>



<li>OnePlus One</li>



<li>HTC One (M8)</li>



<li>ZTE Overture 3</li>



<li>Certain Android devices released before 2015</li>
</ul>

<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 developers Larian Studios have shifted the team’s entire focus to their next game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While speaking to <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/baldurs-gate-3-devs-shift-full-attention-to-their-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Video Gamer</a>, Baldur’s Gate 3 devs stated, “Swen and the team[‘s]… full attention is focused on crafting their next title”. The report also reveals that the development studio will be entering a “media blackout” until further notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, Swen Vincke, the CEO of Larian, spoke about the studio’s journey in a new post on <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1877608305452892504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, stating that there’s much more to come from them in the future. While reposting the “Larian Studios: From Bankruptcy To Baldur’s Gate 3” YouTube video, Vincke stated that it has been “an incredible journey so far. But the story isn’t over yet. Stay Tuned.”</p>



<p>Back in March 2024, Baldur’s Gate 3 devs revealed that they <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-baldurs-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would not be working on a DLC or sequel</a> for the series but on something “new.” Since then, it has been revealed that Larian Studios is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-is-working-on-two-new-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently working on two new projects</a> while continuing to provide support to 2023’s game of the year.</p>



<p>If you are worried about the next Baldur’s Gate title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-4-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hasbro has expressed interest in creating it</a>. However, they are in the process of finding the right partners to develop the franchise’s next entry. Baldur’s Gate 3 actors have also shown interest in working <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-actors-interested-in-new-dd-game-or-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a new Dungeons and Dragons game or movie</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Nintendo lawyers reportedly visited accessories manufacturer Genki on the CES trade show floor last week, a reporter has claimed, after videos of its dummy <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> console went viral.
</p>
<p>
High profile French tech journalist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuKVsoHCgXk">Julien Tellouck</a> was one of several reporters to stop by Genki's CES booth last Friday, when he claimed the company had been dropped in on by Nintendo lawyers.
</p>
<p>
Images of Genki's mock-up Switch 2 unit - which the company's chatty CEO initially claimed was based on the actual final design of Nintendo's under-wraps console - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">spread across the internet last week</a>. Clearly, Nintendo noticed. 
</p>

<a aria-label="Newscast: Everything we learned this week about Switch 2 - and what is going on with Ubisoft?" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1BtAZoo1S0?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
According to Tellouck, though, Genki simply told Nintendo it had never signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the company and therefore hadn't technically broken any rules.
</p>
<p>
"I talked to the guy from Genki just behind me, he told me that Nintendo had stopped by with lawyers - they had nothing to be reprimanded for because they had never signed a paper with Nintendo - no confidentiality agreement, no NDA," Tellouck said. "So the Japanese brand are quiet. 
</p>
<p>
"On the other hand, [Genki] told me that they were sure that the Nintendo Switch 2 - except for a few details - would look like this 3D prototype."
</p>
<p>
Perhaps notably, by the end of last week <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/01/10/148376.html">Genki had decided to make clear it hadn't actually seen Switch 2 itself</a> - after previously saying it was aware that units were now available on the black market.
</p>
<p>Last Friday finally also brought an acknowledgement of the leaks by Nintendo. Speaking to Japanese newspaper The Sankei Shimbun, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks">Nintendo spokesperson simply stated the images and videos from CES were "not official"</a>.</p>
<p>With details of the Switch 2's hardware design spreading, further leaks have also begun detailing Switch 2's third-party software line-up. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-getting-halo-and-another-big-xbox-game-with-microsoft-set-to-be-a-very-big-supporter">Microsoft will reportedly be a major supporter, alongside Square Enix with multiple Final Fantasy titles</a>. Surely, after months of waiting, official word is now imminent.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>There are always new indie games coming out. Whether they're from known developers or new developers coming out of the woodwork, there is a lot to be excited about when it comes to indie games. They come in every shape and size, with some being geared towards providing a nostalgic retro experience to others being roguelikes, deck-builders, and even a soulslike or two. Here are the most anticipated indie games of 2025.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a></em></p>

<h2>Citizen Sleeper: Starward Vector (January 31 - All Platforms)</h2>
<p>The first Citizen Sleeper was incredibly popular, and this game takes players back into the universe of this beloved text-heavy roleplaying game. This title is set to release on all platforms, including Nintendo Switch and Mac, platforms that are most often left out of video game releases these days. For those excited about this sci-fi title, you won't have long to wait, as it's set to release at the end of this month when you'll finally get to dive into this world and explore the Starward Belt. It's the perfect title for those who are fans of dice-rolling features incorporated into an RPG.</p>

<h2>Date Everything (February 14 - All Platforms)</h2>
<p>If you're looking for a very goofy visual novel where you get to date inanimate objects turned into people, this is the game for you. We are putting this on this list purely for the comedic value. If you've ever wanted to charm your fridge or maybe even date your washing machine, Date Everything is the game for that. It's shaping up to be a fever dream of a game. There are 100 fully-voiced characters for you to get to know, giving the game a ton of replayability.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Wanderstop (March 11 - PC)</h2>
<p>Wanderstop is a new game created by the developers behind The Stanley Parable. If you like cozy games with exploration, then Wanderstop may just be the game for you. Luckily, you won't have long to wait until the release of Wanderstop. At the moment, it's only being released on PC via Steam. This game tells a story about change and tea, similar to the way Coffee Talk is. If you enjoy the Coffee Talk games, maybe put Wanderstop on the wishlist.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Usual June (TBA)</h2>
<p>While Usual June doesn't have a release date just yet, it is set to release at some point this year. This title is made by Finji, the developer behind the hit game Tunic. Usual June takes a bit of a wildly different spin, as it focuses on the story of a girl who can communicate with the dead. June has to explore the town of Fen Harbor alongside her friends and try to stop the world from being torn apart by an interdimensional anomaly. It is set to release this year, with more details being released about this game periodically, showcasing gameplay and the beautiful art style.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Slay the Spire 2</h2>
<p>Slay the Spire is a beloved deck-builder and is one of the most known games in the genre. It was a huge moment when Mega Crit announced the game, and more so when fans of the first game finally got to see a gameplay trailer for Slay the Spire 2. Mega Crit has been hard at work and has been releasing regular updates about the development process.&nbsp; There will be some familiar faces but also some new ones and plenty of new relics and cards to get to know and experiment with. At the moment, <a href="https://wccftech.com/slay-the-spire-2-announced-early-access-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slay the Spire 2</a> doesn't have an official release date, but it is due for release this year, albeit in early access.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Hyper Light Breaker - (January 14 - Steam)</h2>
<p>Hyper Light Breaker is officially entering the<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Early Access period</a> on January 14, where players will get to dive into the eclectic world of Hyper Light from a 3D perspective, compared to the 2.5D perspective of Hyper Light Drifter. If you're a fan of Risk of Rain 2, then you're in for a treat with this game. Whether you play by yourself or with friends, Hyper Light Breaker has a lot of replayability, as it follows the typical roguelike methodology.</p>

            <p>EEK3 is the alternative showcase of small horror game creators that amalgamates every year like a shell of flies around the corpse of E3. It's a lot of fun for people who enjoy ye olde PS1 aesthetics and foggy throwback horror. The 2024 showcase was supposed to happen in time for Halloween, the night when the spirits of old platformer mascots rise from their graves to gift polygons to small children. But it was postponed due to technical problems. Only now has the 2-hour showcase of game trailers emerged, culminating in a new Haunted PS1 demo disc packed with upcoming games. "The curse," say the organisers, "is lifted." </p>
<!--more-->
<p>There are over 70 games shown off. As you can imagine, it's quite a long show. But I heard you have lots of time on your hands. It's a whole new year. And if you need it, here's <a href="https://www.moyahorror.com/eek3-games-list">a full list of all the games</a> on show. </p>

<p>There are more than a few stand-outs among the lo-fi horror. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prison-of-husks">Prison Of Husks</a> is a sword swinger set in a medieval castleland reminiscent of Lordran from the first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/angeline-era">Angeline Era</a> is a colourful and bumpy hack 'n' slash from the creators of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anodyne">Anodyne</a> RPGs. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/of-love-and-eternity">Of Love And Eternity</a> is an attractively pixelated knightly romance - and by romance I mean your love was killed and so were you and now you are in a hellish skull-filled country where you have to use a lantern full of glowbugs to see the bone-littered path in front of you. We last saw it demoed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/of-love-and-eternity-is-a-scary-walk-with-good-noises">back in 2021</a>.</p><p>There are probably a ton of other promising entries - I haven't got through the whole show yet. But I spy some familiar faces coming down the gore tubes. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trip">Trip</a> is the funny, bright timeloop caper<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trip-is-a-pleasant-train-journey-with-normal-folk-like-this-unblinking-child-who-speaks-only-in-dark-symbols"> I tried in autumn</a>. And the grasping hand of non-euclidean horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eclipsium">Eclipsium</a> recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-worth-downloading-the-demo-for-uncanny-horror-eclipsium-just-to-stare-at-your-hands">got Nic cooing</a>. And, oh look, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sorry-were-closed">Sorry We're Closed</a> also gets a shout-out, despite the fact the hot pink horror with horny demons already released in November (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sorry-were-closed-review">Ed reviewed it</a>, in case you're wondering). This is probably just a hangover result of the showcase's long delay. </p>
<p>Still, yes, 70 games. That's a lot of ground to cover. Thankfully, the Haunted PS1 demo disc which accompanies the showcase is not quite so overwhelming. It only has 24 demos to try out. These demo discs have often been the delightfully fetid source of quiet hits. Parkour rock climbing game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorns-lure">Lorn's Lure</a> was first featured on the demo disc back in 2021, for example. And one of my favourite games of last year, the Elder Scrolls-inspired <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dread-delusion">Dread Delusion</a>, first appeared on the 2020 disc.</p>
<p>In short, the Haunted PS1 folks have a good track record for curating interesting stuff, and every disc has a fun framing device that makes it a game in itself. This year, a ritual has wrong, say the creators, and it has manifested a two-sided disc, with one side devoted to fearsome freakery and the other devoted to cute nostalgia. You can <a href="https://hauntedps1.itch.io/demo-disc-flipside-frights">download the demo disc on Itch</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I've always wished there was a game workers equivalent of gobbing in an especially rude customer's cheeseburger. Not that anyone should need the lingering threat of getting served a McLungButter to be polite to service workers, but it seems good to have the option. Possibly spurred on by reality-challenged goblins hounding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> Aerith actor Brianna White, Square Enix have shared a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/company/customer_harassment_policy.html">new policy</a> outlining how they plan to respond to harassment from customers toward their staff and partners. It's obviously a vastly more proper and legally sound approach than the aforementioned sandwich tampering, but I support it nonetheless.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"There are instances where certain customers take actions directly or through our support centers, or towards our group executives, employees, partners who are involved in the creation and distribution of our group products and services, that constitute ‘customer harassment," reads the statement as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/new-square-enix-policy-aims-to-protect-employees-from-toxic-fans/">Very Gary Computing</a>, "such as denial of personality, violence, defamation, intimidation, advance notice of wrongdoing, advance notice of obstruction of business, harassment."</p>
<p>"Such actions do not only prevent our employees and partners from engaging in their work with a sense of security," they continue, "but also causes disruptions to other customers. Square Enix will not tolerate harassment and will take action as necessary". The action in question being to "cease providing support services or to refrain from providing our group’s products and services.”</p>
<p>Here's their list of absolutely Gaialess behaviour in full:</p>

<p>As VGC highlight, Briana White has previously <a href="https://x.com/ItsBrianaWhite/status/1869877671628607729">spoken out online</a> to request that "shippers" please relax. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> features a love triangle between her character Aerith, protagonist Cloud, and his childhood friend Tifa - a secondary story element that a certain subset of the audience have historically taken far too seriously, which has apparently spilled over into real-life harassment of White.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I imagine the bulk of this is mostly the kind of boilerplate you find in policies about harassment, rather than responses to any specific incident. Although the line "unreasonable changes or exchange of product or request for monetary compensation" requires a bit of good faith that Square Enix's idea of "unreasonable" is in line with everyone else's.</p><p>Again, though, it seems mostly like covering bases to me. I imagine the "unreasonable and excessive demands for punishment of our employees" line rings depressingly true to anyone who's ever seen the sheer catastrophic levels of entitlement floating around on social media from people who feel that buying one (1) videogame gives them the right to attempt to purge workers they disagree with. Love to be a human on the internet in 2025. Love it.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2’s creative director has revealed how involved Arrowhead Game Studios will be with the upcoming movie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-movie-arrowhead-wont-have-final-say" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VG247</a>, Johan Pilestedt recently posted a photo of the Helldivers 2 team having a meal together on <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1877764599409221678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). In the comment section of this post, the creative director was asked whether Arrowhead would be involved in the upcoming Helldivers movie’s production. Pilestedt responded, “The short answer is yes. The long answer is that we’ll see.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pilestedt added that Arrowhead Studios are game developers and not “Hollywood people,” so they are unaware of “what it takes to make a movie.” The director concluded by stating, “Therefore, we don’t, and shouldn’t, have the final say” in the production of the upcoming Helldivers movie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In other news, Helldivers 2 developers have already begun fleshing out the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dev-next-game-concept/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high concept’ for the team’s next game</a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/dynasty-warriors-origins-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dynasty-warriors-origins-review.1080624/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dynasty-warriors-origins-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel has inspired countless adaptations, to the point where it can be hard to make these now familiar characters and stories fresh again. But after spending 60 hours with Dynasty Warriors: Origins, its rebooted tale of politics, war, and diplomacy felt almost as new as the first time I discovered it. It ups the scale of its battles beyond what even this series has been known for, with more enemies on screen than ever before to truly create that “1 vs. 1000” fantasy. Pair that with improved visuals, a much deeper and more refined focus on its combat, impressive storytelling, and a wealth of postgame content and Origins has easily become my favorite Dynasty Warriors yet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Romance of the Three Kingdoms’ broader storylines are often the driving force behind some of Dynasty Warriors’ biggest battles, the real focus and draw of this series has always been the action itself. The moments that have stuck with me most involve taking down hundreds of opponents at once, with fights against legendary warriors like Lu Bu usually just adding a bit of flavor to that carnage. However, with Origins, Koei Tecmo and Omega Force have balanced the scales between story and combat. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dynasty Warriors: Origins Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike previous games, which had you pick a storyline and then swap between legendary lords like Liu Bei, Sun Ce, or Cao Cao, here you take on the singular role of a brand new character created specifically for Origins. The trope of your hero being <em>yet another</em> wandering warrior suffering from amnesia is a bit cliche, but it works surprisingly well. This more focused storyline takes you through the earlier years of prominent Three Kingdoms characters before their rise to glory, letting you travel across multiple provinces and lend your talents to whichever army needs you. And although I did miss the ability to play as those well known officers like Guan Yu for entire missions, Origins at least gives you the option to take control of them temporarily in some specific levels, which is a nice compromise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There isn't much choice in the early chapters as you join iconic events like the quelling of the Yellow Turban army and the rise and fall of Dong Zhuo. But that all changes when you reach the midpoint of the roughly 45-hour (if you take the time to do all the side activities) campaign, as you must choose an alliance and lord to join permanently, which shapes your perspective throughout the rest of the story. I first chose the small but competent Shu clan, following Liu Bei's optimism and selflessness through the highs and lows of his rise to power. Thankfully, after seeing the end of one storyline, Origins makes it very easy to either jump back in and replay any battle you want or restart from specific points in each chapter, letting you see how the story unfolds when you choose one of the other alliances. Meeting certain conditions in each of those branching stories will even unlock the “true endings” of the saga, which I am still happily working towards. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Origins puts a little more romance into the Three Kingdoms.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the five chapters, there is also a secondary storyline that involves the recovery of your lost memories, slowly explaining the wanderer's role in the grander tale that unfolds. It’s filled with engaging conversations and cutscenes across a large cast of interesting characters, which adds levity and intrigue to help balance out the more exposition-heavy dialogue that focuses on the events of each battle or the various betrayals and alliances happening around them. The only real downside and oddity of your main character is that he is often emotionless – and when he does emote, it is extremely subtle, which sometimes hurts the emotional depth of certain story moments; he also doesn't speak except for generic shouts during battle when you dodge, parry, or take down an officer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you encounter other prominent warriors in battle, you will occasionally find them afterward on the world map, allowing you to deepen your bond with them. Each bond has five levels, and progressing through them provides bonuses like collectible coins that offer regular rewards as you grow your collection. The final bond level even unlocks a more intimate cutscene between you and that character, and these conversations ended up being some of my favorites. For example, avoiding spoilers, it was surprisingly touching when one famous general asked me to join them for a drink so they could etch the features of my face and the sound of my voice into their memory. The characters speak so eloquently and with such reverence that it can often read as romantic interest, although none of the dozens of bonds I completed ever explicitly led to that. Still, Koei Tecmo certainly put a little bit more romance into the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and I, for one, couldn't be happier about it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Art of War</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">They say war never changes, but the weapons of war sure do. You may just begin with a sword and some very simple special attacks (known as Battle Arts), but you’ll not only unlock more options as you go, you’ll also gain proficiency with each one in order to unlock new combos and stronger abilities. That system encouraged me to keep using weapons I otherwise might not, even if my initial experience with them wasn’t great. For example, The wheels weapon, which is one I've enjoyed in the past, just didn't seem to have the wave clear or damage potential of weapons like the crescent blade or gauntlets when I first unlocked it – but after increasing its proficiency a bit, I eventually discovered its potential in staggering enemy officers and its ability to shred through their defenses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are eight additional weapon types to unlock either by defeating specific generals or purchasing them in shops, and I generally found myself with a new one by the time I had gained three or four levels of proficiency with my current one, preventing combat from ever getting stale. Each weapon has a distinct identity that fills in nicely for Origins’ lack of switching characters, especially when you can swap between them in the middle of a mission to gain proficiency with multiple weapons per stage and adapt to the evolving situation of a battle. It quickly became apparent which weapons were ideal for me to take down as many enemies as fast as possible, especially in the latter chapters, where taking too long in one fight could mean not reaching allies in time to save them. While every weapon is designed to work in all situations, there are inherent benefits to using something like the wide-hitting lance against crowds, which also has an Endure mechanic that stores damage taken and turns it back on your enemies with improved power while restoring your health over time. Meanwhile, whenever I found myself locked in a duel with a powerful foe, it was time to bring out my gauntlets thanks to their ability to easily knock up and juggle my opponents until it was done. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The spectacle of the Ultimate Musou Attacks match their power.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Every weapon has its own set of Battle Arts, which consume a resource called Bravery and range from wide sweeping attacks to powerful repeated thrusts to various counterattacks. The more powerful and exciting ones even give you the ability to summon small tornadoes that sweep up enemies, make spires of earth that deal constant damage to anyone touching them, or (one of my personal favorites) create a laser of light fired from your fingertips that can pierce and knock up groups for as long as you hold the button down or until you run out Bravery. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bravery is accumulated by landing hits on enemies, parrying strikes, or perfectly evading attacks after unlocking a specific skill on the skill tree. Parries and perfect evasions look better than ever and come with large benefits in combat; parrying attacks immediately opens up enemies to counterattacks, ending their combos and making them susceptible to knock-ups. Meanwhile, perfect evasions generate Bravery more quickly as you can chain dodges to restore more with each combo. These mechanics add depth to the combat and help keep fights interesting beyond just seeing how many KO’s I could get while slaughtering armies. In addition to your Battle Arts, you also have access to the all-powerful Musou Attacks that the series is known for, as well as a rage mode that refills your Bravery instantly, restores health on hits, and enables an even stronger Ultimate Musou Attack. The spectacle of these moves match their power, and it was always a rush to see 1000 KO’s pop up simultaneously when I timed one right. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While on the battlefield, you also gain access to numerous Tactics that can help turn the tide of battle when deployed properly. For instance, using your squad to rain down fire arrows in the heat of battle can deal some good damage and weaken the opposing troop's numbers – however, moving to higher ground before unleashing them will result in a much more dramatic success, increasing the damage to their health and morale, which gives you some welcome strategic choices to make beyond simply using these moves whenever they come off cooldown. Those cooldowns can be quite lengthy, too, so these Tactics became extremely valuable for assisting officers in danger or softening up enemies to strike them down quicker. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The power fantasy of quickly devastating huge hordes of foes with ease is one of the things I love about Dynasty Warriors, and I'm happy to report that feeling is still alive and well here. However, as you turn up the difficulty, it also becomes increasingly important to utilize the defensive options at your disposal, which adds satisfying wrinkles for those who want to face them. Mastering these techniques is important on the higher Hero difficulty and essential on the Ultimate difficulty that unlocks after completing the main story – there, enemy combos will quickly deplete your health, and the more aggressive AI isn’t afraid to attack you from multiple angles at the same time, meaning one wrong move can easily lead to mission failure. I had a blast taking on this added challenge as I replayed previous missions, making enemy officers stronger and healthier but also dropping higher tiers of rewards. Some missions also carry special challenges, such as completing them within a shorter time limit, defeating specific officers, and capturing certain bases to unlock new rewards, making it even more worth my time to revisit them. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Jada's Favorite Musou Games Unranked.</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of combat, Origins puts you on a gorgeous map filled with mountains, rivers, and forests, giving it the appearance of a living diorama built for strategic planning. That map is filled with numerous markers for missions to complete, skirmishes to take on, resources to collect, officers to talk to, and towns to shop in. Its 10 provinces are large enough to warrant a fast travel system of its own, but still small enough to conveniently get anywhere you need to in just a minute or two. In addition to the main story missions, side missions offer rewards like new accessories to boost your stats or more guards to improve your Tactics, while skirmishes are bite-sized, two-to-three-minute encounters that are great for earning extra money or completing the various challenges given to you by other officers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of these challenges are easy tasks like killing 100 enemies with strong attacks from a spear, but I enjoyed using skirmishes as a way to handle them so that I could tackle the main missions without having to do something like limit myself to a specific weapon. The trickiest of these challenges (which I wish there were more of) required me to win five duels without taking damage – that was genuinely tough and required quite a few restarts to finish quickly, but it helped hone my skill in duels. They were also always worthwhile to complete as they rewarded me humorous or deeper conversations with some of my favorite characters, and provided bonus skill points to unlock the next thing on my skill trees. Both skirmishes and challenges became a great way to try out new builds, too, as well as a nice way to sprinkle in some action when the story reached moments of multiple back-to-back cutscenes.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">If Dynasty Warriors: Origins is meant to be a new beginning, it’s one that gets off to a masterful start. It doesn’t just have the largest amount of enemies the series has thrown on screen at once, it also deepens its combat, improves its storytelling without getting in the way of the action, and provides a healthy amount of replayability and postgame content – all while looking better than ever. Your amnesiac hero is a bit too much of a blank slate at times, but the impressive ensemble cast made this story sing as I grew to care about the characters around him, big and small. Origins is both a great entry point for newcomers and a triumphant return for veterans like me who felt the last few entries had become stale or missed the mark. It feels like the series I once loved is finally back.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> will receive its first major patch later this week, 0.1.1, which primarily brings some big changes to endgame content.</p>
<p>More is planned for a future update too, as game director Jonathan Rogers explained in a new video (below).</p>
<p>"We have a huge amount of much more meta-shifting changes that we know we want to make," he said. "And one of the best things about having the game in early access with the endgame, is that we now have a much better idea of where we want character powers to be and what the balance of bosses and monsters should be relevant to that. But, those types of changes are going to have to wait until we are ready to make a new league and a new economy for people to play in.</p>

<p>"That's still a little while away yet, but in the meantime we'll be continuing to identify things that are causing frustration and try and address them."</p>
<p>So what are the biggest changes?</p>
<p>Firstly, maps have received balance tweaks to the likes of monsters, chests, essences, and other materials. This is to ensure maps are more rewarding to explore.</p>
<p>Four new towers have also been added, as only one tower map was available previously, in order to improve variety. The existing map has also been "redone" to "make playing there less boring".</p>
<p>More maps with bosses will also be spawned as the rate was previously incorrect. What's more, Pinnacle content currently takes too long to reach and players have only one attempt at the boss. Now Citadels will spawn within closer reach on the map, and six respawn attempts will be provided on bosses - though only on the Arbiter of Ash boss so far.</p><p>Other quality of life changes include: better visibility of attack effects thanks to reduced clutter on maps; tweaks to strongboxes to spawn monsters more quickly; an increased zoom level on the Atlas; removal of terrain collision issues; the ability to overwrite item sockets with new runes; and other boss balance changes.</p>
<p>Full patch notes will be revealed later this week when the patch arrives. For now, check out the video above for details.</p>
<p>Developer Grinding Gear Games admitted back in December <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-not-rewarding-enough-its-developer-admits-amid-incoming-changes">Path of Exile 2 was "not rewarding enough"</a> and listed a number of tweaks it's been working on. It's clear, then, the developer is not slowing down now the game is out in early access.</p>
<p>"Soulslike thrills combine with sky-high production values to make Path of Exile 2 a hugely impressive package, even in early access," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review">Path of Exile 2 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/13/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-the-best-musuo-game-ever/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>For a moment there we were genuinely worried about what the future had in store for <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a>. Despite being a flagship franchise for <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei-tecmo">Koei</a> over the years, it began to feel starved of innovation, rehashing the same core mechanics and retreading the same old story. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/13/dynasty-warriors-9-review/">Dynasty Warriors 9 tried to do something drastically different</a> with its open-world setup but this was poorly executed, leaving players to explore barren landscapes populated by braindead enemy warbands. The fact that Nioh developer <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/team-ninja">Team Ninja</a> recently did their own spin on the Three Kingdoms story with <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/wo-long-fallen-dynasty">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a> also hinted at DW’s uncertain future. However, it appears that Omega Force had been biding its time, going back to the drawing board, and rebuilding its beloved hack n’ slash epic from scratch instead of tacking a few new shiny features on a much-fatigued formula.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dynasty Warriors Origins - Overview Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wEJj6ahC38s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As the name implies, Origins is a reboot, and an ideal entry point for both new and lapsed fans. At the same time, this latest Dynasty Warriors game feels like it was made for series diehards, revising and reworking just about every core aspect while layering on intriguing new gameplay systems.</p>


<p>For the uninitiated, Dynasty Warriors is a historical action game set in Ancient China and based on Luo Guanzhong’s epic novel, “Romance of the Three Kingdoms”. While there have been 9 mainline entries in the series, each one has retold the same story over and over albeit with shinier graphics and incremental changes to the frenzied, hack n’ slash gameplay. DW has always been about “1 versus 1,000” battles where players obliterate entire armies by hammering out button combos and special “Musou” attacks.</p>
<p>Despite the many changes Omega Force has made in Dynasty Warriors: Origins, that concept is still at the very centre of the experience. If anything it has become more galvanised thanks to smartly evolved combat mechanics and the enhanced cinematic atmosphere of large-scale battles.</p>


<p>Hearing that Dynasty Warriors: Origins would only feature a limited roster of playable characters and weapons seemed like a major red flag. Dynasty Warriors 9 included almost 100 generals; a core part of the DW experience has been playing through each campaign to unlock new characters. However, this big change makes perfect sense from both in terms of narrative and gameplay.</p>
<p>Instead of selecting a faction and watching the events of the Three Kingdoms saga play out from their perspective, you are the ‘Wanderer’, a mysterious fighter with a hidden past who, during those early chapters of the story, remains neutral. It’s a clever change-up and one that allows you interact with various characters from each faction before ultimately deciding who to align with whereas previous games forced players to choose Shu, Wu, or Weight straight off the bat with little to no preamble.</p>
<p>If there’s one niggling flaw with the story, it’s the new cast ethereal characters who help the Wanderer piece together memories of his past life. They steer the game’s narrative in a slightly more supernatural directional though thankfully this doesn’t overshadow the historical Three Kingdoms timeline, giving fan favourite characters more time to shine.</p>

<p>Paradoxically, even though many of them aren’t directly playable, in Origins it feels like you learn more about each character through various cutscenes and other interactions. This is helped by the presence of English voiceovers. One gripe we’ve had with other games in the wider Musou franchise is the disconnect when attempting to read subtitles in the heat of battle, often missing vital information and a sense of atmosphere. Something else noticeable is the shift away from over-the-top caricature representations of certain historic figures such as Zhang Jiao and Dong Zhuo who are instead given some added thought and depth in Dynasty Warriors: Origins.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the number of weapons has also been dialled down. It was not that long ago that each and every character had a specific weapon complete with its own unique moveset and attack animations. We’re talking dozens of weapons, with myriad flavours of different swords and spears as well as exotic armaments such as Zuo Ci’s deck of cards, Ling Tong’s nunchucks, and Zhang He’s claws. Omega Force has opted for quality over quantity in Dynasty Warriors: Origins, giving each weapon class its own distinguishable depth and “feel”. Where the Sword and its strong attack combos should be familiar to DW fans, other weapons require a change in mindset. The Wheels, for instance, will send out a pair of arcing blades when performing a strong attack. After a couple of seconds these will return in a boomerang-like fashion, triggering an even more powerful attack with a well-timed button press.</p>
<p>While you can definitely get away with mindless button bashing on the lowest difficulty setting, Dynasty Warriors: Origins actively encourages mastery over its weapons, as well as its new combat features. Chief among these is the greatly empowered status of enemy officers. Not only do they have meatier health bars and a higher damage output, their attacks need to be countered either by dodging or parrying. Even regular soldiers pose more of a threat here, chipping away at your own health and occasionally rallying to perform unit-wide actions such as charges and arrow volleys. There’s a genuinely rewarding sense of challenge – a series’ first.</p>

<p>There’s also a surprising amount of depth. In past instalments it took maybe one or two battles to get the gist of how the entire game would play out whereas Origins continues to introduce new gameplay concepts throughout. For example, players can mix and match a growing list of Battle Arts and Tactics unlocked during the campaign alongside new mounts and items while also levelling up their weapon proficiency. Omega Force has even changed what players do off the battlefield. Instead of advancing to the next battle via a campaign menu, you are free to explore a vast world map, populated with shops, quest givers, collectables, and smaller side mission skirmishes.</p>
<p>It’s quite the visual spectacle, too. Character models may not have the uncanny lifelike detail of colossal budget AAA games, but they’re the best we’ve seen in a Musou game, some of them, including core cast members like Cao Cao and Liu Bei, ageing and changing appearance throughout the course of the campaign. Even the regular rank and file troops have received a facelift – impressive, when you consider how many of them are on-screen at any time. That said, the game’s performance remains silky smooth even during the most hectic of action set pieces.</p>

		<p>As we head into the top five of our Most Wanted games for 2025, we return to the oeuvre of Hideo Kojima with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>.</p>
<p>As one of the most popular video game auteurs out there, Kojima has kept himself incredibly busy in recent years. After the success of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/01/death-stranding-review-ps4-pro/">Death Stranding in 2019</a>, the game gathering up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/12/31/game-of-the-year-2019-overall-winner/">a multitude of Game of the Year awards</a> and enjoying continued success with its PC port and eventual expanded <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/23/death-stranding-directors-cut-review-is-it-an-essential-upgrade-for-ps5/">Director’s Cut</a> over the following years, a sequel was always highly likely. However, Kojima has also been working on a game titled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/08/hideo-kojimas-xbox-exclusive-od-seems-to-be-about-scared-floating-heads/">OD for Xbox</a>, and at the start of 2024, also confirmed that he will be creating <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/31/hideo-kojima-is-making-a-new-action-espionage-game-after-death-stranding-2/">a new action-espionage game with Sony</a>.</p>
<p>But the plate that he and the team at Kojima Productions will stop spinning first is Death Stranding 2: On The Beach – announced in 2022 and with big gameplay reveals coming last year ahead of a 2025 release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Death Stranding 2 NEW Trailer 4K (2025) PS5 Pro" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aRvuCmbrjAU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>While the first game was already oddly prescient, the themes running through it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/13/death-stranding-pc-review/">working surprisingly well in the context of the pandemic and lockdowns</a> that rolled around the world in the years following its release, Kojima threw out his narrative for Death Stranding 2 and started over to better reflect the effects of COVID-19 on the worldwide population.</p>

<p>Death Stranding 2 will take place outside of North America, as Sam and the DHV Magellan look to expand the Chiral Network, doing so with the backing of a private organization known as APAC. Sam, of course, will take the lead and trudge across vast landscapes, ride on futuristic vehicles and all the rest while trying to deliver packages, through increasingly exotic and alien landscapes, and confronting all sorts of monstrosities, such as a giant inky black hand that feels like something out of a Soulslike.</p>

<p>There will be a lot of returning characters and actors for Death Stranding 2, with Norman Reedus reprising the role of Sam Bridges, and Léa Seydoux and Troy Baker reprising their roles as Fragile and Higgs. There’s also plenty of new stars joining the cast, including Elle Fanning as Tomorrow, and Shioli Kutsuna as Rainy.</p>
<p>The most recent trailer was a huge <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/29/check-out-20-minutes-from-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">20-minute video from Tokyo Game Show 2024</a>, revealing a lot about Tomorrow, who was born and grew up in the world of the dead, and Rainy, another part of the DHV Magellan crew who’s pregnant. They also have a little sing-song with Sam and Dollman (Fatih Akin), which is as bizarre and surreal as it sounds – and obviously completely in keeping with all the other craziness that has been revealed through the narrative-heavy cutscenes released so far in trailers.</p>
<p>A new photo mode will feature in Death Stranding 2 called ‘Photo Shoot Event’, which has the characters all pose and prance around for a photo shoot, playing with plushy toys of the white grubs, model some nice jackets and dance on vehicles from the game. It’s a huge shift from the typical photo mode that is found in games, with the scenes rendering and moving in real time while you snap pictures, instead of meticulously posing character models, facial expressions, lighting, and all the rest.</p>

<p>So yeah, Death Stranding 2. It looks as wild and as out of the norm as the original in every way possible, from a story that jumps down the rabbit hole, to continuing the practically unique style and tone of its gameplay, and even more of the atypical asides to enjoy in the moments between.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/31/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-revealed-coming-out-in-2025/">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is set to release for PlayStation 5 in 2025</a>.</p>

            <p>Since the start of 2025, three studio closures along with multiple layoffs have been reported across the industry.</p>
<p>Studios closing down include Toadman Interactive, which developed titles such as  third-person shooter Immortal: Unchained and Hero Defense game Bloodsports TV. The studio also offered support on games including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-online">The Lord of the Rings Online</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mechwarrior-5-mercenaries">MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking on Toadman's closure, parent company Enad Global 7 <a href="https://www.enadglobal7.com/press-releases/enad-global-7-initiates-a-wind-down-of-the-operations-in-toadman/">wrote</a>: "This decision does not come lightly and follows several initiatives to turn the subsidiary profitable, including the cost-saving measures executed last year. Ongoing Work-for-Hire (WFH) contracts with Daybreak and Cold Iron will be protected in this process, this means that a complete closure of activities will be optimized to fulfill the contract’s deliverables.</p>
<p>"This will have an immediate effect on all employees not engaged in these contracts."</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition, Enad Global 7 announced 38 employees at its Piranha Games studio will be laid off. These layoffs come after the most recent game in the studio's Mechwarrior series "performed below expectations".</p>
<p>"The team at Piranha truly delivered a high-quality game that exceeded both internal as well as external expectations in terms of quality, story and gameplay," said <a href="https://www.enadglobal7.com/press-releases/eg7-undertakes-business-optimization-at-one-of-its-studios/">Enad Global 7's CEO Ji Ham</a>. "Despite the phenomenal work by the team at Piranha, the game failed to reach new audiences and expand its core audience as anticipated and therefore has not met the necessary sales targets, which has forced us to undertake necessary actions."</p><p>As well as Toadman, Robocraft 2 developer Freejam has closed its doors. As reported by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/robocraft-2-canceled-freejam-shuts-down">Tech Raptor</a>, the developer wrote on its discord server that it will now be sunsetting games such as Robocraft 2 and its predecessor, as well as cardboard survival game CardLife. This will be happening "over the coming weeks".</p>
<p>The third studio to reportedly have closed its doors is Counterplay Games, the developer behind PlayStation 5 launch title, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/godfall">Godfall</a>. It was revealed the studio was "disbanded" last month, after it had worked with Jackalyptic Games on a project. "Unfortunately we were unable to continue our partnership into the new year and CPG was disbanded," a Jackalyptic Games employee wrote in a LinkedIn post (thanks, <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2025/01/10/ps5-launch-exclusive-godfall-dev-counterplay-games-disbanded/">PlayStation LifeStyle</a>).</p>

<p>These closures and layoffs follow last week's news that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splash-damage-cancels-transformers-reactivate-says-roles-at-risk-of-redundancy">Splash Damage had ceased development of Transformers: Reactivate</a>, and that it'll be "scaling down" the studio as result of the game's cancellation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League developer Rocksteady also recently suffered another round of layoffs</a>, this time just before the end of 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-players-are-risking-account-bans-to-mod-the-game-even-after-season-1-clampdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> players are risking having their accounts banned by continuing to use mods even after a clampdown with the release of Season 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since Marvel Rivals’ hugely successful December launch players have used mods to create custom skins despite concern over account bans. Popular mods include turning Iron Man into Vegeta from Dragon Ball and Mantis into a goth. There’s even a mod that turns Jeff the Land Shark into Pochita from Chainsaw Man.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, alongside the launch of the Fantastic Four and Season 1, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-1-update-appears-to-have-disabled-mods-much-to-the-dismay-of-fans-of-custom-skins">Marvel Rivals added a secret mod restriction in the form of asset hash checking</a>. At the time, developer NetEase told IGN that the game’s terms and conditions prohibit mods as well as cheats, bots, hacks, or any other unauthorized third-party software. NetEase had already warned Marvel Rivals players that using mods might cause problems, and reinforced that message in a statement to IGN: "It is not recommended to modify any game files, as doing so carries the risk of getting banned."</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However, it seems some are undeterred. A workaround was discovered and is now widely circulating online and, while it involves more steps than previously, is manageable for most PC players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Modder Prafit, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/1162" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">who uploaded their workaround to Nexus Mods</a>, issued a warning to players: “Use at your own risk,” Prafit said in the description of the mod.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“By using this you are actually circumventing a system that was created to stop us from modding on the Season 1 patch start. No-one knows if NetEase will ban you, but they have never issued permabans as far as we know.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, new mods have sprung up that take advantage of the addition of Fantastic Four characters. For example, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/1132" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ercuallo's mod turns Mister Fantastic into Luffy from the manga One Piece</a>. According to stats from Nexus Mods, this Luffy mod has already been downloaded over 5,000 times in the two days since launch.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Modding Marvel Rivals lives on but it needs extra steps to pull off <a href="https://t.co/VEeiiHyxiA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/VEeiiHyxiA</a></p>— Marvel Rivals - Leaks &amp; Info (@RivalsLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1878415626923860151?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The question Marvel Rivals modders and those who continue to use them is whether NetEase will actually ban players, as it’s threatened to. The community has yet to unearth an example of a player who has been banned for using mods, but workarounds may spark further action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why would NetEase want to ban mods? Apart from the potential lost revenue associated with the sale of skins and potential intellectual property concern, mods may affect the balance of gameplay or even the performance of the game itself. Indeed, modder Prafit said that their temporary workaround should only be used by those with a “beefy” PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, check out the Marvel Rivals <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-confirms-nerfs-and-buffs-coming-with-season-1-balance-changes"><u>Season 1 patch notes</u></a>, and official stats that reveal <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-hero-stats-reveal-pick-and-win-rates-in-quickplay-and-competitive-modes"><u>Marvel Rivals' pick and win rates</u></a> in Quickplay and Competitive modes for Season 0.

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Developer Direct Might Be Bigger Than Microsoft Suggested, According to Jez Corden]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-might-be-bigger-than-microsoft-suggested-according-to-jez-corden/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-developer-direct-might-be-bigger-than-microsoft-suggested-according-to-jez-corden.1080561/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-might-be-bigger-than-microsoft-suggested-according-to-jez-corden/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We're now exactly ten days away from the recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23-featuring-doom-south-of-midnight-and-a-surprise-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Xbox Developer Direct, the yearly January virtual event where Microsoft shares new details and footage on some of its upcoming first-party games.</p>
<p>As always, Microsoft outlined most of the lineup beforehand. We know the hotly anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> prequel by id Software will be there, for example. We might even get a release window, as there's a solid chance that the first-person shooter powered by the latest version of the id Tech engine will be launched in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>The new intellectual property from Canadian studio Compulsion Games (Contrast, We Happy Few) will be there, too. <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-rumored-to-launch-in-march-2025-following-tga-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight</a> is an action/adventure game where players will step into a Southern Gothic fantasy setting heavily based on Southern American folklore. As Hazel, a young heroine who can weave magic for traversal and combat, players must confront various mythical creatures to protect her loved ones and repair the tears in the so-called Grand Tapestry. The game's use of stop-motion animation certainly makes it look very unique.</p>
<p>This year's Xbox Developer Direct will also include a third-party game: <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-reactive-turn-based-rpg-was-easily-one-of-the-most-impressive-reveals-of-xgs-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur Expedition 33</a>. It's not the first time (last year, the show included Square Enix's Visions of Mana), and we're not complaining anyway as the game looks very interesting, both in its story premise (all those of a certain age, in this case 33, are at risk of dying because of the mysterious Painter) and in its real-time elements to spruce up the regular turn-based JRPG combat. The game will be included with the Game Pass subscription service at launch, so it makes sense for Xbox to show it off there.</p>
<p>But the most intriguing tidbit is that Microsoft promised to also have fans virtually visit a 'surprise location' to see another studio's 'brand new game'. Since then, fans have been wildly speculating about what it could be, and now Windows Central's Jez Corden <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jezcorden.com/post/3lfeu6ablnk2i" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> he thinks the Xbox Developer Direct will be 'much bigger' than Microsoft has so far let on. The only way for that to happen is for this mystery game to be a really big one.</p>
<p>However, it doesn't seem like it could be coming from an internal Xbox studio. Most of them are already busy with known projects, except perhaps Double Fine, whose latest game is 2021's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/psychonauts-2-mindblowing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Psychonauts 2</a>. Their titles rarely qualify as 'really big,' though.
