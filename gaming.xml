  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Speaking as a veteran insomniac who routinely has to operate across time zones, let me share a few of my top tips for staying awake when you really want to sleep. Firstly, fill your eyes with as much light as possible - moonlight, fridgelight, phonelight, flamingoilbarrelight - and your lungs with as much bracing outdoors air as they can take. Secondly, enlist a similarly restless friend for some mutual tickling. Thirdly, remember your failures. All of them. Fourthly, consume a carefully calibrated mixture of fresh fruit and coffee, then look up dad jokes on Reddit.</p>
<p>It doesn't feel like any of these proven strategies will work in Sleep Awake, the new first-person "psychedelic" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game from former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spec-ops-the-line">Spec Ops: The Line</a> director and designer Cory Davis and his team at Eyes Out. Nobody wants to tickle you here, going by the trailer. Nobody has any dad jokes to share. They just want to beat you to a bloody sludge with pipes.</p><!--more-->
<p>Sleep Awake takes place in a city called the Crush, the last known city on Earth. Humanity faces extinction thanks to a mysterious force that disappears people when they fall asleep. Such civilisation as remains consists largely of addled cultists, would-be messiahs and assorted lairy randos, all battling desperately to keep their eyes open.</p>
<p>The game's levels are strewn with various means of prolonging wakefulness, from that old classic the bed of nails, to dubious brain-modifying technology that resembles the Pilot's throne in Alien. You will creep around, corner to corner, solving puzzles and straying into a parallel dimensions that may or may not be hallucinations. There's music from Robin Finck of Nine Inch Nails. They're pretty loud, aren't they? Good choice of rock pedigree for this setup. Imagine if they'd hired Simon &amp; Garfunkel. There'd be no humans left after 30 minutes.</p><p>Sleep Awake now has a release date - December 2nd - announced during last night's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/galaxies-autumn-25-showcase-how-to-watch">Galaxies Showcase</a> of indie malarkey. Perfect. A decent remove from the Xmas hols, but still close enough to cast a shadow over Santa's strained, unblinking face. You can find a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446540/SLEEP_AWAKE/">Steam</a>. Or you can read Oisin's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sleep-awake-a-visually-inviting-horror-game-from-the-dev-behind-spec-ops-the-line-has-a-demo-out-now">slightly mixed impressions</a> of that demo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Developer emptyvessel has released an extended gameplay video of its upcoming 4v4v4v4 cyberpunk first person shooter DEFECT. In the game, you choose to play as a member of one of a number of factions including The System’s Police Force, Rogue Police, or a member of different gangs as each group attempts to complete its own objectives while sabotaging and defeating the others.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEFECT | Extended Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O0d9sqm5LX0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In this extended gameplay trailer for DEFECT, we open with the load in screen for The System’s police force where players vote on the objective to pursue and prepare their loadouts for the starting phase, though you can pick up and find other weapons in the matches too. The police’s mission here is to infiltrate Nodrog’s territory, whose voice can be heard taunting the force. During the footage you see switches to surveillance camera views, and this is how Nodrog is following the police’s moves. These cameras can be hacked to provide additional tactical advantages.</p>
<p>Players will have a variety of tools at their disposal like drones and scanners to scout out areas, and a tool called a Body Snatch. With Body Snatch, players can subdue enemies and then transfer a downed teammate’s consciousness into that body. In the video, we see this play out with a gang member being taken down and then joining the police due to their mind being taken over. There are also health stations dotted around maps, but they only have three charges and are usually in dangerous areas. Health does not regenerate so finding and defending these points is also a crucial element of matches in DEFECT. The final objective in this video is to reboot the building’s operating system, but emptyvessel has stated final objectives differ and can change depending on what is happening in matches.</p>

<p>This video just looks at DEFECT’s multiplayer PvP mode, though emptyvessel has confirmed it is also working on single player and co-op content for the game. A release date is yet to be confirmed for the game, with PC currently confirmed as the only platform with Steam Deck compatibility in the works.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There’s something about handheld gaming that just seems to fit with tactical games. Nintendo in particular, have regularly married the two, with series like Fire Emblem forming part of the bedrock of their handheld gaming lineup for many years. So, while Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch is out for all the major platforms, it’s a natural for the Nintendo Switch, fusing Fire Emblem-esque strategy and storytelling with Roguelike progression.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d9ScyPnAxU0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That said, Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch doesn’t make the best first impression on Nintendo Switch (by way of Switch 2’s compatibility layer), and a big part of that is in-game visuals. I initially started playing the game in handheld mode, and while the character artwork is detailed and characterful, the in-game visuals seemed very basic indeed. It looks better when you play docked, but it’s still pretty rough around the edges. It’s a testament to the quality of the gameplay that you’ll find yourself drawn into the tactical action, despite this, and the longer I spent with the game, the less I noticed.</p>


<p>There’s definitely a strong flavour of Fire Emblem in every gulp of Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch. You move your team of characters around a grid, facing off against a slew of different enemies, and if you want to be successful, you have to consider positioning, weaponry types, weaknesses and individual strengths.</p>


<p>While Fire Emblem has a straightforward weapon triangle of strengths and weaknesses to consider, Veil of the Witch takes this a step further with weapons and armour types with paired affinities. That means that heavy armour is weak to axes, leather armour is weak to swords, and cloth armour is weak to spears and bows. Besides that, some larger creatures will have different weaknesses depending on their positioning, and you’ll pour a lot of thought into where you’re going to send your team.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, there’s melee, ranged and magical attacks and support spells, as well as unique moves for each character. For all of these traditional trappings, the roguelike progression, and multiple runs into this fantasy world really do bring a newfound sense of freshness to the tactical action. Part of that comes down to decisions.</p>
<p>Every time your characters level up, you’re given two possible upgrades to equip them with, so you have to decide between better defence and improved attack, or enhanced movement and increased critical hit chance. Each run, there’s a chance to build them differently, and having that extra sword to spin makes Veil of the Witch consistently compelling.</p>

<p>Alongside levelling up, there’s further choices to be made following each battle. Here you can choose your route through the world, with an indication of the type of reward you’ll gain for heading in that direction,</p>
<p>Despite the repeated trips through the game world, there’s a story to be told, with Sable, the titular Eidolon, using your crew to further her own shadowy motives, bringing you back from the dead over and over again. While Veil of the Witch is often a little worthy, and there’s a lot of thou, thee and verily in the dialogue, you start to find the characters quietly endearing, learning more about them as you progress, often via one-to-one conversations back at your base.</p>
<p>Once again, that brings the Fire Emblem comparisons come even closer, but the feel and tone of Veil of the Witch is fundamentally very different from Intelligent Systems’ iconic franchise, and it absolutely stands as its own thing. It draws you in far more effectively than you might be expecting, and if you’re looking for a tactical RPG that is a little more respectful of your time, Veil of the Witch fits the bill perfectly.</p>

<p>Runs probably do run longer than you’d expect for the Roguelite genre. You’ll find battlefields that you thought you were finishing up suddenly beset by reinforcements, or small skirmishes where enemy fighters are repeatedly resurrected. These extend your time in certain battles, slowing your progress, especially when you’re facing an almost inevitable death. Equally, there’s as much challenge and depth to each encounter as you’ll find in the best of the genre, and there’s plenty of variation to the way that battles play out, with different conditions changing things up. Overall, I’d rather have the thoughtful, engaging strategy, rather than it becoming a frantic jog through multiple encounters.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>'s battle against the bot farmers continues with a series of backend updates from EA. Amongst other things, the developers have reversed some "unintended" changes to XP progression and balance, and removed bots from "verified" modes available through the Portal editor.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Last week, the developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-is-getting-updates-to-speed-up-xp-progression-and-unlocks-as-ea-tackle-plague-of-bot-farmers">announced</a> that they were taking action against players who'd created matches simply to murder computer-controlled soldiers en masse for easy XP. The argument being that Battlefield 6's servers are filling up with XP factories, making it harder for players to find the weird and wonderful mode variations that Portal is supposed to be for. 
</p>
<p>
As ever, the counterargument is that there might be fewer bot-processing joints and more flights of Battle-whimsy in Portal if the game's progression system were less annoying. I didn't find it particularly annoying during my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-review">pre-release time with multiplayer</a>, but then again, I'm not very competitive-minded and was in no hurry to unlock any of those fancy scopes. Too busy lying on my back, enjoying the deep blue sky over Gibraltar (while bleeding out).
</p>
<p>
I neglected to note in the previous story that Battlefield Studios have a more straightforward monetary interest, of course, in stopping people short-circuiting the XP system. Battlefield 6 is a live service game with a forthcoming battle pass and options to pay for XP and tier skips. It's harder to sell those special editions and Double XP boosters if people can accelerate the grind on custom servers.
</p><p>
Here's an update on their attempts to remedy the situation from Battlefield's social accounts. "We have organized a series of changes to emphasize our commitment to highlighting the player community and making this a space where you can celebrate creativity, find unique experiences, play with friends, and build communities.
</p>
<p>
"As part of this effort, we've rolled out several backend updates to support healthier matchmaking and better overall experiences in Portal. This includes resolving unintended systems that affected XP progression and balance across experiences, and for now, removing bots from Verified Experiences to help improve the overall quality of matches."
</p>
<p>
Verified experiences are a more curated and grounded selection of Portal modes that mostly let you twiddle with the settings of Breakthrough, Conquest, and Rush. Unlike other custom modes, these modes award full XP, so you can see why EA would be keen to do away with botfarming in verified experiences.
</p>
<p>
EA have now introduced a change whereby you'll need to disable "bot backfill" if you want full XP gain in a verified mode. Any verified experiences that have bot backfill will need to be unpublished and republished with the change. 
</p>
<p>
"Servers, including persistent ones, may occasionally need to be restarted," the developers add. "These brief interruptions may continue until ongoing improvements are fully implemented."
</p>
<p>
The first season of Battlefield 6's live seasonal seasonings begins on 28th October. It introduces a new map, some extra guns, a new mode, and a paid battle pass for those who partake.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rockbeasts-is-a-band-management-sim-that-brings-back-the-mtv-era-%E2%80%93-with-fish-bassists-and-iggy-pop.1333771/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sometimes, you have to immediately talk about a game trailer you’ve seen. This is one of those times. During the Galaxies Steam Fest showcase, Team17 dropped a brand new announcement and reveal trailer for Rockbeasts, a band management sim, that looks to take the spirit of Bojack Horseman and Adult Swim and apply it to the world of MTV-era music management. It looks utterly brilliant, so, first things first, go have a look at it.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROCKBEASTS | Gameplay Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DV4ULIZ6qyw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The immediate thing we obviously have to talk about is the cast of creatures. Fish bassists, deer guitarists, ostrich front-animals, and rabbit drummers adorn the artwork for the game, and their look gives you an impression of the irreverent take the team are going for. There’s lots of rock-centric attitude, plenty of drama, and some rhythm-action in there too, which has put it right to the top of my radar.</p>
<p>Coming from Polish two-man team Lichtund, the game aims to chart the highs and lows of being in a band, working your way through dive bars and tiny venues through to headlining your own stadium tour. That’s a very dry and basic task though, and you have to cope with ego-stroking, spoiled brats and a lot of sticky venues.</p>
<p>Key Features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Manage Resources Managing Time (turn-based game)</li>
<li>Do Quests and Side Quests</li>
<li>Level up and get sweet gear</li>
<li>Customize your band and instruments</li>
<li>Plan and play Concerts (what songs you’ll play, what gear you’ll use (from smoke machines to disco balls, we’ve got it all), and even how the band will look on stage)</li>
<li>Unlock New Songs (a full soundtrack recorded in a studio and performed by the voice actors)</li>
<li>Experience branching narratives across 17 episodes where your choices make a difference</li>
<li>No two playthroughs are the same!</li>
</ul>
<p>This awesome-looking dark comedy has been written by acclaimed video game writer Jakub Szamałek (Senior writer on The Witcher 3, Principal Writer of Cyberpunk 2077, and the upcoming The Blood of Dawnwalker). It’s also fully voiced and features some very recognisable voices, including the iconic Iggy Pop.</p>
<p>It’s available to wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1445880/ROCKBEASTS/?hsCtaAttrib=210178644193">Steam</a>, PlayStation and Xbox right now, with Nintendo Switch listings coming soon!</p>

<p>Now, the company is back at it again. In a new announcement, <a href="https://stability.ai/news/stability-ai-and-ea-partner-to-reimagine-game-development?utm_source=x&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=SAI+x+EA+">Stability AI</a> (of which acclaimed movie creator James Cameron is part of its board of directors) has confirmed that it has entered into a new partnership with EA to "co-develop transformative generative AI models, tools, and workflows that empower EA’s artists, designers, and developers to reimagine how games are made".</p><div><figure data-videoid="r2Zh6lJRTak" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2Zh6lJRTak?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r2Zh6lJRTak?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2Zh6lJRTak?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed62bd51lokygn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>As part of the announcement, Stability AI said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"EA and Stability AI are both trailblazers in their respective fields. For more than 40 years, EA has led through technological shifts across interactive entertainment, redefining what is possible for its global community of players.</p>
<p>"With the launch of Stable Diffusion, the most widely used image model in history, Stability AI transformed how visual media is created and put generative AI in the hands of millions of creators. This partnership combines EA’s leadership in interactive entertainment with Stability AI’s unparalleled technical expertise in generative AI.</p>
<p>"Together, we’re opening new creative frontiers that will shape how EA designs, builds, and brings experiences to players around the world."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, over on EA's website, the company states that with "humans at the center of storytelling, we’re evolving how we work so that AI becomes a trusted ally". It stresses that AI will primarily accelerate workflows, enable faster iterations, and expand creative possibilities – whatever that means.</p>
<p>In an effort to potentially lessen the backlash that this news will inevitably generate (chortle!), EA said that AI "can draft, generate, and analyze, but it can’t imagine, empathize, or dream", and that it is up to the human mind to drive true creativity.</p>
<p>Even so, we can't imagine this announcement will go down too well with many folks. The company is well known for its sports games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA SPORTS FC 26</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden NFL 26</a>, but has also helped produce intriguing adventure titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tales_of_kenzera_zau">Tales of Kenzera: ZAU</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Is Doing Better in Japan Thanks to Growing Importance of PC, Phil Spencer Says]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-doing-better-japan/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-is-doing-better-in-japan-thanks-to-growing-importance-of-pc-phil-spencer-says.1333765/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Although the perception of Xbox is at an all-time low, the brand is doing better in Japan, a region that is notoriously one of the worst for Microsoft's video gaming division</p>



<p>Speaking with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55776">Japanese publication Famitsu</a> during the recent Beyond the Strand event celebrating Kojima Productions' 10th anniversary, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer commented on Xbox's performance in Japan.</p>



<p>In the past year, the total playtime across the entire ecosystem has increased by around 20%. Although no exact figure has been confirmed, Spencer specified that the playtime growth is balanced between console, PC, and cloud. However, much of this total playtime increase is due to the increasing importance of the PC market in Japan.</p>



<p>To further boost Xbox's market share in Japan, Microsoft is planning to provide more content for Japanese players. Spencer confirmed that the publisher is currently talking with different partners while it is continuing to maintain a close relationship with Japanese developers like CAPCOM, Square Enix, SEGA, Bandai Namco Entertainment and Konami.</p>



<p>Speaking about the company's future in terms of hardware, Phil Spencer reiterated once again to Famitsu that <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">a new Xbox console is coming</a>, though he offered no additional details. However, the recent release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally</a> provides an indication of the company's strategy, which aims to connect multiple devices under the Xbox platform.</p>



<p>Xbox's renewed focus on the Japanese market is no surprise. The company is attempting to cater more to the region's audience by setting the next entry in one of its hallmark franchises, <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/">Forza Horizon 6</a>, in Japan and publishing games developed by Japanese studios, such as the highly anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, which ended the series' long hiatus. Hopefully, the attention on the Japanese market will bring back other Japanese franchises that have been left dormant for a while.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>'s true ending didn't feel totally slam dunk satisfying to me in its 1.0 release form, and developers Supergiant Games seem to have agreed with those sorts of assessments. Hence, in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>'s first proper post-launch patch they've just put out as a Steam preview, some "true ending enhancements" being rolled out like a boon from a sassy god.</p>
<p>Shameless plug alert, if you want to read my full thoughts on that 1.0 version, you can read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-10-review">this here review</a>. The short version is that it's good.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anyway, enough of that, let's dive into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/505090299391902119?l=english">the notes</a> for this post-launch first patch preview. "The Patch 1 Preview represents a work-in-progress whose contents may evolve, and some text translations are still in progress," Supergiant wrote. "We do not have a release date for the full patch."</p>
<p>In terms of their true ending tweaks, the studio say they've added some extra events with key characters you'll run into both before and after completing Melinoë's task. Bits of the ending scenes before the credits roll have also been "revised", while one change I can't say I'm necessarily a fan of is that the number of times you'll need to clear the underworld run before getting the final ending has gone up. On one hand, it'll ensure you get more chances to see these new scenes, but on the other, I fear it might feel a bit like padding in a game that's already treading a thin line in that regard towards the end.</p><p>Alongside those ending tweaks, Supergiant have added in a cauldron incantation which lets you go back in time and replay previous story beats, which is handy since it means I won't have to start from scratch to take in the revamped finale. "A number of character-related Prophecies, including the one connected to the story epilogue, should unfold faster than before," reads another of the patch's headline changes, while the decor you can buy for the crossroads now costs less spirit kudos points. Phew, no more lofty rug prices.</p>
<p>In terms of the usual bug fixes and balance adjustments, only one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nocturnal">Nocturnal</a> Arms has had an aspect tweaked, that being the Witch's Staff's ability to burn folks when imbued with Hestia's smoulder ring cast boon. The boon and blessing specific tweaks are more numerous and a few bosses have had their hitboxes and effects adjusted.</p>
<p>There's more in the full notes, and if you want to give this preview a go, Supergiant have included instructions on how to opt into its Steam beta after backing up your saves.</p>

		<p>For Fallout Day, Bethesda Game Studios brought some updates on the Fallout franchise and mark some of the milestones that the series has passed. In particular, to celebrate its 10th anniversary, the company announced: Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition will arrive on 10th November (and 2026 for Switch 2!), and there’s a physical 15th anniversary bundle for Fallout New Vegas on the way as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tWVT9eYOPas?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Similar to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/19/skyrim-anniversary-edition-ps5-free-upgrade-xbox-series-x-s-pc-ps4/">Skyrim: Anniversary Edition from 2021</a>,&nbsp;<strong><em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em></strong> bundles the game and all its official add-ons together with over 150 mods of Creation Club content, looking to create a curated ultimate collaboration between the original developers and the community.</p>
<p>Creations are coming to Fallout 4 broadly through the new in-game Creations menu, which will make it easier to discover and download more mods as well.</p>
<p>The Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Xbox One, PS4, and PC this year, with a Switch 2 release set for 2026. There will also be an Anniversary Upgrade for existing platforms, and Game Pass and PS Plus subscribers will also have upgrade options.</p>

<p>Another anniversary is being celebrated for Fallout: New Vegas, which is turning 15 this year. There’s no new port of the game (sadly), but Bethesda has created a new physical Fallout: New Vegas 15th Anniversary Bundle, which is probably already out of stock on the Bethesda Gear Store.</p>
<p>The bundle includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fallout: New Vegas: Ultimate Edition PC Code</strong></li>
<li><strong>Victor Statue (8″ PVC):</strong> The friendly Securitron stands tall and is ready to roll</li>
<li><strong>Doc Mitchell’s Evaluation Cards (8×8 cardstock set):</strong> Straight from your first moments in Goodsprings, a true piece of New Vegas history</li>
<li><strong>Vault Boy Enamel Pin (1.5″):</strong> Vault Boy stacks the odds with poker chips in hand</li>
<li><strong>Mojave Express Patch (3.5″ × 1.9″):</strong> Woven, iron-on, and full of wasteland charm</li>
<li><strong>NCR Recon Patch (3.25″ × 3.5″):</strong> Woven, iron-on insignia of the New California Republic’s finest</li>
<li><strong>Collector’s Big Box:</strong> A throwback-style display box created exclusively for the anniversary</li>
</ul>
<p>And then there’s Fallout 76, with more details on the Burning Springs update which will arrive on 2nd December, and introduce a new region in Ohio where you’ll battle the Rust King and desert Deathclaws.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout 76: Burning Springs Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJ_SER3SwSQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In good news for this game, native PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions are on the way for next year.</p>
<p>And finally, Fallout Shelter is getting new updates in the form of Seasons:</p>
<p>“Inspired by Vault-Tec’s experiments, Seasons introduces limited-time Vaults to the game that are completely separate from your original Vault. Each Season will have a unique theme, bringing new challenges and rewards as players hit different milestones.”</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a> has finally come to Xbox and it's also been added to Game Pass, available to those who sub to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, or PC Game Pass. In addition, Xbox players can also check out the Whispers in the Woods expansion which also launched today.</p>
<p>The base game, which itself is a lovely and mysterious roadtrip well-worth playing, is available for those with Game Pass, though the Whispers in the Woods expansion must be bought separately for £12.49 / €14.99 / $14.99. You'll also be able to buy that for PS5 and PC, which each recieved the base game back in February, 2024.</p>
<p>The expansion got a release date trailer last night <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-in-the-jam-packed-autumn-edition-of-the-galaxies-showcase">during the Galaxies Showcase</a>, which you can watch yourself below.

In our annual round-up, the game was described as such by editor Chris Tapsell: "One of this year's most unique games, but also one that seems to tap right into the zeitgeist: weird physics, gallows humour, masochistism, and a requirement to press on regardless."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">Game Pass recently received a price hike</a>, as well as a change to the tiers of subscriptions themselves, all while Xbox recorded record subscription revenue.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-za-sells-5-8-million-units-debut-week/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-sells-5-8-million-units-in-debut-week.1333738/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, The Pokémon Company has announced that the latest installment in the monster-catching series, Pokémon Legends: Z-A, has sold 5.8 million units in its debut week, with Nintendo confirming that around half of those sales were on the Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>While still a very good sales performance, it lags a bit behind compared to the first Pokémon Legends, Arceus, which launched in early 2022 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-sales-reach-6-5-million-holds-1-position-in-uk-boxed-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 6.5 million units in its first week on the market</a>.</p>



<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-urban-renewal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently posted Wccftech's review of the game</a>, penned by Nathan Birch, who rated the game 8.5 out of 10. Here's a summary of his time with this new Pokémon Legends:</p>



<p><em>The Pokémon Legends: Z-A campaign is a bit lighter than some other entries in the series, as you'll be able to complete the story in around 20 hours if you're really galloping toward the finish line. Of course, you could easily spend two to three times that (or more) if you really want to Catch 'em All and tie up everything the game has to offer. As is usually the case with this franchise, you get out of this Poké Ball what you put into it.</em></p>



<p><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the most cohesive, thoughtfully-constructed Pokémon RPG of the HD era. Some may miss the more expansive world of something like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but this game's top-notch new combat mechanics, solid gameplay loop, and refreshing level of polish makes it fairly easy to overlook its compact map. Pokémon Legends: Z-A feels like a great new foundation to build on and I'm excited to see how the series evolves next.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/defect-immersive-squad-based-cyberpunk-shooter-impressive-gameplay/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/defect-an-immersive-squad-based-cyberpunk-shooter-gets-first-impressive-gameplay.1333735/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>During the Galaxies Gaming Showcase, independent studio emptyvessel has unveiled the first gameplay footage of its debut title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/immersive-shooter-defect-announced-by-emptyvessel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEFECT</a>. </p>



<p>The team, <a href="https://wccftech.com/aaa-gaming-veterans-found-two-new-studios-called-giant-skull-and-emptyvessel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founded by two former id Software developers</a>, provided an impressive demonstration of this immersive squad-based cyberpunk-themed first-person shooter game. According to emptyvessel, DEFECT is set in a futuristic, divided city where players battle it out in a world ruled by an enigmatic AI known as 'THE SYSTEM', while ruthless gangs and rogue law enforcement vie for supremacy. Players will choose from a selection of dangerous factions, including THE SYSTEM's own policing force, rogue police elements, and gangs vying for power. They will compete to achieve objectives such as smuggling guns, assassinating or kidnapping targets (including players), or arresting suspects. </p>



<p>Every mission in DEFECT is said to be different, whether you’re acting as the law, the lawless, or somewhere in between. Your choices determine how you play the game with friends in single-player, PvP, or co-op multiplayer modes. Squads of four players compete to complete multiple open-ended objectives and acquire valuable items and enhancements that can turn the tide of battle. The inevitable chaos means that no firefight ever ends the same way twice.</p>



<p>The game doesn't feature automatically regenerating health, unlike most recent shooters, so players must find health stations to heal themselves if they’re going to stay in the fight. These health stations generally have three charges. As seen in the trailer, DEFECT features extensive environmental destructibility, including multiple layers of destruction on each wall and item, and features such as dynamic dust that fills the room the more you destroy. This can be used strategically to reduce visibility in a space if you have equipment such as tactical goggles or to escape a dangerous situation quickly. Environmental interaction also includes players being able to flip tables and similar stuff to create cover and/or block paths.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>emptyvessel founder and game director Emanuel Palalic said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Our entire emptyvessel team is incredibly excited to show off this first look at gameplay in DEFECT as we’ve poured a ton of passion and time into crafting the game’s tone, atmosphere, and underlying systems. DEFECT is a HUD-less immersive shooter where any wall can be destroyed, gadgets and tools completely redefine how you approach combat, and every weapon or ammo type affects the world, interactables, and enemies in unique ways. The world is filled with emergent moments and dynamic branching narratives that react to player actions in real time.</em></p>



<p>Earlier this year, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/empty-vessel-closes-its-series-a-funding-for-defect-with-11-million-total-raised-single-player-support-and-console-launch-added-to-development-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered the news</a> that emptyvessel had raised $11 million in Series A funding <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-invests-in-defect-indie-developer-empty-vessel-to-help-get-defect-over-the-finish-line/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from NCSOFT</a>, 1AM Gaming, and Black Phoenix Games, to finish the game and add single player mode and console launches. However, it seems like DEFECT is currently only available for wishlisting on PC stores, like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2470010/DEFECT/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/defect-dde0e6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/defect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GOG</a>. Those store pages actually provide interesting information, including the game's system requirements (which we added below) and the confirmation that it will come with a level editor and LAN multiplayer co-op/PvP support. DEFECT does not have a release window yet.</p>

			<p>During yesterday's Galaxies Gaming Showcase, French developer Tactical Adventures announced the early access release window for Solasta II. The sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/solasta-crown-of-the-magister-tactics-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2021's turn-based tactical role-playing game</a> will be available on PC in early 2026 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2975950/Solasta_II/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>, though details such as pricing and the estimated early access period haven't been shared yet. The studio had <a href="https://wccftech.com/solasta-ii-announced-powered-by-unreal-engine-5-early-access-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally planned to launch this year</a>, but there has been a small delay.</p>



<p>Unlike the first game, which was powered by Unity, Solasta II features much better visuals thanks to the switch to Unreal Engine 5. You can still get a taste of that in the two-hour demo available on Steam. The downside to the engine change is that it likely won't be as moddable; the previous installment featured a level editor that brought forth a wealth of user-generated content, such as whole new adventures for players to enjoy.</p>



<p>In this sequel, which is still based on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons SRD 5.1 ruleset, players will embark on a quest driven by family legacy to the faraway continent of Neokos, where the ancient and enigmatic Shadwyn (voiced by Amelia Tyler, the narrator of Baldur's Gate 3) is corrupting the land. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>According to Tactical Adventures, Solasta II stays true to its promise of delivering gameplay based on the world's most popular tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG): Dungeons and Dragons. But that's not all that Solasta II will have to offer. This new instalment will also allow players to roam freely across the lands of Neokos, exploring and uncovering the map as they wish. </p>



<p>The studio has promised to show off the new in-game overworld map for traveling between areas and answer fans' questions in a special Community Stream that will air on Tuesday, October 28, at 10 AM Pacific Time (1 PM Eastern Time, 6 PM CET) via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TacticalAdventures/streams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/tacticaladventures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch</a>.</p>

<p>"A brand new, original story-led adventure"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Bluey, the popular Australian animation for children, is <a href="https://www.bluey.tv/blog/blueys-quest-for-the-gold-pen-video-game-arrives-december/">getting a new video game</a> on the Switch and Switch 2 in 2026.</p>
<p>It's officially titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/blueys-quest-for-the-gold-pen">Bluey's Quest for the Gold Pen</a> and is an "original story-led adventure game" by the show's creator Joe Brumm. Halfbrick – the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psvita/fruit_ninja">Fruit Ninja</a> studio based in Bluey's hometown of Brisbane – will be bringing this title to Nintendo platforms and other systems in partnership with PM Studios.</p>
<p>This new game, "inspired by the hand-drawn worlds of the Dragon and Escape episodes" invites players to unlock Bluey's drawings, which are brought to real life by the Heeler family. It blends "heartfelt storytelling with discovery-driven gameplay".</p>
<p>All up, there'll be nine adventure-filled levels to work through - from snowy mountains, golden beaches, to lush green forests and even the Aussie outback. Along the way, players can uncover treasures, solve puzzles, and embark on magical mini quests as they "glide, fly, and skate" through the world.</p>
<p>The initial launch for Apple devices is taking place this December, with the console and PC release to follow next year.</p>

<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is already off to an impressive start for sales, as Nintendo Japan reports it has sold almost 6 million copies in its first week.</p>



<p>As the latest in the franchise, Pokémon Legends: Z-A furthers Arceus’ open-air combat and brings it to Lumiose City. Sprawling with Pokémon of all regions and generations, the style and fun of past titles are on full display. Reviews for the title have been great, ranking among the best in the franchise. Plus, with Scarlet and Violet’s okay reception, Legends: Z-A has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-preview-the-new-battle-system-could-become-the-new-standard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a breath of fresh air</a> for all. Luckily, the sales are proof enough, with Nintendo Japan confirming its insane worldwide sales total for its launch week.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/PostImages/pokemon_pressreleases_20251023_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release from Nintendo Japan</a>, the company revealed that Pokémon Legends: Z-A, in its first week, has sold over 5.8 million copies worldwide. This does make the title one of the best-selling Nintendo Switch 2 games yet, which is an impressive feat. Given Mario Kart World, from stats from June 30th, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-sales-nearly-match-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 5.6 million</a> in its launch month, Pokémon is off to an incredible start. Furthermore, the press release claims that almost half of the sold copies were played on a Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>Seeing as Pokémon is one of Nintendo’s biggest franchises, it isn’t too surprising to see it launch with high sales. However, it’s still great for it to get almost 6 million in just the launch week. Furthermore, should the numbers get bigger, it can easily eclipse Pokémon Legends: Arceus, which sold 14.8 million within two months of its release in 2023. Overall, it seems Pokémon is here to stay, and fans wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>

<p>Here's the full rundown of the Patch 1 preview, and when we find out about a Switch 2 and Switch release, we'll share an update.</p>
<h3>Hades II - Post-Launch Patch 1 Preview</h3>
<div><p>In addition to various bug fixes and some balance changes, this patch contains...</p><p>

• <strong>True Ending Enhancements</strong>: Added new events in the lead-up to the True Ending, and some after. As part of this, increased the number of Underworld clears required, and added to and revised parts of the main True Ending scenes before the end credits. <em>Note: The vast majority of changes are to the Underworld route; the Surface route is mostly unchanged.</em></p><p>

• <strong>Returning to a Real Possibility</strong>: Added Cauldron incantation lets you return to an earlier point in the story in case you wish to re-experience key events, such as the True Ending.</p><p>

• <strong>Fated Prophecy Adjustments</strong>: A number of character-related Prophecies, including the one connected to the story epilogue, should unfold faster than before.</p><p>

• <strong>Crossroads Renewal</strong>: Many decorative items have reduced costs in Kudos compared to before. Any excess Kudos you have already spent will be refunded.</p><p>

<p>If you haven't already checked out our review of Hades 2, here's a quick sample. On Switch 2, we gave the game an excellent nine out of ten. We also shared our impressions of the title on the original Switch version.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Supergiant Games is five-for-five with Hades II, a huge, triumphant sequel that manages to diverge mechanically and offer more challenges and variety than its predecessor. It helps that it’s nearly faultless on Switch 2 in particular."</p>

However, Glick says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmVgzNasYjI">in a lengthy new video</a> that he will likely step away from in-person events because of harassment from fans.</p> <p>The pro player says he’s had to deal with fans groping him during pictures and pushing boundaries like touching him without consent. He says this meant leaving this year’s Worlds tournament early because he wasn’t able to watch the event in peace after he’d been eliminated and that the stress he feels from these events has now started to outweigh his enjoyment of competing in the tournaments themselves.</p>

 <p>Glick also says he wants to be there primarily to compete, but the fan interactions have begun overtaking his private time at the shows and even, in some cases, prevented him from getting to the matches on time.</p>  <p>Beyond that, Glick says that he doesn’t want to make a video for this year’s Worlds tournament because it would make him “relive” the event and all the bad memories he has associated with it. For now, he’ll be taking time off from in-person events, which could affect whether or not he qualifies for 2026’s World Championship.</p>

 <p>“Even if I do qualify for the World Championships this year, it is very likely that I will not attend,” Glick says in the video. “It’s gonna depend on how the rest of the season and how the rest of these events go. But what I will say is that I do not want to have another Worlds like the one I just had. I would rather not attend than take the risk because I think that if I don’t attend Worlds there’s a chance I could come back in the future. I think if I have one more Worlds like this one, I don’t think I’m coming back.”</p>

 <p>Glick says that these “parasocial” interactions have been both a problem in-person and online. The pro claims that while he isn’t above criticism, the “vitriol” from some has become so prevalent that he’s not comfortable interacting with fans or critics online, and that the unwanted attention has included sexual harassment in online messages too.</p>

 <p>“I guess what I’m trying to say is that I feel like I’ve become more of a symbol and less of a person,” he continues. “There is a lot of responsibility and I’m very privileged to be in that position, but at the same time, I would like to be a person. Sometimes I would like to be Wolfe and not WolfeyVGC.”</p>

 <p>For now, Glick will be taking social media breaks, doing fewer videos, and even playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> in solitude rather than on stream. He signs off the video saying that he still wants to create content about competitive <em>Pokémon</em>, but that he’ll have to take time to reevaluate his approach after these “dehumanizing” experiences. But he isn’t fully walking away and says he still wants to make changes to improve his relationship with the competitive <em>Pokémon</em> space.</p>

 <p>“I always figured that if I stopped competing it would be because competition stopped being fun for me; like I lost the love of the game or maybe I wasn’t able to keep up with a new guard and it was really hard for me to never win. […] The thing I’ll say about this that is positive is that I’m still having fun. I still love competing and I’m still having a blast. If I could just do the competition part of tournaments and not everything else, that would be great for me. […] Because it’s still fun for me, I have motivation to try and fix things.”</p> <div dir="auto" data-qa="virtual-list-item" role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1761270211.861699" tabindex="0" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1761270211.861699"> <p>He says he’s still looking into arranging meet-and-greets where fans can chat with him in-person, but isn’t yet sure what form those will take moving forward.</p> </div> <p>“I wish that I could do more,” Glick says. “I wish there was more of me to give. I really have tried for so hard for so many years to be the person people see me as, as this symbol, as this kind of unshakable bastion in the scene, but I am only human, and I think pretending that I’m not is not doing me or you any favors.”</p>

<p>So many games nowadays come loaded with DLC, or at least plans for some other paid content drop in the future, but when it comes to the upcoming Switch 2 release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, you'll be getting the full package on release.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the latest Nintendo Direct broadcast, the game's director Masahiro Sakurai mentioned how the Kirby Air Riders team isn't currently planning on any DLC, and "everything is here". Additionally, he's not planning to turn this into an "ongoing series".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Just so you know: We're not planning any DLC. Everything is here...I've thrown everything I have into this game from the start. So I hope you don't miss this opportunity."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So, no DLC is in the pipeline, and don't expect this racing entry to necessarily transform into an ongoing series or anything similar. Of course, there will be some additional physical content in the form of a new amiibo line, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/three-more-kirby-air-riders-amiibo-have-been-announced">multiple figures already announced</a>.</p>

This new change will still see Neutron Capture being one of the best (if not the best) damage scalars in the game, but the power level will be much more in line with our expectations. Additionally, since all damage from the Gun is converted into Radiation, it should have more scaling vectors for clever build crafters, and allow for meaningful boosts from Gun Damage.</p><h3>Cosmic Brilliance - Passive</h3><ul><li>Flux Generator + Annihilation interaction updated so spawned grenades now scale correctly with character level</li></ul><h3>Amon the Forgeknight</h3><ul><li>Shield visuals adjusted for improved clarity in combat situations</li></ul><h3>Trait - Forgeskill</h3><ul><li>Adjusted interaction with Forge Master class mod so Forgeskill now respects its cooldown in multiplayer</li></ul><h3>Onslaughter - Calamity</h3><ul><li>Camera behavior stabilized when combining Onslaughter with Order Legendary Pistol Noisy Cricket</li><li>Attack frequency of Rocket Punch is now consistent in multiplayer</li></ul><h3>Balance Adjustments</h3><ul><li>Seeing Red Duration restored no longer increases per point invested, and is now 4 seconds for all ranks.</li></ul><p>Dev Note: Seeing Red was always meant to have huge damage scaling potential, but was always meant to be hard to maintain. We didn't want to nerf this passive's power, but we're making the effect harder to maintain.</p><h3>Scourge - Vengeance</h3><ul><li>Scorched Kairos passive now displays consistent magazine size values for the Ordnance gadget</li><li>The Forgewave no longer fires unintentionally during Glacial Rapture</li><li>Projectiles no longer get stuck in the air when Forgemaster Firewall is active during the Fortress Indomita boss fight</li><li>Blackout Shock Damage now properly scales with points invested</li><li>Blackout is now 15% per point, down from 21% per point</li></ul><p>Dev Note: After fixing the scaling of the DoT (damage over time), we found that Blackout was overperforming a bit, so we gave it a slight re-adjustment.

We still want this skill to be effective, but it should not be able to scale infinitely. We’ll be monitoring Melee builds after this change to make sure they are meeting expectations, and will further adjust if necessary. This ultimately had to be fixed so we can establish a baseline before we investigate further buffs/changes.</p><h3>UI &amp; UX &amp; Text</h3><ul><li>Sorting settings in menus now persist when switching tabs or leaving the menu</li><li>“Toggle Junk” behavior has been corrected to target the desired item in Bank menus and Backpack</li><li>Weapon wheel no longer sticks when opened near Guns vending machines</li><li>Combat Radar now features a dedicated Legendary Loot Indicator, making high-value drops easier to spot in the heat of combat</li><li>Press/Hold input now cancels correctly without triggering unintended actions</li><li>“Apply Settings” prompt only appears when changes are made</li><li>[PS5 and Xbox] Splitscreen updates, including number text scaling, Equipment/Backpack improvements, scrollbar behaviors, Party list layout, and “Flip Card” functionality</li><li>Restored Fullscreen resolution controls and switching behavior</li><li>Weekly Activities now populate after campaign completion</li><li>Maurice's Black Market Vending Machine timer updates to show correct cooldown</li><li>Firmware 3-Piece bonuses (Ahoy, Oscar Mike, Daed-dy O’) now show cooldown icons; Deadeye Tier-3 stacks now appear in the passive bar</li><li>Boss Bar spacing corrected when Combat Radar is active</li><li>Transfer Machine naming has been standardized across the game</li><li>Travel notification now displays the initiating player’s name</li><li>ECHO Location path remains readable over time; made improvements to pathfinding</li><li>Updated various UI visuals and icons for alignment, consistency, and clarity</li><li>Updated localization and various text descriptions across the game</li><li>Standardized/updated terminology across gear, menus, customization, and manufacturers</li></ul><h3>Visuals</h3><ul><li>Updated various character and NPC animations</li><li>Corrected various reported instances of VFX not rendering correctly</li><li>Grapple Vault points now show proper models instead of placeholders</li><li>Reduced reported instances of visual pops at cinematic starts</li></ul><h3>Audio</h3><ul><li>Audio and VO now remain active when returning to menus after level traveling in multiplayer</li><li>Adjusted audio mix for improved balance across gameplay and VO</li><li>SFX volume slider now correctly applies to high HDR-value sounds</li><li>Addressed several reported instances of VO not playing as intended across multiple missions and scenarios</li><li>Vault Hunter battle voiceover frequency has been tuned so lines repeat less often</li><li>Missing pain reaction audio restored for several named NPCs</li><li>Improved various subtitle timing and text</li><li>Background music now continues as expected during the Idolator Sol boss fight</li><li>Unique audio cue restored for Phosphene (shiny) gear spawns</li></ul><h3>Settings &amp; Accessibility</h3><ul><li>Personal Cross-play settings can now be adjusted immediately after switching Party Privacy from Local Only to Public in Session Settings</li><li>Air Dash is now fully usable on controller when Toggle Crouch is set to Off under Accessibility → Gameplay</li><li>Individual graphics options now reset properly after making changes and then selecting Run Auto-Detect in Options</li><li>[PS5 and Xbox] Field of View resets consistently to Default on consoles without showing mismatched values</li></ul><h3>Player Experience</h3><ul><li>Improvements to stability</li><li>We are continuing to investigate and will make further improvements to stability and performance.</li><li>Addressed multiple reported issues across multiplayer, missions, menus, and engine systems.</li><li>Improved matchmaking and session stability.</li><li>Addressed performance in multiplayer when there were large numbers of homing projectiles</li><li>Refined graphics settings and shader handling</li><li>Improvements made to patch reliability and automation processes</li><li>Ocean could occasionally fail to load</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>[Epic] Rich Presence now displays correctly in non-English languages on Epic</li><li>[PS5] Friend list now loads properly after logging out and back in during patch checks on the title screen</li><li>Joystick input now behaves consistently when lowering deadzones</li><li>[PS5 and Xbox] SHiFT account linking verification codes now auto-copy and apply correctly on console</li></ul><h2>Weekly Activities:</h2><p>Weekly Big Encore Boss has switched to a tougher variant of a different existing boss with an even more rewarding loot pool for those that take it on.</p><ul><li>The Battle Wagon</li></ul><p>The Weekly Wildcard Mission has changed.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Avalon Hill has announced two new board games at Essen Spiel 2025. The iconic board game developer stated that their next two projects will include a strategic experience created by award-winning designers, as well as a new expansion for the iconic <em>HeroQuest</em>.</p>

<h2>The Avalon Hill Essen Spiel 2025 Announcements</h2>

<p>As part of the first day of the iconic board game convention, Avalon Hill announced two new board games: <em>Market Fresh</em>, and <em>HeroQuest Wizards of Morcar</em>.</p>

Players gain points for every crate they add, and score higher for every crate they stack. However, space will run out as competition intensifies, so who can hold out the longest? The game was created by award-winning German designers Michael Kiesling (<em>Azul</em>, <em>Vikings</em>) and Wolfgang Kramer (<em>Take 5</em>, <em>Coliseum</em>).</p>

<p><em>Market Fresh</em> will be available in January 2026 at local game stores. It will be sold at an MSRP of $44.99.</p>

<p>The second game, <em>HeroQuest Wizards of Morcar</em>, is an updated version of the 1991 original quest pack. At its core, it is the same fantasy story. A dark alliance of wizards has come together to do Zargon's dark bidding. What is he after? The power of 1,000 Dread sorcerers locked away in the High Alter of the Northern Dread Wastes.</p>

For if Zargon gets a hold of this power, he will be unstoppable. The expansion will include 5 quests based on the original story, alongside 5 new quests. The box will include 27 detailed miniatures, 64 game cards, and a cardboard tile sheet. You will need <em>HeroQuest Game System</em> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hero-quest-first-light-review-your-favorite-ttrpgs-favorite-gateway-ttrpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>HeroQuest First Light</em></a> to play this expansion.</p>

<p><em>HeroQuest Wizards of Morcar</em> is available for pre-order right now. It is currently available at an MSRP of $49.99.</p>

She warns that this <em>won’t</em> be something you’ll want to play every day, but she’s still making it real.</p><p>She’s calling her kit <a href="https://buildaboy.co/">the Build A Boy</a>, and she says the completely pre-soldered version should truly be “drop in and play.” It’s her custom-designed board with everything you should need beyond the bricks, including:</p><div><ul><li><span>an actual harvested Game Boy Pocket CPU</span></li><li><span>a 2.7-inch 320 x 320 display</span></li><li><span>working switches you can place behind your Lego buttons and D-pad for actual controls</span></li><li><span>a speaker and a volume wheel</span></li><li><span>a rechargeable battery</span></li><li><span>a USB-C port to charge it</span></li></ul></div><p>Natalie confirms to <em>The Verge</em> that she’s planning to offer an optional glass lens if you hate the plastic window that Lego uses to cover the screen — and she might even offer some sort of <em>video output</em> so you can play on a TV or other external screen, though it’s not guaranteed. She’s not sure how she’ll make video out happen yet, though. “It could even be potentially be over Wi-Fi if that doesn’t affect performance,” she tells me.</p><p>While the original Game Boy offered a 160 x 144 10:9 aspect ratio display, Natalie says the 320 x 320 one will simply upscale the original images by 2x while keeping their relative shape and size the same.</p><p>Natalie doesn’t plan to wire up a Link Cable port for multiplayer play — “I don’t personally care for the link port,” she tells me — but says she’ll “probably” leave a pinout so modders can add their own.</p><p>As far as harvesting the chips goes, Natalie says she’s managed to buy damaged Game Boy Pockets in bulk, as they’re the “unloved sibling” of the Game Boy family, but she doubts she’ll have enough to satisfy demand. If you have a donor Game Boy Pocket yourself, she’ll also sell a version that only requires the CPU and RAM for around $60. She’ll also sell a completely DIY version for the “soldering iron pros” out there. She’ll also still release files for free.</p><p>It’s not clear what the entire drop-in kit will cost yet, given Trump’s tariffs. “I am aiming for $99 USD but y’know how the world is at the moment,” she writes. She’s hoping to start selling them in early 2026, and says she should receive the first test boards this very week.</p><p>Natalie’s kit won’t be the only way to play a Lego Game Boy for real. For example, tap the video below!</p><p>While it’s quite a feat to shrink an entire actual working Game Boy down to the size of a Game Boy cartridge, others are coming close — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/18/24159721/retrohai-nintendo-ds-lite-game-boy-color-advance-sp-mods">modder Hairo Satoh</a> has been showing off <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DP-5jNhk3BO/">an excellent Game Boy Color version on Instagram</a> that uses real cartridges, though he tells me it required a lot of modification to the Lego “shell” and he’s not sure he’ll release a kit himself. Generally, Satoh sells one-offs on commission.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805376/lego-game-boy-brickboy-emulator-kickstarter">the rival BrickBoy kit</a> might be the easiest and most sustainable way to power a Lego Game Boy yet. It plays ROMs on an emulator, not actual cartridges on actual chips, which defeats some of the fun for me — but at least no Game Boy Pockets will be harmed in the making of that kit. We’re still waiting to share how much it’ll cost; it’ll launch on Kickstarter on October 28th.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/805673/nintendos-chips-make-this-lego-game-boy-upgrade-kit-the-most-authentic]]></content:encoded>
