                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-4/">The Witcher 4</a> is still a long way from players getting their hands on it, but CD Projekt Red's team still wants fans to know that the lessons learned in the previous games will be reflected in the sequel. Narrative director Philipp Weber--who was previously the quest director for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-next-gen-update-review-winds-howlin/1900-6416135/" data-ref-id="1900-6416135">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>--recently said that The Witcher 4's quests will embrace the example set by its predecessor. Among other things, that means Ciri won't have to worry about meaningless fetch quests.</p><p>"We don't do fetch quests," Webber told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4s-narrative-lead-is-holding-onto-some-of-his-earliest-witcher-3-feedback-for-the-rpgs-sequel-we-dont-do-fetch-quests/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, before <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-is-learning-lessons-from-cdprs-past-no-fetch-quests-an-eye-on-cyberpunk-2077s-fan-favorite-characters-and-devs-who-care-about-the-art-were-making/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">expanding upon the reasons</a> for that decision.</p>

<p>"A quest has to be something interesting," said Weber. "I have to feel, as a player, that if I played that quest, my time was well spent and not just spent. I was busy doing stuff, and didn't think about work or taxes. I experienced a story, or something else that was worth it. That basic rule is still there 100%."</p><p>Weber went on to explain that CDPR's core philosophy is "to let people care about what they're doing," and that edict remains in place for The Witcher 4. He also stressed that the lessons learned from The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 will be reflected in the way The Witcher 4 unfolds its narrative through quests and side missions.</p><p>An early look at The Witcher 4 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-the-witcher-4-footage-looks-ridiculously-good-on-ps5-but-theres-a-caveat/1100-6532024/" data-ref-id="1100-6532024">shared during State of Unreal</a> in June. But as impressive as that was, CDPR later explained that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-wasnt-actually-the-game-says-cd-projekt-red/1100-6532043/" data-ref-id="1100-6532043">a tech demo set in The Witcher 4</a> rather than the actual game. The dev team has also noted that the upcoming game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-why-the-witcher-4-is-being-developed-with-a-console-first-approach/1100-6532445/" data-ref-id="1100-6532445">being developed with a console-first approach</a>.</p><p>CD Projekt Red hasn't set a date for The Witcher 4 yet, and it's possible that it may not be ready for release until the next console generation.</p>

<p>Prime Gaming is available for Amazon Prime subscribers, offering free PC games each month and more. More details can be found on the <a href="https://primegaming.blog/prime-gaming-july-content-update-boxes-lost-fragments-paquerette-down-the-bunburrows-and-more-8d359820a1b9">Prime Gaming blog</a>.</p>
<p>As for the games themselves, a personal favourite of mine, Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered arrived back in February of last year. On its release, we awarded the game four stars while acknowledging some of its dated qualities.</p>
<p>"I still love this collection, because it's carefully made and lovingly updated, but also awkward, elbowy, frustrating and prone to leaving me stuck. It's a collection that understands that Tomb Raider was absolutely a game about its controls, and it still should be - even if it doesn't quite know how to deliver on that," Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-review">Eurogamer's Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered review</a>.</p>
<p>Donlan was similarly taken with Toem on its release. "Playful challenges and a warm sense of place and character converge in this cheerful modern classic," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toem-review-a-photography-puzzler-and-a-journey-filled-with-lovely-moments">Eurogamer's glowing Toem review</a>.</p>
<p>Another highlight from this batch of games is Venba. "Food and family converge in this beautiful slice-of-life tale," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/venba-review-tasty-puzzles-and-a-recipe-book">Eurogamer's Venba review</a>, which also boasts four stars.</p>

<p>Nintendo's new hybrid lands some exclusive tweaks this time around, with the ver. 1.4.0 patch adjusting some visual blurriness that would crop up in Docked mode, and the vibration intensity in the Pro Controller 2.</p>
<p>That's not to say that the Switch 1 edition has been left out, mind you, with both versions of the game landing new area challenges, materials, recipes and more.</p>
<p>The full patch notes were shared on the <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/patchnote/ver_1_4_0/">Fantasy Life i website</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below. As we mentioned, some of the adjustments are for Switch 2 only (and some are unique to Steam), but we have highlighted these where appropriate in the following rundown:</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amd-fsr-4-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-ps5-pro-in-2026-big-chunks-of-rdna-5-are-being-designed-through-engineering-partnership-with-sony.1233759/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It has been confirmed that AMD FSR 4, in its complete implementation, will be available to PS5 Pro developers starting next year. This isn't surprising, considering that Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-confirmed-to-have-been-co-developed-with-sony/">helped</a> AMD develop the algorithm as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/">Project Amethyst.</a></p>



<p>AMD FSR 4 will be available as an upgrade to the existing PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR), which debuted with the PS5 Pro launch in late 2024. In an interview <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/playstation/sonys-mark-cerny-explains-why-your-ps5-pro-is-getting-an-upgrade-in-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Tom's Guide</a>, Sony Lead System Architect Mark Cerny explained:</p>



<p><em>The algorithm they came up with could be implemented on current-generation hardware. So, the co-developed algorithm has already been released by AMD as part of FSR 4 on PC. And we're in the process of implementing it on PS5, and it will release next year on PS5 Pro. It's not a cut-down version of the algorithm. It's the full-fat version of the co-developed super resolution that we'll be releasing on PS5 Pro.</em></p>



<p>Commenting on the ongoing Project Amethyst partnership with AMD, Cerny added:</p>



<p><em>This is not for proprietary technology. This is really trying to move the industry forward. Obviously, we want to use these technologies on our consoles, but these technologies are available to any of AMD's customers freely. Big chunks of RDNA 5, or whatever AMD ends up calling it, are coming out of the engineering I am doing on the project. And again, this is coming out of trying to move things forward. There are no restrictions on the way any of it can be used. AMD is moving extremely quickly. What I'm trying to do is prepare for the next generation of consoles, so my time frame is multi-year here.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, the article shares a comment where both companies hint at an even tighter partnership than during the design of the PlayStation 5 or the PlayStation 5 Pro consoles. </p>



<p>This comes just days after AMD <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-announces-multi-year-deal-with-amd-to-power-next-gen-devices/">announced</a> a multi-year partnership with Microsoft. However, that one seems focused on making various types of Xbox devices, including the upcoming ASUS ROG Xbox Ally handheld. In contrast, the Sony partnership is centered on machine learning powered upscaling advancements.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-use-this-dhv-magellan-trick-to-restore-roads-and-monorails-more-quickly/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Besides completing deliveries and knitting back together a world that a cataclysmic event has torn apart, a big part of the Death Stranding 2: On the Beach experience is to collaborate with other players to build back the infrastructures that have been destroyed by the Death Stranding, and make it easier to complete deliveries and bring the world back together again under the Chiral Network. Doing so, however, can be a very time-consuming endeavor: to bring back roads and monorails, you will have to donate a lot of materials such as Chiral Crystals, Metals, and Ceramics, which can be sometimes hard to get, especially in the quantities required to bring these fundamental infrastructures back. Raiding enemy camps is a good way to collect some resources, but alas, it will still take some time to get everything you need.</p>



<p>There is a way, however, to restore roads and monorails in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach more quickly. To take advantage of this trick, however, you will have to play through the story until you complete <strong>Order 12 and unlock fast travel</strong> via the DHV Magellan. This will allow you to travel quickly to any zone deemed safe, including the cities and shelters you have connected to the Chiral Network in Mexico.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As you likely have noticed at this point in the game, in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, <strong>you can take as much materials as you can carry from any city or shelter</strong>. As you are unlikely to return to Mexico after you are done with the beinning of the game, unless you want to max out the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-what-do-you-get-for-maxing-connection-level/">Connection Level</a>, you can <strong>take the materials at your disposal in each city and shelter in Mexico, load them up on the DHV Magellan and bring them to Australia to put them to good use restoring roads and monorails</strong> without having to deal with a material shortage when crafting weapons and tools, as most of your in-game time is spent in Australia.</p>



<p>The process to put this trick into action is simple. Head into any city or shelter in Mexico, access the main terminal, enter the Fabrication and Management menu, and then pick the Claim Materials option. Select any material you want, load them up on your Floating Carrier or any vehicles you have in the vicinity, then head back into the DHV Magellan and add the Materials to its storage. Fast travel to the location nearest to the road or monorail you want to restore, claim the Materials back, load them up and then head to the infrastucture to donate them.</p>



<p>While this trick somewhat defeats the purpose of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, it's still an excellent way to make one of the most tedious mechanics of the game more bearable. All the Materials you can get from Mexico won't be enough to restore every infrastrure in Australia, but they will provide you with a strong start that will make gathering the remaining materials needed far less time-consuming.</p>

        <p>Out now for testing on Bedrock, with Java to follow</p>

            <p>Copper golems and new types of copper equipment are coming in the next big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a> update, which is available to test now in Minecraft Bedrock and available shortly as a Snapshot for the Java edition. The golems actually date back to Minecraft's 2021 Mob Vote - players cruelly snubbed them in favour of the musical, item-fetching Allay. Classic case of robophobia, if you ask me. What can some fairy jukebox junkie do that a golem can't. Luckily for you nay-sayers, Mojang have seen fit to add the oxidisable automatons to Minecraft anyway, in keeping with the idea that Mob Vote outcomes are more of a guide for development than a rigid prescription.</p><!--more-->
<p>As and when you get access to the update, you'll build golems by planting a jack-o-lantern or carved pumpkin atop a block of copper. This, to my understanding, is how the good Lord created Adam in the Garden of Eden, except that Adam did not immediately start going through the Good Lord's treasure chests within a set range and organising them by item.</p>
<p>A copper golem is, in other words, a housekeeper. It'll ensure that each goodie you craft is stored in the same place. I look forward to the complaints from players who've had to start over because all of their diamond equipment has been industriously shuffled into some random cellar. I also like the idea of these worlds outlasting their creators and becoming a ceaseless hive of Mary Poppinbots. As with other copper items in Mojang's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a>, the golems will corrode over time and develop a charming green patina, though this doesn't affect their operation.</p>
<p>Copper in general will be more useful as of this updating. It's now an equipment tier, whose "durability sits somewhere between stone and iron", according to <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/a-new-friend-with-a-familiar-patina">the official Minecraft website</a>. Apparently, "a copper pickaxe will help you mine a bit faster and for a bit longer than a stone pickaxe but won't allow you to mine any additional materials - you'll still need to upgrade to iron for that." Being already abundant in Minecraft's generated worlds, it's "the perfect early-game material".</p>
<p>In case you have been skulking in a Creeper hole these past 10 years and missed the acquisition, Mojang and Minecraft are currently owned by Microsoft. Microsoft are about to announce another round of mass layoffs, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lstr3pbp3k2x">according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>. If this does come to pass, the irony of it accompanying the addition of a new robot workforce to Minecraft will be <em>just</em> pressing enough to retrospectively justify me mentioning it here. Fingers crossed that Schreier is wrong.</p><hr>
<p><em>Before joining RPS, our news editor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell wrote a book about Minecraft's history in collaboration with Mojang and Microsoft. He's not receiving any royalties or similar on-going payments.</em>

                <p>Barely a month after the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review-its-a-switch-too/1100-6532411/" data-ref-id="1100-6532411">Switch 2</a>, Nintendo is set to release the console's next big game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-preorder-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530595/" data-ref-id="1100-6530595">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, in just a few weeks. It's also the first new game in the franchise since 2014's Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze. Regardless, there's a little too much pent-up excitement for DK's comeback in the new live-action trailer for Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q7ZqqN_KHQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4q7ZqqN_KHQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>YouTube user MikeyOrlando6665 summed it up pretty well in the top comment on the video: "Thank you for telling me this trailer wasn't representative of the gameplay experience. I totally thought I'd have to play DK in front of a large crowd of people chanting DK instead of my usual gameplay experience of sitting alone in my basement in my underwear crying."</p><p>Most of the footage features the game's 3D platforming experience, but it also showcases a side-scrolling sequence that serves as a callback to the original Donkey Kong Country from 1994. Donkey Kong creator Shigeru Miyamoto recently explained <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shigeru-miyamoto-explains-donkey-kongs-new-look/1100-6531714/" data-ref-id="1100-6531714">why Bananza ditched DK's long-standing Donkey Kong Country design</a> in favor of a more contemporary look.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-looks-like-the-mario-odyssey-successor-no-one-expected/1100-6532824/" data-ref-id="1100-6532824">hands-on impression of Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, it was called "the next evolution of [Super Mario Odyssey's] ideas," while noting that it is "full of playful new mechanics and ideas."

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a>'s director has acknowledged the game's controversial nomination for best indie game at The Game Awards 2023, admitting Mintrocket is not an indie studio.</p>
<p>Mintrocket is a subsidiary of South Korean developer and publisher Nexon, but its game was nominated for the Best Independent Game award, ultimately missing out to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in an interview with Japanese site <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/635/G063598/20250627083/">4gamer</a>, director Hwang Jae-ho stated "there's nothing indie about [Dave the Diver]" considering it was made at Nexon.</p>

<p>"I wonder if people mistook us for an indie studio just because we're developing games as a small team, or just because our art styles and game systems tend to be unique," he said (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dave-the-diver-director-addresses-controversial-best-indie-game-nomination-from-2023-theres-nothing-indie-about-us-we-didnt-apply-for-it/">Automaton</a>).

<p>Nominees for The Game Awards are chosen by an international jury of global game media outlets. As Hwang noted, Nexon therefore had nothing to do with the nomination.</p>
<p>Essentially, the media got it wrong, perhaps due to Mintrocket being considered a small team, or due to the pixel art style.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, ahead of the game's release, Nexon vice president <a href="https://www.gametoc.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=69776">Dae-Hwon Kim stated in an interview</a> Dave the Diver isn't an indie game, despite appearances.</p>
<p>Later, The Game Awards producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> confused matters. "Independent can mean different things to different people, and it's sort of a broad term," he said (as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/keighley-weighs-in-on-debate-over-dave-the-diver-qualifying-for-best-indie-game/">VGC</a>). "You can argue, does independent mean the budget of the game, does independent mean where the source of financing was, does it mean the team size? Is it the kind of independent spirit of the game, meaning a smaller game that's sort of different?"</p>
<p>He then deferred to the 120 global media outlets that voted to determine the interpretation. Now, Hwang is finally ending the debate.</p>
<p>Dave the Diver received widespread critical acclaim and is still receiving updates two years after its release. Its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-delays-in-the-jungle-dlc-but-sure-knows-how-to-soften-the-blow-with-these-other-announcements">In The Jungle DLC has been delayed into next year</a>, however, after first being revealed in 2024.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-director-finally-ends-indie-debate-after-controversial-the-game-awards-2023-nomination]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Goblinz Publishing and developer Duper Games has announced that Day of the Shell, a turn based tactical roguelite, will be released on July 29th for PC and consoles. Ahead of the full release, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3082100/Day_of_the_Shell_Prologue/">Day of the Shell: Prologue</a> has been released for free on PC via Steam. You can check out what the gameplay of the game looks like in the trailer below.</p>

<p>Day of the Shell: Prologue contains one world with 13 islands to explore, the revolver and crossbow weapons, 12 relics and nine blessings that can be combined, five enemy types, and seven runes that upgrade the main character’s passive abilities.

<li><em>One Click, One Turn: Tactical choices are made with a single click, making gameplay simple and dynamic while maintaining strategic depth.</em></li>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/craftlings-are-as-absent-minded-as-lemmings-but-theyre-capable-of-much-more/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/craftlings-are-as-absent-minded-as-lemmings-but-they%E2%80%99re-capable-of-much-more.1233717/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you see Craftlings and think “Oh cool! It’s a bit like Lemmings!” then Ariano Games’ work is halfway done. At first glance, this really does look a lot like Lemmings without the bright green hair, but it shouldn’t take long to see that this is a very different style of strategy game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Craftlings Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G5JGBSo_T_8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Craftlings are, similar to the Lemmings that inspired them, about as hapless as they come. They’ll just wander straight forward, only turning around if they encounter a wall they can’t clamber up, or something that clearly tells them to go back the other way. If there’s nothing to stop them, they’ll more than happily march off a cliff or high-up ledge and plummet to their doom… and then another Craftling spawns in.</p>


<p>It’s up to you to guide them, keep them safe and busy, and channel their tireless efforts in a productive direction toward the objective. Instead of just reaching a simple exit portal, you task them with constructing buildings, growing and evolving a village as you look to meet the demands of the level. In the first stage, that’s to build a ballista to fire at a giant octopus that’s clearly one very bad dude.</p>


<p>Building takes resources, and gathering resources requires tools, meaning you need to build up a little supply chain to get things done. You don’t just buy a pickaxe and give it to a Craftling, but instead have to build the Mining Shed that makes them in exchange for wood and coins, a Craftling then automatically grabbing a pickaxe once created and marching straight ahead until they find some rock to smash, before dragging the rock back to town and dropping it wherever it’s needed.</p>
<p>There’s no real thought behind this from the Craftlings, so it’s up to you to create the paths and marshal their efforts. Place ladders if they need to go between different levels, place blockers to just turn them back around – thankfully, you don’t need to sacrifice a Craftling for this most menial of jobs – and conditional arrows that can allow and prohibit certain Craftlings with certain items in hand. In fact, everything’s conditional. Click on the blocker and it’s disabled for a bit; click on the arrow boards and you can change their rules; click on a Craftling and they’ll hop and head back the other way.</p>

<p>It’s a rather satisfying twist on the classic style, but Craftlings promises to go much further. There’s further nuances, like heavy objects needing you to place mechanical lifts to raise and lower them between levels, as they can’t be dragged up and down ladders. Latter levels also introduce combat, which naturally requires you to build a barracks, to equip and train Craftlings to be able to defeat skeleton enemies.</p>
<p>That was one of the main new challenges in the third level that we briefly tried –&nbsp;a new stage that goes beyond the two levels currently found in the public demo. Alas, with time running out and my Craftlings unable to defeat the skeletal menace standing between them and some bricks I needed, I had to get rather creative.</p>
<p>While you need the Craftlings to do a lot of the work, you do still have a good amount of arbitrary god-like control in this strategy game. You place key structures like the material lift, you have magic bubbles and tricks to send a single Craftling up and down between levels, and you also have dynamite to just destroy certain obstacles and items in the world, depositing many items back in your inventory.</p>
<p>And with a mean skeleton in my way, that got me thinking. Could I just delete the ground beneath it? No, Ariano Games has thought of that, but could I tunnel beneath him? And then build out a platform beyond him with a ladder up to where the bricks were? Using blockers and timely clicks to bounce the Craftlings away from danger and back towards town?</p>
<p>Well actually…. yes!</p>

<p>Look, I’m not too proud about breaking the puzzle design –&nbsp;OK, I’m quite proud about it –&nbsp;but it does show that there’s some creative freedom with how you can tackle certain tasks, and that’s part of the magic of sandbox titles and the 90s games that were the source of inspiration for Craftlings. Finding your own path and your own solution is always much more fun than just following the main designed path.</p>
<p>If that’s tickled the nostalgic part of your brain, then make sure to check out Craftlings for yourself. There’s no announced release date, but there is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771110/Craftlings/">a demo available on Steam</a> with two levels from the game, and you can obviously wishlist it to keep tabs on its progress.</p>

It's good news for those who weren't keen on the new landscape orientations – you can now play in TATE Mode!</p>
<p>With the new update applied, all you need to do is head into the options, navigate to 'Layout' and change the playfield to 'Veritcal'. Et voilà! You can now play the game vertically, just like the original arcade classic.</p>

<p>It's pretty funny to us that the update has been applied to all platforms. If you've got a monitor that can easily be turned to a vertical orientation, sure, but we can't imagine folks paying on a giant LG TV having much luck on the likes of the PS4. Still, options and all that.</p>
<p>However you choose to play, Breakout Beyond is a cracking new entry in the long-running series. We gave it an 8/10 in our review and said "Whether you’re an old-school fan or a newcomer, Breakout Beyond may be the best way to experience Atari's stone-cold classic".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rihwox&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Outriders 2 is one of the two games People Can Fly canceled this year, but the game's development was far from completion.</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/outriders-2-cancelled/">report</a> shared online, Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson corroborated a report from TheThumbWars, confirming that what would have been the second entry in the series was indeed the canceled project codenamed Gemini. However, the game development was far from release, as screenshots and footage provided to Insider Gaming confirmed it wasn't near completion. Reportedly, the game was in motion capture stage earlier this year.</p>



<p>Outriders 2 / Project Gemini was confirmed to have been canceled last month by People Can Fly CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski. The development of the game was suspended due to publisher Square Enix failing to present the developer a draft of the subsequent content rider to the Publishing Agreement covering the terms and conditions of further milestones on the project, and the lack of communication regarding its willingness to continue or terminate the development of the project.</p>



<p>Though Outriders 2 and Project Bifrost were cancelled, People Can Fly still has some projects in the works. Besides working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-is-being-co-developed-by-people-can-fly/">Gears of War: E-Day </a>for Microsoft, the studio is also working on a<a href="https://wccftech.com/people-can-fly-reaches-agreement-to-develop-a-new-game-based-on-sonys-ips/"> yet-to-be-announced game based on a Sony IP.</a></p>

        <p>Site founder says these changes would have come regardless of switch in ownership</p>

            <p>Nexus Mods is set to introduce age verification for folks in the UK and EU attempting to gander at NSFW add-ons, as part of incoming changes to how the site handles mods containing adult or "illegal" content.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15319?BH=6">news post</a>, Nexus Mods content team lead SlugGirl outlined that these changes are being made in response to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer">UK’s Online Safety Act</a> and the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en">EU's Digital Services Act</a>, along with guidance being issued by UK regulator Ofcom. Site founder Robin 'Dark0ne' Scott has commented on the post in an effort to reassure users that these policy adjustments aren't a result of Nexus Mods' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-announce-ownership-change-but-the-folks-taking-over-remain-a-bit-mysterious">recent change in ownership</a>, and would have had to happen regardless.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>UK and EU users will need to verify their ages when accessing "the majority of adult content hosted on the site". "The specifics of this are being carefully considered as we want to get this right so that the option to view adult content remains available to adults, whilst fulfilling our legal obligation to ensure children are safe on our website," SlugGirl wrote.</p>
<p>This change won't affect users outside of the UK and EU, however, unless your country passes legislation that requires it.</p>
<p>Nexus say that this and the raft of other tweaks outlined in the post are the result of being given the choice of doing this and getting rid of adult content for UK and EU users entirely. As founder Scott, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-new-owner-is-a-company-whose-co-founder-has-already-had-to-reassure-folks-that-nfts-and-crypto-arent-incoming">recently passed Nexus Mods on to new owners Chosen</a>, put it in his comment: "the law is the law, and Nexus Mods will, and must, follow the law.</p>
<p>"For the people who think this is the fault of the new owners of Nexus Mods," he went on, "please either read the news post above properly or read up on the laws around child safety online that are coming to every major western country either this month, or in the coming year (including most states in the US).</p>
<p>"Whoever owned Nexus Mods, whether it was still me or the new ownership, would have had to have dealt with it this year no matter what. Frankly, I'm relieved that it is not me who has to deal with this or be responsible for the content on the site directly because I have some big misgivings about how it is being enforced. However, if it was me, I would still have followed the letter of the law, and I'd have been doing what is written above. Because I'd have to."</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>sabbath7991/CD Projekt</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for what else is changing, while Nexus Mods makes clear that some the details are "still being worked out behind the scenes", they've outlined a raft of planned revisions for the site's approach to illegal content, categorisation and tags for adult content, together with changes to the block and mute systems.</p>
<p>As far as illegal stuff, the site's Terms of Service'll be updated with a "more detailed definition of what counts as illegal content under UK law and how we protect children from harm whilst on the site". The site will also automatically take down material depicting child sexual abuse, as well as banning uploaders and reporting them to the UK's National Crime Agency.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nexus Mods are introducing revised tags for mods that contain legal adult content, which are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pornographic</li>
<li>Extreme Violence</li>
<li>Harmful substances</li>
<li>Suicide</li>
<li>Self-harm</li>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>Body stigma</li>
<li>Eating disorders</li>
<li>Swearing or Profanity</li>
<li>Sexualised</li>
</ul>
<p>"These tags can be added by our moderators and staff and will be locked in place once added," Nexus Mods explained, "Of course, this does not change the ability mod authors have to tag their mods and users' ability to vote on tags." You'll be able to filter out mods according to these tags if you don't want to see them, just as you currently can with mods tagged adult.</p>
<p>While it's easy to see the logic behind most of these changes, the lack of detail regarding the form of the new age verification and what sorts of personal data it might ask for has left some Nexus Mods users with lingering questions. There's also the matter of the site not having yet outlined in-depth what sorts of mods its new tags will encompass.</p>
<p>The likes of suicide seem pretty self-explanatory, but extreme violence and depression are a bit more vague, as well as being things a lot of the base games you might mod include or depict in some form. Swearing and profanity could also be very complicated to police, given that different words fall under those categories depending on where you are in the world.</p>
<p>"Some of these changes are live already and will be detailed in the next monthly roundup, while others will roll out gradually over the coming weeks and months," SlugGirl wrote to round out the post. "We’ll do our best to make the transition as smooth as possible, but we understand this may cause some disruption."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-are-set-to-introduce-adult-mod-age-verification-for-uk-and-eu-users-soon]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Well, here is something I didn't see coming. Quite out of the blue, Rockstar has released an update for Red Dead Online, which boasts four new adventures.</p>
<p>The update is known as Strange Tales of the West, and those four missions are Strange Tales of The Plague, Strange Tales of Modern Science, Strange Tales of The Bayou and Strange Tales of The Wilderness. This update has really come as a surprise: back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-confirms-end-of-major-red-dead-online-support">Rockstar told fans not to expect any further major updates for Red Dead Online</a>. So, what's this we have here now, Rockstar?</p>
<p>Rockstar has also released a new trailer for Red Dead Online's Strange Tales of the West update, which as noted by <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato">SynthPotato</a>, the last time that happened was several years ago, with Blood Money. You can check out the trailer for Strange Tales of the West below. It's listed as volume one, so perhaps there is even more to come down the line.</p>

<p>Along with Rockstar itself, PlayStation also shared the latest Red Dead Online trailer. "Starting to feel like all this marketing is part of something much bigger for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>," mused social media user <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_">videotechuk_</a>, who also revealed this update comes with a new zombie 'infected' mode.</p>
<p>"It's highly unusual for both Rockstar and PlayStation to come out today to market new Red Dead Online content."</p>
<p>Some are speculating the team is now gearing up for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-next-gen-update-switch-2-port-reports-suggest">that previously rumoured next gen Red Dead Redemption 2 update alongside Switch 2 port</a>. Eurogamer has asked Rockstar for comment on the latest update, and what it all means for the future of the series.</p>

		<p>Unfrozen has released a brand new gameplay trailer for the turn based title Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era, which is the official prequel to the Heroes of Might &amp; Magic games. Originally, the studio was working solely with Ubisoft to develop the game, but yesterday that changed when Unfrozen announced that publisher Hooded Horse has come on board as a publishing partner for Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era. Ubisoft remains the IP holder for Heroes of Might &amp; Magic.</p>
<p><iframe title="Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era - Gameplay Trailer | Fantasy Turn-Based Strategy" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zlVlN7NXF00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>First, let’s start with the gameplay trailer for Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era. As the game is a prequel to the main series it will have story beats and events that have been referenced in other games, as well as have its own stories. In the gameplay trailer, you can see that the combat will remain turn based and take place across vibrant and varying biomes on the continent of Jadame. As the player you will have the option to choose which faction to play as, and make choices that impact the entire continent. The playable factions include Temple (Classic Humans), Necropolis (Undead and Vampires), Sylvan (The Forces of Nature and Fey Folks), Dungeon (Underground Creatures and Dark Elves), and Hive (Demonic Insectoids). Unfrozen has stated that there is another faction that is yet to be revealed.</p>
<p>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era will have a campaign that can be played solo, as well as classic, one hero, and arena modes. In classic mode, players choose their heroes, upgrade their castle and explore the map. One hero mode is a blitz mode with only one hero so when they fall it is all over. Arena mode is all about jumping straight into battle with different enemies. There will also be an in-game editor where players can create and share scenarios. The game is going to be released into Early Access first via Steam, and you can request access for playtests on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105440/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_Olden_Era/">Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era Steam</a> page.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Game-Key Card Street Fighter" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c6c91250da4f4/game-key-card-street-fighter.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has today published the transcript of its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506.pdf">85th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders</a>, in which company president Shuntaro Furukawa was asked to comment on the Switch 2's Game-Key Card releases. Unsurprisingly, he came to the defence of the format. Equally unsurprisingly, we're still not convinced.</p>
<p>As highlighted on BlueSky by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3lsxagrh4tp2j">@oatmealdome</a>, the topic arose from one shareholder's announcement to the Nintendo directors that they have concerns about the Game-Key Card format. "I've seen opinions on the internet saying that Game-Key Cards are unappealing," the investor said, "I'm concerned that if third-party titles using Game-Key Cards don't sell well, it will discourage third parties from supporting the Switch 2".</p>
<p>It's a fair comment, particularly given the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/third-party-launch-games-on-switch-2-reportedly-sold-very-low-numbers">discourse around third-party Switch 2 sales</a> in recent weeks, but Furukawa dodged the issue like a pro. "We introduced the Game-Key Card because game file sizes are larger on the Switch 2 compared to the Switch 1," the company president responded, "We have various ways to distribute games on the Switch 2, and we are working with our third-party partners to ensure their support for our platform".</p>
<p>Let's quickly break that down, shall we? The first section feels like a no-brainer, explaining the very basics of the format, but for all the beefy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighters</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fictions</a>, it turns a blind eye to the smaller titles that definitely could fit on a cart. As for the second section, it all feels very focused on the publisher side of things, doesn't it? As if to say, 'Oh, you don't want a Game-Key Card <em>or</em> an expensive cartridge? Have you considered releasing <em>digitally</em>?'</p>
<p>It has been rumoured for a good few months now that Nintendo is <em><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-new-leak-may-explain-why-so-many-switch-2-physicals-are-game-key-cards">only</a></em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-new-leak-may-explain-why-so-many-switch-2-physicals-are-game-key-cards">offering publishers a Game-Key Card or an expensive 64GB cart</a>. This has yet to be confirmed, and Furukawa was never going to disclose that kind of information in a meeting like this, but it might have been nice to get a little more reassurance about what "working with our third-party partners to ensure their support for our platform" actually entails. Hey, we can dream!</p>
<p>Only time will tell whether Game-Key Card releases actually have all that much effect on sales, but for the time being, prepare to see them sticking around on Switch 2 for a while.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom%E2%80%99s-pc-strategy-is-paying-off-as-steam-revenue-increases-by-over-61-while-playstation-revenue-declines.1233681/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>CAPCOM's focus on the PC market seems to be paying off well, as the Japanese publisher reported a significant increase of its Steam revenue for the previous fiscal year.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-sees-61-surge-in-revenue-from-steam-playstation-revenue-decreases/">Automaton</a> today, the Japanese publisher recently confirmed that their Steam revenue for the April 2024 - March 2025 fiscal year increased by 61.1% over the previous fiscal year, roughly $366 million USD. This accounts for 31% of CAPCOM's total revenue, which includes revenue for other businesses, around 10% increase over the previous fiscal year. Looking at the digital entertainment business alone, Steam revenues account for 42.1% of revenue.</p>



<p>With CAPCOM's Steam revenues increasing, it's no surprise that PlayStation sales have become a smaller part of the publisher's revenue. In the fiscal year ending March 2025, PlayStation sales accounted for less than 10% of the company's total revenues.</p>



<p>CAPCOM's success on the PC market doesn't come as a surprise, especially as the publisher has been focusing more and more on it in the recent past. Earlier this year, Monster Hunter Wilds' PC release marked the first simultaneous multiplatform release for the series, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-was-february-2025s-best-selling-game-in-the-us-more-than-half-of-its-sales-came-from-steam/">more than half of the game's total launch window sales were on Steam</a>. Other games from the publisher, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/">Street Figther 6</a>, continue to be extremely popular on PC as well, suggesting how the publisher is unlikely to change for the foreseeable future, for the joy of PC players who won't have to wait for any console-exclusivity deal to end to be able to play games from the publisher.</p>

            <p>What <em>is</em> an indie game? Is a self-published game an indie game? Is a game with a small team size an indie game? Is it an indie game if it makes you go "oooo, haven't seen that before"? I got a letter this morning that made me feel slightly wistful but with undertones of mercurial optimism. Is the concept of post, therefore, an indie game? Are you ok? You're looking a bit pixelated this morning. Are <em>you</em> an indie game?</p>

<p>Was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dave-the-diver">Dave The Diver</a> an indie game? The 2023 Geoffrey H. Video Game Awards seemed to think so when it nominated the happy management <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> for its 'best independent game' category. "Fie and fuckleberries on that!" came the response. "That's funded by Nexon! They're massive! Also, Nexon's Vice President even said "it may look like an indie, but it’s not necessarily so" in <a href="https://www.gametoc.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=69776">an interview</a>. Case closed, Geoffles!"</p>
<p>The case was not closed. Much online out-loud thinking occurred. Thinkpieces fluttered from the sky like Yuletide's first crisp yellow snow. Then forty five full minutes passed and everyone forgot about it and started arguing about Ebert again.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/635/G063598/20250627083/">4Gamer</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dave-the-diver-director-addresses-controversial-best-indie-game-nomination-from-2023-theres-nothing-indie-about-us-we-didnt-apply-for-it/">Automaton</a>), Mintrocket CEO and Dave The Diver director Jaeho Hwang addressed 2023's hottest much-ado with a firm nope.</p><p>

"We did not intend for it to have an indie game feel" Hwang says, via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/dave-the-diver-director-says-theres-nothing-indie-about-hit-game">NintendoLife</a>. "It's made by Nexon, so there's nothing indie about it".

</p><p>"I wonder if people mistook us for an indie studio just because we’re developing games as a small team," he continued, "or just because our art styles and game systems tend to be unique. For some reason, we also ended up getting nominated for the Best Indie Game award, which caused some people to go, ‘Hey, isn’t that a Nexon game?’, but it’s not like we applied for the award ourselves."</p>
<p>Hwang went on to point out how The Game Awards' nomination system works. Namely, that it's chosen by over 100 international games media outlets (not us, afaik) - devs and publishers can't submit games themselves. These parties aren't made aware of nominated games in advance either, Automaton point out. "Independent is a broad term" host Geoff Keighley said at the time. "It can mean different things to different people". As can <a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472">$250k for a minute of airtime</a>, presumably.</p>
<p>Anyway, my main feeling from back then hasn't changed: Dave The Diver is a great time regardless, and using games as cudgels to police arbitrary categories does them a disservice. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dave-the-diver-gets-godzilla-dlc">It's got Godzilla in it and everything</a>. Phwoar. There's a big lizard if I ever saw one, our Godzilla.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dave-the-diver-director-finally-puts-2023s-silliest-debate-to-rest-no-its-not-an-indie]]></content:encoded>

<p>At the end of the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15319">official post announcing these changes</a>, the Nexus Mods team stated they "are not optional for us. They are part of complying with legislation, and we are committed to keeping our platform safe for everyone."</p>
<p>The previous owner - Dark0ne - hopped into the comments to support the new team in charge in light of these changes. He wrote: "We did not write these laws, we have no control over these laws. Nexus Mods is not an underground website operating on the dark web - it's a legitimate business that has to follow the laws of the countries it operates in. If we don't follow these new laws then we will get fined out of existence (the fine in the UK alone is 10 percent of worldwide revenue or £18m ($25m USD) - whichever is higher)."</p>
<p>Dark0ne continued: "Whoever owned Nexus Mods, whether it was still me or the new ownership, would have had to have dealt with it this year no matter what. Frankly, I'm relieved that it is not me who has to deal with this or be responsible for the content on the site directly because I have some big misgivings about how it is being enforced. However, if it was me, I would still have followed the letter of the law, and I'd have been doing what is written above. Because I'd have to."</p>
<p>Let's take a look at these two pieces of legislation Nexus Mods is citing as the force pushing these changes. The <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0043/">UK's Online Safety Act</a> essentially is an online content moderation bill forcing platforms to take steps to stop kids from seeing adult or illegal content.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer">UK's Department of Science, Innovation, and Technology online safety bill explainer</a>: "The Act will give providers new duties to implement systems and processes to reduce risks their services are used for illegal activity, and to take down illegal content when it does appear."</p>
<p>The UK law places emphasis on protecting kids and the removal of CSAM (child sexual abuse material), "content that amounts to terrorism", assisting-suicide, and equally dire content.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Services_Act">EU's Digital Services Act</a> is focused largely on "illegal content", essentially demanding all large platforms take steps to remove such harmful content or risk hefty fines.</p>
<p>This sort of content was already not allowed on Nexus Mods, but the terms and services are being updated to make the guidelines absolutely clear, so mod creators can understand what's allowed under UK law.</p>
<p>Community reaction to these changes are mixed. Some are coming from a place of understanding, noting Nexus Mods can't really do much about legislation impacting large websites. Others are welcoming the changes, happy the website will be scoured from illegal content and younger audiences will be protected.</p>
<p>There are, however, plenty of people anxious about how age verification will work. A lot of the future changes coming to Nexus Mods are still vague, due in large part to the team still in the process of figuring them out. Age verification <em>is </em>coming, but in what form? Is it going to be a standard "are you 18?" check box, something which would protect Nexus Mods but all kids will just lie through, or will it request some form of evidence to prove one's age?</p>
<p>If it's the latter, how will this data be protected? It's all a messy soupy problem Nexus Mods will have to fix. It's a real optics roadbump for Nexus Mods, given this sweeping change to content moderation and age verification comes only a few weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/end-of-an-era-nexus-mods-has-been-sold-to-an-unknown-party-after-24-years">Nexus Mods changed ownership to growth-focused company Chosen</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/nexus-mods-is-getting-age-verification-for-uk-and-eu-users-weeks-after-changing-owners]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Publishers Krafton have removed multiple senior staff at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> studio Unknown Worlds in a sudden shift that swaps the leadership team for a single head honcho from the studio who made sci-fi horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a>. It's not clear why. At Unknown Worlds, co-founder Charlie Cleveland, CEO Ted Gill, and technical director Max MacGuire have all been "replaced" by Steve Papoutsis, CEO at Striking Distance, the creators of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a>-ish game. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Papoutsis replaces the previous leadership team—Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire—effective immediately," said Krafton in <a href="https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/">a press release</a>. "While Krafton sought to keep the Unknown Worlds’ co-founders and original creators of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> series involved in the game’s development, the company wishes them well on their next endeavors."</p>
<p>Well, that's ominous. Papoutsis, the man being installed by Krafton, was an executive producer on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space-2">Dead Space 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space-3">Dead Space 3</a>. He became a higher-up on Callisto Protocol, the would-be spiritual successor to those spacey horror games, and eventually CEO of the studio, replacing Glen Schofield. I say "would-be" because the game famously ran like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-callisto-protocol-review">a stuttering jelly on an old train</a> when it came out on PC. </p>
<p>"I am thrilled to be taking on this new role within the Krafton family," said Papoutsis, "and to be working alongside the immensely talented team at Unknown Worlds. Player experience is our North Star, and the team is laser-focused on delivering the best possible game for the Subnautica community. We appreciate Ted, Charlie and Max for their past roles in having built this beloved world, and thank the fans for your devotion and patience."</p>
<p>The decision is unexpected to say the least. Subnautica 2 is due to release some time this year into early access, and the studio has been increasingly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-teases-new-creatures-and-co-op-among-the-coral">showing off its subaquatic setting</a> in developer blogs and promising <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-will-have-a-bigger-map-and-a-silent-protagonist-say-devs">a bigger world of wetness</a> than in previous games. Given such proximity to launch, the choice to suddenly boot several senior members of staff, including a founder who has been at the company for 24 years, shortly before the game is set to launch, is pretty wild. </p>
<p>It's not yet clear if other developers have also been laid off, or if this is a limited shake-up resulting from a long-term problem between developer and publisher. But none of it looks reassuring. I've reached out to contacts at Unknown Worlds for comment.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If there's one thing I love doing first thing in the morning, it's launching myself into a festively atrocious trench network, where gasmasks glare from the offal like toppled gargoyles, and sea mines dangle overhead like enormous germ cells. Here be monsters. Here be dropped diary pages. Here be a tormenting combo of "handcrafted" characters and permadeath. Here be, er, minigames.</p>
<p>"A grimdark machine for martyrdom, fed by flesh and devotion," is how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/in-hope-voiden">In Hope Voiden</a> describes itself. In this first-person survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>, you are 12 people in succession, each laden with baggage of one kind or another, each trying to make sense of a rusty hellmouth that marries the grot of World War 1 to the grain of PS1. It's the work of German team Stilbruch Games. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>The retro aesthetics might sound tedious on paper. There are a lot of PS1-style horror games. But this one grabs me both for the density and peculiarity of its setting - is that a stained glass window, deep in the catacombs? - and for the ensemble format. "Each individual has a personal mission, unique traits, and only one life," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3726180/In_Hope_Voiden/">the Steam page</a> goes on. "Every action matters. Every failure lingers. When one life ends, another takes its place. The world remembers. The horror deepens."</p>
<p>Aside from exploring the pasts and motivations of the character in hand, you will also "discover the truth of a place where war broke reality". The blurb writing is perhaps a bit over-the-top in the non-World-War sense, though I absolutely don't have the right to complain about this after penning that line about the germ cells. Hopefully the in-game lore is sparser and subtler. Let those gnashing textures speak for themselves, I say.</p>
<p>You might expect the minigames to be a refreshing distraction from all the misery, a touch of match-3 to cheer you up when you're, I don't know, picking ghost shrapnel from your thighs. Fool! The minigames are all part of the plan! They are the grimdarkest bits of all!</p>
<p>"Lighting a flare. Bandaging a wound. Forcing a door. Enemies don't wait. Your mistakes cost you time. And time costs lives," summarises the Steam page. There also appears to be combat, or at least, there is a brief glimpse in the trailer of somebody firing a gun at something ghastly, but I'm not expecting this to be any kind of shooter. That gun is probably going to fill you with undeserved confidence and get you gnawed and despoiled by mutant trench rats.</p>
<p>Parallel-wise, I guess this is the lumbering, corner-peeking lovechild of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amnesia-the-bunker">Amnesia: The Bunker</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saturnalia">Saturnalia</a>. It has no release date, only the ominous prediction that it is "coming soon".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/explore-a-torrid-trench-dimension-as-12-perma-killable-lost-souls-in-this-amnesia-style-horror-shooter]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A new Horus Heresy book has left Warhammer 40,000 lore fans debating the true nature of the carrion Emperor and the Golden Throne — and the possibility that two classic pieces of early art work may well offer a canon look into the setting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Era of Ruin (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-forced-to-pull-its-own-website-warhammercom-offline-after-scalpers-descended-upon-pre-orders-for-a-special-edition-horus-heresy-book">the special edition of which forced Warhammer.com offline when preorders went online</a>) is an anthology of short stories designed to bookend the Horus Heresy, the galaxy-spanning civil war between loyalist and traitor Space Marines that occurred 10,000 years before the current Warhammer 40,000 setting. The Horus Heresy saw the Emperor finally defeat his Chaos-fueled primarch son, Horus Lupercal, and save the Imperium of Man from destruction, but at a terrible cost: the near-death Master of Mankind was interred upon the Golden Throne as a carrion Emperor sustained by the daily sacrifice of thousands of psykers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The iconic art of the God-Emperor by John Blanche, below, is seared into every Warhammer 40,000 lore fan’s mind. This is how the Emperor looks in the 41st millennium: grim, dark, and barely there at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But is this actually how the Emperor looks in the setting? Era of Ruin’s final short story, The Carrion Lord of the Imperium by Aaron Dembski-Bowden, is also its most interesting. It suggests the image of the God-Emperor we see in John Blanche’s art is just that in the setting: an image.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/01/ow852ulpdo731-1751405677082.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The God-Emperor, by John Blanche. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Towards the end of The Carrion Lord of the Imperium, Diocletian Coros, a Prefect of the Legio Custodesan (the Emperor’s ultra powerful and ultra loyal bodyguard), visits the Emperor at some non-specific time seemingly centuries after the end of the Horus Heresy. It’s here things get spicy:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Through the doors, the secret doors, the one behind those renowned gateways decorated in trappings of glory,” the passage reads. “Past the graven image of the Immortal Emperor: a skull-faced warlock on a mighty throne, eternally alive on the edge of death, imposing in His majesty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Through that final door, which opens only to droplets of a tribune's blood, and whose impenetrable locks take an hour to unseal.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s stop there for a second. Here, The Carrion Lord of the Imperium suggests the image fans have of the Emperor on the Golden Throne, that image informed by John Blanche's art, is the “graven image” described in the book. It is an image in real life, and an image in the Warhammer 40,000 setting. It is propaganda. And not even propaganda for humans, who we’re told haven’t been down this far inside the Palace for generations. It is propaganda for us, the audience, and all but the most special of characters within the setting.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/01/era-of-ruin-1751405846044.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Era of Ruin is packed with fun Warhammer 40,000 lore. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which begs the question: if this image isn’t of the actual Emperor, what does the Emperor actually look like? Let’s continue:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Inside the innermost sanctum, where the architecture of the walls is uncomfortably organic, strangely spinal. Diocletian approaches the Golden Throne, such as it is, and his kindred — naked but for their cloaks, loincloths, and black helms — move aside in his honour.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He ascends the steps. Slowly. Not without reverence, but without the abject worship expected by the people of the Imperium. They would be horrified by its absence; but then, everything about this place would horrify them. It's why they will never be allowed to know of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At long last, Diocletian stands before his king.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He looks past the hanging wires that resemble intestines, and the clicking, ticking life-support engines, and the preservative mist sprayed in the air in nine-second intervals. He looks past the blood bags and vitae-packets linked intravenously to the thing on the throne, which is just a chair compared to the great and grand artworks: a throne without the capital T that makes it both a curse and the salvation of the species.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He looks at the revenant husk of something that was somehow once, somehow still is, a man. Something that shouldn't be alive, and arguably isn't by any mortal measure. Something tortured by its own impossible continuation — physically starved and psychically bloated on the feast of souls it's forced to devour every day of its endless and agonising existence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Or is it forced? Maybe it craves this. Maybe it hungers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s more to this final section of the book, but there’s no need to run through it. We have what we need: the Emperor described here is very different to the Emperor in the John Blanche art ("a throne without the capital T"). We hear of Adeptus Custodes wearing black helms guarding the Emperor, “hanging wires that resemble intestines,” blood bags and preservative mist.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans believe this passage describes a very early piece of Warhammer 40,000 art found within the 1987 Rogue Trader rulebook (the 1st Edition of the Warhammer 40,000 core rulebook). It shows the Emperor in a different light, complete with blood bag, mist, wires that resemble intestines, and those Custodes with the black helms.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/01/rogue-trader-emperor-1751405755038.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Emperor's Palace as depicted in 1987's Rogue Trader rulebook. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s safe to say Warhammer 40,000 lore fans are loving every word of this short story. Not only does it reference two classic depictions of the Emperor — potentially even dragging them both into the canon — but it’s all very grim-dark in the way 40K should be. If this passage means what fans think it means, Era of Ruin makes a 28-year-old piece of Warhammer 40,000 art not only relevant to the setting in 2025, but part of an explosive revelation about the true nature of the Emperor himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, <a href="https://youtu.be/NCOSao1KEQo?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the legendary John Blanche has spoken of this before in interviews</a>, revealing his art was never meant to depict the "real" Emperor, rather it was meant to show an image of the Emperor pilgrims who had made their way to Terra would gaze upon as they arrived at what they thought was the God of Mankind's throne. The "real" Emperor, Blanche believes, is kept in a glass tube behind this facade, connected to all kinds of machinery. And so in turn Warhammer 40,000 fans have been hoodwinked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Library author Dan Abnett, who is behind some of the key Warhammer 40,000 lore and novels, <a href="https://youtu.be/VchkiTUisu8?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has expressed a similar idea in interviews</a>, and even called into question the existence of a throne room at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever Games Workshop’s big plan for the Emperor (some believe he is sort of waking up), what fans can safely say is Era of Ruin offers perhaps the clearest depiction yet of the true nature of the Golden Throne and the carrion Emperor within it. Even better, it brings into the setting classic pieces of early Warhammer 40,000 art, now revived and relevant as Warhammer 40,000 looks even further into the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Games Workshop.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

			<p>A new Stellar Blade patch has gone live today for the PC version of the game, introducing new content and improvements.</p>



<p>The 1.20 patch, which is around 4.9 GB big, introduces seven new arranged tracks based on existing music as a token of appreciation for all the love and support from fans. Additionally, the new patch also unlocks Hard Mode difficulty from the start, which is a very welcome change as Stellar Blade at normal difficulty isn't a particularly challenging game.</p>



<p>Besides introducing new arranged music and unlocking Hard Mode from the start, the new Stellar Blade patch brings a slew of fixes for a variety of issues, such as an issue specific to the "Where is the Fantastic Bait" quest, another related to the NIKKE minigame which made EVE's gun disappear, and a few others. The patch also improves the Expected VRAM display in the graphics options menu, and now shows both current usage and expected maximum usage. You can learn more about the 1.20 patch and what it does by reading the full patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3489700/view/535480083734855862?l=english">here.</a></p>



<p>Following its release last year on PlayStation 5, Stellar Blade finally made its debut on PC last month, becoming an instant success by selling over <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-1-million-units-on-pc-in-3-days-ceo-hopes-sequel-comes-out-in-2027/">1 million units </a>in three days. As of now, developer Shift Up hasn't confirmed if the game is hitting other formats in the future, but there's a very good chance it will launch on Nintendo Switch 2 at some point, as the developer is i<a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-switch-2/">nvestigating the possibility</a> of a port.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

		<p>Krafton has announced a major leadership shake up for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> developer <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/unknown-worlds">Unknown Worlds</a>, with co-founders Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire leaving the studio “effectively immediately”, being replaced by new CEO Steve Papoutsis, who’s coming over from Callisto Protocol team Striking Distance Studios.</p>
<p>This is a very significant change, with the Subnautica 2 early access release still aiming for later this year, and is a major cause for concern amongst the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/subnautica">Subnautica</a> community.</p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pubg">PUBG</a> publisher Krafton is keep to express that while they “sought to keep the Unknown Worlds’ co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game’s development, the company wishes them well on their next endeavors.” So why has this happened?</p>
<p>Through the press release, there’s an expectation that Papoutsis will being “renewed energy and momentum to delivering the long-anticipated Subnautica 2 experience to fans.” While Krafton CEO CH Kim says that “Given the anticipation around Subnautica 2, we owe our players nothing less than the best possible game, as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>The statement goes on to discuss Krafton’s oversight putting regular milestones and progress assessments in place for all its studios, and that “Unknown Worlds’ new leadership fully supports this process.”</p>

<p>So, it doesn’t take too much reading between the lines to see that Subnautica 2’s early access release might have been in doubt for 2025. That could have been through missing milestone already or from wanting more time. Papoutsis has been put in place to ensure that a product is delivered this year.</p>
<p>Papoutsis has come across from Callisto Protocol developer Striking Distance Studios. The tail end of Callisto Protocol’s development was mired in controversy over glorifying crunch culture at the studio, with employees pushed to work 6-7 day weeks. Then studio head <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/callisto-protocol-sequel-glen-schofield-interview">Glen Schofield walking back and apologising</a> for comments that seemed to glorify this approach. In an interview following his departure from SDS, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-callisto-protocol/glen-schofield-interview">Schofield then claimed that Krafton forced the game to be released three months earlier</a> than had been agreed, leading to cut content and the aforementioned crunch.</p>
