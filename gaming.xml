		<p>Blizzard is hitting the big red reset button on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>, reverting the game back to being just <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch">Overwatch</a> from 10th February, a bit like when Prince decided to be called Prince again instead of having an unpronounceable sign for a name. As part of the soft reboot, Overwatch will embrace a new story focus with a narrative arc running through each season, and there will be 10 new heroes launched through the year, with the first five joining the roster alongside the reboot.</p>
<p><iframe title="Overwatch Animated Short | “Reign of Talon”" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ch2J2Xuu3VI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Overwatch might have been feeling some of the heat from Marvel Rivals, pushing Blizzard to take this reinvigorated approach, harking back to the early days of the game. Each arc will start with a new cinematic and then continue through motion comics, in-game events, new voice lines, animated hero trailers and short stories.</p>
<p>The five new heroes include&nbsp;Domina, Emre, Mizuki, Anran, and Jetpack Cat, and each one will have an important role in the story.</p>


<p>Joining the Talon forces, with Vendetta leading them, is Domina, taking on the role of being a poke tank with a hard-light barrier, sonic repulsors and an imprisoning barrier ultimate. Emre is a former Overwatch Strike Team member, but walked away, got some cybernetic mods, and kind of lost his mind – he’s a fact-paced run-and-gun damage style. Mizuki is a new support with spinning blades that bounce of walls, a healing hat to bounce around and a healing sanctuary.</p>
<p>On the Overwatch side of things is the new damage dealer Anran, who shoots fiery projectiles and is sure to be veeeeeeerrry popular for cosmetics – hence why she’s available from 5th Feb via a Hero Trial. Then there’s Jetpack Cat, who is a ginger cat riding a jetpack and meowing a lot. She has Biotic Pawjectiles, a healling Purr, and the abilitiy to catnap as her ultimate. She will also make pet owners feel very, very guilty for shooting at her.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Overwatch Spotlight | 5 New Heroes" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fa9myF4xm8w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The three main character classes will remain, but they’re now being broken down into sub-roles to give special buffs as follows:</p>
<p>TANK</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BRUISER</strong>: Reduces critical damage received. While at critical health, gain movement speed.
<ul>
<li><em>Mauga / Orisa / Roadhog / Zarya</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>INITIATOR</strong>: Staying airborne lightly heals you.
<ul>
<li><em>D.Va / Doomfist / Winston / Wrecking Ball</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>STALWART</strong>: Reduces knockbacks and slows received.
<ul>
<li><em>Domina / Hazard / Junker Queen / Ramattra / Reinhardt / Sigma</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>DAMAGE</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SHARPSHOOTER</strong>: Critical hits reduce your movement ability cooldowns.
<ul>
<li><em>Ashe / Cassidy / Hanzo / Sojourn / Widowmaker</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>FLANKER</strong>: Health packs restore more health.
<ul>
<li><em>Anran / Genji / Reaper / Tracer / Vendetta / Venture</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>SPECIALIST</strong>: Eliminating an enemy briefly increases your reload speed.
<ul>
<li><em>Bastion / Emre / Junkrat / Mei / Soldier: 76 / Symmetra / Torbjorn</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>RECON</strong>: You detect enemies below half health through walls after damaging them.
<ul>
<li><em>Echo / Freja / Pharah / Sombra</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SUPPORT</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TACTICIAN</strong>: You can gain excess ultimate charge, which carries over after using your ultimate ability.
<ul>
<li><em>Ana / Baptiste / Jetpack Cat / Lucio / Zenyatta</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>MEDIC</strong>: Healing allies with your weapon also heals you.
<ul>
<li><em>Kiriko / Lifeweaver / Mercy / Moira</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>SURVIVOR</strong>: Using a movement ability activates passive health regeneration.
<ul>
<li><em>Brigitte / Illari / Juno / Mizuki / Wuyang</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Overwatch Spotlight | Sub-Roles &amp; New Meta Event" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DRaSIHEJ424?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Season 1 will kick off a new meta event that will run for five weeks, asking players to join either Talon or Overwatch, and then fight for their side. You’ll get missions to complete each week to further the lore of the battle, and earn tons of lootboxes along the way.</p>
<p>Oh, and there’s an ugly new main menu that looks like a mobile F2P game. The old menus weren’t perfect, but they had a pleasing minimalism and clarity to them.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/873755/nintendo-switch-virtual-boy-impressions</link>
            <guid>1425952</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Though the Virtual Boy was both a commercial and critical failure, the console’s infamy is part of what has made it such a fascinating piece of Nintendo’s history. Original units are still going for hundreds of dollars on bidding sites, and hobbyists have spent years keeping the Virtual Boy alive through emulation and homebrew games. For a long while, it seemed like Nintendo wanted nothing more than for the public to forget that the Virtual Boy ever existed. But over time, the company has become more comfortable acknowledging and even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qg5jmq7_GQ">joking about the system through references</a> in games like <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em>, <em>Tomodachi Life</em>, and <a href="https://luigi-mansion.fandom.com/wiki/Virtual_Boo"><em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em></a>.</p><p>Looking back on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/16/17357848/nintendo-3ds-switch-upgrade">Nintendo 3DS</a> and more recent experiments like the Nintendo Switch and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qg5jmq7_GQhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qg5jmq7_GQhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qg5jmq7_GQ">Labo</a>, it wasn’t exactly surprising to learn that the Virtual Boy was being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/777032/nintendo-switch-virtual-boy-games">resurrected as a Switch peripheral</a> designed to be used while playing classic Virtual Boy games on Nintendo Switch Online. There’s a nifty poetry to Nintendo’s worst-selling console being reimagined as a fancy peripheral for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/873098/nintendo-switch-era-best-selling-console">most successful system of all time</a>. Everything about the new Virtual Boy’s release speaks to Nintendo being confident enough to revisit one of its biggest failures and turn it into a flex that is quite literally designed to prop up the Switch family of consoles.</p><p>When I recently spent some time playing with the new Virtual Boy, though, Nintendo’s confidence in this $100 side quest didn’t feel entirely justified. The headset / stand combo is a gorgeous piece of retro tech that’s comfortable enough to shove your face into. And even though I was kind of hoping to experience some disorienting visual weirdness, the console’s stereoscopic lenses didn’t leave me with a headache. But there’s a clunkiness to the way the Virtual Boy’s games played that made the device feel more like an aged novelty rather than a system I could see myself spending some serious time with.</p><p>The major selling point to this thing is that it’s faithfully re-creating aspects of the original console that worked while smoothing over some of the roughness that led to it flopping in the ’90s. But if retro nostalgia isn’t really your jam, you might want to pass on the plastic model and consider <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/873745/nintendo-switch-online-virtual-boy-3d-labo-cardboard-vr">dusting off your old Labo kit</a>.</p><p>As someone who never played the original Virtual Boy and tends to find VR headsets uncomfortable to wear, I was pleasantly surprised at how well my face fit into the new peripheral, which is meant to stand on a table and be used with a controller after you insert your Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 into it. Unlike my cardboard Labo headset — which was prone to letting external light leak in — the plastic Virtual Boy was able to plunge me into total darkness while I was sitting in a well-lit event space.</p><p>That darkness made the redness — which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/868569/nintendo-switch-online-virtual-boy-3d-lineup-launch">can be customized to other colors</a> — of the Virtual Boy’s monochromatic game selection screen pop as I browsed through the limited library of 3D titles. Nintendo says that by the end of this year, it plans to release 14 different Virtual Boy games through its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24339906/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-nso">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> subscription package, which costs $50 a year for individual accounts and $80 for family plans. The first batch of Virtual Boy games is due out on February 17th when the $100 peripheral and its cheaper $25 cardboard counterpart are being released.</p><p>During my time with the Virtual Boy, I found myself charmed but a little underwhelmed while playing games like <em>Galactic Pinball</em>, <em>Teleroboxer</em>, and a new port of <em>The Mansion of Innsmouth</em> — a title that had previously only been released in Japan. The games ran perfectly fine and looked like what you would expect from a point in Nintendo’s history when it was experimenting with a new way to make its games feel immersive. As impressive as this lens technology might have been when the original Virtual Boy was released, it pales in comparison to what Nintendo managed to accomplish with the 3DS, and it never managed to fully trick my eyes into thinking that I was playing a game in 3D.</p><p>Ironically, it was more aesthetically simplistic games with vector graphics like <em>3-D Tetris</em> and <em>Red Alarm </em>that felt like they were really pulling me in with their novel approach to presenting three-dimensional space. There’s also something to be said for the fact that playing these games in any form has become much more difficult over the years. This new peripheral might not exactly set off a new wave of Virtual Boy game preservation, but it will make them infinitely more accessible — especially for folks who weren’t around during the original console’s brief lifespan.</p><p>Though Nintendo didn’t give me hands-on time with the cardboard Virtual Boy, I came away much more interested in trying that out and seeing what these games might look like on a Labo. The plastic model definitely looks cool and will probably scratch a certain itch for those who wish they’d been able to own a Virtual Boy back in the ’90s. But in 2026, these kinds of 3D games just feel a bit <em>too </em>dated to warrant the price of admission if you aren’t already paying for an NSO subscription.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/873755/nintendo-switch-virtual-boy-impressions]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/marathon/" id="98">Marathon </a>will have a ranked mode, a new report suggests.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99">Bungie </a>has not officially confirmed many details about the upcoming extraction shooter, Marathon. However, new details have been shared with <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/marathon-ranked-mode-surface-scoring-holotags" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a> courtesy of leaker <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/2019105753978794502?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X0X_Leak.</a></p>



<p>The ranked mode in the upcoming game will have 6 tiers, with discussion of a 7th “Master” tier. The 6 tiers mentioned in the report are Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Pinnacle. Each tier has three individual sub-rankings as players level up. Ranked rewards will include cosmetics and other items, some of which players will be able to equip directly, and others will be gifted to them after a season is over.</p>







<h2 id="h-scoring-details-for-marathon-ranked-mode">Scoring Details for Marathon Ranked Mode</h2>



<p>The report goes on to mention scoring details, noting that players must have a Holotag equipped to score in a match. There is no Holotag equipped; there will be no contribution to the score. If players successfully exfil from a ranked match before reaching the target score, no rank progress is gained or lost. Failing to exfil results in a point loss equal to the full Score target.</p>



<p>Holotags have rarities equivalent to the ranks mentioned above. Each tag has unique effects that boost score targets when looted from other Runners during a match, also enabling potential scores higher than the initial target.</p>



<p>For example, a Silver Holotag grants players 5,000 credits to their score target on Infil, and any additional looted silver tags expand players’ credit capacities by 1,000.</p>

        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Deep Physical <a title="Genres > Simulation [931 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">Simulation</a></strong> – Don’t like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.</li><li><strong>Fully Simulated <a title="Companies > Creature [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/creature">Creature</a>s</strong> – Every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Faction System</strong> – Pursue allegiances with over 70 factions: apes, crabs, trees, robots, and highly entropic beings, just to name a few.</li><li><strong>Richly Detailed Science Fantasy Setting</strong> – Over fifteen years of worldbuilding have led to a rich, weird, labyrinthine, one-of-a-kind storyworld, layered on top of the simulation, all for you to explore. Live and drink, friend.</li><li><strong>Tactical Gameplay</strong> – Turn-based, sandbox exploration and combat offers as many solutions as you and your mutations, implants, artifacts, and skills are creative enough to invent.</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > RPG [18,002 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> Elements</strong> – <a title="Platforms > Quest [164 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>s, NPCs, villages, historic sites; some dynamic and some handwritten, interwoven to produce a transportative RPG experience.</li><li><strong>Atmospheric Original Soundtrack</strong> – Over two hours of otherworldly music to delve to.</li></ul><p><strong>Character Creation</strong></p><p><em>Caves of Qud</em> has one of the most expressive character creators of all time.</p><p>Play the role of a mutant indigenous to the salt-spangled dunes and jungles of Qud, or play a true kin descendant from one of the few remaining eco-domes—the toxic arboreta of Ekuemekiyye, the ice-sheathed arcology of <a title="Games > Ib [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ib">Ib</a>ul, or the crustal mortars of Yawningmoon.</p><p>Build your character out of:</p><ul><li>Over 70 Mutations—outfit yourself with wings, two heads, four arms, flaming hands, teleportation, the power to clone yourself…</li><li>Dozens of cybernetic implants (and more to find as treasure)—night vision, translucent skin, carbide fists, spring-loaded ankle tendons…</li><li>24 castes and kits from across the social order of Qud and beyond Moghra’yi, the Great Salt Desert</li><li>Too overwhelmed to build a character from scratch? Choose one of nine preset characters and start your <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,847 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> right away. Then return to character creation when you are ready.</li></ul><p><strong>Modes</strong></p><p>Play one of four modes:</p><ul><li><strong>Classic</strong> – Like other traditional roguelikes, this mode has permadeath, meaning you lose your character when you die. Extremely challenging even for experts.</li><li><strong>Roleplay</strong> – Play it like an RPG. Save your progress at checkpoints located in settlements.</li><li><strong>Wander</strong> – Focus on exploration. Most creatures will not attack you, you don’t gain experience by killing, but you DO gain experience by discovering new locations and treating with legendary creatures.</li><li><strong>Daily</strong> – One chance with a fixed character and world seed. How long will you survive?</li></ul><p><strong>What’s New in Version 1.0?</strong></p><p>After nine years of continuous development and frequent updates, <em>Caves of Qud</em> has finally reached its 1.0 release! Here are some highlights of what’s been added for 1.0:</p><ul><li>The last leg of the main quest.</li><li>The new, fully graphical user interface.</li><li>Hundreds of visual and sound effects.</li><li>Lots of polish and stability.</li></ul><p><strong>History</strong></p><p><em>Caves of Qud</em> is a project of epic proportions that’s been in development for over fifteen years, since 2007. It began as the science fantasy roguelike dream of co-creators Jason Grinblat and Brian Bucklew, who released the first beta in 2010. Since then, it’s accrued a few more contributors who have enriched the project by helping to add visual effects, sound effects, an original soundtrack, a new user interface, new game systems, new lore, and half a world of content. <em>Caves of Qud</em> has grown into a wild garden of emergent narrative, where a handwritten story weaves a path through rich physical, social, and historical simulations. The result is a hybrid handcrafted and procedurally-generated world that’s alive in a way few games are.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Switch Rlease Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Caves of Qud - Release Date Trailer - Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DisUBYdcFcM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/caves-of-qud-for-switch-launches-february-16]]></content:encoded>

      <p>As you may have seen, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-ditching-the-2-amid-launch-of-new-story-driven-era-with-10-new-heroes?ref=aftermath.site"><u>there was some big <em>Overwatch </em>news today</u></a>, including the reveal of a bunch of new characters and <em>Overwatch 2</em> dropping the "2" from its title.</p><p>What you might not have seen was that IGN accidentally leaked a bunch of that news by accidentally publishing a story early,<a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-an-faq/"> <u>ahead of its agreed embargo time</u></a>. It's catastrophic for marketing teams when that happens, so I understand they'd be pretty annoyed, but it also happens sometimes, because games writers are human and humans make mistakes. This isn't the first time an embargo has accidentally been broken, and it won't be the last.</p><p>As annoyed as the <em>Overwatch </em>team would have been, though, was this tweet (below) from an account with 3.3 million followers (who knows how many are real or left these days, though) really necessary? Calling out the publication by name--a name that acts as a flame to every shit-brained moth still using Twitter and frothing at the mouth over video game <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-anime-review-score-discourse/"><u>review</u></a> scores--is not a great look for <em>Overwatch's</em> social team, but throwing in a slogan from an authoritarian regime for good measure makes it much, much worse.</p><figure></figure><p>It should be noted that as part of the big announcements today the <em>Overwatch </em>Twitter account says it has been taken over by Talon, the game's villains, so this could have been an attempt at an in-universe joke that didn't even land at all, let alone land badly. But only a few other posts have tried to be "in-character", and they were all just harmless cartoon villain stuff, not...using a Trump slogan to call out a website that gamers on the platform owned by a white supremacist love to hate.</p><p>I get it, spoiling a big day of news must have sucked! But there are more productive ways of dealing with that than punching down at someone who made a mistake.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why Blizzard Says It’s Been Making Overwatch Heroes Hotter]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/overwatch-heroes-characters-hotter-young-skins-collab-2000665796</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Over the years </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s heroes</span></a><span>, which once included characters of various ages and (sometimes) shapes and sizes, have largely started conforming to a particular trend. Nowadays, a lot of its heroes are what most people would consider conventionally attractive, young, and ripe for dressing up in crossover skins. Why is this? Well, some fans theorize that it’s for the obvious draw that comes with putting hot people in your game, but Blizzard says there’s actually a little more to it than that.</span></p>  <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yes-overwatch-characters-have-been-getting-sexier-but-not-for-the-obvious-reason/1100-6537888/"><i><span>GameSpot</span></i></a><span>, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>senior producer Kenny Hudson was asked about whether or not this trend has taken hold of the game’s hero roster, with even four of its five upcoming heroes seeming to fit the bill as the game heads into its revamp next week with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-cinematic-doomfist-vendetta-death-reign-talon-2000665013"><span>a new Season One</span></a><span>. According to him, it’s because such characters make designing skins easier, as opposed to doing so for characters like the robot-piloting hamster Wrecking Ball, which puts the team in “crisis” mode.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Something that we kind of look into when we’re doing our heroes is how can we make them unique, but still give them a good platform, proportionally, height, scale proportion to not only build cosmetics for them and future-proof things, but to stop the technical hurdles of other things,” Hudson said. “So, one of the things that really helps with that is if you give longer limbs, taller legs, a bigger core, it actually makes it easier for our artists to physically put new geometry on those models. And so, that’s how it kind of turns out.”</span></p> <p><span>Art director Dion Rogers gave us a similar answer when we asked </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-collab-skins-mercy-kiriko-juno-lucio-sanrio-2000665321"><span>why some characters get more skins than others</span></a><span>, saying that some of the collaboration skins the team designed were just easier to put on characters like Mercy or Kiriko. However, the team is hoping that that will be changing in 2026 and it can get back to more “oddball” heroes.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Now we’re in this realm where we can make more Jetpack Cats because we’ve learned all these lessons,” Hudson said.</span></p> <p><span>After </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-name-change-season-21-cinematic-spotlight-2000665046"><span>dropping the </span><i><span>2 </span></i><span>from its name</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>is getting a bit of a reboot next week on February 10, with a new season, story content, and five new heroes all dropping on day one.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of the creators behind <em>Doom</em> and one of the lead developers directing the franchise today replied to a terminally ill fan’s touching post about how he’s spending his final weeks alive playing <em>Doom Eternal</em> on a PS5 in a hospital room.</p> <p>On January 31, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/1qsei9w/my_days_are_nearing_and_my_local_hospital_allowed/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php">Wanderingrader123 posted a sad but powerful story to Reddit</a> explaining that he has been battling Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma cancer since 2022. However, his situation hasn’t improved, and doctors say he possibly only has weeks to live. The Toronto hospital he is in offered to fulfill any request he had during his remaining time, and he asked if you could play <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-doom-dark-ages-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-game-pass-1851779839">2025’s <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></a><em>,</em> saying he’s been a fan of the series since 2016, and the reboot and sequel, <em>Doom Eternal</em>, have helped him through some “tough times.” However, due to “financial issues” he has been unable to play through <em>Dark Ages.</em> Thankfully, the hospital got him a PS5 and a copy of the game, and he’s currently ripping and tearing his way through it.</p>

 <p>“I may not live to see the upcoming DLC, but I am nonetheless happy to finally play the game in my own hands,” said Wanderingrader123. “To the developers of ID Software, thank you for bringing such a beautiful piece of art that not only brought the FPS genre to its roots, but also revitalize and reinvented the wheel that no other game could. Not only that, but thank you for crafting such an awesome series for a fan like me.”</p>   <p>His post and story caught the attention of id game director Hugo Martin, who has served as the lead developer on the recent <em>Doom</em> games, including<em> Dark Ages.</em></p>

 <p>“Thank you so much for your support and know that all of id salutes you brother,” replied Martin on Reddit. “I tell the team all the time, people care about our games, we have to put the same amount of care into making them. It has been the honor of our professional lives making these past three games for fans like you. To make the Slayer feel STRONG in <em>DOOM</em>, we infuse him with all the attributes of a true old school hero: we give him strength, courage and heart… we make him like you. RIP AND TEAR, my friend. You are the real Slayer.”</p>

 <p>Wanderingrader123’s bittersweet post also caught the attention of John Romero himself, one of the original developers who helped create <em>Doom</em> and id Software back in the 1990s.</p> <p>“I am so moved and honored that you carried <em>DOOM</em> with you for a decade and chose to live in <em>DOOM</em> as your journey nears its end,” posted Romero. “You are the definition of bravery and courage. You are the reason <em>DOOM</em> exists.”</p> <p>“When we made <em>DOOM</em>, we wanted to create a world where you felt powerful even in the face of overwhelming odds. Knowing that it has been a companion to you, something familiar, something steady, something alive, means more to me than I can properly put into words. You are not alone in that hospital room. You are standing in a place millions of us have stood, fighting. Every enemy, every level, every moment matters because you do. Thank you for sharing this part of your life with us. Thank you for bringing <em>DOOM</em> with you. Rip and tear—with love and respect.”</p>

 <p>Beyond these <em>Doom</em> devs, the wider <em>Doom</em> community replied to Wanderingrader123’s post, sharing words of encouragement and commending the poster for his bravery.&nbsp; The outpouring of love and support led to Wanderingrader123 responding. Here’s his full reply:</p> <blockquote><p>“I want to thank you all for the kind support you have given over in the past 24 hours. I’ll admit, I was very hesitant and reluctant even to make such a post due to the nature of my condition. No amount of words can describe the overwhelming kindness you have given me since I posted. Not only from the fans but to also the developers as well. I have recieved massive amounts of DMs, which I am incredibly grateful of, though, I won’t be able to get through most. Still, I am grateful nonetheless. It is an extreme privilege to be in a welcoming community such as r/<em>Doom</em> and be able to share this post. I am currently having a blast beating up demons with the flail.”</p> <p>“And for people wondering, I am actually in the Toronto General Hospital in Downtown, Toronto, Ontario. But for the sake of both my privacy and my family, I will not divulge my location further than that. Please and thank you for respecting my privacy, as well as the massive support. I will use the time that I have left to not only enjoy myself but to also spend time with my family and friends. Thank you again, everyone!”</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>ProbablyMonsters, the studio behind last year's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/storm-lancers">Storm Lancers</a>, has revealed Nekome: Nazi Hunter, a third-person action game where – you guessed it – you kill a lot of nazis. The game's release date and playable platforms remain to be announced, but if the idea of getting revenge against nazi soldiers during World War II sounds like a great time, it's a game you might want to keep an eye on.&nbsp;</p><p>"In Nekome: Nazi Hunter, players step into the role of Vano Nastasu, a young Romani man consumed by grief after the brutal murder of his family by nazi soldiers," a press release reads. "The game follows Vano's transformation from hunter to hunter as he embarks on a violent personal odyssey of revenge across war-torn Europe."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out the Nekome: Nazi Hunter announcement trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cfi7rGaz3gg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cfi7rGaz3gg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>ProbablyMonsters says its game approaches the Second World War from a personal perspective, as you play as Vano, a man not trying to end the war (though I imagine he'd like to do that), but set on exacting revenge on every nazi he comes across. To do so, players will "scout enemy routes, plan their assaults, and strike with precision in a mix of stealth and brutal, up-close combat." If the trailer above is any indication, the combat is indeed brutal, violent, and bloody.&nbsp;</p><p>The studio says Nekome: Nazi Hunter's visuals are inspired by grindhouse cinema and that the game features visceral combat, complete with grounded finishing moves. Though the announcement trailer is short, the screenshots below might give you a better look at what to expect in the game:&nbsp;</p><p>More information about Nekome: Nazi Hunter will be released at GDC next month.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you think of Nekome: Nazi Hunter's reveal?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has revealed new details on upcoming Riftbound products. The studio's State of the Game update includes new details of upcoming sets for the official <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends" rel="nofollow"><em>League of Legends</em></a> TCG, and a reprint of the highly sought after Proving Grounds.</p><h2>The <em>Riftbound </em>State of the Game Announcements</h2><p>As part of their State of the Game column on their website, Riot Games gave players an update on <em>Riftbound</em>. This included the announcement of Regional Qualifiers for Organized Play across North America, Europe, APAC, including cities like Lillie, Atlanta, Sydney, Vancouver, Barcelona, Singapore, and Los Angeles.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>For those interested in how Riot will address the competitive meta, they plan on being minimal at this point in the game's life cycle. The game is relatively new, and implementing restrictions on certain cards this early may not be a wise long-term decision. They have stated that they will avoid power-level errata, changing the core rules to address power creep.</p><p>The State of the Game also confirms the release dates of upcoming sets and teases some unique selling points. These sets were originally announced as part of their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everything-announced-at-riftbound-pax-unplugged-panel" rel="nofollow">PAX Unplugged</a> panel, but were light on detail.</p><p>The fourth set, <em>Riftbound: Vendetta, </em>will launch globally on July 31 in a synchronized English and Simplified Chinese language release. This is a departure from the game's more staggered release, starting in Chinese before being localized to English at a later date. In addition, Vendetta will introduce enemy faction pairings to the game for the first time.</p><p>For dedicated <em>League of Legends</em> fans, the State of the Game does confirm that the fifth set, <em>Riftbound: Radiance</em>, will include two fan-favorite champions. Ekko, which same may recognize from the Netflix animated series Arcane, and Seraphine.</p><p>These upcoming <em>RIftbound</em> sets will have preview seasons throughout this year. These previews will start with the game's third set, <em>Unleashed</em>, on March 16, followed by <em>Vendetta</em> this Summer, and the fifth set, <em>Radiance</em>, will be previewed this Fall.</p><p>Lastly, competitive players and collectors can relax since Riot has confirmed a reprint of Proving Grounds. This introductory product was designed to bring new players into the game. But, the set contained unique cards that are currently vital in the competitive meta, causing much higher demand.&nbsp;</p><p>Riot has stated more copies are coming and have stated they have learned a lesson from the situation. Going forward, any starter sets will not contain unique cards.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo investors are taking <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>‘s sales struggle hard.<em> Maybe Black Myth: Wukong</em> coming to Switch 2 can turn things around. And who is left to lead <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. I’m still bummed about <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-avowed-obsidian-rpgs-sales-outer-worlds-3-2000665352">yesterday’s report that <em>The Outer Worlds</em> franchise</a> is essentially on ice after last year’s entry struggled to sell. It’s an exceptionally solid immersive sim RPG that feels like it’s on the verge of being something truly special. But those <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">30-percent profit margins</a> on games given away for free on Game Pass are a killer.</p> <h2>Nintendo gets hammered</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Many Japanese gaming companies' stocks took a big hit in the Japanese stock market today! via <a href="https://twitter.com/serkantoto?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@serkantoto</a> </p> <p>• Nintendo -12.3%<br>• Capcom -9.1%<br>• Konami -7.7%<br>• Koei Tecmo -6.3%<br>• Sony -4.2%<br>• Kadokawa (FromSoftware parent) -3.9%<br>• Square Enix -3.4%<br>• Bandai Namco -3.4%<br>•… <a href="https://t.co/tnJuY2cZHG">https://t.co/tnJuY2cZHG</a> <a href="https://t.co/WxWBGrA4hq">pic.twitter.com/WxWBGrA4hq</a></p> <p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/2019025986139148481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The Mario maker’s share price in Japan dropped 11 percent this week over worse-than-expected profitability despite the Switch 2 continuing to be a launch-year juggernaut. Fans might think the concerns stem from questions about the new device’s mixed year-one lineup, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-04/nintendo-dives-10-after-disappointing-profit-spurs-margin-fears">but <em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> that it comes down to worries about increasing production costs and pressure from U.S. tariffs.</p>

 <p>But it’s not the only video game stock getting crushed. Many publishers continue to be down days after Google’s new Genie AI tool rollout <a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-stocks-down-take-two-gta-nintendo-roblox-unity-google-ai-game-maker-2000664594">sent share prices spiraling</a>. While Nintendo is the hardest hit, Capcom and Konami are all suffering as well, not to mention Roblox, Unity, and even Take-Two in the U.S.</p> <h2>Another <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> veteran is out</h2> <p>Luc Couture has been a level designer on the stealth action franchise since the beginning, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-veteran-designer-leaves-ubisoft-two-decades/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a>. “Today was my last day at Ubisoft Montreal,”&nbsp;he wrote <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7424588173462183936/">on LinkedIn</a>.&nbsp;“It’s been an incredible journey that lasted more than 20 years….During that time, I have learned a lot about game development, relationships and myself. I even met my wife and mother of my children because of Ubisoft colleague…so how blessed am I….right? But I was recently in need for some change. So that’s why I will soon pivot to tackling new challenges as part of a smaller studio with other veterans. Times are exciting.”</p>

<p>Daniel Vávra, the writer and director of Kingdom Come: Deliverance and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, has posted a predictive and somewhat damning statement about artificial intelligence on social media. He was responding to a video showcasing the insane advancements of photorealistic, gen-AI video creation tools, which are fast becoming <strong>terrifying</strong>.</p>



<p>Vávra, a games industry veteran of more than 20 years, stressed that movies and gaming ‘will never be the same’, and suggested we need to make the most of it because of the benefits it offers.</p>







<h2 id="h-everybody-hates-ai-well-actually-not-everybody">‘Everybody Hates AI (Well Actually, Not Everybody)’</h2>



<p>In a recent statement that some might dub inflammatory, Daniel Vávra, the creative director of 2025’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/one-year-ago-medieval-masterpiece-kingdom-come-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, bigged up generative AI. <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/2019133539053084862" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">He wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Everybody hates AI (well actually not everybody). But I told you its unavoidable future. </p>



<p>Hate me as you wish. Its the truth. This is fan made trailer. Made in two days. By one person. Movie (and gaming) industry will never be the same. You can see it as an game over or as an opportunity for everyone to make great stuff without the big money from corporations. </p>



<p>But it doesnt matter what you think. Its here and its not going anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Vávra suggests that pushing back against AI is a fruitless effort, as it’s inevitable that the technology will continue to evolve. Instead, Vávra indicates that a symbiosis of sorts is the best way forward, using the progressive technology as a way to make things better and faster without gargantuan investments from ‘corporations’.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that more developers are falling into the use of AI these days. It allows them to iterate faster, test more effectively, and create games, especially larger ones, at a much more efficient pace. The sketchy area comes when generative AI is used to replace artists, musicians, and actors, and it has caused an intense amount of flak across the industry in recent years.</p>



<p>In a throwback interview with Insider Gaming, Doug Cockle (Geralt of Rivia, <em>The Witcher</em>) named <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doug-cockle-ai-voice-replication/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI voice replication ‘theft’</a>. It was a sentiment that has been echoed countless times since.</p>



<p>Vávra gave his thoughts back to those opposing his energy towards AI, offering up an analogy of sorts:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My “art” is just a materialization of my thoughts, the result of my brain guiding my hands. Its similar as if you were saying that driving cars is unnatural cheating to reach something faster and only peple who really arrive in destination are those who walk…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s rough, but it makes quite a lot of sense, and it’s one of the biggest debates around the use of AI. Are you inherently evil or immoral for using AI to make your life easier, and is it better to struggle, take longer to do things, and spend more money just to declare you’re <strong>not using AI</strong> for something?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, <strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> announced a flurry of showcase events, one for each of its major titles: <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-announces-showcases-for-world-of-warcraft-diablo-hearthstone-and-overwatch-all-within-the-next-two-weeks/"><strong>World of Warcraft, Overwatch 2, Hearthstone</strong>, and <strong>Diablo IV</strong></a>. The World of Warcraft showcase happened at the end of last week, with Blizzard digging into its <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-roadmap-housing-blizzcon-2026/">World of Warcraft roadmap for 2026</a></strong>. Today, it followed up with the <strong>Overwatch Spotlight,</strong> announcing <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24246206/overwatch-spotlight-the-reign-of-talon-begins/">what to expect for the coming year</a>, and a significant change to the game going forward: it's no longer called <strong>Overwatch 2</strong>, and will instead just be called '<strong>Overwatch</strong>' once again.</p>



<p>Towards the end of the 35-minute spotlight, Overwatch game director <strong>Aaron Keller</strong> began to explain the decision to drop the '2' from the game's title by saying, "<em>Overwatch is a living universe that keeps growing, keeps surprising, and keeps bringing players together from around the world. This team is focused on continually delivering these great experiences for years to come</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>And with that, we realized, Overwatch is a game that transcends any single number. So moving forward,</em> <em><strong>we're dropping the '2,' and continuing simply as Overwatch</strong>.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Overwatch Spotlight | Premieres Feb 4 at 10am PST" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/moRmc0a8NI8?start=1875&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It's a tangible change indicating how the team at Blizzard is looking to reinvent and overhaul the game, though that is, of course, coming with more than just a change to the name. The game will introduce <strong>10 new heroes</strong> over the course of 2026, as it kicks off a new, <strong>annual story arc</strong> that will start with a new <strong>Season 1</strong> next week on <strong>February 10, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>The opening story event is the <strong>Reign of Talon</strong>, which was introduced with a cinematic at the top of the spotlight, where Vendetta defeated Doomfist to take what was rightfully hers. The story for Reign of Talon will be told through upcoming hero trailers, animated comics, in-game events, map updates and short stories released by the team in the coming year. This is also the new storytelling structure that Blizzard will continue with moving forward.</p>



<p>"<em>For the first time ever, we're telling an annual story with a beginning, middle, and end</em>," said Keller during the Spotlight. "<em>A story that evolves across all six seasons of the year before a new Season 1 launches the next chapter in 2027. This is going to be epic</em>."</p>



<p>Out of the 10 new heroes that'll be joining the game across 2026, <strong>five of them will arrive in Season 1</strong>. Those five heroes are: <strong>Domina (Tank), Emre (Damage), Mizuki (Support), Anran (Damage), </strong>and <strong>Jetpack Cat (Support)</strong>. The new season will also make changes to the core roles of the game, with Tank, Damage, and Support heroes now all categorized into sub-classes within their main class role.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Overwatch-2026-Season-1-Heroes.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Overwatch 2026 Season 1 Heroes, from left to right: Jetpack Cat, Anran, Emre, Mizuki, Domina. Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Tanks will include <strong>Brusier, Initiator, </strong>and <strong>Stalwart</strong> sub-classes. A Brusier Tank (Mauga, Orisa, Roadhog, Zarya) receives reduced critical damage and gains movement speed when their health is at critical levels. An Initiator Tank (D.Va, Doomfist, Winston, Wrecking Ball) reclaims some of its health while staying airborne. Lastly, a Stalwart Tank (Domina, Hazard, Junker Queen, Ramattra, Reinhardt, Sigma) has reduced knockback and slows.</p>



<p>Damage heroes are split into four sub-classes: <strong>Sharpshooter, Flanker, Specialist,</strong> and <strong>Recon</strong>. Sharpshooters (Ashe, Cassidy, Hanzo, Sojourn, Widowmaker) get their movement ability cooldowns reduced with critical hits. Flankers (Anran, Genji, Reaper, Tracer, Vendetta, Venture) get more health from using a health pack. Specialists (Bastion, Emre, Junkrat, Mei, Solider 76, Symmetra, Torbjorn) get their reload speed briefly increased after a kill, and Recon heroes (Echo, Freja, Pharah, Sombra) will be able to detect enemies through walls after you damage them and they have less than half their health.</p>



<p>Finally, Support heroes are broken into three sub-classes: <strong>Tactician, Medic,</strong> and <strong>Survivor</strong>. Tacticians (Ana, Baptiste, Jetpack Cat, Lucio, Zenyatta) gain excess ultimate charge that carries over even after using their ultimate ability. Medics (Kiriko, Lifeweaver, Mercy, Moira) heal themselves while also healing others with their weapons, and Survivors (Brigitte, Illari, Juna, Mizuki, Wuyang) activate passive health regeneration when using their movement abilities.</p>



<p>Season 1 will also introduce a new Conquest Meta Event, where players take sides fighting for either Overwatch or Talon, completing missions that tie into the lore of the game, with the rewards from the event going to whichever side was able to complete more missions. You'll be able to switch sides after completing your current faction's weekly pass.</p>



<p>The UI/UX overhaul is the other major change that'll be introduced with Season 1, with Blizzard hoping the new look will "<em>restore some personality and hero-centric vibes while in-game</em>."</p>

<p>Lastly, the new season will also include new mythic skins, <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-x-street-fighter-6-kicks-off-today-bringing-new-skins-signature-special-moves-as-emotes-and-more/">collaborations,</a> and other cosmetics, with the first collaboration of 2026 bringing <strong>Hello Kitty</strong> into Overwatch. As for when Season 2 will kick off, the roadmap shared for the year has its arrival pinned for somewhere during <strong>Spring 2026</strong>, with a new hero to be introduced, the arrival of the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 </strong>version, and likely more than a few celebratory events planned around the <strong>10-year anniversary</strong> of Overwatch.</p>

<p>The next major showcase event coming from Blizzard is all about Hearthstone, which will premiere at the end of this week on <strong>February 9, 2026,</strong> at <strong>9:30am PT / 12:30pm ET / 5:30pm BT</strong>.</p>

              <p><span>Motoaki Furukawa, the former Konami composer behind the likes of </span><i><span>Policenauts</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Snatcher </span></i><span>and the Nintendo 64 version of </span><i><span>Castlevania</span></i><span>, and Pixel Co., a small Nintendo Switch-focused Japanese dev team, have lost their respective legal battles against each other regarding the abandoned crowdsourced shoot ‘em up </span><i><span>Steam Pilots</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><i><span>Steam Pilots</span></i><span> was crowdfunded via Japanese crowdfunding site Makuake through two separate campaigns, both of which were created in 2019. The two campaigns managed to raise a combined 11,022,700 yen. This amounts to roughly $70,000 USD today, but was closer to $90,000 in 2019.</span></p>

 <p><span>In January 2022, Pixel Co. director Hidekuni Sasaki revealed in a </span><a href="https://x.com/pixel_japan/status/1478369068273266688"><span>post on X</span></a><span> that it was ceasing development on </span><i><span>Steam Pilots</span></i><span>, after allegedly not having received any form of payment in the two years they’d worked on the project. </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/20220105-8183/"><span>According to a representative</span></a><span> at Makuake, the total amount from both crowdfunding campaigns had been fully passed to Furukawa at this stage. Two months after Sasaki’s initial statement, Furukawa announced through </span><i><span>Steam Pilots’ </span></i><span>second Makuake page that a second developer had been brought on to replace Pixel Co.</span></p>   <p><span>From there, a legal battle ensued. Pixel Co. launched a suit against Furukawa in March 2022, seeking to recoup its lost development costs. Furukawa launched a countersuit of his own in 2023, in which he sought compensation for damages and alleged emotional distress caused by Pixel Co.’s CEO.</span></p>

 <p><span>As detailed in a report by </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japanese-game-company-and-ex-konami-composer-lose-lawsuits-against-each-other-after-collapse-of-crowdfunded-project/"><i><span>Automaton</span></i></a><span>, this all came to a head on January 30 when a Japanese court ruled that neither party would receive compensation for their alleged damages. However, Pixel Co.’s president has been ordered to pay Furukawa 40,000 yen (roughly $2,600) following his emotional distress lawsuit.</span></p>

 <p><span>In a </span><a href="https://x.com/pixel_japan/status/2017206252775076062"><span>post on X</span></a><span>, Pixel Co. stated that they find the ruling “to be deeply regrettable,” and that they believe the outcome “has the potential to cause serious disadvantages for the entire game industry.” Pixel Co. signed off by stating, “Regarding our future course of action, we will make an announcement at a later date. That is all.”</span></p> <p>But while <em>Steam Pilots</em> is dead, out of the wreckage of that retro shoot ’em up was born<em> Bounty Sisters</em>, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/07/bounty-sisters-is-a-promising-new-shoot-em-up-from-the-wreckage-of-crowdfunding-disaster-steam-pilots">a very similar game</a> that came to Switch in Japan just a couple of months ago.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[What is Liberty Prime Alpha? Fallout Season Two Ending Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/liberty-prime-alpha-fallout-season-two-explained/</link>
            <guid>1425871</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve just finished season two of the Fallout television show, you might have a few questions spinning around your head. Most critically, you might be wondering what Liberty Prime Alpha is and why it’s so important to those in the Fallout universe. This behemoth character was ‘introduced’ in the mid-credits sequence of the Fallout TV show’s second season finale, and it has some fans confused.</p>



<p>In case you’re unaware, Liberty Prime is the name of an enormous robot character in the Fallout universe, made most iconic in 2008’s Fallout 3 when it stormed into battle against the Enclave. It was seen again in 2015’s Fallout 4, but has lived in the shadows ever since.</p>



<p>But what’s <strong>Liberty Prime Alpha?</strong></p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-s-liberty-prime-alpha-is-coming">Fallout’s Liberty Prime Alpha is Coming</h2>



<p>In the closing seconds of the season two finale of Fallout, we saw blueprints for Liberty Prime Alpha, a towering robot that the Brotherhood of Steel, now led by ‘Quintus the Destroyer’, intends to build.</p>



<p>Those familiar with Fallout will instantly recognize Liberty Prime, but Liberty Prime <strong>Alpha </strong>is an entirely new construct, seen for the first time as the second season wrapped.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Liberty Prime Alpha could be the bgiger brother of this</figcaption></figure>







<p>It’s assumed that Quintus, who was betrayed by Knight Maximus in the second season of the show, will attempt to build Liberty Prime Alpha, but his intended target is unclear. Liberty Prime is an utter wrecking machine, so Liberty Prime Alpha should be borderline apocalyptic, no pun intended.</p>



<p>It’s unclear where the blueprints for Liberty Prime Alpha came from, as Maximus’ friend Dane approached Quintus with them as the mid-credits sequence played out. At that point, Area 51, the home of the Knights of San Fernando, was the site of an exploding civil war between various chapters of the Brotherhood of Steel, one of Fallout’s oldest and most recognizable factions.</p>



<p>The most likely explanation is that the blueprints were somewhere <strong>in </strong>Area 51, and that was one of the driving reasons for Quintus to relocate his chapter there and try to align with the other faction bodies.</p>







<p>Whatever happens in season three of Fallout, we might see the creation of one of the biggest robots the franchise has ever seen. Are you excited? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

We didn't get any real details as to what the release was going to entail as of yet. Overwatch 2 is already on the Nintendo Switch and thus playable on Switch 2, but it's just the regular edition, and a Switch 2 would presumably have some upgrades attached.

It's all just Overwatch now as the game enters a "new, story-driven era" with a year-long narrative, 10 new heroes, and a major overhaul.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced today at the Overwatch Spotlight, Blizzard revealed its first year-long storyline, entitled "The Reign of Talon". As it sounds, the plot is going to focus on the antagonistic faction Talon as it takes over around the world, while Overwatch continues to fight back. In-game events, hero trailers, animated comics, short stories, and map updates will tell a story across six seasons rolled out throughout the entire year, beginning with the launch of five new heroes on February 10 as Season 1 begins. On the Talon side, new heroes will include Domina (tank), Emre (damage), and Mizuki (support), and on Overwatch we'll get Anran (damage) and Jetpack Cat (support). More heroes will join in the future, with a new hero added in each of Season 2-6 to come. A new story arc is planned to begin with another Season 1 in 2027.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Overwatch "The Reign of Talon" New Hero Images</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other updates include a new Meta Event called Conquest, where players choose to align with either Overwatch or Talon over five weeks to compete for rewards including lootboxes, skins, and titles. We'll also be seeing a major UI and UX overhaul with a new hero lobby and a promise of faster navigation. And we're also getting a Hello Kitty-themed in-game event from February 10-23.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/03/spotlight-2026-roadmap-1770137812637.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid all of this, Blizzard is officially dropping the "2" from Overwatch 2, and referring to it going forward just as Overwatch. As a press release explains: "Overwatch is more than just a digit: it's a living universe that keeps growing, keeps surprising, and keeps bringing players together from around the world. This year marks a huge turning point in how the development team envisions the future of Overwatch, so we are officially dropping '2' and moving forward as 'Overwatch'."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The newly-dubbed "Overwatch" will also be getting an upgraded Nintendo Switch 2 edition in the spring (both the original Overwatch and Overwatch 2 are currently available on Nintendo Switch, and thus Switch 2, but do not have dedicated Switch 2 upgraded versions).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no surprise that Blizzard might want to wipe the slate clean from the struggle that has been Overwatch 2. The sequel/revamp of 2016's popular hero shooter Overwatch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-blizzard-apologizes-for-shaky-launch-promises-fixes-for-queues-and-more">stumbled out of the gate</a>, and while it saw a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-has-reached-over-25-million-players-in-its-first-10-days-35-million-in-its-first-month">massive surge of players at the start</a>, those numbers <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-engagement-and-player-investment-is-declining-activision-blizzard-admits">dropped in the following year</a>. As time went on, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-becoming-the-worst-user-reviewed-game-ever-on-steam-overwatch-2s-recent-reviews-jump-to-mixed">user reviews complained</a> about a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-becomes-worst-user-reviewed-game-on-steam-ever-even-as-tens-of-thousands-turn-up-to-play">number of issues</a> such as monetization and controversies around the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-pve-hero-mode-canceled-a-difficult-choice">cancellation of the game's long-awaited PvE Hero mode</a>.

The fact remains that Overwatch 2 has never quite lived up to the hype levels of its predecessor, Overwatch, and this could be an attempt on Blizzard's part to regain some of that glory - especially by focusing so much on story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Long-rumored cuts hit The Washington Post this morning, seeing the paper <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/media/washington-post-layoffs-sports-rcna257354?ref=aftermath.site"><u>axe</u></a> its sports and books sections and “Post Reports” podcast, drastically shrink both local and international coverage, and lay off what so far is reported to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/media/washington-post-layoffs.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>30%</u></a> of its staff. It’s a terrible day for the paper, and for journalism broadly, and absolutely none of it had to happen.&nbsp;</p><p>The cuts were announced via a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benmullin.bsky.social/post/3mdzqnj7zi22r?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Zoom call</u></a> this morning, with executive editor Matt Murray instructing staff to stay home rather than come to the office. According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/maxtani.bsky.social/post/3me22xvoxjs2h?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Max Tani</u></a>, Murray said the cuts were to position the paper “to become more essential to people's lives, and what is becoming a more crowded, competitive and complicated media landscape, and after some years when, candidly, the Post has had struggles to do that." After the meeting, staff were informed whether they still had jobs via email.&nbsp;</p><p>(Aftermath co-founder Nathan Grayson and I were both previously employed at The Washington Post, and our desk, Launcher, was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/washington-post-is-closing-launcher-its-highly-regarded-video-game-website?ref=aftermath.site"><u>shuttered during layoffs</u></a> in 2023.)</p><p>The Post’s struggles were certainly not caused by the staff of the paper themselves, who consistently put out good, important work in the endlessly trying circumstances of both the world at large and journalism specifically. They were certainly not caused by a lack of money, in the most essential sense; staffers have been <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2026/01/fearing-major-layoffs-current-and-former-posties-rally-around-savethepost-campaign/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>appealing for weeks</u></a> to owner Jeff Bezos, who could fund the paper forever if he felt like it, to stop the cuts.&nbsp;</p><p>Having a billionaire owner does not, of course, equate to a healthy business. The Post has been shedding subscribers since the decision to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/10/29/washington-post-cancellations-number/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>pull an endorsement</u></a> of Kamala Harris in 2024, and continued to be in freefall as the outlet’s <a href="https://www.avclub.com/washington-post-subscriber-loss-opinion?ref=aftermath.site"><u>opinion section </u></a>was directed to swing right. Half-baked directives like the “<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/22/washington-post-third-newsroom?ref=aftermath.site"><u>third newsroom</u></a>” came and went, and staff fled the paper in droves as they saw the writing on the wall. Murray and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/30/nx-s1-5055648/washington-post-will-lewis-phone-hacking-scandal?ref=aftermath.site"><u>scandal-ridden</u></a> publisher Will Lewis may have come in with a mandate to turn things around, but if anything have dug the hole deeper. (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/herbscribner.bsky.social/post/3me24qpgb2c2n?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Axios</u></a> reports that Lewis wasn’t even on this morning’s call.)</p><p>If Murray’s goal is for WaPo to become “more essential” to readers’ lives, less diversified coverage doesn’t seem like the way to do it. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/02/04/nx-s1-5699328/washington-post-layoffs-jobs-bezos?ref=aftermath.site"><u>NPR</u></a> writes that “Now the <em>Post </em>appears poised to become primarily a federal paper, seeking to appeal almost exclusively to readers interested in issues about the U.S. government, with an emphasis on national security and American politics.”&nbsp;</p><p>This is certainly a top interest of readers of the Post, and a beat it made its name on during Trump’s first term and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2022/timeline-watergate-scandal-revelations/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>before</u></a>. But as many Post staffers pointed out in their <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianstelter.bsky.social/post/3mdkxym5gqc2y?ref=aftermath.site"><u>calls to Bezos</u></a> in the weeks leading up to today’s layoffs, no beat exists in a <a href="https://aftermath.site/star-reporter-talent-pr-washington-post/"><u>vacuum</u></a>: Desks shrunk or axed today, like sports and metro, provide essential knowledge and context for government and politics coverage, particularly when your local reporting covers the nation’s political hub of DC. You can’t cut some desks and assume the others will be fine; you can’t assume the paper can just do more with less, the favorite refrain of every media owner.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/washpostcomms/status/2019071299667063211?ref=aftermath.site"><u>message to staff</u></a> today, Murray highlighted a declining number of stories as one problem necessitating today’s cuts, writing that the paper’s “daily story output has substantially fallen in the last five years.” He also wrote that “we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.”&nbsp;</p><p>How the solution to these problems is <em>less </em>coverage, more narrowly focused, isn’t clear, but it’s hard to take any of today’s cuts and their half-assed justifications with any kind of good faith. It’s hard not to see this as Bezos, bored or maybe even actively hostile to the paper he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/02/jeff-bezos-destroy-washington-post?ref=aftermath.site"><u>once supported</u></a>, either intentionally trying to destroy it, or attempting to defang it to curry favor with Trump.</p><p>All of this is personal for me, as it is for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/02/washington-post-layoffs-bezos/685872/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>others</u></a> who’ve written about today’s bloodbath. I spent a day shy of a year at the Post, coming in to run a desk that was closed three months after my hire, and two months after I moved to DC for the job after over 20 years in New York. In a show of something like decency, which I did appreciate even if I wasn’t very good at expressing it, I was moved to another department rather than getting laid off with my team, and I spent a miserable season struggling to climb the stairs to where the bulk of the journalists sat without having to cry in the bathroom afterward because I wanted so badly to be sitting up there with them. But even at my own personal worst, I was awestruck by the people around me and the efforts they made so naturally to give me chances to shine: Slack messages from other desks asking for expertise on games or trans issues, meetings with teams eager to collaborate with my new team, opportunities to help lead an employee resource group or attend staff-led skill shares or just go on a lunchtime bike ride to visit the cherry blossoms at Hains Point.&nbsp;</p><p>I found the Post to be an astonishingly collaborative newsroom, where my colleagues seemed to want me there even if executives didn’t, where bosses and peers made far more effort than I deserved to meet me where I was. People shared stories of their own career setbacks and told me the Post was a place where I could bounce back, where opportunities could be open to me if I stuck it out. Even though I eventually decided to leave to start Aftermath, I still feel an admiration for and allegiance to the Post that sometimes feels unearned for the amount of time I actually spent there.</p><p>So it’s hard for me to see the big picture of today’s layoffs when they have so many specific names and faces attached, when I know first-hand how much better the people affected today deserve. That Lewis and Murray and Bezos–if Bezos is even paying attention–could look at all these people and their work and their kindness and their dedication and decide the paper would be better off without them is unthinkable to me, but I’ve long given up on trying to understand how media executives think.&nbsp;</p><p>An outlet with the talent the Post has on hand, with the resources Bezos is able to pour into it, should not be doing layoffs of this scope and scale. Not just because, essentially, it doesn’t <em>need </em>to, but because any decision-maker who’s risen to the position of calling these shots should be smart enough to look at the paper and recognize that the value of the thing they have comes from its abundance: the various desks and experts and coverage areas that all work together to make the paper what it is. A lesser paper is not going to win more subscribers or bring the company more money. A narrow focus on a particular conception of politics, at a time when Trump and his ilk are using every avenue possible–<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/02/politics/kennedy-center-trump-renovations?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the arts</u></a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/03/trump-administration-coalie-mascot-fossil-fuels?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the environment</u></a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/16/politics/trump-great-health-care-bill-details?ref=aftermath.site"><u>healthcare</u></a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/17/state-department-secret-playbook-sports-trump-00735496?ref=aftermath.site"><u>sports</u></a>, and more–to foster their agenda will not serve readers or stand up to power. It’s just going to make the Post’s coverage worse, and its staff more overworked and unhappy, and the paper less relevant to readers who need a robust free press.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe this is what Bezos wants. It’s certainly what Trump and his administration want. Not just a worse paper, but a worse environment for journalism as a whole, with fewer jobs, less coverage to draw from, a shorter horizon to picture as young journalists imagine what their careers could be.&nbsp;</p><p>Immiseration is one of the ruling class’ most powerful tools these days, and that feels like the only logic today’s layoffs have. They make the public less informed, and silence current and would-be journalists without the need for <a href="https://theconversation.com/trump-lawsuits-seek-to-muzzle-media-posing-serious-threat-to-free-press-272850?ref=aftermath.site"><u>lawsuits</u></a> and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2026/2/4/trump-hits-out-at-reporter-for-question-on-epstein-survivors?ref=aftermath.site"><u>insults</u></a>. Today’s cuts feel like a PR move as much as a corporate one, a reminder of the <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/" rel="noreferrer">power of the rich</a>, who can make worse so many lives without having to <em>do </em>anything, without even having to acknowledge it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s hard not to talk about the Post like it’s dead, though of course it’s not. I have every confidence the people remaining will do the best work possible with what they have in front of them, because they believe their audience deserves it, even if their executives and owner don’t. But it simply doesn’t have to be like this, not for a paper owned by one of the world’s richest men, and not for a journalism industry that’s more essential than ever.</p>

              <p>Last year’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-is-it-good-reboot-jp-film-1851785757"><em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em> was a totally fine</a>, but not very memorable<em> Jurassic Park</em> sequel. That’s been most of what we’ve gotten from the dinosaur-filled franchise over the last decade or so. But if, like me, you crave something better, something more like the original books and film, then you should check out an ongoing YouTube series that is one of my favorite things on the internet.</p> <p>YouTuber Ali Awada has been making animated <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-jurassic-world-rebirth-movies-ranked-1851776876">Jurassic Park</a></em> videos since 2023. And while some of his earlier attempts weren’t highly polished, with choppy animations and weird edits, they showed that the creator understood how to produce scary videos using the world of <em>Jurassic Park</em>. And Awada’s most recent <em>Jurassic Park</em> series is a massive improvement over that past work.</p>

  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/GFuDk8PB1KU?list=PLEaHBaexswf_orH4auAn5hXD1TXhJbSYx"><em>Muldoon’s Logs</em></a> is an ongoing found-footage-like VHS horror series made up of 12- to 20-minute-long videos from the point of view of <em>Jurassic Park</em> game warden and khaki shorts lover Robert Muldoon. You know, the guy who gets eaten by a raptor in the first movie after saying, “Clever girl.” In Awada’s series, we get to see what Muldoon was up to before the movie, as he helped run the park and manage its dinos.</p> <p>Each installment features Muldoon checking on various dinosaurs while dealing with a mystery involving rogue velociraptors that keep causing problems. Where these raptors come from, how they got into different parts of the park, and who is to blame are questions the series has been teasing for weeks now with each new upload. And I’m hooked.</p>

 <p><em>Muldoon’s Logs</em> aren’t the scariest YouTube videos around, but instead are more of a slow burn. You get a lot of time to just chill with Muldoon as he interacts with the dinos or investigates different scenarios. This builds the tension as you know something bad or scary is going to happen before the video ends. And when that happens, like a raptor appearing where it shouldn’t or a T-Rex chase, it’s exciting and tense.</p>

  <p><em>Muldoon’s Logs</em> are a great example of how <em>Jurassic Park</em> can be the perfect franchise for horror-adjacent projects and movies, something the franchise proper doesn’t do enough of. Dinosaurs stalking around is creepy stuff, and Awada taps into that, with the VHS aesthetic helping to hide some of the limitations while also making it all feel more real. I hope the upcoming horror game <a href="https://kotaku.com/finally-we-got-some-new-gameplay-of-that-scary-looking-jurassic-park-game-2000617830"><em>Jurassic Park Survival</em></a> is as scary or scarier than <em>Muldoon’s Logs.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>And for <em>Jurassic Park</em> lore nerds, you’ll enjoy all the large and small references to the movies, games, and books, including characters from the Telltale <em>Jurassic Park</em> game being name-dropped and Awada skillfully explaining why the Dilophosaur is so different in the novel compared to the film. In fact, something I really appreciate about <em>Muldoon’s Logs</em> is how often the writing reminds me of the technical, science-heavy dialogue found in Michael Crichton’s original books.</p>

 <p>If you’e a <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-worst-and-weirdest-jurassic-park-games-1826918812"><em>Jurassic Park</em></a> fan and/or someone who enjoys VHS found-footage horror, <em>Muldoon’s Logs</em> are perfect for popping on at night in a dark room and getting lost in a creepy, tense atmosphere.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/blizzard-entertainment/" id="87642">Blizzard </a>confirms <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/overwatch/" id="197">Overwatch </a>will drop the “2,” launching a year-long Reign of Talon story arc with new heroes and seasons through 2026.</p>



<p>During the Overwatch Spotlight on February 4, Blizzard announced that not only are they launching the first year-long story for Overwatch with the “Reign of Talon” plot, but moving forward, the game would simply be known as Overwatch again. Season one of the new format begins on February 10. This arc will run through 2026, with five additional seasons, after which a new story arc will begin with season 1 in 2027.</p>



<p>Along with the new season will come the launch of five new heroes. Three of the heroes will be Talon-aligned: Domina, a tank hero; Emre, a damage hero; and Mizuki, a support hero. There will also be two Overwatch-aligned heroes: Anran (damage) and Jetpack Cat (support).</p>

<h2 id="h-the-reason-for-the-shift-away-from-overwatch-2-explained">The Reason for the Shift Away From Overwatch 2 Explained</h2>



<p>In a press release, the Overwatch team explained that they’re dropping the “2” from the game title because they believe the game is more than a number or an expansion; it’s a living universe, and this year marks a turning point in development.</p>



<p>“This year marks a huge turning point in how the development team envisions the future of Overwatch, so we are officially dropping the ‘2’ and moving forward as Overwatch,” they said.</p>



<p>Overwatch officially became Overwatch 2 in 2022, shifting to a 5v5 PVP-style game. In May 2023, Blizzard canceled planned hero missions for the game, which were to have RPG-style skill trees. The cancellation was due to the risk of diverting too many development resources from the live service game. </p>







<p>Now, the game again shifts focus and makes a new attempt to reach more players while still giving current players something to look forward to.</p>
