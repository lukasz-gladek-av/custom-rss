		<p>The endurance racing management simulator, GT Racing, is set to launch in early access on September 3rd, available on Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG. GT Manager challenges players to create and manage an endurance racing team from scratch, overseeing all aspects of running the team such as finances, driver and staff recruitment, securing sponsorships, and track performance during racing events.</p>

            <p>
UK spending on video games plummeted by 29.4 percent during the first half of this year, while music and video sales grew. 
</p>
<p>
Physical game sales fell by 40 percent to £111.7m compared to the first six months of 2023, while digital download sales fell 23 percent to £236.9m.
</p>
<p>
The numbers, reported by the Digital Entertainment and Retail Association (<a href="https://www.eraltd.org/music-outpaces-video-and-games-in-first-half-of-2024-with-sales-revenues-up-7-9">ERA</a>), reflect a "soft new release schedule", according to its latest report.

<p>
"It was a tough first half for the games business with a lack of heavy-hitting releases, but we are optimistic for a strong second half, the traditional time for blockbuster releases," ERA boss Kim Bayley said. 
</p>
<p>
The first half of 2023 notably included the launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom for Nintendo Switch. Compare that to the first six months of this year, and there's nothing of quite the same scale. Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth for PlayStation 5 was perhaps the most notable launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-underperforming-says-industry-analyst">though sales haven't matched its predecessor</a>. 
</p>
<p>
As Bayley notes, however, a slew of 2024 blockbusters are on the horizon - including Star Wars Outlaws in August, EA Sports FC 25 and The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom in September, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> in October, plus <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.
</p>
<p>
UK spending on both music (including vinyl, CD and downloads) and video (including DVD, Blu-Ray, digital) both grew over the same period. 
</p>
<p>
Music sales grew by 7.9 percent, driven by Record Store Day and the launch of new Taylor Swift breakup album The Tortured Poets Department, including its lead single Fortnight (nothing to do with Fortnite). 
</p>
<p>
Video sales also grew, despite declining sales for physical media (that sounds familiar!). A drop in DVD and Blu-ray spending was offset by growth in video downloads and digital sales - which does not include money spent on streaming subscriptions to Netflix, Amazon or Disney+.
</p>
<p>
Still, despite video games' sizable 29.4 percent drop in sales year-on-year, the sector remained far larger than either music or video overall. Total spending on video games from January to June 2024 stood at £348.6m, compared to £213.7m for video and £163.8m for music.

			<p>A new Zelda: Ocarina Of Time mod promises to turn the classic entry in the series into the latest, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, by introducing a new gameplay mechanic.</p>
<p>This new mod, which is being developed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@notchase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notCHase</a> for the Ship of Harkinian open-source PC port, gives Link the power to fuse objects to weapons and shields similar to Tears of the Kingdom. While this ability definitely breaks the game, the possibilities it offers are very interesting to see. Sadly, the mod is not yet available for download, but hopefully, it won't take long for it to launch. In the meantime, you can check it out in the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="If Link could Fuse Objects to Weapons &amp; Shields in Ocarina of Time" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LE3af5aN8TY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Ship of Harkinian is one of the native Zelda: Ocarina of Time PC ports available for download. It offers additional features not found in the original, such as higher framerate support, a variety of visual and gameplay enhancements, including the higher-quality textures found on the Nintendo 3DS port, a built-in randomizer, and more. The same team that developed this port is also working on a native PC port of <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-majoras-mask-native-pc-port/">Majora's Mask.</a></p>
<p>You can download the Zelda: Ocarina Of Time Ship of Harkinian port and learn more about it on its <a href="https://www.shipofharkinian.com/">official website</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-review-bombed-over-new-battle-pass-move/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Respawn recently unveiled a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-overhauls-battle-passes-abandons-in-game-ac-currency-option/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new monetisation strategy</a> for Apex Legends, which essentially splits the Battle Pass into two separate passes and removes the use of AC or Apex Coins from the beginning of Season 22. This move has disappointed Apex Legends fans, as they have expressed their feelings by review-bombing the game on Steam. Learn more details below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-steam-reviews-battle-pass-controversy-1851595270" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, Apex Legends’ reviews on Steam have recently turned “Overwhelmingly Negative,” which shows players’ annoyance with this new strategy. Since the latest battle pass announcement, Apex Legends has gathered over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172470/Apex_Legends/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">10,000 negative reviews</a>, with most pointing fingers at the new battle pass system.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Starting with Season 22, we’re evolving the Apex Legends Battle Pass to improve your experience and progression goals.</p><p>Read on to learn everything to know about the upcoming changes or check out the infographic below to learn more. </p><p>📃: <a href="https://t.co/kg5NhlFfVq">https://t.co/kg5NhlFfVq</a> <a href="https://t.co/i516ktP9ma">pic.twitter.com/i516ktP9ma</a></p></div>— Apex Legends (@PlayApex) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayApex/status/1810330029265420515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Players with over <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dualz313/recommended/1172470/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">1,000 gameplay hours</a> have stated they are done with the game. Most players stated that even the “cheaters”, the “audio issues”, and other problems were bearable, but the new Battle Pass system is the end of the line for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the earlier system, players could purchase Battle Passes with AC coins, which players could earn back by progressing through the battle pass tiers during the season. They could be then used again to purchase the battle pass of the next season, making it a one-time purchase. With the new IRL currency strategy, players will have to shell out around $20 each season if they want to acquire all content from both battle passes, which isn’t ideal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, we have seen the remarkable influence of the gaming community on games in recent times. The most recent instance was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/negative-helldivers-2-reviews/">Helldivers 2 review bombing fiasco</a>. Players were against a required PSN login to play the game, even on Steam. Their protest ended <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-positive-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strong-arming Sony Interactive Entertainment</a> into removing the need for PSN on Steam, a win for the gaming community. This shows the power of the community to influence change. Hopefully, the Apex Legends community can achieve a similar feat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In other news, Apex Legends Champion <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-champion-apex-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ImperialHal stated</a>, “Apex is Dying”. This statement, coupled with the ongoing review bombing, raises concerns about the game’s future. Also, a leak is teasing a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-leaks-possibly-tease-new-district-map/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new ‘District’ map </a>for the title.

            <p>
A Microsoft team leader has emailed thousands of staff to protest the closure of a major internal group focused on promoting diversity, equity and inclusion within the company. 
</p>
<p>
The outgoing staff member blasted Microsoft's decision to cut their team amid a wider cooling in the corporate space to the need for diversity groups generally. 
</p>
<p>
A quote from the email first published by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-layoffs-dei-leader-email-2024-7">Business Insider</a> claims that the team had been told it was "eliminated due to 'changing business needs'". 
</p>
<p>
In response, a Microsoft spokesperson told the publication that its "D&amp;I commitments remain unchanged. Our focus on diversity and inclusion is unwavering and we are holding firm on our expectations, prioritising accountability, and continuing to focus on this work."

<p>
Microsoft has continually cut jobs over the past few years, and made more staff redundant on 1st July, per social media updates from those affected. Eurogamer contacted Microsoft for more detail on the numbers laid off at the time, but did not receive a response. 
</p>
<p>
"True systems-change work associated with DEI programs everywhere are no longer business critical or smart as they were in 2020," the laid-off team leader wrote in their email, highlighting a growing trend of cutting DEI-focused teams across the tech space. Google, Zoom and Facebook owner Meta have also laid off diversity-focused staff over the past year. 
</p>
<p>
In another section of their email, obtained by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-dei-lead-blasts-company-in-internal-email-after-team-is-reportedly-laid-off">IGN</a>, the team leader discussed some of the wider context behind the deprioritisation of DEI programs. In a nutshell, they say that the push for greater inclusion efforts that brought investment is fading, while political winds are also on the change.
</p>
<p>
"Unofficially in my opinion, not specific to Microsoft alone, but [right-wing Republican policy plan should Trump be re-elected] Project 2025 looms and true systems change work associated with DEI programs everywhere are no longer business critical or smart as they were in 2020. Hence the purposeful and strategic three-to-five year shelf life of many company's inclusion commitments post the murder of George Floyd are being re-evaluated.
</p>
<p>
"And the way I see it, the timing was impeccable so businesses everywhere could re-evaluate the path forward should their US federal contracts be at risk if the work continues on its face."

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">Microsoft laid off 1900 people across Xbox and Activision Blizzard in January</a> this year, following earlier layoffs in 2023. Across the video games industry as a whole, more than 20,000 people are thought to have been let go over the past two years, with more let go in 2024 so far than the whole of last year.

			<p>Still Wakes the Deep Patch 1.3 has been deployed, finally adding support for DLSS, FSR3 and XeSS upscaling to the PC Game Pass version.</p>
<p>The Chinese Room's survival horror title was released across PC and consoles last month. The game was also made available on Game Pass upon launch. <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-pc-once-again-lacks-nvidia-dlss-amd-fsr-at-still-wakes-the-deeps-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unfortunately, the Game Pass PC release once again lacked several features</a>, including support for NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR3, and Intel XeSS upscaling. As confirmed by the development team last month, a new update would add support for DLSS for the Game Pass version. In addition, the team said that it was investigating the possibility of AMD FSR3 support. "The Chinese Room and Secret Mode are hearing you and we'll be working to rectify this issue as our highest priority", the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1622910/discussions/0/4345491756988100844/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> last month. "DLSS implementation is in progress, and will be rolled out in July as part of the patch above."</p>
<p>Fast forward one month, and we now have this promised patch. Not only does it add support for DLSS, but as mentioned, support for FSR3 and XeSS as well. In addition, for PC Game Pass, this new update adds additional resolution options when playing the game in windowed mode. Aside from the support for the different upscaling techniques and new resolution modes for the PC Game Pass version, this new update also packs various bug fixes as as well as some other new features. You can find the full release notes for this new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1622910/view/6783067225509637923" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch here</a>.</p>
<p>Still Wakes the Deep is available worldwide now for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. As said, the title is also available through Game Pass. Here's what we wrote about The Chinese Room's title in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/still-wakes-the-deep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our launch review</a>:</p>
<p><em>While Still Wakes the Deep offers up its fair share of thrills, railroad-style level design, a short runtime, and a surprisingly superficial story result in an experience that may entertain in the moment, but will likely be forgotten rather quickly. Still Wakes the Deep may well float your boat at a discount, but there are better, scarier fish in the sea.</em></p>

            <p>When <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clickolding">Clickolding</a> - a vaguely <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inscryption">Inscryption</a>-y sub-hour dread droplet -  opens, you’re sitting on a bed across from a man wearing a mask that looks like someone gave up halfway through carving an Easter Island statue of Joe Camel, stuck a pair of googly eyes on it, then went to cry in the corner at what they’d created.</p>
<p>In your hand is a clicker counter. Moose-face stares. What do those eyes convey? Patience? Intent? Longing? If nothing else, they betray a deep certainty that whatever else happens, you’re going to click. If you stop clicking for a moment, a prompt appears in the corner telling you the controls. At least, I think it's a prompt, because it might actually be a threat.</p>
<p>Left click to click. He'd like you to click 1000 times, please.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>1000 clicks before I get a big wad of cash, I’m told. That’s why I’m here. Immediately, a burning mystery presents itself: Are you really going to make me click 1000 times, game? Or, more pertinently, am I really going to click hundreds of times just to find out?</p>

<p>At irregular intervals, the man will speak to you, and thus I predictably begin to form superstitious rituals around the clicker. What if I click it really fast? What if I get to this number? What if I don’t click it at all? I soon discover I can hold the space bar down to click and feel like a genius. I balance my speaker remote on my space bar and go do some crunches. I’m still watching the screen, of course. I’m not taking my eyes off this camel fucker.</p>
<p>He is deeply unnerving.  On his shirt is either blood or the delicious Korean fermented soy and chilli paste known as gochujang. And buddy, I do not think it is the delicious Korean fermented soy and chilli paste known as gochujang. I try watching the static on the tv for a while, but no. I feel his googly eyes burning into my back.</p>
<p>Some nice jazz occasionally swells up in the background, but I can’t really enjoy over the sound of the clicking. It would be presumptuous of me to suggest that my clicking, rhythmic and routine as it is, provides a complementary improvisation to such wonderful brass. Still, I choose to hear a certain freeform chaos between the clacks of plastic on plastic, scores of minor entropic armageddons, in the knowledge that any act of time wasting is also a very minor act of self destruction.</p>
<p>I’m sorry. I’ve just been clicking for so long.</p>
<p>I start timing the clicks. With the spacebar held down, it’s about ten every two generous seconds. That’s three hundred click per minute. That’s…uh. It’s a long time. It’s a long, long time to be clicking a clicker. I’m not going to stop of, course. I’m in too deep at this point.</p>
<p>The real gag at the heart of Clickolding, despite the pun name and the hints you’re indulging in your captor-client's kink, is that you're the mark here. It's a guiltily gratifying act of self-imposed BDSM, one humiliating click after the other. Then again, so is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4-best-class">Diablo 4</a>, and at least this has the decency to not threaten you with another season. You can grab Clickolding <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3011440/CLICKOLDING/">on Steam</a> for £2.24/€2.69/$2.69. I’d give it a resounding thumbs up, but my hands need a rest.</p>
<p><em>Clickolding is by Strange Scaffold, whose Creative Director Xalavier Nelson Jr. has written many words for RPS.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/blizzard-sends-1-month-pc-game-pass-trial-triggering-speculation-of-more-games-joining-the-service/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blizzard-sends-1-month-pc-game-pass-trial-triggering-speculation-of-more-games-joining-the-service-soon.929328/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blizzard-sends-1-month-pc-game-pass-trial-triggering-speculation-of-more-games-joining-the-service/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Blizzard Entertainment began emailing its users one-month PC Game Pass trial codes (only usable on new accounts). I got one myself, and there are many other reports <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1e5920i/blizzard_has_started_sending_out_pc_game_pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on places like Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about the offer is that it is set to expire on July 24. You have a week to redeem your code. Why July 24, though? Well, recent rumors have suggested a new wave of Activision Blizzard games might be about to be added to the subscription service.</p>
<p>Chief among them is, of course, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-is-coming-to-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</a>. Call of Duty fans have been looking forward to the massive first-person shooter franchise being added to Game Pass, and the new Modern Warfare III season drops on July 24. Microsoft might be trying to get more new users in ahead of the game's arrival on the subscription service.</p>
<p>In addition to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, we also <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-activision-blizzard-games-are-reportedly-launching-on-game-pass-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> rumors that Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Spyro: Reignited Trilogy, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 will soon join Game Pass. However, these are all Activision titles and the promotion email came specifically from Blizzard. As such, it's not far-fetched to imagine some Blizzard games might be part of this new wave following <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lands-on-game-pass-on-march-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diablo IV's example</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Remasters like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-ii-resurrected-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diablo II: Resurrected</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warcraft-iii-reforged-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warcraft III: Reforged</a> come to mind, as well as classics like Starcraft and Diablo III, not to mention perks for Overwatch 2. Then there's the long-standing dream of World of Warcraft joining Game Pass, although that's hard to imagine coming to fruition, given that the monthly subscription price of Blizzard's MMORPG is higher than PC Game Pass ($14.99 versus $11.99). Perhaps they could offer a discount.</p>
<p>Adding a good chunk of the extraordinary Activision Blizzard portfolio would surely go a long way toward convincing consumers that Game Pass is still convenient even after the<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> latest price increase.</a> As a reminder, the Ultimate tier will cost $19.99, up from $16.99; the PC tier will be raised to $11.99 from $9.99, and the console tier will be unavailable to new users, replaced by a more limited Standard tier priced at $14.99.</p>
<p>According to analysts, Game Pass users should anticipate <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-users-should-expect-more-price-bumps-in-the-future-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even more hikes in the future</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-series-x-deal-prime-day-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Grab a free game or controller alongside your new console.</h2></div><div><section><p>The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-s-review">Xbox Series X</a> is the premier <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-xbox-console-release-dates-in-order">Xbox console</a> on the market right now. With 4K resolution, 120fps support, and instant loading thanks to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ssd">speedy SSD</a>, every game is a joy to play on Xbox Series X. Alongside the numerous features for home entertainment, the Series X can easily be the perfect home console for any gamer. It's a major upgrade over the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-s-review">Xbox Series S</a>, which is only capable of 1440p output on select titles. </p><p>Now's as good a chance as any to pick up a new Xbox with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-amazon-prime-day-sales-and-deals">Amazon Prime Day</a> running through Wednesday night and other retailers with their own competing sales. As part of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-sale-prime-day-2024">Best Buy's Black Friday in July sale</a>, you can save $50 off a new Xbox Series X console. Not only that, but you will also get a free $50 Best Buy gift card with your purchase, which you can use to score a new game or controller. </p><h2>Xbox Series X + $50 Best Buy Gift Card for $449</h2><div id="204354" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>FREE $50 BEST BUY GIFT CARD WITH PURCHASE</p></div><p><h3>Microsoft - Xbox Series X 1TB Console - Black</h3></p></div>Immediately upon purchase, the gift card will be emailed to you alongside your receipt. Since Best Buy's sale is open to everyone, you won't need to be a My Best Buy member to score this gift card. <p>The Xbox Series X is a great console overall for any game you'd like to play. With Game Pass Ultimate – grab a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-is-43-off-for-prime-day-stock-up-now-and-avoid-the-price-hike">three-month subscription for 43% off for Prime Day</a> – you can even stream games over the cloud and pick up where you left off, even if you're not home.</p><h2>What We Said In Our Review</h2><p>Xbox Series X is an excellent console that offers the most power available in the console space currently. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-review">In our review</a>, we said the following about the Series X: "No matter what current games you throw at it, your loading times will be drastically cut, your framerates will be smoother, and your resolutions will be higher. This bold and minimalistically designed box is quiet, compact for both the power it packs and especially how it compares to the PS5, capable, and loaded with convenience features like instantly resuming and cycling between any of your recently played games."
</p><h3>Is It Worth Buying At This Price?</h3><p>If you are currently a Game Pass subscriber or plan to subscribe to the service, Xbox Series X is a great choice. You'll get hundreds of games instantly to play through, with the best performance available in the Xbox ecosystem. Plus, with the 4K Disc drive, you can play any <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-part-two-deal-prime-day-2024">4K Blu-rays</a> with ease.</p><p>However, if you're in no rush to purchase a new console, you'll likely find far better deals later in the year for Black Friday, especially as Xbox plans to release <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-and-black-ops-6-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">three new console variants</a>. It's likely that the current Xbox Series X will be discounted alongside these releases to push more Xbox consoles into the market.</p><p>For more Xbox deals, be sure to check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-deals-prime-day-2024">best Xbox deals of Prime Day 2024</a>.</p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 17, 2024 1:39 am</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Revealed first to the public in 2019, this Soulslike action RPG garnered a great deal of interest in Korea and abroad for its unique pixel graphics and gameplay. Selected as the first game in the collaboration campaign by North American crowdfunding site <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gameround/chrono-sword-0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> and the global game testing platform Game Round.Inc in 2020, it raised over seventy thousand dollars to successfully reach its funding goal.</p><p>Developer 21c.Ducks has submitted <em>Chrono Sword</em> to a number of game shows in Korea and abroad, where it was praised and awarded by a number of these for its gameplay. The developer then used this as a chance to refine the gameplay and level design within the game.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_899380"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><em>Chrono Sword</em> isn’t another 3D rendered game like many of the Souls-like <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,243 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPGs</a> released these days, instead rendered in an isometric pixel art style for this unique Souls-like. Since 21c.Ducks announced the game, they’ve shown a heart and soul commitment to elevating the game’s storyline and the features that make it a Soulslike action RPG.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Chrono Sword</em> spans a vast land splayed out in three dimensions, all rendered in its pixel art style. Once inside, players will embark on a “journey through time,” able to venture between the past, present, and future, switching between maps seamlessly with no loading screens.</p><p>In addition, the game features a variety of systems that incorporate the heavy enemy and player hits common to the Souls-like genre, but with the action made faster and more intense. Details of the enhancements made to <em>Chrono Sword</em> will be revealed at a later date.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

Considering the white version is already showing low stock, you may want to snag one soon. Both the white and black models are eligible for Amazon's deal, which knocks 30% off the 8BitDo Arcade Stick's $120 list price.

The Switch version works wirelessly via Bluetooth and the included 2.4GHz dongle.</p><p dir="ltr">The sticks are nearly identical, save for the platform-specific menu buttons and dials. Each controller comes with a stick and eight face buttons. The Switch edition can connect via Bluetooth, 2.4GHz wireless via a dongle that slots into a hidden USB port on the bottom of the controller, and wired with the included USB-C cable. The Xbox edition boasts both wireless and wired connections, but it doesn't have Bluetooth.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4335657-8bitdoarcadestick.png" data-ref-id="1300-4335657" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4335657-8bitdoarcadestick.png" data-ref-id="1300-4335657"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Arcade Stick</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4335657-8bitdoarcadestick.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The 8BitDo Arcade Stick's simple design makes it easy to start playing right out of the box, but it's also moddable--including support for swapping out the buttons and joystick with components from other fight sticks--for those who want to fine-tune the controller's feel. PC users can also program their own button macros using the free 8BitDo Ultimate software. It's also more affordable than most fight sticks, even at full price, making this discount all the more enticing.</p><p dir="ltr">Amazon has plenty of other great discounts on 8BitDo products right now, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdos-commodore-64-inspired-keyboard-gets-a-big-prime-day-discount/1100-6524900/" data-ref-id="1100-6524900">awesome mechanical keyboards</a> that pay homage to retro gaming consoles.

                <p>Today, Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1813287523780641094" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">released a brand new</a> dynamic background for download, and it's based on the iconic "Blades" format first introduced with the Xbox 360.</p><p>The interface shows the green and grey colors that made this design so memorable back in 2005. However, it's only a dynamic background and you can't actually flip through anything. In order to change your background, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Press the Xbox button in the middle of the controller to bring up the menu</li><li>Scroll over to Profile &amp; System and click Settings. Under the General tab, click on Personalization, then go to My Background then to Dynamic Backgrounds.</li><li>Under the Featured Tab, choose Xbox 360 Blades</li></ul><p>This move seems like a final acknowledgement of the Xbox 360 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-xbox-360-store-is-closing-but-dont-get-too-worried/1100-6516956/" data-ref-id="1100-6516956">before its storefront closes down for good on July 29</a>. While you'll still be able to buy and download Xbox 360 content that's backwards compatible with Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S through their respective digital storefronts, anything that can only be found through the Xbox 360 Marketplace will be gone after that date.</p><p>The Xbox 360 era is arguably Microsoft's most notable, as the Xbox brand really came into prominence when the console was first released in 2005. It's so iconic, in fact, that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-now-build-an-xbox-360-out-of-1342-mega-bloks/1100-6517575/" data-ref-id="1100-6517575">there's a $150 buildable replica of the Xbox 360 from Mega</a>.</p>

Though there are only 6 feature-length Terminator films, there was also the hit TV series <em>The Sarah Connor Chronicles</em>, and a brand new Netflix anime series coming out this year to catch up on. Check out our reviews of the 6 films below:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><em></em><a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-terminator"><em>The Terminator Review</em></a><em></em></li><li><em></em><a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/terminator-2-judgment-day"><em>Terminator 2: Judgement Day Review</em></a><em></em></li><li><em></em><a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/terminator-3-rise-of-the-machines"><em>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines Review</em></a><em></em></li><li><em></em><a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/terminator-salvation"><em>Terminator Salvation Review</em></a><em></em></li><li><em></em><a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/terminator-genesys"><em>Terminator Genisys Review</em></a><em></em></li><li><em></em><a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/terminator-6"><em>Terminator: Dark Fate Review</em></a><em></em></li></ul><h2>Where to Stream Online</h2><p>Below you will find links to stream almost all 6 Terminator movies online. For the moment, 5 of the Terminator movies are available to stream on various platforms online. Some of those streaming platforms are fuboTV, Peacock TV, Prime Video, Paramount+, Max, MGM+, Roku, Tubi, and TBS. 5 of the Terminator movies (<strong>excluding Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</strong>) are also available to rent or buy on Amazon or YouTube. </p><h3>Best Order to Watch in</h3><p>Since there is an element of time travel included in the canon of the Terminator movie series, the events can become a bit muddled; that's why watching them in order of release date is probably fine to do with this series.

            <p>
Rockstar's GTA+ subscription service could soon expand to include access to Switch versions of the company's games if a now-reverted recent update to its website is anything to go by.
</p>
<p>
GTA+, which is currently only available through Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, offers subscribers access to various <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-online-weekly-update-time-9302">GTA Online</a> items and a "rotating assortment" of Rockstar Games - including Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy, Red Dead Redemption, and LA Noire - for £6.99/€7.99/$7.99 USD a month.
</p>
<p>
A full list of games available to GTA+ members can be found on the Rockstar's website, with subscribers currently able to access titles across a range of platforms, including Xbox, PlayStation, the iOS App Store, and Google Play.

<p>
However, as spotted by <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2/status/1812959219680768485">TezFunz2 on X</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/rockstars-gta-subscription-service-could-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch/">VGC</a>) a recent update to <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-plus/benefits">Rockstar's website</a> added Switch versions to the list of Games Included With GTA+, prompting speculation the company might soon make it possible for GTA+ subscribers to play titles on Nintendo's platform as part of their membership.
</p>
<p>
While Switch's library of Rockstar games is limited, LA Noire, Gand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition, and Red Dead Redemption have all been ported to the console, making for a reasonable chunk of on-the-go action Rockstar could wield as additional incentive to tempt players toward GTA+.
</p>
<p>
Time will tell if Switch's recent inclusion on Rockstar's GTA+ Benefits page is a sign of things to come or merely meaningless placeholder art inadvertently let loose upon the world, but I've asked the company for comment, just in case it has something to say.
</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The rocket-assisted sidearm archetype, a pistol that literally shoots rockets, is one of the best gun types in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, and with the launch of Act 2 of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-the-final-shape-episode-echo-season-pass-gear-and-exotics/2900-5451/" data-ref-id="2900-5451">Episode: Echoes</a>, we're now up to three of these powerful, explosive-launching pistols in the game. While you'll still want to get a crafted god roll of The Call from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">The Final Shape</a>'s new destination, the Pale Heart of the Traveler, the newly released Aberrant Action is another gun you should be chasing. It too is craftable, and since it's a Solar gun, it carries some extremely useful perks that will help you in high-level PVE content.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How To Get Aberrant Action</h2><p dir="ltr">Aberrant Action is part of the Episode loot pool, so you'll need to complete Episode activities to earn it. That means heading into Breach Executable, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-enigma-protocol-guide-how-to-unlock-and-complete-the-episode-activity/1100-6524267/" data-ref-id="1100-6524267">Enigma Protocol</a>, or the newly released Nessus Battlegrounds missions in hopes of receiving Aberrant Action as a random reward. It seems more likely that you'll get them from the Battlegrounds playlist, probably because it and Aberrant Action are releasing together.</p><p dir="ltr">You're guaranteed at least one Aberrant Action for completing the story quests of the first week of Act 2, as well as Corrasion, the episode's new pulse rifle. You can also get Aberrant Action from Failsafe in the HELM when you turn in Echoes engrams, and eventually, you'll be able to focus those engrams to get Aberrant Action specifically--although, you can't unlock that ability in the first week.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4335557-20240716154833_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4335557" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4335557-20240716154833_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4335557"></a><figcaption>Aberrant Action</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4335557-20240716154833_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Aberrant Action God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr">Aberrant Action PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Quick Launch  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Velocity, +15 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: High Velocity Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Reload Speed, +10 Velocity</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Heal Clip  <ul><li dir="ltr">Reloading shortly after a final blow grants Cure to you and nearby allies.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Incandescent  <ul><li dir="ltr">Defeating a target spreads scorch to nearby enemies. More powerful combatants and Guardians spread scorch in a larger radius.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Velocity / Reload Speed</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Aberrant Action is a bit of a weaker option when compared to The Call and Indebted Kindness, the rocket-assisted sidearm you can get from the Spire of the Watcher dungeon. It might not wallop enemies quite as well as those other guns, but it makes up for that weakness with Solar build synergy.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a utility player that'll slot right in with your Solar builds thanks to the combination of Heal Clip and Incandescent, which work extremely well with Solar abilities, especially those reliant on scorch. Incandescent sets nearby enemies on fire when you get a kill, and Heal Clip heals you and nearby allies when you reload after a kill. In concert with other build elements that burn enemies and heal you, Aberrant Action is a great fit.</p><p dir="ltr">There are actually a few other good combinations for Aberrant Action, as well, if you find you want a version that's a little less dependent on a Solar use-case. Beacon Rounds, a new perk from The Final Shape, feels great, giving your sidearm rockets tracking once you get a kill with them. It's a great perk for dealing with enemies on the far side of an arena and can make up for the slower speed of rockets when compared to bullets from traditional guns.</p><p dir="ltr">Demolitionist is also pretty good, since you'll use your rocket-assisted sidearm to blow up and clear out lots of smaller enemies, which will boost your grenade up-time overall, and Reverberation boosts the size of your rocket explosions, which can help increase the overall utility of Aberrant Action for clearing weak enemies.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Aberrant Action PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Quick Launch  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Velocity, +15 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: High Velocity Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Reload Speed, +10 Velocity</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Heal Clip / Beacon Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">Heal Clip: Reloading shortly after a final blow grants Cure to you and nearby allies.</li><li dir="ltr">Beacon Rounds: Final blows with this weapon grant your projectiles tracking. Dealing further damage extends the duration.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Harmony / Golden Tricorn  <ul><li dir="ltr">Harmony: Final blows with other weapons improve this weapon's damage and performance for a short duration.</li><li dir="ltr">Golden Tricorn: Final blows with this weapon grant bonus damage. While this buff is active, grenade or melee kills of the same damage type greatly increase its damage and duration.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Velocity</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Aberrant Action isn't much of a PvP gun, so unless you love it, don't lean into that aspect of it. There are better rocket-assisted sidearms for the job, and generally, they're not well-suited to taking down Guardians anyway. If you do go with Aberrant Action in the Crucible, put your emphasis on boosting damage and the gun's Velocity stat, as it'll make those rockets harder to dodge.</p><p dir="ltr">For perks, your combo will depend on how you play in the Crucible. Heal Clip can help you get through dangerous situations with a boost of health after you use the gun to land a kill, making it a handy clean-up weapon in dual scenarios. Beacon Rounds, on the other hand, can pair well with Harmony, where you're going after more opponents after racking up a kill with another weapon, giving you a damage boost and, potentially, tracking on your rockets. More aggressive players will likely want the Beacon Rounds / Harmony combo, but really, there's not much in the way of perk synergy that will help you withstand fights with multiple enemies here.</p>
