			<p>As part of the launch preparations, BioWare has <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/combat-and-progression?isLocalized=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a new blog post and video dedicated to the progression systems within Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p>The info dump begins with confirming the level cap, which the developers have set at 50. While experience points can be obtained by killing enemies and exploring the world, players will find it far easier to level up by completing quests, especially the bigger ones.</p>
<p>With each level, players will be granted a Skill Point to spend in the so-called Constellation Tree. There are many options to choose from, as detailed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large circle: Class (core skills and weapon proficiencies)</li>
<li>Diamond: Ability (can be assigned to an Ability slot)</li>
<li>Medium circle: Major Passive or Ability Upgrade (adds effects or modifies existing Abilities or stats, like guaranteeing a critical hit on knockdown or extending range)</li>
<li>Small hexagon: Trait (modifies existing class skill, like counter-attack, extending an attack combo or missile block/return)</li>
<li>Small circle: Minor Passive or Stat Boost (increases the efficacy of Abilities, Passive, or stats)</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<p>Very importantly, Skill Points can be refunded for the entire Skill Tree or individually at any time and for free, allowing Dragon Age: The Veilguard players a high degree of experimentation throughout their entire playthroughs.</p>
<p>As you would expect, given the type of game, there will be a variety of equipment to loot or purchase, including weapons, armor, and accessories. Each item will have its own unique stats and attributes. As weapons and armor evolve, duplicate items will allow you to increase stats and unlock additional features. Players can further upgrade and enchant the items through the Caretaker's Workshop in the Lighthouse hub. There will be a list of basic enchantments at first, but each time Rook upgrades the rank of the Caretaker's Workshop, more enchantments will become available. Each item or ability can have a single enchantment applied to it, and each enchantment can only be applied to a single item or ability at a time.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Upon creating their 'Rook' character, players will align with a faction. The chosen Faction will affect the initial appearance of the Rook, especially when dressed in casual clothing. However, all visible armor can be transmogrified' into anything else that has been collected via the wardrobe in the Lighthouse.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Progression Deep Dive | Parts 1-3" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wvr3OV8kYcM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Last but not least, Dragon Age: The Veilguard also allows the progression of Rook's companions, who are getting two Skill Points for each level. Ways to get experience for your companions include completing their personal quests as well as dialogues and decisions made with them.</p>
<p>Players may take two companions on missions. Each companion has its own gear to manage, which can also be upgraded and enchanted in the aforementioned Caretaker's Workshop. Companions also have Primers and Detonators, which can be combined with each other or with the Rook in combat. Each Primer has a matching Detonator. When the correct combination is used, a detonation is triggered - dealing increased damage over an area and increasing the stagger. For example, as seen in the video, Rook can use Toxic Dash to detonate the Sundered target, and Neve can detonate it with her Icebreaker ability.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be released on <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-to-launch-on-october-31/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 31</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/misfits-magic-season-2-announced-return-three-years-later<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hot off the heels of the stunning conclusion of<em> Never Stop Blowing Up</em> Dimension 20 is spinning up it's dome once more for a new season of role-play goodness. Today Dropout announced that <em>Misfits &amp; Magic</em> Season 2 will be premiering on September 25th.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Misfits &amp; Magic </em>season two sees the return of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a77a65bf-2dda-4081-be3d-d54808255109" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/aabria-iyengar-discusses-burrows-end-finale-dice-telling-story-and-what-happens">Aabria Iyengar</a> as the DM of this season of Kids on Brooms, a magic based expansion for Kids on Bikes.</p>
<p>Joining Aabria will be <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s">Brennan Lee Mulligan as Evan Kelmp</a>, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b6ff64e2-0570-485e-860b-402771d3faf6" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/we-chat-dimension-20-burrows-end-generational-trauma-and-environmental">Erika Ishii </a>as K, Danielle Radford as Sam Blask, and Lou Wilson as Whitney Jammer. All of the cast from the original season is reprising their roles as we get to catch up with the magical misfits three years after the events of the first season.</p>

<p>While not much has been officially revealed about this new season the ever-present theme of the winds of change has many members of the magical world spooked.</p>
<p>Throughout the trailer we get hints of the story among the characters reuniting, hints as to what each character might have been up to since we last spoke with them.</p>
<p>"Three years since the events that we last left off with. You're just at that age where you're exiting the traditional understanding of childhood and you're deciding who you want to be... and death is on the table"</p>
<p>A few interesting props in the dome were also shown off. Bicycle handles put into the dome for each player, a very clear reference to <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, a diorama of a solar system in the center of the table that we will see moving, and an animated tablet that will talk to the players.</p>
<p>Season Two of <em>Misfits &amp; Magic</em> will release on September 25th of Dropout.tv. There will be 11 episodes in total putting the finale episode on December 4th.</p>

            <p>Back in July, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> reached version 5.0 with the Worlds update, which refreshed its planetary generation to introduce more variety alongside more detailed water, clouds, and weather. We didn't write about it at the time, because I suppose re-writing the very fabric of the galaxy seemed small-time.
</p>
<p>Today's new update, however, adds fishing, and I can't not write about that.
</p>

Here's the trailer:

<figcaption>Actually the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zu-OxnMETY0">Aquarius update trailer is here</a>.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQS4oa-dgLY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update is called Aquarius, and it makes use of the Worlds update's fancy new oceans with their pulsing, reflective surfaces by allowing you to cast a line into them. There's a wide range of different underwater life to find, from "common minnow-like fish to huge alien marine mammals", according <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/09/aquarius-update/">to the announcement</a>. You'll need to find different bodies of water on different planets to collect them all.
</p>
<p>To help matters, there's a new "Exo-Skiff" which can be deployed, and is basically a hovering, customisable fishing platform. It's got a built-in fridge for storing your catches within. Or you can build your own automated fish farm, whcih will gather fish for you while you're elsewhere, killing some other kind of flora or fauna. However you collect your fish, you can cook 'em for dinner if you wish.
</p>
<p>I'm genuinely fond of fishing in games, particularly in those games like Zelda or Kirby where the fishing is far aside from the much more dramatic adventure I'm meant to be having. No Man's Sky's system seems to have a lot of charming detail, too, including the ability to catch "messages in bottles" left by other players. Cute.
</p>
<p>Aquarius is out now and free to all players. No Man's Sky is also currently 60% off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/">over on Steam</a> as part of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-space-exploration-fest-kicks-off-deals-and-demos-on-september-2nd">Steam Space Exploration Fest</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When these are shot, they’ll explode and damage whoever is around, including yourself. This is something you’ll want to use, especially when the game throws large waves of enemies your way. This will help ensure you effectively limit their numbers.</p><h2 id="h4048"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t be afraid to charge into a fight</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="b52c4813cc011989d3f32fa6eed0a952" data-recommend-id="image://b52c4813cc011989d3f32fa6eed0a952" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charging into a fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Charging into a fight." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b52c4813cc011989d3f32fa6eed0a952" data-recommend-id="image://b52c4813cc011989d3f32fa6eed0a952" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charging into a fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Half the fun of being a Space Marine is being able to rip and tear your enemies apart.

<p>Microsoft continues to not be happy with Apple. In a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66d6d0d19084b18b95709f13/Microsoft_WP_6_Redacted_version_-_TO_BE_PUBLISHED__1_.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new statement</a> surrounding the CMA (Competition and Markets Authority) investigation into the cloud gaming market, Microsoft says that Apple is making it “impossible to effectively monetize” its cloud gaming offering.</p>



<p>According to Microsoft, Apple’s commission fee is “neither economically sustainable nor justifiable”. </p>



<p>“The 30% commission fee makes it impossible for Microsoft to effectively monetize its cloud gaming service offering,” the company says. </p>



<p>Microsoft continues by calling out Apple’s requirement for services to make content, features, and subscriptions available for in-app purchases within the app. They say that it would require third-part developers needing to make major changes to their games to comply with the requirement, thus limiting potential competition.</p>



<p>“Beyond that, from a practical perspective, CGSPs have no way to ensure that third-party game developers recode their games to comply with this requirement,” they said. “As a result, the restriction effectively precludes CGSPs from offering third-party developed games.”</p>



<p>Lastly, Microsoft <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#business" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">calls issue with Guideline 3.1.1</a> from Apple which says that app developers can’t link to outside sources to purchase subscriptions. </p>



<p>“Apps in this section cannot, within the app, encourage users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase, except as set forth in 3.1.3(a),” Apple’s guidelines read. For the record, Guideline 3.1.3(a) allows exceptions for “reader” apps such as magazines, newspapers, etc..</p>



<p>Apple has not responded to the latest statement from Microsoft. In August, however, the company said that developers aren’t having many issues with the IAP requirement.”</p>



<p>A provisional decision from the CMA is expected to come in November. All parties have until the end of September to respond to the investigation.</p>

                <p>Winter is coming in Frostpunk 2, and if the last game was any indication, it's going to be brutal and result in a whole lot of deaths--possibly everyone in your settlement, if your city management isn't up to snuff.

The sequel expands on all the elements of the original Frostpunk, giving you larger cities to manage and a lot more humans to deal with. The idea is that, where nature was your biggest enemy in the original Frostpunk, your primary adversary in the sequel is human nature. There's an expanded, multi-chapter story to work through, and you'll have to contend with a city council, more factions, and bigger districts, with a story that sees you building and expanding over the course of months rather than days.</p><p>In addition to the standard edition of Frostpunk 2, Fanatical also offers the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Ffrostpunk-2-deluxe-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffrostpunk-2-releases-this-month-heres-how-to-save-30-on-your-preorder%2F1100-6526218%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Ddlvr.it%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Frostpunk 2: Deluxe Edition</a> on PC, which comes with more content and a few additional benefits. Nabbing the deluxe edition gets you Frostpunk 2's three post-release DLC add-ons, which you'd normally have to buy separately, as well as a digital art book and soundtrack. It also comes with an in-game item and a novella, Warm Flesh, which is part of a Frostpunk story anthology. In addition to the stuff you get, preordering the deluxe edition gets you access to Frostpunk 2's story mode on September 17, three days prior to the official launch.</p><p>You can preorder Frostpunk 2: Deluxe Edition at Fanatical for an even larger 30% discount, bringing the cost down to $52.49 from its usual price of $75.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred Mercenary Companions | Gamescom 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred expansion might finally give players the keys to the cow kingdom. As spotted by the dataminers over at <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/new-cow-level-hints-in-diablo-4-patch-2-0-ptr-346356" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, several curious items have been found in the test build for the game's 2.0 update, which will be released alongside Vessel of Hatred in October.</p><p dir="ltr">One of those items, the Rusted Bardiche, will look familiar to those who have experienced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-798">Diablo 2's</a> secret cow level, as it is the weapon wielded by the bi-pedal cow enemies found there. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-25658">Diablo 3</a>, transmuting the Bovine Bardiche item in Kanai's Cube granted access to Diablo 3's cow level, the "Not the Cow Level."</p><p dir="ltr">That's not the only datamined item that may lead to a secret level. Four others--the Unusual Key, the Rusted Old Bell, the Jabbering Gemstone, and the Crooked Staff--have also been datamined. These items (excluding the key) seem like fairly obvious references to Diablo 3's Wirt's Bell, Staff of Herding, and Gibbering Gemstone, which when used together opened a portal to Whimsyshire, aka the "pony" level.</p><p dir="ltr">Just because all these items have been datamined, however, doesn't mean players know where to actually find them in-game just yet, or the steps that might be required to put all the pieces together to finally gain access to the cow level, Whimsyshire, or something entirely new. Judging from past secrets in Diablo 4, finding the cow level will still require some serious sleuthing and experimentation on the part of players.</p><p dir="ltr">The last major <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-secret-cow-level-mystery-just-had-a-major-breakthrough/1100-6518576/" data-ref-id="1100-6518576">cow-level breakthrough</a> came in October 2023, when a player collected a trio of secret items, killed exactly 666 cows, and cleansed the items at the mysterious ox statues in the city of Ked Bardu, all to acquire a Strange Key that unlocked a previously inaccessible area. That location, the Forlorn Hovel, housed a group of cows that when killed, dropped a Stamina Potion--a nod to Diablo 2's Cow King. Consuming the potion grants a buff that has no obvious effect, and so the hunt for the cow level has continued.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4's 2.0 update will bring huge changes to the ARPG on October 8, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-completely-changing-how-it-handles-difficulty-taking-a-page-from-diablo-3/1100-6526194/" data-ref-id="1100-6526194">complete re-work of the game's difficulty system</a> and a reorganization of its endgame. That will be in addition to all the new features coming as part of the Vessel of Hatred expansion on that same day, which includes the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-hours-with-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatreds-spiritborn-reveals-a-diablo-class-unlike-any-other/1100-6525108/" data-ref-id="1100-6525108">new Spiritborn class</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-getting-diablo-2-style-runewords-so-you-can-make-your-own-spells/1100-6526197/" data-ref-id="1100-6526197">Diablo 2-style Runewords</a>, Mercenary companions, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-getting-a-huge-first-of-its-kind-dungeon-filled-with-exclusive-rewards/1100-6526026/" data-ref-id="1100-6526026">"first-of-its-kind" endgame dungeon</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hoyoverse-provides-details-regarding-genshin-impact-on-xbox/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hoyoverse-provides-details-regarding-genshin-impact-on-xbox.972126/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hoyoverse-provides-details-regarding-genshin-impact-on-xbox/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Genshin Impact is finally coming to Xbox after years of <a href="https://wccftech.com/pixel-9-pro-xl-with-tensor-g4-slower-than-tensor-g2-in-running-genshin-impact/">being on mobile</a>, PC and PlayStation 5, all since 2021. Now, three years on, the game will finally be released on Xbox, as announced in August 2024. The game will be released on Xbox Series X|S on November 20, 2024.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/hoyoverse-gave-us-some-details-on-how-genshin-impact-will-work-with-xbox-game-pass-as-well-as-xbox-cloud-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussion with Windows Central</a>, HoYoVerse spoke about the deal with Xbox and the fact that Genshin Impact will have special in-game bundles on day one for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, as well as bundles available to subscribers in subsequent version updates. While Genshin Impact is coming to Xbox, it's been officially confirmed that it won't be coming to Xbox One, but it will be available to those on Xbox One by using Xbox Cloud Gaming. However, to play Genshin Impact through the Xbox Cloud Gaming, players will need an active Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to access it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Genshin Impact - ONL | gamescom 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pazRlb7gn5Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While most online games require you to have Xbox Game Pass Core (Xbox Live Gold), this game won't. This is because it's already a free-to-play game, which would make it a dangerous path to tread if they were to monetize the social aspects of the game. This was confirmed by a HoYoVerse representative after the Xbox website incorrectly cited that those wanting to participate in multiplayer gameplay in Genshin Impact would need Xbox Game Pass Core.</p>
<p>At the moment, it remains unknown what sort of bundles players can expect from seeing Genshin Impact on Xbox, specifically for those using it via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. It could be anything from Banner Pulls to Primogems or other basic consumables, but for now, it remains to be seen or revealed by HoYoVerse.</p>
<p>HoYoVerse has gone on to make many different gacha games, but Genshin Impact continues to be one of their most popular. Last year saw the release of Honkai: Star Rail, with this year seeing the release of Zenless Zone Zero, which is the most stark difference to Honkai: Star Rail and Genshin Impact, which have some crossovers and similarities in features.</p>
<p>With how popular Genshin Impact is, it continues to receive frequent updates, adding new areas and storylines for players to explore. The developers also continue to add new characters for people to love (or hate) and save up their Primogems to pull for them on their banners.</p>
<p>Whether the other HoYoVerse games will follow suit after Genshin Impact makes its way to Xbox Series X|S remains to be seen. The developers will probably discuss this once the statistics about the game's performance on the new platform come out.</p>

            <p>Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a "postcolonial 4X game", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.</p><!--more-->

<p>Some quick notes on the title. In attaching his own name, I suspect Murthy is gently sending up Sid Meier and other creators who've built themselves up into global brands. "Syphilisation", meanwhile, is a pun which Murthy originally took from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/the-rise-and-fall-of-western-syphilisation-an-irishman-s-diary-about-a-once-dreaded-disease-1.3101963">James Joyce's novel Ulysses</a> - it references a sexually transmitted disease whose spread is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3956094/">entangled</a> with the formation and expansion of empires.</p>
<p>One of Syphilisation's most gripping devices is that it's a conversation with itself. Rather than making you the leader of a faction or nation, it casts you as a student participating in a group report on Gandhi, Churchill, the Raj and the Indian Independence Movement during the 19th and 20th century. From afar, it looks a lot like other games in the genre, with units moving across a tile-based map featuring settlements and resources, but the group report premise makes room for disagreement about these fundamentals and the events depicted. The other students are all distinct characters with their own backgrounds, and as Murthy quips on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1712530/Nikhil_Murthys_Syphilisation/">the Steam page</a>, "the politics of nations are just the politics of student groups writ large".</p>
<p>While it's possible to pay Syphilisation selfishly, covetously and aggressively, building empathy is a goal and a site of intense design exploration. "In particular, I try to show that the ideas of winner-take-all and growth-for-the-sake-of-growth that underpin most of the genre have viable alternatives," Murthy adds. In practical terms, this includes experimenting with nonviolent conflict resolution, "non-deterministic" tech trees and cooperative win conditions. Research is partly a question of deciding how to interpret figures such as Winston Churchill, rather than simply exposing a codex entry with a new technology attached.</p>
<p>Murthy has also looked at "history from below", and how the game's 'subjects' might have their own agency. "The citizens of your empire have many requests of their own and will often just handle them by themselves rather than wait for you to get around to them. They will research new technologies, complete buildings and units and simply deal with their issues by themselves. You can make yourself more popular by getting there first, but Syphilisation understands that leaders need the people and not the other way around."</p>
<p>I spoke to Murthy together with former Civilization developer Jon Shafer and Paradox's Ryan Sumo about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/can-you-make-an-anti-imperial-empire-game">the idea of an "anti-imperial empire game"</a> last year. It remains one of the most enlightening interviews I've ever done, mostly because I kept my mouth shut while the three of them talked about things like visualising map space and the concept of progress.</p>
<p>I've not played much of Syphilisation as yet - I'm still getting my head around it, partly thanks to the ambition on show, and partly because the presentation is a bit dense and overwhelming (as was the case with the developer's previous, similarly imaginative <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-quiet-sleep">The Quiet Sleep</a>). One thing I'm currently pondering is whether the bits I find obfuscatory are deliberate rejections of the omniscience other imperial simulations offer. If you're eyeing up the 1.0 release and would like to have a try yourself, there's still a demo on Steam at the time of publication.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It is a sad day to learn of some of the heinous acts committed by people who were, at one point, highly regarded within the esports space. The former UK League of Legends coach, <strong>Lorcan ‘Lorcz’ Elliott</strong>, has officially been sentenced on child sex offenses, putting the man in prison for four years and eight months.</p>



<p>The news, which broke at Esports News UK, came earlier today (September 4, 2024), as the former LoL coach was officially sentenced.</p>



<hr>







<p>The former League of Legends coach has pleaded guilty to 22 different sex offenses regarding children. The man was found guilty of inciting children to engage in sexual activity, taking indecent photos of children, distributing indecent photos of children and attempting to have sexual conversations with children.</p>



<p>Elliot has now been barred from working in any industry with children in the future and has been officially placed on a sex offender list. The former coach had originally been sentenced to seven years in prison, but his sentence was reduced due to no prior convictions.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Elliot had also sent sexual photographs and videos of himself to underage children.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-lorcan-elliot-charged-on-22-accounts-of-child-sex-offenses">Lorcan Elliot Charged On 22 Accounts Of Child Sex Offenses</h2>



<p>Lorcan Elliot was a notable name in the UK League of Legends scene just a few years ago, as the man worked as an esports coach on several different teams. Some of these teams included Nuclear Storm, London Esports and Giants.</p>



<p>The man had also spent plenty of hours representing the University of Cambridge in NSE national university League of Legends esports tournaments.</p>



<p>It is incredibly disheartening that someone could fly so low under the radar, with many peers in the industry having no idea of the malicious and disgusting intent someone holds. </p>



<p>Hopefully, no one ever has to fall victim to Elliot’s behavior ever again. </p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2-review.972105/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I was halfway through the opening level of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2’s campaign, unloading bolt rifle rounds alongside my two squadmates, when I found myself smiling at just how good it feels to be back in this futuristic grimdark fray. It’s been over a decade since the original, but Space Marine 2 reinvigorates the squad-based shooter series with seeming ease. The environments are varied and breathtaking, the running-and-gunning feels great, and the sense of comradeship while fighting with your team, be they bots or friends, can be exhilarating. It may not break much new ground in its genre, but it didn’t need to for me to have a blast playing through its dozen-hour campaign.</p><p>Let’s get this out of the way early: The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/09/warhammer-40k-space-marine-review">original Space Marine</a> clearly took inspiration from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/07/gears-of-war-review-2">Gears of War</a>, and this sequel follows suit. It’s a squad-based shooter starring heavily armored dudes who growl their dialog while either shooting guns or revving Chainswords to ward off invading aliens. The similarities don’t bother me a bit (especially when one could make the case that Gears borrowed from Warhammer first). It’s been years since I’ve played a game that scratched that particular itch, and Space Marine 2 uses the rich lore of Warhammer 40k to carve out its own identity. That’s true in both the meaty campaign that can be played solo or co-op, as well as two additional modes that let you upgrade your weapons and customize your armor between rounds, which are meant to keep you coming back after the credits roll.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The campaign drops you back into the considerable boots of Demetrian Titus, the hero of the first installment. It picks up over a hundred years later, and does a good job of explaining everything you need to know, whether you played the original or not. Despite the century-long gap, not much has changed for our dour hero since we last saw him. He’s still a gravelly-voiced, seasoned soldier who doesn’t appear to have aged at all thanks to his genetically-engineered longevity. He’s spent the last century serving in the Space Marines’ Deathwatch chapter, which goes on the most dangerous of missions. After an intense opening level that has you deploying a “Virus Bomb,” you’re rewarded for your bravery and dedication by being brought back into the fold as a blue-armored Ultramarine.</p><p>The story is more than serviceable, and it moves at a fast clip, sending your squad to interesting locations across several planets. It has a few twists and turns that bring it to surprising places, and there’s even some intriguing inter-squad conflict to spice things up. That said, the whole thing is pretty one-note: it’s all very serious. I get that there’s a war going on and lives are on the line, but just a dash of humor – even the gallows humor many other 40k games use – would have added a welcome extra dimension.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Enemies have enough variety that I rarely got bored of blasting them.</p></div><p>You're accompanied on your missions by two squadmates who are bots by default, but you can invite friends to take their place. The bots are serviceable comrades, capable of doing their part to fend off enemies and revive you when you fall in battle. But as with most games like this, it’s more fun to play with friends, which you can coordinate from your home base, called the Battle Barge.</p><p>Gone are the Orks from the first Space Marine, and in their place is humanity’s latest intergalactic enemy: the Tyranids. These alien monstrosities come in many forms, from hulking Carnifex beasts to hordes of smaller creatures that look like xenomorphs or velociraptors. Some can fly, while others swarm across the ground, piling on top of each other to scale cliffs in order to attack you and the rest of the Imperial Guard’s forces. You’ll encounter other enemy types as you progress through the campaign as well, which provides enough variety that I rarely got bored of blasting them to the shreds with an array of Imperial and alien weaponry.</p><p>It’s a good thing the guns and melee weapons feel great to use, because that’s how you’ll spend the bulk of your time in Space Marine 2. You can customize your loadout between missions, picking a primary weapon, sidearm, and close-combat accessory to start out with. You also find plenty of weapon caches scattered throughout the levels, letting you swap in flamethrowers, plasma blasters, sniper rifles, power swords, and all manner of explosives, from sticky bombs to shock grenades that deploy an electric area-of-effect. There’s a weapon for every style of encounter – though you usually don’t know what’s ahead when you have to choose. Checkpoints are frequent, though, so if you get wiped you can make a more informed choice the next time.</p><p>Hitting an enemy with any of those weapons produces a satisfying splatter of blood. Larger enemies on the brink of death flash red, indicating you can execute them with a gruesome finishing move. Performing executions recharges your shields, which is helpful, and you can pick up Medicae Stimms to heal, or enable Titus’s Righteous Fury special ability, which boosts your health bar as you slice through enemies with your melee weapon. I always appreciate it when recovering health in a shooter is tied to putting the hurt on your enemies.</p><p>In fact, just moving around feels great in Space Marine 2. You’re a hulking, heavily armored soldier, and walking feels appropriately chunky – but your character is also more nimble than he was in the previous outing, so that weight is never aggravating. It feels just right.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Wherever you're deployed, the art design is uniformly stunning.</p></div><p>One of the main drawbacks of the original Space Marine was its drab brown-and-gray color palette – an ill-advised trend of the era it came out in. Thankfully, that’s gone in favor of much more colorful and lively environments in the sequel. Some levels have you tromping through alien worlds that are green and purple and lush with extra-terrestrial flora. Others are set in towering urban areas full of gothic buildings with stained-glass windows. Wherever your squad is deployed, the art design is uniformly stunning, gorgeous enough to justify leaving the previous generation of consoles behind. </p><p>Most areas are active war zones, with human soldiers fighting hordes of enemies both in the foreground and the background. Sometimes you’re following a tank through the ruins of a city, backing up squads of Astra Militarum soldiers. Other times you’ll see flying Tyranids swarm through the sky like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4f_1_r80RY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>murmuration of starlings</u></a> while platoons of soldiers blast projectiles at them. More than most military games, Space Marine 2 makes it feel like there really is a war going on, and you’re only one part of the effort. I’m usually not prone to taking screenshots, but here I found myself switching to photo mode in almost every level so I could capture the beauty.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The campaign is a fine enough chunk of game on its own, but that’s not all you get in Space Marine 2. In addition to Titus’s saga, you can play two other modes that aren’t so linear, each connected to the other: Operations and Eternal War.</p><p>Eternal War is a PvP mode, but unfortunately the pre-launch population was so low that I wasn’t able to test it out for this review – I’ll add an update later with my impressions. I was able to spend time with Operations, however, which lets you play side missions that are directly referenced in the main story but are carried out by other teams while Titus does his thing. </p><p>In both Operations and Eternal War, you get to choose from six classes of Space Marine, each with different loadout options and special abilities. There’s Tactical, which can use an Auspex Scan to highlight and weaken enemies; Sniper has a limited-use camo cloak; Bulwark plants a banner flag that restores the shields of any nearby squad mates; Vanguard has a grapnel launcher to pull himself into the action for close combat; Assault has the Jump Pack that Titus uses occasionally in the campaign; and Heavy get a bubble shield. All of the abilities are useful and fun to use in combat. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Chris’s Favorite Third-Person Shooters</h3></p></div><p>Playing these modes also earns you various currencies you can spend to upgrade your weapons and customize your armor with cosmetics, which turns out to be great fun. You can unlock a ton of neat emblems and charms for each piece of your armor, as well as new colors that represent the different Space Marine chapters. Pretty much all of the colors look cool as hell, and the ornament options let you adorn your dude with chains, skulls, and other details that wouldn’t be out of place on the cover of a heavy metal album.</p><p>The Operations levels themselves aren’t all that different from the ones in the campaign, even taking place in the same environments, which does make them a little bit less exciting. There are currently six missions, and while playing through them once was fun – especially with a team of co-op partners – I don’t really feel compelled to replay them, even to earn currency to upgrade my weapons and customize my armor. I’m still eager to try out the Eternal War PvP mode, as well as the additional modes promised in developer Saber Interactive’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-post-launch-roadmap-includes-new-maps-a-horde-mode-and-more"><u>post-launch roadmap</u></a>, but at least at launch the PvE offerings are more a brief but amusing distraction rather than a mode I’ll keep returning to. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A Destiny mobile game is reportedly in development over at NetEase under the name Destiny Rising, and it could be announced soon.</p><p>This rumor originally came from Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1830693815876714763" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kurakasis</a>, who said that Destiny Rising hasn't been canceled despite developer Bungie's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">recent layoffs</a>. Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb has corroborated this rumor over on <a href="https://www.threads.net/@jeffygrubbgrubb/post/C_d55_hvrN1?xmt=AQGzciFTVQuJZMKdsPkuKr3gbhzEPty-5vSECAmuhE7No18" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Threads</a>, saying that the game will reportedly have Hero characters instead of having players create their own characters. However, it seemingly will still retain the same kind of feeling of playing Destiny on console or PC, but just on mobile.</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-02/sony-s-bungie-maker-of-halo-and-destiny-faces-reckoning-after-mass-layoff" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg reported</a> that in early 2022 when Sony purchased Bungie, the developer went ahead and hired new employees to work on several incubation projects, including mobile versions of Destiny. It's possible that Destiny Rising is one of those. However, a Destiny spin-off, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-destiny-game-codenamed-payback-has-reportedly-been-cancelled/1100-6525485/" data-ref-id="1100-6525485">codenamed Payback</a>, was reportedly canceled. Internally, Bungie referred to it as "the next Destiny" instead of "Destiny 3."</p><p>When 17% of Bungie employees were let go from the recent restructuring, Destiny veterans including executive creative director Luke Smith and vice president Mark Noseworthy also departed. However, it was <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-veterans-luke-smith-mark-noseworthy-let-go/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">later clarified</a> that they reportedly left on their own accord instead of as a result of the layoffs.</p><p>Mobile versions of popular games have become increasingly popular. For example, Tencent reportedly has a mobile version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-mobile-version-in-the-works-at-tencent-report/1100-6520843/" data-ref-id="1100-6520843">Elden Ring</a> currently in development. The company also acquired the rights to publish a mobile version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/visions-of-mana-studio-is-shutting-down-just-after-releasing-game-report/1100-6526204/" data-ref-id="1100-6526204">Blue Protocol</a> before the game's shutdown announcement.</p>

However, if that game has left you wanting a more typical lightsaber-swinging odyssey across the stars, boy, have I got the games for you. Respawn Entertainment, which is best known for shooters like <em>Apex Legends </em>and the <em>Titanfall </em>series, has also spent the past several years developing the <em>Star Wars Jedi </em>third-person action-adventure games, and you can snag them on sale on PlayStation right now. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196086" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Dark Knights And Dark Princes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196086,196918,196307" data-current="196086"><div><p>The Week In Games: Dark Knights And Dark Princes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21614.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>At the moment, you can pick up the first game, </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-the-kotaku-review-1839940185&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-the-kotaku-review-1839940185"><em><strong>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</strong></em></a></span><strong>, for just $10 on both PS4 and PS5.

For this low of a price, picking them up is just insurance.<br></p><p><em>Jedi: Fallen Order </em>surprised me when I finally played it. I think I was a year or two late to the party, playing it in the midst of an emotional and mental rut smack in the throes of the first year of the pandemic. I needed any game to just kind of make me feel anything, and I was throwing wanton money at sales trying to find the thing that would jolt me awake and actually enthrall me. I knew to expect more from it than the average licensed game based on the pedigree of the team working on it, but also I simply didn’t know Respawn had that dog in them.<br></p><p>Respawn’s <em>Jedi </em>games are sometimes compared to From Software’s <em>Dark Souls </em>series thanks to a handful of mechanics and principles they adapt. For example, combat in the <em>Jedi </em>games primarily centers around smaller and more intimate skirmishes, where you are forced to dodge, parry, and pick your moments. You spend the game learning new lightsaber and force techniques, but at the end of the day, you won’t get far unless you learn to parry and riposte early on. Much like <em>Souls</em>, and perhaps to a greater extent <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>, the <em>Jedi </em>games feature a give-and-take kind of approach to combat. Yeah, there are nameless grunts with blasters that you can just cut through, but there are also a number of opponents with similar weapons to yours who will push back on you till you throw everything you have at them.<br></p><p>These games are also structured in a similar way to the <em>Souls </em>series. There are meditation points that function as bonfires, and you can level up there and even fast-travel, but using one also resets the enemy spawns in the area. When you fall in battle, you leave a Force impression of your XP behind, and unsurprisingly, it must be picked up before your next death or it’ll disappear entirely. Even the way that <em>Jedi: Fallen Order </em>and its sequel dole out shortcuts in their huge environments is similar to the Metroidvania-style approach to level design found in both the <em>Souls </em>games and the games that I think both series are ultimately more akin to: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-legend-of-zelda-games-breath-wild-botw-nintendo-1850320051&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-legend-of-zelda-games-breath-wild-botw-nintendo-1850320051">3D <em>Zelda </em>titles</a></span>.</p><p>The <em>Jedi </em>games aren’t nearly as hard as some of those comparisons let on though, unless you specifically adjust the difficulty to the highest levels. I wouldn’t recommend it though, because whereas their inspirations are designed around difficulty more thoughtfully, upping the challenge in the <em>Jedi </em>series simply tweaks knobs in the back end to make the games more brutal and unfair. Take it from someone who has completed both on higher settings, I got nothing but headaches from trying to force the <em>Jedi </em>games into being <em>Souls </em>games, which is why I think they’re better thought of as 3D <em>Zelda </em>wrapped in a <em>Star Wars </em>skin and story. </p><p>To that end, <em>Fallen Order </em>and <em>Survivor </em>both have a greater degree of platforming, puzzle-solving, and traditional dungeons than your typical <em>Souls </em>game, giving them a much more vintage vibe as opposed to the modern feeling of other contemporary action adventure games. That doesn’t make them feel dated though. They feel like relics of a bygone era of games, which I do mean in the most complimentary sense. There aren’t actually <em>many </em>huge AAA games that commit to both open worlds and these small, focused gauntlets that break up the monotony of nonstop combat and constantly expanding maps. You’d think the popularity of <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a></span>,<em> </em>and these <em>Jedi </em>games would spawn more of them.<br></p><p>The two games released so far—with a third game currently in development—tell one of the more entertaining stories in the current incarnation of the <em>Star Wars </em>Expanded Universe. Centering the padawan-turned-runaway Cal Kestis, who’s played by <em>Shameless</em>’ Cameron Monaghan, the series takes place between <em>Revenge of the Sith </em>and <em>A New Hope</em>. Cal, a survivor of the Great Jedi Purge, is on the run from the Empire when he meets the crew of the Stinger Mantis, including the pilot Greez and its captain, Cere Junda, played by the inimitable Debra Wilson.<br></p><p>I think these titles, more so than most of the current glut of shows and movies, capture the spirit of <em>Star Wars</em>, or at least what it’s traditionally meant to me. Cal is far from a perfect protagonist, and as he’s grown he’s had to deal with his imperfections and occasional inclinations to the dark side of the force. Greez is easily the most fun sidekick-style character introduced in a long time, and even BD-1, Cal’s robotic companion, feels leagues better than BB-8. Cere and Merrin, a Nightsister who becomes entwined in Cal’s journey, could have fulfilled very archetypal roles (and to some extent still do, because <em>Star Wars </em>loves a tried-and-true trope) but they are also great sources of conflict in Cal’s saga. They actually push on him, even grate against his sensibilities, and challenge him to be a better Jedi, and moreover, a better person. This cast and these games are as heady as they are whimsical, and that’s <em>Star Wars </em>for me.</p><p>Along their journeys, they take on a number of high-ranking officers of the Empire including a great deal of Inquisitors, and even come to blows with Darth Vader himself. The <em>Jedi </em>games span several planets, covering sights both familiar and completely foreign to <em>Star Wars </em>fans. And while it mostly stays relegated to its own corner of that far, far away galaxy, I can feel the ambitions of the story (especially that of <em>Survivor</em>) beginning to creep into territory of the books, shows, and movies. It is, by my measure, one of the better investments you can currently make in the beleaguered <em>Star Wars </em>universe, and one that’s well worth the relatively low asking price right now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You’ll craft specific bait for each catch you want and when you do catch your prize, you can use it to cook new recipes.

The Aquarius update feels like a triumphant acknowledgment of how far the game has come. <em>No Man’s Sky</em> bringing fishing to the game adds one more pastime to the game and recognizes that after years, the world is good enough that players can just sit back and relax within it.

<p>It is a wild day when a game completely unrelated to another video game ends up sponsoring that game. World of Warcraft China (WoW) has recently sponsored two Chinese Dota 2 organizations going into The International 2024. These sponsorships are happening despite Valve’s ban on in-game ads during the massive tournament.</p>







<p>It was recently announced that World of Warcraft China was going to sponsor G2xiG and Xtreme Gaming’s Dota 2 team going into The International 2024. This huge esports event is considered the biggest Dota 2 competitive tournament in the world, happening once a year. </p>



<p>Seems pretty cool that a video game completely unrelated to Dota 2 would sponsor them, right? Well, it would seem as if the sponsorship may be for nothing, as Valve has made it incredibly clear that no in-game ads will be allowed during the extent of The International 2024 event.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>With this ban on in-game ads, it would seem as if the WoW sponsor holds very little weight going into the Dota 2 event. Will the game pull out from its sponsorships? Or do they have a marketing strategy up their sleeves that no one will expect?</p>



<p>The sponsorship plan was originally to put two popular WoW character’s names on the jerseys of each team.</p>







<h2 id="h-world-of-warcraft-releases-new-expansion">World Of Warcraft Releases New Expansion</h2>



<p>The popular MMORPG recently released its newest expansion, The War Within. Debuting with some of the game’s best reviews, The War Within has become a hit with World of Warcraft enthusiasts.</p>



<p>The partnership with the two Chinese Dota 2 teams was supposed to be a way to help promote the game’s new expansion, but it seems as if Blizzard’s efforts may have been for nothing.</p>

<p>If you had given me, at age 15 or so, a game in which you can fight seemingly hundreds of Tyranid bugs at once with two friends, alternately blasting them with bolt rifles or pulverizing them with a chainsword, then finishing the biggest of them by ripping off one of his claws and shoving it through his head, all of it happening to the sounds of action-movie orchestration and dialogue about stoic duty, would I have had any complaints?</p>

<p>No, I would not. But we're spoiled for choice now. How much you enjoy <a href="https://www.focus-entmt.com/en/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2"><em>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</em></a> (for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation and releasing on September 9) will depend on your ability to tap into the deep basement of your kill-'em-all mentality and fantasy lore engagement. You can enjoy it somewhat ironically, which I did at times, especially when playing co-op with friends who told me that they did not like the game's aesthetics at all. But strip away the grimdark trappings of zealotry, Chaos Marines, and skulls—so, so many skulls—and you have a competent, sometimes innovative third-person squad shooter. It feels like <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/gears-of-war-5-hands-on-a-new-blockbuster-for-the-game-subscription-era/">Gears of War</a>, </em>minus the cover, but with heavier characters, more melee combat, and somehow even fewer women.</p>
<p>Getting the most out of <em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>means suspending disbelief, feeling heavy metal, and wanting to kill a whole bunch of things with some very big dudes. In roughly a dozen hours of gameplay, I found the core gameplay loop relatively engaging, with enough mix-ups, upgrades, and challenges to keep it feeling more like the fun kind of endless war, not the real kind. It's pretty enjoyable to team up with friends, too, so long as they're cool with <em>Warhammer 40K's&nbsp;</em>vibes and some occasionally repetitive challenges.</p>

<h2>Constant lore, varied battles</h2>
<p>I do not have deep&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em><em>40K</em> lore knowledge (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/warhammer-40000-boltgun-is-a-loud-obnoxious-and-damned-fun-retro-shooter/"><em>Boltgun</em></a> was previously my deepest engagement), so please forgive everything I get wrong in sketching out the game's story. You, Demetrian Titus, are an Adeptus Astartes, a Space Marine, a bio-engineered huge guy with like three hearts and plugs in your head and an all-encompassing devotion to the Imperium of Man. In the prior <em>Space Marine</em> game, you did so well resisting the lure of Chaos that you were turned into the Inquisition and made to serve on the Deathwatch. Now you're back and demoted, and something bad happens to you in the training mission. You are saved by the Ultramarines, and you undergo the Rubicon Primaris surgery to make you an even bigger and stronger fundamentalist killing machine.</p>

<p>And then you're off, joined by Brother-Sergeant Gadriel and Brother Chairon, played by either your online friends or the game AI. You have a heavy primary weapon, a pistol-like sidearm, and a melee weapon, usually a chainsword, a big knife, or a huge hammer. Your armor is tough but gets worn down, and only time or pulling off a <em>Doom 2016-</em>style melee finisher on downed enemies will recharge it. You're not exactly agile, but you can lunge at remarkable speed, like Chris Farley in his <em>SNL&nbsp;</em>prime. And you call your teammates "brother" a <em>lot</em>.</p>

                <p>Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 remake comes out in October, and the developer has shown off some interesting extras on social media. A recent post revealed an optional no-UI mode, as well as a so-called "'90s filter" that adds large amounts of film grain, color correction, and other on-screen elements.</p><p>As you can see in the above post, the two modes work together to create an aesthetic that is highly reminiscent of the original Silent Hill 2. Copious film grain and fog are two of Silent Hill's defining aesthetic traits, and the game did not feature any UI elements--not even a health bar. But as pedants were quick to point out, the name of this '90s filter would seem to be a misnomer, considering that the original Silent Hill 2 released in 2001.</p><p dir="ltr">Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 has garnered a somewhat polarized response from the horror community, with some players expressing concern over the direction of the project. But after a three-hour hands-on preview with the game, GameSpot's Jessica Cogswell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-preview-significantly-better-than-the-trailers-youve-seen/1100-6525893/" data-ref-id="1100-6525893">wrote</a> that the remake is significantly better than its marketing materials have indicated. "In short, I was incredibly impressed by the time I spent with Silent Hill 2 Remake," she wrote. "It is surreal, cerebral, horrifying, and grotesque--all of the things that made the original title such a remarkable title not only for Konami, but for the horror genre as well."</p><p dir="ltr">Fans will decide for themselves when the game releases on October 8. In the meantime, PC players can try the definitive version of the original, Silent Hill 2: Enhanced Edition, which recently received its final update.</p>

                <p>Despite recent changes to the app store to accommodate cloud gaming, Microsoft and Nvidia still don't have native cloud-gaming apps on iOS. Anyone wishing to play Game Pass via the cloud on their iPhone must use a web app. New submissions to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) reveal Microsoft's reasons for not yet publishing an app.</p><p>In a submission from late July (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234777/microsoft-apple-cloud-gaming-app-store-changes-xbox-cma" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>), Microsoft claims that Apple's recent changes to its app guidelines are insufficient for Microsoft to release a native iOS app. Microsoft objects to Apple's 3.11 guideline, which forbids developers from linking to outside websites for subscriptions, thereby circumventing Apple's 30% cut on app transactions. It claims that, "The 30% commission fee makes it impossible for Microsoft to effectively monetize its cloud gaming service offering," because other Apple regulations make it impossible for Microsoft to change subscription fees on iOS. Furthermore, Microsoft claims third-party developers would need to recode their own games to fall under Apple's rules.</p><p>Apple countered that other developers have not had similar difficulties with the in-app purchase requirement. It cites Antstream, a retro-gaming cloud app, that Apple assisted with subscription optimizations, editorial frameworks, and public relations review. According to Apple, Microsoft has failed to negotiate with Apple or work towards a compromise, despite Apple's recent changes and willingness to cooperate with other teams.</p><p>The CMA is investigating mobile browsers, browser engines, and the distribution of cloud gaming in the UK. It is identifying remedies to competition issues including requiring cloud gaming native apps to operate on a "read-only" basis (i.e. without in-app purchases) to prevent the need for recoding or requiring Apple to allow cloud gaming clients to provide their own payment systems. The CMA will release a provisional decision report in November. A final report will likely release in February or March 2025.</p>
