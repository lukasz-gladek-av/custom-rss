            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/06/star-wars-jedi-survivor-last-gen-port-hits-ps4-and-xbox-one-in-september/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA and Respawn have announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> is coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 17th September. The last-gen version will come in at a $49.99 retail price, and still have an upgrade path from last-gen to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone who pre-orders on PS4 or Xbox One before 17th September will get a free cosmetic item set themed after Obi-Wan Kenobi.</p>


<p>In the run up to this new release, Respawn will also be releasing a patch for the PC version of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor in the coming weeks, which promises “enhancements to the game’s technical performance, controls and more, plus a variety of quality-of-life improvements.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/02/star-wars-jedi-survivor-is-being-ported-back-to-ps4-and-xbox-one/">The port was announced almost exactly a year ago</a>, with EA CEO Andrew Wilson confirming that the game was being ported back to the last generation. “Thanks to the strength of this legendary franchise and community demand, our development team has committed to bringing this Jedi experience to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,” he said at the time.</p>
<p>That still left plenty of work for Respawn to do, taking everything that the game is able to do on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, using the speedy SSDs for loading and newer versions of Unreal Engine, and making it work with a much lesser CPU and a slower hard drive.</p>

<p>If the port holds up, then this is a great follow up to Respawn’s original Star Wars tale. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/26/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review/">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor review</a>, Aran said, “Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a great continuation of Cal Kestis’ journey. The story is a little predictable and platforming could be sharper, but this is a sequel that builds on the ideas of the original and there’s real enjoyment to be had in exploring the expansive new worlds, digging into the lore and running into secret boss fights.”</p>

            <p>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only War, unless you don't have a 64-bit PC with an Intel Core i5-8600K equivalent and at least eight gigs of RAM, in which case you'll have to, I don't know, live in everlasting peace, or something. I'm pretty sure not having eight gigs of RAM is heretical, but never fear, you can probably compensate by taking a leaf from the God-Emperor's book and arrange for a host of dying psykers to pour their brain energy into your motherboard.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that Focus Home have released the system requirements for huge-shouldered action game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>.

<p>To my non-hardware-editor eye, these don’t seem that terrifying, but bear in mind that these are the requirements for running the game at 1080p. I suspect higher resolutions on Ultra are going to take a toll. Best round up a few extra psykers, just to be safe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-blinked-and-almost-missed-warhammer-40k-spare-marine-2s-release-date">Space Marine 2 will release on September 9th</a>, and I think it's fair to say we're looking forward to it. To lapse into the accursed lingo of scoring, the 2011 original felt like a 7/10 action game with a 9/10 action game trapped inside it, revving a chainsword. The sequel features <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-marine-2-shows-off-10-minutes-of-stomping-chainswording-and-a-chaos-tease-for-the-warhammer-40k-sequel-in-extended-gameplay">a new campaign starring Ultramarine stalwart Lieutenant Titus</a> plus a squishy rogue's gallery of greenskins, Tyranids and Chaos Marines. It also boasts co-op and competitive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-looks-like-space-marine-2-will-let-you-go-head-to-head-in-pvp-multiplayer">multiplayer</a>, though sadly it doesn't look like there will be any interspecies PvP.</p>
<p>This latter omission is, of course, a test of your loyalty to the Imperium, the most important "system requirement" of all. A true servant of the God-Emperor would not blanch at being unable to play a Tyranid. Speaking of traitors, a WIP but apparently complete and fully playable version of the game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/at-least-500-people-will-trounce-you-in-space-marine-2s-multiplayer-at-launch-because-theyre-already-playing-a-torrent-of-the-entire-game">leaked online last month</a>. I dare say there's footage in the wilds if you fancy spoiling it for yourself.</p>

The changes don’t deal with the flamethrower directly, but rather with its flame effects and how those are handled by the game’s systems. Here’s how they read:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Adjusted flame effects to work more realistically.</li><li>It doesn’t go through various bodies/objects where bounce off would be the expected behavior, like on armors and static objects.</li></ul></blockquote><p>It’s a seemingly innocent fix that has turned lots of players into bug food.

While it wasn’t meta breaking, it made the situational tool a lot more useful than it otherwise would have been. After today’s changes, the flames no longer appear to be able to reach the soft underbellies of the Chargers, or easily ignite burn damage on other weak spots. </p><p>It’s also just not as fun to use. “Flamethrower can’t kill chargers now,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1eldw49/they_nerfed_the_flamethrower/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1eldw49/they_nerfed_the_flamethrower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one player on the subreddit. “Doesn’t go through their leg armor anymore.

It’s possible that these under-the-hood changes to flame effects are just part of developer Arrowhead Studios trying to make everything is working as intended when the new guns drop. But plenty of players feel like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ele6iu/freedom_flame_releases_this_weeklets_nerf_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ele6iu/freedom_flame_releases_this_weeklets_nerf_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s an underhanded way</a></span> of potentially pushing them to pay for the new battle passes now that their existing flamethrowers have been nerfed.<br></p><p>Changes like these have long been a sore spot in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, however. While Arrowhead has re-balanced the game at various points to try and keep it challenging and make players explore alternate ways of playing, it can also feel like the studio is just constantly taking away fans’ favorite toys. Players discover a weapon is really good at a thing, they use it religiously for months, it becomes a corner stone of the community culture, and then it gets killed in a new update. For some that keeps the game evolving, but for others it’s a reason to take a break. </p><p>“I’m Level 140, played since launch. I had it with the nerfs man. At least make it make sense!” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1elg8gq/im_done/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1elg8gq/im_done/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one particularly demoralized fan. “I thought the people complaining were crazy, but I was here a long time and I see the patterns now: Nerf a weapon, forcing everyone to the new meta. AH sees the meta, nerf it, make the enemy ridiculously 10 times stronger.”</p><p>Not everyone is against the nerf. Some players have already discovered new ways to use the flamethrower that still make it an effective bug-killing machine, but it requires much better positioning and execution. One theory is that the new behavior will more closely mimic the way the new fire-based weapons act, keeping them all in line with one another. Still, it’s easy to see why players who have been casually enjoying the game as it is are getting burnt out on the constant whiplash of weapon balancing. We’ll have to wait until the new Warbond drops later this week to see how it all shakes out. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Getting ready to film your next YouTube or TikTok video, but want to find the best and most optimal settings for recording in OBS? While the quality of your video can largely depend on the PC you are filming on, there are still settings in OBS for recording that most would consider the best.</p>



<p>Here are the best OBS settings for recording.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-obs-recording-format">Best OBS Recording Format </h2>



<p>Luckily, recording on OBS is quite simple. Though, there are a few settings you may want to tweak before hitting the record button.</p>



<p>To find your recording settings, simply click Output in the General Settings tab. This will give you options for recording and live streaming. Obviously, we want to focus on recording.</p>







<h3>Best OBS Recording Settings:</h3>



<ul>
<li>1920×1080 (For YouTube)</li>



<li>1080×1920 (For TikTok and Shorts)</li>



<li>Bitrate between 3,000 and 4,000</li>



<li>Select x264</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-best-obs-video-settings">Best OBS Video Settings:</h3>



<ul>
<li>1920×1080 (For YouTube)</li>



<li>1080×1920 (For TikTok and Shorts)</li>



<li>Downscale Filter: Lanczos</li>



<li>Frame Rate: 60 FPS</li>
</ul>



<p>These settings can be tweaked depending on your computer. If you have two GPUs, then recording on one of those instead of <strong>x264</strong> is okay.</p>



<p>These OBS settings are the best for recording for YouTube, helping give your viewers a smooth and high-quality viewing experience.</p>







<h2>Best OBS Settings For Recording Low-End PC</h2>



<p>For those who have a low-end PC, there are better settings to help optimize your recording. The last thing you want is for your video to come out all laggy and whatnot. </p>



<h3>OBS Recording Settings For Low-End PC:</h3>



<ul>
<li>1280×720 (For YouTube)</li>



<li>720×1280 (For TikTok and Shorts)</li>



<li>Bitrate: 2,000</li>



<li>Select x264</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<h3>OBS Video Settings For Low-End PC:</h3>



<ul>
<li>1280×720 (For YouTube)</li>



<li>720×1280 (For TikTok and Shorts)</li>



<li>Downscale Filter: Lanczos</li>



<li>Frame Rate: 30 FPS</li>
</ul>



<p>While these settings may be low, every creator still has to start somewhere. Work your way up to get a better PC in the future if you find yourself having to film with these settings.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-obs-settings-for-4k">Best OBS Settings For 4K</h3>



<p>Are you looking to take your recording settings up a notch and film your next piece of content in 4K? Luckily, OBS allows for recording in 4K. This is mainly intended for those who have a high-end PC, though.</p>



<h3 id="h-obs-recording-settings-for-4k">OBS Recording Settings For 4K:</h3>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE: EA, NFL Negotiating License Extension For Madden NFL]]></title>

<p>For nearly 20 years, when it comes to simulation football games, there is only one option: EA Sports and Madden NFL. EA has had an exclusive license agreement with the NFL since December 2004, making the Madden franchise the sole game in town. Sure, there have been other football games since then, but nothing like what was around in the early 2000s when fans had games like NFL Fever and NFL 2K as alternatives to Madden. But now, as the exclusive contract between EA and the NFL gets close to the end of the current agreement, many have been wondering whether that’s about to change.</p>



<p>The current deal was signed as an <a href="https://x.com/AlbertBreer/status/1266072611253035011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">extension back in 2020</a> for $1.5 billion, and it goes through the 2025 season. There is an option to extend it by a year through 2026 if target revenue was hit, and, by all estimations, that target has been. So what we’re looking at is a contract that expires in two years.</p>



<p>That two year window is the same point in time when EA and the NFL announced their last extension of the Madden license. So, where is the current one?</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-talks-are-ongoing">Talks Are Ongoing</h2>



<p>Sources have indicated to Insider Gaming that discussions between EA and the NFL have been on-going regarding the future of the game and the license. It’s said that talks began later than in the past for a variety of reasons, including concern from the league if remaining exclusive with one company was the best option.</p>



<p>The league has been well aware of the public reception to the franchise the past few years. And one thing they don’t like is when the shield is viewed in any sort of negative light. That meant there was added pressure from not only within EA to deliver but from the NFL as well.</p>



<p>After the issues that plagued Madden 23, last year’s Madden 24 was viewed as a make-or-break game from all aspects. Internally, it wasn’t going to just come down to how much money the game made in initial sales, but how well it did in retaining players throughout the year.</p>



<p>The game ultimately “exceeded all expectations” in terms of both revenue and player base. Through July 2024, 11 months after the game’s release, Madden 24 remained a top 10 game on both Xbox and PlayStation in weekly average users (WAU). While Madden Ultimate Team is a big reason for that, the internal belief is that if the game “wasn’t good at all” people would’ve left by then. Sources went as far to say that Madden 24 was felt by many as a “turning point” for the franchise with a “feeling that Madden 25 will kickstart things in a bigger way”.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-confident-is-ea">How Confident Is EA?</h2>



<p>Going back to the contract discussions, many who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the nature of the subject say that they believe an agreement on a new contract will come within the next 12-18 months.</p>



<p>“We have no reason to believe we won’t still have the exclusive license,” said one source.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another said, “At the end of the day, Madden is making more and more money each year for both EA and the NFL. The sales continue to go up, and it would be crazy to not have the deal continue.”</p>



<p>Of course, there is the idea that Madden’s numbers are only what they are because of the exclusive license. Fans who want to play as their favorite NFL team or player really have no other choice if they want a realistic game.</p>



<p>“That’s just the way it is right now. What do they want us to say?” one person with EA said, adding that they don’t mean anything negative by it.</p>



<p>Every source who spoke was adamant, though, that the developers care about what the players want. They aren’t just trying to get by with each game. They are actively doing what they can in the time they have between releases.</p>



<p>“We honestly do want players to love the game each year,” one said. “We know we aren’t going to make everyone happy, but our goal with each game is to make it better than the last and have more people enjoy it than the year before. People can believe what they want, but we really do care about the game we are putting out there.”</p>



<p>As far as the possibility of losing the exclusive rights to allow more simulation games from competitors, I was told, “It’s not impossible, but there’s honestly no way someone else could compete with us for the rest of this generation and possibly into the next one due to the timing of the deal and how long it takes to make a game like this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re not worried.”</p>



<p>Neither EA nor the NFL returned multiple requests for official comment on the state of the agreement and negotiations.</p>

The chapter will introduce two new playable characters: Dracula will be the latest killer joining the roster, while <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/castlevania-iii-draculas-curse">Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse</a> protagonist Trevor Belmont will be the new survivor. </p><p>Behaviour notes that although Trevor is not the Belmont known for his brawn, Behaviour teases that his "unique skillset serves to set him apart," including his collaboration skills, which make him an effective team player. In contrast, Dracula has many different forms he can take, noting that Dracula has three different forms: Vampire, Bat, and Wolf. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dead by Daylight x Castlevania Chapter Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>"We wanted to create fluidity in the way players can have Dracula change between his different forms and have it feel seamless," Dead by Daylight Creative Director Dave Richard explained in the press release. When I first played Symphony of the Night — which is one of my favorite games of all time — having vampiric powers like these was absolutely amazing. Being able to put players in the shoes of The Dark Lord in Dead by Daylight was an alluring and unique opportunity for us."</p><p>Those who play Dead by Daylight on PC and are eager to play the chapter can now access it via Steam public test build. </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

One of the latest leaks shows a potential new Warzone map, which is already creating some controversy due to the design.</p><p dir="ltr">As <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1819837521133760767" rel="nofollow ">originally reported by CharlieIntel</a>, the leaked footage shows an island setting for a large-scale battle-royale map called Avalon. The video reveals that the map consists of a series of small islands. The islands are connected by bridges, but there is plenty of surrounding water that could potentially lead to a lot of swimming and water fights.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The video clip from CharlieIntel has been removed by a copyright strike, but the same video shared by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/1ejdt0c/new_potential_warzone_map_leaked_as_part_of_major/" rel="nofollow ">JenNettles</a> remains on Reddit, where players are already chiming in on their thoughts of the map design. SideOfFish comments saying, "Caldera, but with water. SMH." Another Redditor replies saying, "I already find it frustrating to cross rivers in Urzikstan, and this looks far worse."</p><p dir="ltr">The inclusion of water in Warzone can often lead to frustrating fights and final circles, with players struggling with visibility and underwater shooting. Comparisons to Caldera are also potentially negative, as the WWII-themed island map designed for Call of Duty: Vanguard was Warzone's least-popular battle-royale map.</p><p dir="ltr">It was also reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-new-map-avalon-leaks/" rel="nofollow ">Inside Gaming</a> that Avalon is suggested to be the Warzone map for 2025, following the reintroduction of Warzone's popular Verdansk map. Another recent Black Ops 6 leak includes a graphic look at the ability for players to use their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-leaks-continue-this-time-with-a-graphic-new-ability/1100-6525547/">enemies as a meat shield</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">An official Warzone map reveal is likely to happen during Activision's Call of Duty: Next event on August 28.

					<p>Despite Deck13's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atlas-fallen-god-of-sand/">Atlas Fallen</a> showing much promise before release, the German studio's game failed to deliver a truly compelling experience. On paper, the mix of the combat mechanics of the Monster Hunter series and character action games like Devil May Cry and Bayonetta sounded exciting, but a clunky execution of these concepts made the experience very middling despite a well-designed world with deep lore.</p>
<p>Not wanting to leave their game in a state that the studio itself did not find optimal, Deck13 has launched the Reign of Sand free <a href="https://wccftech.com/atlas-fallen-gets-enhanced-with-free-reign-of-sand-update-on-august-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a>, which attempts to fix many of the base game's issues to present an experience that is not worthy of players's time. Does it succeed? Yes and no at the same time. While the enhancements are substantial, they go on to improve features that were already good enough to begin with, not addressing those core issues that impact the experience the most, namely the combat mechanics.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Atlas-Fallen-Reign-of-Sand-01.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Reign of Sand update doesn't introduce any major change to the Atlas Fallen story, as the studio opted to lightly expand it with new lore elements. So, once again, players will control a fated Unnamed who obtained the Gauntlet, an ancient and powerful artifact that grants them the power to banish the Wraith who have been plaguing the world that was once almost destroyed by the Sun God Thelos and covered in sand. With the mysterious Nyaal at their side, the Unnamed will get to meet all sorts of people on their journey, letting them learn more about the world they live in and the battle they are fighting.</p>
<p>While the update doesn't shake up the story a whole lot, Reign of Sand does bring some improvements that influence the narrative. For starters, the beginning of the game has been tweaked a bit to get the player faster into the actual adventure, which is a very welcome change, given how the first few minutes were probably the dullest part of the campaign. The biggest change, however, is in regard to voice acting. The original male voice for the Unnamed was replaced with much higher quality acting provided by Ben Starr, who rose to fame in the video gaming world by voicing Clive Rosfield, the main character of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">Final Fantasy XVI</a>. Needless to say, the difference between the old and new voice acting is night and day, presenting dialogues in a more polished way and improving the experience considerably.</p>
<p>In a similar way, the Atlas Fallen gameplay saw mostly an expansion and some tweaking with the Reign of Sand update. The update adds a revamped progression system that makes it easier to enhance the Unnamed, new abilities, and new Essence Stones that grant players even more customization options. Having not played again after having reviewed it last year, I can't tell for sure, but I feel the game's balance has been tweaked as well, and I had far fewer issues achieving high Momentum, unlocking the ultimate form of the main weapons and unleashing the most powerful abilities, in the new version of the game. While these tweaks and quality-of-life improvements are very welcome and make the game slightly more enjoyable than at launch, they fail to address the core issues with the game's combat, which is still clunky and floaty.</p>
<p>The camera, at the very least, has been improved slightly, so it is a little easier to spot and avoid off-screen attacks, but blocking using the Sandskin ability or dodging attacks still doesn't feel as responsive or satisfying as it should have. Again, I find these issues weird for a studio like Deck13, which proved in the past with The Surge series it is more than capable of crafting weighty, satisfying combat. So, if you expect the combat to reach the heights of other games with the update, you will still be disappointed.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Atlas-Fallen-Reign-of-Sand-02.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Rounding up the additions brought to Atlas Fallen by the Reign of Sand update are additional challenges. The long-awaited New Game + comes with Nightmare Mode, putting player skills and builds to the test, while those still in the middle of the adventure will find new combat challenges like the Source and Watcher's Challenges, which task players with defeating enemies under certain conditions, also giving them the chance to take control of Nyaal and use some brand new abilities. Again, welcome additions, especially considering similar content is usually added via paid DLC but hardly game-changing.</p>
<p>Deck13's commitment to improving Atlas Fallen is commendable, and, for the most part, the Reign of Sand update achieves what it sets out to do, enhancing the game enough to make it a little more worthwhile to players who might have skipped it at launch. Still, the update doesn't address what are, in my opinion, the game's biggest issues, so those who didn't like how the combat felt last year will not change their opinions with the game's updated version.</p>

<p>With welcome improvements, quality of life changes, and new content, Atlas Fallen: Reign of Sand enhances the game developed by Deck13. However, the update mainly improves the game's existing strengths and fails to address the core issues with its combat system. As a result, the update delivers only partial improvements, leaving those dissatisfied with the game's floaty and unsatisfying combat still wanting more.</p>

Soon enough you get access to a giant drill , the Grinder — wow, that’s the other half of the title. The Grinder allows you to drill into different surfaces in each level, offering a unique movement mechanic that everything else in <em>Pepper Grinder</em> is built around. While moving through ground with the Grinder you feel like you are shooting through water, and you can pull off thrilling moves like jettisoning yourself out of the ground to make big leaps. When you pick up the basics of movement and get into the rhythm, stringing together jumps and drilling into the ground to pick up speed and rush through levels is an exhilarating feeling that never gets old. At its best times <em>Pepper Grinder</em>’s flow-state movement mechanics evoke the very best platformers.</p><p>The only place <em>Pepper Grinder</em> really puts the brakes on its fun movement-based adventure comes when combat becomes a heavier focus. There are boss fights sprinkled in and your average grunt enemy to take down across stages but combat isn’t nearly as thought out or satisfying as speeding through levels. However, the best additions to <em>Pepper Grinder</em> come in its later stages, where the levels amp up just enough to keep offering a new challenge. Once you get into the game’s excellent movement you’ll find yourself rushing through levels as fast as possible until suddenly the game is over.</p><hr><p><em>Pepper Grinder</em> is now available on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In comparison, the minimum PC requirements are more forgiving if you're using older hardware, although this targets 30fps at 1080p to help keep the game running smoothly. The mandatory requirement across all PCs is a solid-state drive with 75GB of storage capacity available, which will likely help process all the hundreds of heretics you'll face on the battlefield.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-castlevania-crossover-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Behaviour Interactive has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight Castlevania&nbsp;</em>crossover release date, as well as unmasking the killer and survivor you can expect to play as when it arrives.</p>
<p>Originally revealed as part of the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-crossovers-spinoffs">eighth anniversary celebrations</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>crossover will arrive on August 27th, but you can check it out right now via the game's public test branch if you want to.</p>
<p>As you might expect, the killer being added to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>as part of the&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>crossover is none other than Dracula, and he brings with him the ability to shapeshift into three different forms with distinct abilities.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-castlevania-crossover-dracula.jpg?itok=rh1ec8Qz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-castlevania-crossover-dracula.jpg?itok=rnHqvc3K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dracula is&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>-themed killer.</figcaption></figure><p>Dracula's Vampire form can use a damaging fire spell, while his Wolf form is capable of tracking enemies more effectively and moving more swiftly. He can also transform into a bat, giving him the Undetectable status and giving him the ability to teleport to vault points within 32 meters.</p>
<p>His survivor counterpart is none other than vampire hunter Trevor Belmont, scion of the Belmont clan and star of Netflix's&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>show (although not its newest spinoff, <i>Nocturne</i>, which stars Richter Belmont instead).</p>
<p>Trevor's perks allow him to see the killer when completing a generator, upgrade his items, and heal after opening chests, so he's a good choice if you're looking for a scrappy survivor who can fend for themselves.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight Castlevania&nbsp;</em>trailer, which gives a glimpse of both Dracula and Trevor, right here.</p>

<p><em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>is the latest in a long string of crossovers for&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>. Others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider-crossover"><em>Tomb Raider</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-alan-wake-crossover"><em>Alan Wake</em></a>, and the recently-announced&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover"><em>Five Nights at Freddy's&nbsp;</em>crossover</a>, although that's not coming for a while yet.</p>
<p><em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>crossover arrives for all players on August 27th. You can check out the full patch notes for the corresponding update <a href="https://forums.bhvr.com/dead-by-daylight/kb/articles/465" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

As the wait lengthens for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, other Soulsy creature features are scurrying to fill the breach. We had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deviator">Deviator</a> last week - now, it's time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perennial-order">Perennial Order</a>. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a "plant horror" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable "Instinct" abilities and one-hit deaths.</p>
<p>In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it "Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those "painterly" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as "rotted" and "unhallowed" and "manky". It's out on 6th September. Find a trailer nested below this paragraph like a venus flytrap poised to clamp around your fingers.

The last boss rusher I seriously got into was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/furi">Furi</a> from The Game Bakers. This looks considerably less joyful, assuming you don't find joy in squirming egg sacs or nodachi-wielding toadstools. I will admit to deriving pleasure from the spectacle of a giant skeleton boss who plays chess with squelchy animate pieces, but only because I'd much rather fight a bony boardgamer than the bright-eyed, tentacle-nosed clot of darkness that pursues you elsewhere in the trailer. There are touches of bullet hell, too, albeit with roaches rather than bullets.
</p>
<p>
The developers cite Dark Souls as an influence, but don't expect nearly as much backtracking. Perennial Order lets you respawn right at the beginning of each encounter, so as to "spend your time fighting rather than walking". That said, there's apparently a world beyond the bosses, with NPCs to pester and lore to sponge from secluded nooks. More "boss rush focussed" than "boss rush", perhaps. You can get help from a friend, too: there's optional co-op throughout.
</p>
<p>
Again, it's out 6th September. There's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1411020/Perennial_Order/">a demo on Steam</a>, if you can't wait to sink your boot into this belching swamp of genre references.

Those in attendance duly oblige.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Brin briefly took the podium (Hyper Talk speakers only have five minutes to blitz through a topic) to discuss why AI has contributed to the "clusterfuck" that has become the video game industry. She suggests the technology itself isn't the problem, but rather the "overhyped expectations" that have convinced studio heads it can replace human creativity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"First of all, I want to talk to you a little bit about creativity–and creativity, just in case you didn't know, isn't something you're born with or not," says Brin. "Creativity doesn't just mean being good at art. It's a whole set of holistic skills that I do not have time to unpack for you, so I want to talk about once core concept, and that's the concept of theft."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Brin is specifically referring to the concept of theft as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://austinkleon.com/2018/01/11/good-theft-vs-bad-theft/">described by artist and writer Austin Kleon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, who explains that while "imitation is&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;flattery. It’s&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>transformation</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;that is flattery: taking what you’ve stolen and turning it into something&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>new."</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"He explains that part of finding your voice as a creative is about borrowing and sampling and copying the people you really admire. As he outlines here's there's good stuff: honor, study, steal from many," Brin says. "[Then there's] bad theft: not giving credit, plagiarising, and ripping off. When it comes to AI, it's an example of bad theft. At least as it stands now, because there's no way of giving credit."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Offering up some evidence, Brin displays the work of D&amp;D artist Greg Rutkowski, whose work has been copied more than Picasso through AI tools like Midjourney without him ever receiving a credit (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-66099850">more on that here from BBC News</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Because of the way the [Midjourney] LLM is set up there's no way to give Rutkowski credit or monetary reimbursement for the work that's been fed into the model. So where does that leave the artist and game developers?," she asks</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I would say that many entry-level positions in the game industry as well as those higher up are at risk because of cost-cutting measures. So what do we do? First of all we need to start being responsible about how we put together datasets. We need more mechanisms for attribution. So, the question I want to pose to you today, rather than 'can AI replace human creativity?,' is can AI create with humans in interesting ways as part of the creative process–not a replacement for it?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Getting a little bit philosophical, Brin leans on a theory of play that that emphasises a "dialogue between audience and content," and says we should emulate that dialogue when considering how to combine creative production, AI, and games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Creativity is interplay between humans and their tools, but we have to protect people and workers. We want to build a strong thriving economy in which we can enjoy the work we love to do but also not live in a robotic dystopia," she continues. "How do we protect and promote human creativity? We organize."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Brin is referencing the ongoing efforts of unions across a number of industries that are working to secure AI protections, preventing major companies from deploying the technology in unethical, debilitating ways. SAG–AFTRA's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sag-aftra-performers-to-hold-first-strike-picket-outside-wb-games">recent decision to strike</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in a bid to protect video game performers from AI tools is just one instance of how that collective power can manifest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our activism and protecting our creative practice and our craft [isn't just about what] we do in here together as a community. We actually need to get out there and push for legislation and policy recommendations to protect our economic and social futures," she adds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Brin, it's on workers to "move the needle" as a collective and deliver the protections creative industries are crying out for. "If you're not already familiar or are part of a union, please join one." She closes by demanding a rousing "hell yeah" in favor of a better, brighter future for creativity in games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-launches-17-october/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Quiet Place is known for being a great horror franchise, with the premise revolving around staying as quiet as possible to avoid attracting the attention of Death Angels. The movie franchise is getting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-is-a-single-player-horror-game-out-in-2024-made-by-stormind-games/">new addition</a>, but this time it's in the gaming sphere. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead launches 17 October.</p>
<p>This upcoming title is being developed by the Italian developer Stormind Games, the creators of games such as Batora: Lost Haven and the Remothered franchise. The game is being published by Saber Interactive, the publishers for games such as Vampyr, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Kingdom Come: Deliverance.</p>
<p>For those wanting to know more about A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riegOv5eRuY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 second trailer</a> has been released on YouTube, showcasing some of the survival horror elements that players can expect to run into. From doors slamming shut and alerting the Death Angels, to having to try and shuffle away from them as they are on high alert searching for you, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead looks like it'll be the perfect game for those who were fans of Alien: Isolation.</p>
<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is a spin-off from the movie franchise, where you play as a character who has asthma, which, just by using the inhaler is enough to alert the Death Angels to her presence. She is going through interpersonal family conflict, and must deal with her emotions of that while navigating an apocalyptic world.</p>
<p>For those that haven't seen the movies, the Death Angels use sound to locate their prey, and have a heightened sense of hearing, meaning they can hear every little noise you make. In this survival horror game, that may be the thing that makes or breaks her survival.</p>
<p>If you are interested in purchasing A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, the game will be released on October 17 and will cost $29.99. Pre-orders for the game are currently available, which will allow those who have pre-ordered to get exclusive content in the game and get their hands on some digital art from the upcoming video game.</p>
<p>In addition to the trailer, the developers also released a 10-minute game play video in July, a video that is exclusive to IGN. In <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-10-minutes-of-exclusive-gameplay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this video</a>, you get to see the protagonist navigate Northwood Hospital, where she has to overcome her own fears in order to survive the horrors of the post-apocalyptic world she has been plunged into.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNl2r_WHpcU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">celebration video</a>, No More Robots announced Descenders Next with a release window set for “early 2025.”</p>



<p>Descenders Next will feature a variety of different sports, adding both snowboarding and mountain boarding. Today’s new video showcased early alpha footage of both. Each additional sport will come with its own biome. </p>



<p>Descenders Next will introduce even more sports “as free updates.” The maps for each biome will feature larger maps, races, challenges, and some “boss jumps.” Procedurally generated nodes will also changed based on timelines rather than player entry.</p>

<p>Today’s reveal trailer also confirms that multiplayer will be available at launch, and players can group up in lobbies. However, solo will still be available anytime. </p>



<p>The trailer also teases Career and Parks modes merging, customization, and other central features.</p>



<p>No More Robots added that “we’ll be running test sessions in the coming months,” so players can sign up now. However, Descenders Next will also appear as a playable game at this year’s Gamescom, ahead of its 2025 launch.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the original Descenders game also has a new update, which is coming to consoles soon. There will also be more updates on Descenders Next via Discord “on a weekly basis.” </p>



<p>No More Games only confirmed PC and Xbox platforms for Descenders Next in today’s trailer. It also teases the Xbox Game Pass, hinting it may join on day one. The original Descenders did join the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-xbox-game-pass-core-game-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass core tier</a> in 2023.</p>

It will be available via the Steam public test build on August 6. <span id="more-903831"></span></p><p>“We wanted to create a fluidity in the way players can have Dracula change between his different forms and have it feel seamless,” said Dead by Daylight creative director Dave Richard in a press release. “When I first played <em>Symphony of the Night</em>—which is one of my favorite games of all time—having vampiric powers like these was absolutely amazing. Being able to put players in the shoes of The Dark Lord in <em>Dead by Daylight</em> was an alluring and unique opportunity for us.”</p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>An Immortal Franchise</strong></p><p>It’s difficult to think back to a time in gaming without Castlevania, one of the most iconic series from <a title="Companies > Konami Digital Entertainment [1,073 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/konami">Konami Digital Entertainment</a>‘s (Konami). First released in 1986 on the Famicom Disk System in Japan, then on the <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [20,558 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> Entertainment System in 1987 and going strong ever since, the <em>Castlevania</em> franchise boasts a legacy almost as enduring as that of its main villain.</p><p>For many—those on the <em>Dead by Daylight</em> team included—the original <em>Castlevania</em> in all its 8-bit glory represented an early introduction to <a title="Genres > Horror [447 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a> gaming. Countless titles, a hit animated series, and decades of intricate lore later, <em>Castlevania</em> continues to ascend the pantheon of horror with its arrival in <em>Dead by Daylight</em>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Dracula’s powers and those of his castle are inextricably linked, and The Entity has brought both into its realm. Any time Dracula is the featured Killer in a Trial with an Original Map, players will see the ominous castle looming over the proceedings, perched on the horizon of that Map. The powers it bestows upon its master are enough to make even the most grizzled Survivor’s blood run cold.</p><p><strong>Deadly as the Wolf. Swift as the Bat.</strong></p><p>With Castlevania’s Dracula, Dead by Daylight welcomes both its first shapeshifting Killer, as well as its first vampire to The Fog. Regal, imposing, and wholly terrifying, Dracula’s disdain for humankind is matched only by his bloodlust—making The Entity’s Realm a perfect hunting ground for the nightwalker.</p><p>It is said the Dark Lord can take many forms, each one proficient in tracking and killing victims. As a Vampire he stalks his prey, able to conjure flames that sear flesh and render bone to ash. The Bat is as quiet as a creeping shadow, approaching at a moment’s notice and gaining ground with a blink. The Wolf is a relentless hunter, with a keen nose for fresh blood—even that which has yet to be spilled…</p><p><strong>Survivor’s Bloodline</strong></p><p>Tormented, exiled, and even cursed some say, the Belmont bloodline has stood between humanity and the forces of darkness for countless generations. Yet perhaps, no descendant of this clan is better equipped to take on The Entity’s Realm than new Survivor, Trevor Belmont.</p><p>First introduced in 1989’s <em>Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse</em>, Trevor may not be the brawniest Belmont, but his unique skillset serves to set him apart. From an innate ability to seek out allies and work as part of a team, to his unmatched skills as a vampire hunter, his values and will exemplify what makes the Belmont clan who they are.</p></blockquote><p><em>Dead by Daylight</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,587 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,775 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,013 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,365 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,745 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,804 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/dead-by-daylight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/dead-by-daylight-windows/9nms4sfnbgbh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Store</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span><em>Castlevania</em> Chapter Official Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Dead by Daylight | Castlevania | Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tQWEWR4V-m0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It'll likely make a great addition to bookshelves too, as its colorful, abstract cover is a gorgeous piece of artwork. Absolution is the longest novel in the Southern Reach series by nearly 100 pages.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                                                                                          <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100770772-14555742?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.humblebundle.com/books/jeff-vandermeers-weird-worlds-southern-reach-series-and-other-works-books" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.tkqlhce.com\/click-100770772-14555742?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https:\/\/www.humblebundle.com\/books\/jeff-vandermeers-weird-worlds-southern-reach-series-and-other-works-books&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100770772-14555742?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.humblebundle.com/books/jeff-vandermeers-weird-worlds-southern-reach-series-and-other-works-books">Jeff VanderMeer's Weird Worlds Humble Bundle</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100770772-14555742?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.humblebundle.com/books/jeff-vandermeers-weird-worlds-southern-reach-series-and-other-works-books" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.tkqlhce.com\/click-100770772-14555742?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https:\/\/www.humblebundle.com\/books\/jeff-vandermeers-weird-worlds-southern-reach-series-and-other-works-books&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100770772-14555742?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.humblebundle.com/books/jeff-vandermeers-weird-worlds-southern-reach-series-and-other-works-books">Get 11 books for only $18</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-14555742%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fbooks%2Fjeff-vandermeers-weird-worlds-southern-reach-series-and-other-works-books&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fjeff-vandermeer-absolution-southern-reach-annihilation-preorder-guide%2F1100-6525451%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jeff VanderMeer Humble Bundle</a> supports a great charitable cause and comes with 11 books for $18.
