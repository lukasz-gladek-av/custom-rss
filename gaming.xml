                <p>Following rumors that a new My Hero Academia fighting game was in the works, Bandai Namco confirmed the news by announcing My Hero Academia: All's Justice during its summer showcase. The 3D fighting game is being developed alongside the anime series' final season, and as such, will feature the series' final fights, allowing players to experience the conclusion of the popular manga firsthand.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCkheljpoug" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nCkheljpoug" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>After showing off its visuals in a short trailer, Bandai Namco offered a first look at combat and a brief overview of its mechanics. One of the highlights of the game is a "huge roster" that, for the first time ever, includes all students from class 1-A.</p>

We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment."</p><p>Going forward, Booty claimed Xbox's portfolio strategy is "unchanged," and that is to make great games filled with "new stories, worlds, and characters." He specified that Microsoft has 40+ games in "active development" and teased a "strong slate" for 2026 that will include the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-teases-2026-plans-including-possible-halo-release/1100-6532264/" data-ref-id="1100-6532264">new Fable, Gears of War: E-Day, the next Forza game, and a possible Halo release.</a></p><p>Microsoft's cuts to Xbox came as part of a wider cost-cutting program that saw the technology giant lay off about 4% of its global workforce, amounting to around 9,000 people.</p>

            <p>
Soon, the fairies will be upon us thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-is-off-with-the-fairies-in-new-enchanted-by-nature-expansion">imminent Enchanted by Nature expansion</a>. But before all that, EA has laid the foundations for its impending pixie dust explosion with a free content update - introducing the likes of glass walls and rooftop plants - that's available to download and muck around with right now.
</p>
<p>
Glass walls - which should delight the exhibitionist Sims in your life - can be located under Misc &gt; Wall Patterns in Build Mode, and do pretty much exactly what you'd assume, offering your Sims all the outdoors they could possibly hope for without them ever needing to go outside. Alternatively, they could be turned into (lethally?) inconspicuous partitions, or paired with glass roofs for that authentic greenhouse look. And those aforementioned rooftop plants? Well, you can now stick a select assortment of plants on top of your house. The end.
</p>
<p>
Away from these new decor bits, EA's latest update also brings Sim inventory improvements and a notebook refresh. Players now have new ways to sort their inventory, for instance, with the default "new" view placing freshly acquired stuff at the top, but your stash can also be filtered by price, name, crafting quality, and rarity. Spoiled foods, meanwhile, get an unmissable red background indicator and are grouped into a new Spoiled stack.

<p>
As for the notebook - which includes a new interface designed to make it easier to keep tabs on your household Collections - it now sports a refreshed layout, category page enhancements, new discovery badges, and more. "Whether you're jotting down notes for your Sim or exploring unique categories," EA writes, "the notebook is now more intuitive and engaging."
</p>
<p>
All that arrives alongside an extensive list of fixes and improvements across The Sims 4 base game and its expansions. With the update applied, for instance, Sims should no longer need to grapple with the inconvenience of having rain and snow do their thing indoors, and children should stop going stretchy when attempting to play the violin. There's plenty more where those came from, though, as <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-7-1-2025">detailed in EA's announcement post</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Sims 4's latest update is available now on all platforms and arrives ahead of the game's next major paid expansion, Enchanted by Nature. This launches next Thursday, 10th July, and introduces emotion-hungry fairies (in both kindly and chaotic forms) as a new supernatural Sim option. That's alongside the new coastal world of Innisgreen, where brave Sims can reside if they don't mind luck heavily impacting the course of their lives. Chuck in new adventures, skills, traits, and a new mechanic based around emotional balance, and it's quite a busy one.

		<p>Bandai Namco released a new trailer for Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree, their rather lovely looking roguelike with a unique twin hero mechanic. The game is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Nintendo Switch and Steam on 19th September.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree - Guardian Trailer 1" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mtu17D_rNV8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in an oriental setting where the evil forces of the god Magatsu threaten Shinju Village, a group of heroes have come together under the guidance of Towa, the child of a god who is leading the fight for survival.</p>
<p>There’s eight guardians in the game, and you pick not one, but two of them as you head into each run. We were introduced to Rekka and Nishiki, the former of which is a master swordsperson with a focus on combos and AoE attacks, while the latter is a big fish person who’s very mobile… but can’t actually swim. They’re both pitched as beginner-friendly characters to play as.</p>
<p>On each run, you’ll be able to earn Graces, which are abilities that you earn and pick from a randomised selection. Between runs, then there’s a whole village to explore with some neat minigames and side missions that fold back into the progression.</p>

<p>Honestly, this just looks lovely and we look forward to seeing more. The team will release more videos to reveal more of the Guardians in the coming weeks.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-40-projects-in-development-summer-showcase/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-has-40-projects-in-active-development-everything-shown-at-xbox-summer-showcase-is-%E2%80%9Ccontinuing-on%E2%80%9D.1234488/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/perfect-dark-everwild-game-canceled-microsoft-initiative-1236446212/">Variety</a> regarding the mass layoffs at Microsoft today, everything shown at Xbox's Summer Showcase is "<em>continuing on</em>." Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty also confirmed earlier today that Xbox has <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">40+ projects currently in active development</a>, following the cancellation of Perfect Dark and Everwild.</p>



<p>Xbox had plenty to show off during its Summer Showcase as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>, including the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-will-arrive-later-in-2025-and-is-still-launching-on-last-gen-consoles/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, Grounded 2, new DLC for <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-dlc-announced-launches-in-september-2025/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, new gameplay for Gears of War: Reloaded and <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-features-truly-evil-conversation-options-and-multi-person-dialogues/">Clockwork Revolution</a>. And if Variety's sources are to be believed, all those projects, and every other first-party project shown during that showcase, are safe from today's cuts and cancellations. </p>



<p>That's not to say the studios working on those games haven't suffered layoffs, just that the projects themselves are safe. The mass layoffs at Microsoft today are across the whole company, not just the gaming division, and with exact details on who has been cut and how many have been laid off still unknown, we can't say for sure that no one at Obsidian, for example, didn't lose their job today. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="[4K] Xbox Games Showcase 2025 | The Outer Worlds 2 &amp; Grounded 2 Direct" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_M3QwLBrg8g?start=2383&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The details on Microsoft's mass layoff today are still developing. While several of the cuts have been confirmed, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Rare's Everwild getting cancelled,</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark being cancelled along with The Initiative shutting down</a>, unconfirmed reports continue to circulate. Forza Motorsport developer Turn10, has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsynuplq222l">reportedly lost 50% of its staff</a>, though that remains unconfirmed at the time of this writing.</p>

Consider spending the extra few bucks on this option, as you’ll be able to control the bulb via voice commands with your new smart speaker. The bulb typically costs $13, so you’re saving a nice chunk of change for Prime Day.

This smart speaker is now just $22 (was $40), and while it doesn't sound quite as robust as the Echo Dot, it's a good choice for small spaces that don't need the 360-degree soundscape provided by the Dot. This is the best price we've seen in 2025, and it's not likely to stick around past Prime Day.

            <title><![CDATA[Best Cards To Use With The Sonic The Hedgehog Secret Lair]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-cards-to-use-with-sonic-hedgehog-secret-lair</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-cards-to-use-with-the-sonic-the-hedgehog-secret-lair.1234443/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>and Sonic the Hedgehog secret lair were <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-magic-gathering-sonic-hedgehog-secret-lair-is-gonna-go-fast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Official Magic: The Gathering Sonic The Hedgehog Secret Lair is Gonna Go Fast">announced last week</a>, and they look like a blast. At the heart of this announcement is the Secret Lair X Sonic: Friends and Foes drop which features 7 new and unique cards depicting core characters of the&nbsp;<em>Sonic</em>&nbsp;franchise.</p>

<p>Clearly designed with Commander in mind as casual first cards with legality in only Eternal formats like Vintage, Legacy, and Commander, in this article I'll look at each of the legendary creatures in that drop and suggest 5 cards that work well with each. With six new creatures to take a look at, let's dash off to this look at the new creatures from the Sonic the Hedgehog secret lair.</p>

<h2>Knuckles the Echidna</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/knuckles-the-echidna.jpg?itok=dstUZQhh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/knuckles-the-echidna.jpg?itok=W_OG3OYm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Knuckles is an interesting design for <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>as he’s got a head of steam as a voltron type commander with a flurry of keywords, and comes with his own back up alternate win condition. 30 Artifacts is a lot, no doubt about it, but his ability to make several treasure a turn make it viable to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, you can also give Knuckles some handy gear to make him even deadlier to take advantage of his double strike, trample, and haste to rush down opponents. The combination of both directions make Knuckles a powerful warrior, even if he is restricted to mono-red.</p>

<p>Obviously if you’re looking to run Knuckles as your commander, you should look at some of the other cards in the Sonic Secret Lair drop as cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2081/super-state" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Super State">Super State </a>and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2095/the-reaver-cleaver" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Knuckles's Gloves">Knuckles’s Gloves</a> are clear fits.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>5 Cards to run with Knuckles the Echidna</h3>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otc/251/academy-manufactor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Academy Manufactor">Academy Manufactor</a>: Triple the artifact output as you grab Sonic’s chili dogs.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/afr/167/xorn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Xorn">Xorn</a>: Double the treasure output for double the fun.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/127/full-throttle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Full Throttle">Full Throttle</a>: Any extra combat type card can fit,&nbsp;but Full Throttle’s 2 extra combat phases give you the opportunity to wipe the table out in one turn.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/acr/72/excalibur-sword-of-eden" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Excalibur, Sword of Eden">Excalibur, Sword of Eden</a>: With Excalibur from the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/assassins-creed-magic-gathering-set-has-me-hooked" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" The Assassin’s Creed Magic: The Gathering Set Has Me Hooked"><em>Assassin’s Creed</em>'s MTG set</a>, one attack from Knuckles is enough to kill anyone.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/34/goldlust-triad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Goldlust Triad">Goldlust Triad</a>: A little spice, as with myriad it will get you more Knuckles triggers, and it makes more treasure too.</li>
</ul><h2>Amy Rose</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amy-rose.jpg?itok=wAeamRo2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amy-rose.jpg?itok=VL6SzTyH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Sonic’s psychotic stalker/girlfriend, Amy Rose is yet another boros (red/white) equipment centric Commander, prompting comparisons to any number of those previous (like all the Cloud's from <em>Final Fantasy</em>). Still, Amy has some unique capabilities here on display, and some important abilities for this type of deck.</p>

<p>Haste will help her get into the action quickly, while her attack trigger lets you avoid paying exorbitant equip costs that some cards have. Unlike many equipment commanders, she also wants to have a friend along the ride.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amy clearly wants her <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2098/hammer-of-nazahn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Piko Piko Hammer">Piko Piko Hammer </a>from the Turbo Gear secret lair, and is more than willing to enter <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2081/super-state" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Super State ">Super State </a>as well. She’s also more than willing to borrow <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2095/the-reaver-cleaver" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Knuckles's Gloves">Knuckles’s Gloves</a> to apply some beatdown, but let’s take a look at five other cards the pink menace could use.</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fic/338/colossus-hammer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Colossus Hammer">Colossus Hammer</a>: Probably really a better fit for Piko Piko Hammer than Hammer of Nazahan, but really a must run here for Amy.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/137/firion-wild-rose-warrior" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Firion, Wild Rose Warrior">Firion Wild Rose Warrior</a>: Double up your new equipment and take advantage of Amy even more with this <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Ranking ALL of Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Legendary Creatures Part 1"><em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>MTG legendary creature</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/215/merry-esquire-of-rohan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Merry, Esquire of Rohan">Merry, Esquire of Rohan</a>: Merry is a perfect friend for Amy, as Merry draws cards, and joins in the hasty attacks, all the way from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/deep-cuts-in-lord-of-rings-tales-of-middle-earth-mtg-set" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" The Best Lore Deep Cuts in Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth MTG">Middle-Earth</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/105/inventory-management" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Inventory Management">Inventory Management</a>: There’s a lot of equipment to run with Amy, and Inventory Management provides a unique way for decks using it to get pieces where they need to be, with this&nbsp;technology from&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/197/bladehold-war-whip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Bladehold War-Whip">Blade War-Whip</a>: Providing a friend for Amy, Blade War-Whip also provides the important double strike, and its high equip cost matters less with Amy dodging it.</li>
</ul><h2>Dr. Eggman</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dr-eggman.jpg?itok=jFgX0LZG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dr-eggman.jpg?itok=1e_exU4I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Robotnik is an intriguing card that has a lot of potential, but also one that is challenging to take advantage of. Your opponents always have the option to discard, thus you should expect them to make that choice most of the time, as the idea of whatever construct, robot, or vehicle coming down for free will scare your opponent.</p>

<p>Thus, players must be like Eggman and pollute the situation to make it painful and harmful for everyone. Choke them with pollution, inundate them with smog, and make their lives miserable to power your creations and unleash them on an unsuspecting public.</p>

<h3>5 Cards to run with Dr. Eggman</h3>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/khm/112/tergrid-god-of-fright-tergrids-lantern" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tergrid, God of Fright">Tergrid, God of Fright</a>: If you’re going to be a villain, you might as well go all out. With Tergrid down, your opponents will be strongly considering letting Eggman send out his artifacts. Do note he is a game changer, and thus makes the deck at least bracket 3.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/86/yshtola-rhul" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Y’shtola Rhul">Y’shtola Rhul</a>: The double endphase is what you want here to get two Dr. Eggman triggers each round, from another of our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Ranking ALL of Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy Legendary Creatures Part 2">top 50&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>legendary creatures</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/who/165/the-valeyard" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Valeyard">The Valeyard</a>: You know what’s better than 2 villainous choices a round? 4 Villainous Choices a round, as Doctor Who’s The Valeyard will double Eggman’s triggers.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/132/scrawling-crawler" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Scrawling Crawler">Scrawling Crawler</a>: To make sure opponents feel the pain of denying Eggman his robots, we must give them more cards to make them discard and fuel our evil.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bro/233/cityscape-leveler" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cityscape Leveler">Cityscape Leveler</a>: Cityscape Leveler is one of the biggest construct, robot, or vehicle options, and provides plenty of&nbsp;destruction capability.</li>
</ul><h2>Miles “Tails” Prower</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/miles-tails-prower.jpg?itok=B4QihPBt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/miles-tails-prower.jpg?itok=qa9EUo3d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The kid genius of the Sonic universe, Tails is a longtime icon of the Sonic franchise, and he's got his shop tools out to lead a vehicle deck. Known for making different machines, piloting, and being Sonic’s sidekick, Tails can take take the lead here.</p>

<p>Vehicle decks have challenges with the fact that you need both creatures, and the vehicles, as well as needing to defend yourself. While the traditional UW (blue/white) vehicle deck is led by <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/nec/4/shorikai-genesis-engine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Shorikai, Genesis Engine">Shorikai</a> and is a slower, more methodical deck. Miles wants to lead a more aggressive take that is taking to the sky under his piloting, much like his work on <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2100/weatherlight" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tornado, Sonic’s Biplane ">Tornado, Sonic’s Biplane </a>which you definitely will want here as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>5 Cards to run with Miles "Tails" Prower</h3>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/neo/231/prodigys-prototype" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Prodigy’s Prototype">Prodigy’s Prototype</a>: Making trained pilots, Prodigy’s Prototype also benefits from Tails granting flying to it, as well as a low crew cost.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bot/1/prowl-stoic-strategist-prowl-pursuit-vehicle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Prowl, Stoic Strategist">Prowl, Stoic Strategist</a>: From the BOT special sheet, this Transformers crossover is disruption, vehicular talent, and able to eventually be a decent beater with evasion from Tails.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mor/25/stonybrook-schoolmaster" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Stonybrook Schoolmaster">Stonybrook Schoolmaster</a>: From Lorwyn, Merfolk there gave a benefit when they become tapped - which is what you need to do to crew vehicles, and the tokens it makes are perfectly disposable blockers or bodies to crew vehicles.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/nec/6/drumbellower" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Drumbellow">Drumbellow</a>: Untapping all your creatures each turn ensures that your attacking vehicles don’t leave you defenseless.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/37/unidentified-hovership" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Unidentified Hovership">Unidentified Hovership</a>: Abduct opposing creatures, and ensure they won’t return with the Unidentified Hovership, and grab a card if Tails is out.</li>
</ul><h2>Shadow the Hedgehog</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadow-the-hedgehog.jpg?itok=A9r9p82L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadow-the-hedgehog.jpg?itok=YCyB8H1A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Shadow is one of the less focused commander options in the Sonic Secret Lair drop, as Sonic’s nemesis is rewarding a variety of behavior. He wants hasty or flash creatures, who are dying, and artifacts that produce mana, ideally for spells that take the most advantage of split second.</p>

<p>The best use for him is likely as a draw engine in an aggressive aristocrats style of deck. That means hasty creatures attacking, sacrificing and getting payoffs from it all while causing chaos with attacks.</p>

<h3>5 Cards to run with Shadow the Hedgehog</h3>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ima/136/kiki-jiki-mirror-breaker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker">Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker</a>: Making quickly disposed of versions of various creatures you control, Kiki-Jiki is a great friend to Shadow.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmr/139/sneak-attack" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sneak Attack">Sneak Attack</a>: Put any monster you want onto the field quickly and attacking with haste, and cash out with the card from Shadow.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fic/57/sabin-master-monk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sabin, Master Monk">Sabin, Master Monk</a>: A recurring consistent threat, as blitz is a great mechanic with Shadow, and Sabin can blitz from the graveyard.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otc/159/captivating-crew" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Captivating Crew">Captivating Crew</a>: <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/10e/242/threaten" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Threaten ">Threaten </a>effects are a great way to add haste to creatures, and with other sacrifice outlets can be removal and card draw with Shadow.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/clb/775/zulaport-cutthroat" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zulaport Cutthroat">Zulaport Cutthroat</a>: While I try to avoid too many staples, to avoid the Cutthroat would be ignoring the fact that there are a lot of black payoffs for creatures dying.</li>
</ul>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog.jpg?itok=BSeB5Tyz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog.jpg?itok=U3lKuBUX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Last and not least, is the blue speedster himself. While he’s missing chilidogs (seriously where is that food token), Sonic here is in Jeskai (blue/white/red) colors and rewards having creatures with haste or flash by growing them.</p>

<p>Sonic wants you going fast, and grows himself and the entire team of speedsters he’s inspired by attacking. He also is instructing them to grab all the rings that they can, as when the speeders hit someone treasure comes in.</p>

<p>Sonic works particularly well with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2082/knuckles-the-echidna" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Knuckles">Knuckles</a>, and alright with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2085/miles-tails-prower" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tails">Tails </a>and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2083/amy-rose" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Amy Rose">Amy</a>, as well as loving his <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2099/lightning-greaves" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Power Sneakers">power sneakers</a> to make anyone trigger his abilities as they gain haste.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>5 Cards to run with Sonic the Hedgehog</h3>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/40k/19/vexilus-praetor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Vexilus Praetor">Vexilus Praetor</a>: Sonic might be opposed to the Imperium order opposed type, but this flash(y) Warhammer 40k card works incredibly well with him.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/224/errant-and-giada" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Errant and Giada">Errant and Giada</a>: If you’re wanting to focus more on Flash creatures, this pair from New Capenna can join Sonic on his anarchic quest, adding spray painting and angel wings to team Sonic.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/j25/49/gornog-the-red-reaper" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gornog, the Red Reaper">Gornog, the Red Reaper</a>: Sonic is a Warrior, so you can take advantage of Warrior typal cards like Gornog, who also is a perfect fit for Sonic’s trashtalking, calling your opponent’s creatures cowards.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/afr/18/guardian-of-faith" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Guardian of Faith">Guardian of Faith</a>: Sonic sometimes needs protection for him and the crew, and the Guardian of Faith will provide just that and a flash body afterwards.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/246/gingerbrute" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gingerbrute">Gingerbrute</a>: This little guy is easy to miss but as a cheap haste creature who is virtually unblockable for 1 mana, he’s a great fit for Sonic.</li>
</ul><hr><p>The Sonic Secret Lair drops look great, and these cards look like they’ll be a lot of fun. You’ll be able to attempt to order them on July 14, at Noon Eastern, or buy one of a limited supply of non-foil versions at local stores that are part of the Wizards Play Network for the mechanically unique cards in the ‘main’ secret lair with the new cards.</p>

Saying goodbye to talented colleagues and friends is painful. These individuals have contributed meaningfully to our studios, our games, and our culture. I want to thank them for the contributions they have made that shaped our journey as a team and as a company.</blockquote><blockquote>Today is a day to support one another. Please know we are working closely with impacted employees to ensure they are treated with respect and have our full support during these difficult times. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your manager or HR support team.</blockquote><blockquote>I also want to share today that Matt Firor has decided to step down from his role as the head of ZeniMax Online Studios, effective July 14. I want to offer heartfelt thanks to Matt for his incredible leadership of ZOS over the last 18 years. As a driving force behind the success of The Elder Scrolls Online, Matt has grown the game into one of the most enduring and beloved MMOs in the industry.</blockquote><blockquote>I’m pleased to announce that Joseph (“Jo”) Burba will be taking over for Matt Firor as the new Studio Director for ZOS. With over 20 years in the industry, his extensive experience in live service multiplayer titles, and a strong background in various roles across ZOS the past thirteen years, Jo is well-prepared to lead the team into its next chapter.</blockquote><blockquote>Matt, Jo, and I will work together to finalize our transition plan – more to come soon. In the meantime, please join me in wishing Matt all the best and congratulating Jo on his new role.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you to all of you for your dedication to Bethesda/ZeniMax, our community, and to each other. </blockquote><blockquote>Jill</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The reference to Matt’s note here is the prior memo Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios, sent to Microsoft gaming staff today confirming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rares-everwild-reportedly-canceled-as-microsoft-layoffs-sweep-across-xbox">the cancelation of Rare's Everwild</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">the Perfect Dark reboot</a>, as well as the closure of Xbox studio The Initiative. Booty also mentioned the cancelation of "several unannounced projects" - the ZOS MMO was one of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has reviewed Booty's memo and published it in full, below:</p><blockquote>Following Phil’s note, I want to share more about the changes to the Studios business units. <br>We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio. As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment.</blockquote><blockquote>Our overall portfolio strategy is unchanged: build games that excite our players, continue to grow our biggest franchises, and create new stories, worlds, and characters.

Sources have told IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rares-everwild-reportedly-canceled-as-microsoft-layoffs-sweep-across-xbox">Rare’s Everwild is canceled</a> as layoffs hit the legendary UK studio. Candy Crush maker King is also hit hard, as is Bethesda’s London office.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a memo sent to all Microsoft gaming staff and viewed by IGN, Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios, confirmed Everwild and Perfect Dark's cancelation and said the company was winding down several unnanounced projects.</p><blockquote>Following Phil’s note, I want to share more about the changes to the Studios business units. <br>We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio. As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment.</blockquote><blockquote>Our overall portfolio strategy is unchanged: build games that excite our players, continue to grow our biggest franchises, and create new stories, worlds, and characters. We have more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026.</blockquote><blockquote>For those directly affected, we are working closely with HR and studio leadership to provide support, including severance, career transition assistance, and where possible, opportunities to explore roles on other teams.</blockquote><blockquote>To everyone across our studios: thank you. Your creativity and resilience continue to define who we are. I believe in the strength of our teams and the direction we're taking on the path ahead.</blockquote><blockquote>- Matt</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perfect Dark was conspicuous by its absence during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced">Microsoft's June 2025 showcase</a>, having starred a year earlier with a flashy new trailer. It featured a look at gameplay for the first-person shooter, as well as the welcome return of protagonist Joanna Dark.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Initiative was a studio spun up by Xbox in 2018 to steer Perfect Dark towards release, with Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics brought in to support. Perfect Dark first debuted on the N64 back in 2000, developed by Rare, which has survived today's cull.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a memo to staff sent today and reviewed by IGN, Xbox boss Phil Spencer failed to confirm specifics, telling staff “any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The following message from Phil Spencer was shared to all gaming staff today:</p><blockquote>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.</blockquote><blockquote>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</blockquote><blockquote>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental — it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.</blockquote><blockquote>HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey.</blockquote><blockquote>Phil</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has made a huge number of cuts to its gaming business since acquiring Activision Blizzard for $69 billion. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">It laid off 1,900 staff in January 2024</a>, then made further cuts just a few months later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">when it closed Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks</a>.

Amazon Prime Members get three months free, so make sure to check for an active subscription before looking for this deal. You get three audiobooks to keep, full access to the big library, and it works even if you’ve had a sub before as long as it’s not active now. I just logged in, saw the banner, and grabbed it. <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em> is already in my library, and I’m eyeing that massive new Sanderson one next. Less than three bucks for all that? Easy win.</p></div><p id="3-months-free-kindle-unlimited"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited">3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited</h2></p><div catalogid="bac8eeb1-cb76-4ce5-8784-e2fb014e64c5" id="223446"><div id="223446" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve never really stuck with audiobooks before, but this Kindle Unlimited deal finally got me into them properly. Right now you can get three months free if you’ve got Prime, and it works on your phone or tablet, not just a Kindle. I gave it a go, downloaded a couple of books, and now I’ve actually started finishing them while I’m out walking or doing stuff around the house. It’s made getting through my backlog way easier and I didn’t have to pay a thing to try it. If you’ve been on the fence, this is a solid excuse to dive in.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Price Comparison</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the pricing here by Amazon is insane, but there's some deals to be had when comparing these products to TCG Player. For example, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7YM4?object_uuid=846ed0e8-2a82-47cd-bbd1-7a9842c18700&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prismatic Evolutions Super-Premium Collection</a> was a massive 56% below <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xEG5?object_uuid=846ed0e8-2a82-47cd-bbd1-7a9842c18700&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">market value</a>, but TCG Player is coming in cheaper now at $195. On the other end of the scale, TCG Player has <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnm1k?object_uuid=846ed0e8-2a82-47cd-bbd1-7a9842c18700&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cynthia’s Garchomp ex Premium Collection</a> at a massive 48% below <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpXZv?object_uuid=846ed0e8-2a82-47cd-bbd1-7a9842c18700&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon's current price</a>, which is very close to MSRP. I've compared all the prices in the carousel above, but another pro tip is clicking through to eBay to see if there's any new bargains to be had.
</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">This Weeks Pokémon Card Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve been keeping a close eye on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-june-23">Pokémon TCG market this month</a>, and we’re seeing two very different stories unfold. On one side, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks</a> cards are going through a steep correction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Crown Zenith</a> cards are showing early signs of what could be a long-term value surge. The bottom line? If you're a collector or investor, <strong>now is the time to buy into both.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m picking up what I can from both sets. The current dip in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-booster-bundle-shining-fates-amazon-restock-latest">Sparks</a> is a glimmer of hope for long-suffering 2024-2025 collectors. And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-card-packs">Crown Zenith</a> is a train I want to be on before it leaves the station.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Classic</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sam's Club Pokémon TCG Classic deal is back, and it's massively undercutting other big box retailers and the secondary market. Just for comparrison, the top four cards from this set, Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur and Mewtwo, are worth the same price as this discounted offer. This deal is well worth it and should be snapped up as soon as possible.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Mega Evolution Pokémon Cards Are Climbing</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"> I can't believe the X Y era of Pokémon cards came out 12 years ago, but it was an amazing era for the TCG introducing the Mega Evolution mechanic. Mega's will be returning later this year with the start of the Mega Evolutions era and the end of Scarlet and Violet, so snapping up these top Mega cards before prices go even higher is a wise move. We know how it'll play out, no one will be able to grab the new sets at launch, then the nostalgia will kick in and these cards will skyrocket.  Just the Charizards and Rayquazzas alone are worth a look.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Magic: The Gathering Price Comparison</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">MTG doesn't seem to be struggling to keep up with demand despite it being one of the biggest trading card games on earth, but that doesn't stop big box retailers getting cheeky when they notice a peak in demand. Like with Pokémon TCG, i've gone through the majority of MTG stock on Amazon and compared their pricing to market values on TCG Player. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1vxV?object_uuid=846ed0e8-2a82-47cd-bbd1-7a9842c18700&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Theros Beyond Death booster</a> made me spit out my tea.

Go figure. Another big difference is <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBgnNN?object_uuid=846ed0e8-2a82-47cd-bbd1-7a9842c18700&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marvel's Spider-Man - Play Booster Box</a>.

It plays 4K Blu-rays in native 4K UHD (2160p) resolution and supports HDR10, which improves picture brightness.</p><p>It comes with an HDMI cable, but we'd recommend grabbing a second 4K cable if you don't have a spare. That's because the player has two HDMI out ports. The main one is for video and audio, and is the only one you must use, but the second output is dedicated to audio. Separating audio from video output produces a richer, clearer sound, so dual ports are common on dedicated 4K Blu-ray players. It's one of the benefits of using a media player for Blu-rays instead of a game console like the PS5 or Xbox Series X. You can grab an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-High-Speed-HDMI-Cable-1-Pack/dp/B014I8SSD0?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Basics 4K HDMI cable for $6</a> right now.</p><p>The UBP-X700U also has a Coaxial SPDIF, which can be connected to speakers, soundbars, and TVs. In- terms of audio support, the UBP-X700U is equipped with high-end audio enhancements, including Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.</p><p>One of the coolest features of dedicated Blu-ray players like the X700U is picture upscaling. The X700U can read 4K Blu-ray, standard Blu-ray, and DVDs. When enabled, the built-in tech will enhance the resolution of standard Blu-rays and DVDs.</p><p>While we haven't tested the 2025 edition of the X700U, the upscaling feature on previous iterations was quite impressive. Standard 1080p Blu-rays can look pretty darn close to 4K resolution, and 480p resolution DVDs are substantially better. Honestly, without upscaling tech, DVDs generally look terrible on modern 4K and HD panels. That said, upscaled output varies, and sometimes there are jagged edges or noticeable oddities that won't be appealing to viewers looking for an authentic experience.</p></div>                      </div><p dir="ltr">For a higher-end 4K player with built-in streaming and voice assistant capabilities, check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Ultra-Assist-Blu-ray-Player/dp/B07N3PQM5N?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Ultra-Assist-Blu-ray-Player/dp/B07N3PQM5N?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Panasonic DP-UB820-K</a>.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-retire-following-next-gen-xbox-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/phil-spencer-will-retire-following-the-next-gen-xbox-launch-sarah-bond-to-take-over-%E2%80%93-rumor.1234395/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest in today's whirlwind of Microsoft and Xbox-related news is a rumor that <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-feels-great-about-xboxs-2025-slate-of-games-with-more-unannounced-titles-to-come/">Phil Spencer</a>, the current chief executive officer of Microsoft's Gaming division will retire following the launch of Xbox's next-gen console. Sarah Bond, who is currently the head of Xbox at Microsoft, is rumored to take his place.</p>



<div><p>This claim comes from <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1940460596995961190">TheGhostOfHope on X</a>, an account that has previously been accurate regarding Call of Duty news. It's also been slightly corroborated by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-retiring-xbox-next-gen/">Insider-Gaming</a>, who claims that Spencer's retirement in the near future is something they have also heard multiple times this year. That said, Phil Spencer is currently 57 years old. He's worked at Microsoft in one form or another since 1988 and joined the Xbox team in 2001. He's been at the head of Xbox since 2014, and in 2022, he was made the chief executive officer of Microsoft Gaming. </p><p>He's climbed the ladder as far as he could, and is near retirement age. That he has one foot out the door isn't the greatest bit of speculation, but it's also not a surprise that this claim would come on the day when there are many changes being announced internally at Microsoft and in its gaming division, even beyond what we've already heard about.</p></div>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>EXCLUSIVE: Phil Spencer will be retiring from his role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming after the launch of the next generation Xbox.</p><p>Phil Spencer is working closely with Sarah Bond and her team to ensure a smooth transition for her take over as CEO of Microsoft Gaming once he… <a href="https://t.co/LDqB4BW8ER">pic.twitter.com/LDqB4BW8ER</a></p></div>— Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1940460596995961190?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Spencer took charge of Xbox after the man he replaced, Dom Mattrick, left a mess of a console launch for him to clean up with the abysmal start to the Xbox One generation. He brought the platform back into the spotlight for positive reasons with his championing of Xbox Game Pass, a service that carried the moniker of 'the best deal in gaming' for years.</p>



<p>More recently, his legacy has been the massive acquisitions he's helped secure, of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-has-acquired-bethesda-and-all-its-ips-from-elder-scrolls-to-doom/">ZeniMax and Bethesda</a>, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-has-been-acquired-by-microsoft-for-70-billion/">Activision Blizzard King</a>, though what people will remember of those acquisitions are the mass layoffs that followed them, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">today's massive cuts</a>. </p>



<p>Ultimately, Spencer's retirement is more of a question of when, not if. We've been hearing rumors about <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-rumored-to-support-backward-compatibility-at-hardware-level/">Xbox's next-gen hardware</a> for some time now, and we know that there's an <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">Xbox-branded ROG Ally handheld</a> coming at the end of this year. It could be the case that Spencer's retirement will come after the ROG Xbox Ally is out. It could also be that he'll step down after the next proper Xbox console is out. Either way, it seems clear that his time at Microsoft is winding down.</p>

        <p>Together with "several unannounced projects"</p>

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Microsoft have cancelled their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> reboot and closed its development studio The Initiative in the course of this week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">scything sacrifices to their actually rather healthy bottom line</a>. In a statement, head of Xbox Matt Booty also confirmed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">the cancellation of Rare's Everwild</a>, alongside "several unannounced projects". </p> <!--more-->
<p>Booty says this "reflects a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape." For context, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q3/press-release-webcast">announced net income of $25.8 billion</a> for their most recent financial quarter, with the Xbox division also posting year-over-year revenue growth.</p>
<p>In an email to staff announcing the wider layoffs, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer echoed Booty in styling them a question of "[making] choices now for continued success in future years", and having "the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities." A reported 9,100 people have been kicked to the curb across Microsoft's operations, but as far as I know, no senior leadership salaries are being "disciplined".</p>
<p>While depressing, the cancellation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everwild">Everwild</a> perhaps isn't surprising, given how long it had been in development, and Rare's reported difficulties settling on a direction for the game. The Perfect Dark reboot was also a troubled project. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-making-a-new-perfect-dark">Announced in 2020</a>, it was still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/that-perfect-dark-reboot-is-still-in-early-development-and-years-from-release-report-claims">"in the earliest stages"</a> of development in 2023, according to one report. But then came a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/perfect-dark-reboot-resurfaces-with-stealth-parkour-and-spy-gadgetry">June 2024 trailer</a> that brought a smile even to Graham Smith's careworn visage. I thought it seemed promising, too, albeit not much like the campy original for N64.</p>
<p>Best of luck to all those affected, and to all those who don't yet know whether they're affected. In other layoff news, Microsoft have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-mmorpg-from-the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-has-reportedly-been-cancelled-as-part-of-microsofts-layoffs">taken the axe to a new MMO from Elder Scrolls Online developers ZeniMax Online Studios</a>. There are probably more cancellations to be announced.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success]]></content:encoded>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Initiative was formed in 2018 and based in Santa Monica. Billed as a "AAAA" studio, it was led by former Crystal Dynamics studio head Darrel Gallagher and made up of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-studio-the-initiative-adds-alumni-from-re/1100-6469070/" data-ref-id="1100-6469070">developers from Respawn, BioWare, Naughty Dog, and more</a>. In 2021, The Initiative announced it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-being-co-developed-by-tomb-raider-dev-crystal-dynamics/1100-6496517/" data-ref-id="1100-6496517">partner with Crystal Dynamics</a>, developer of the most recent Tomb Raider games, to assist on the Perfect Dark reboot.</p><p dir="ltr">Players got their first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-gets-first-gameplay-trailer/1100-6524084/" data-ref-id="1100-6524084">Perfect Dark gameplay</a> in 2024 as part of that year's Xbox Games Showcase. The trailer showed Perfect Dark to be a first-person shooter with immersive sim elements, as series protagonist Joanna Dark used gadgets, stealth, and melee takedowns to complete her objectives, all the while hinting at a greater conspiracy for players to uncover. Despite the gameplay showcase, Perfect Dark did not ever receive a release window.</p><p dir="ltr">A report from shortly before the debut of Perfect Dark's gameplay trailer stated the reboot of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-is-allegedly-in-bad-shape/1100-6523261/" data-ref-id="1100-6523261">spy FPS was in bad shape</a> and that the project hadn't "really come together" despite Crystal Dynamics being brought in to help development.</p><p dir="ltr">Perfect Dark and The Initiative are just a few of the games and studios to be affected by this new wave of layoffs at Microsoft. While at the time of writing The Initiative is the only studio closure announced, other studios like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online</a>, Blizzard, Forza developer Turn 10 and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-forza-studios-impacted-by-xbox-layoffs/1100-6532918/" data-ref-id="1100-6532918">Call of Duty Black Ops 7 developer Raven Software have also seen layoffs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty in an internal email shared by Windows Central confirmed Perfect Dark, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Rare's Everwild</a>, and several other unannounced projects, one of which is reported to be ZeniMax Online's next MMORPG, have all been canceled as part of the layoffs.</p><p>"We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio," Booty writes in the email. "As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment."</p><p>It's just the latest round of layoffs for Microsoft in recent years. In 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-10000-people-cuts-reportedly-include-xbox-and-bethesda/1100-6510650/" data-ref-id="1100-6510650">Microsoft laid off an estimated 10,000 people</a>. Following its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft laid off an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/" data-ref-id="1100-6520601">estimated 1,900 employees in 2024</a>. That same year it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">shut down four Bethesda studios</a>, including Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Microsoft has laid off thousands of workers across its various divisions in the latest cost-cutting measures taken by the corporation, whose 2024 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar24/index.html">revenue exceeded $245 billion</a>, a 16-percent increase over its 2023 revenue. Though the cuts have impacted several of the company's various divisions, Xbox appears to be hit particularly hard. This represents the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/06/24/major-xbox-layoffs-reportedly-inbound-for-the-fourth-time-in-18-months">fourth time in 18 months</a> that Microsoft Gaming has laid off workers.</p><p>"We continue to implement organizational and workforce changes that are necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace," an Xbox spokesperson said in an official comment provided to <em>Game Informer</em>. Alongside the official statement, Xbox PR confirmed that less than 4 percent of Microsoft's global workforce was impacted. However, according to <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/facts-about-microsoft/">Microsoft's official reporting</a>, the company employs 228,000 people worldwide, which means 4 percent of the global workforce accounts for more than 9,100 people. Xbox PR also confirmed to <em>Game Informer </em>that the gaming division is impacted, "but not the majority," and stopped short of providing any additional details. When I requested a percentage of Xbox-specific impact, PR could not provide additional context.</p><p>However, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-thousands-xbox-gamning-1236446010/"><em>Variety </em></a>and several other outlets obtained a memo to Xbox employees from Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer. Notably, Spencer says, "Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger," and "Simply put, we would not be where we are without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted." You can see that in its entirety below.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.&nbsp;</p><p>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we’re seeing currently is based on tough decisions we’ve made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.&nbsp;</p><p>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental—it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams. &nbsp;</p><p>HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review. &nbsp;</p><p>Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey. &nbsp;</p><p>Phil&nbsp;</p></div><p>Subsequently, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696877/xbox-perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-the-initiative-layoffs"><em>The Verge</em></a> acquired a memo sent by Xbox president of game content and studios, Matt Booty. In his memo, Booty confirms Xbox is closing down The Initiative, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/e3-2018/2018/06/10/new-microsoft-internal-studio-announced-undead-labs-ninja-theory-playground">an all-new first-party studio founded by Xbox in 2018</a> in Santa Monica, California. In 2020, The Initiative revealed it was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2020/2020/12/10/the-initiatives-perfect-dark-announced">working on a new entry in the Perfect Dark franchise</a>, which is now canceled as a result of this closure. Booty also confirms the Twycross, England-based Rare, which Xbox acquired in 2002 and has worked on titles like Sea of Thieves and Viva Piñata, has been impacted by this round of layoffs, and its new IP, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/11/14/rare-works-its-whimsical-magic-in-the-new-world-of-everwild">Everwild</a>, which was announced in 2019, has also been canceled. You can read his full memo below.</p><div><p>Following Phil’s note, I want to share more about the changes to the Studios business units.</p><p>We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio. As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment.</p><p>Our overall portfolio strategy is unchanged: build games that excite our players, continue to grow our biggest franchises, and create new stories, worlds, and characters. We have more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026.</p><p>For those directly affected, we are working closely with HR and studio leadership to provide support, including severance, career transition assistance, and where possible, opportunities to explore roles on other teams.</p><p>To everyone across our studios: thank you. Your creativity and resilience continue to define who we are. I believe in the strength of our teams and the direction we’re taking on the path ahead.</p><p>Matt</p></div><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTQ2MDUyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMDY1MzI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVJWTDFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.HYeStbJNn6_ntf1rQ17kOC1dHHlVk_Zx4yCTGqcYXAA"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, Candy Crush developer King, which Xbox acquired in 2023 as part of the blockbuster $68.7 billion Activision Blizzard King deal, is cutting 10 percent of its staff, which amounts to around 200 jobs, and ZeniMax, which Xbox acquired in 2021 as part of its $7.5 billion acquisition of Bethesda, suffered losses. According to that same report, a new MMORPG that was in development at ZeniMax Online Studios, has also been canceled. Meanwhile, <em>Bloomberg</em> also reports Raven Software, which was acquired as part of the Activision Blizzard King purchase and has worked extensively on recent Call of Duty titles, is also impacted. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696676/microsoft-forza-motorsport-turn-10-studios-layoffs-xbox-cuts"><em>The Verge</em> also reports</a> that Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10 Studios is also heavily impacted by these cuts, with more than 70 people reportedly laid off.</p><p>Microsoft has laid off thousands upon thousands of workers over the last 18 months, including <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/25/microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees-across-xbox-activision-blizzard-and-zenimax">1,900 employees in January 2024</a>.

<p>"Co-creating the show has been a career highlight," Druckmann said. "It's been an honour to work alongside Craig Mazin to executive produce, direct and write on the last two seasons."</p>
<p>Druckmann added he was "deeply thankful for the thoughtful approach and dedication the talented cast and crew took to adapting" the first The Last of Us game, as well as the ongoing work adapting The Last of Us Part 2 for TV.</p>
<p>The statement noted now was the right time for the Naughty Dog head to step back from the show, before meaningful work on season three begins.</p>

<p>The Last of Us season two aired earlier this year, picking up five years after the events of the season one finale, with Ellie and Joel - played by Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal - now living in Jackson. New cast members this season included Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, Isabela Merced as Dina, Young Mazino as Jesse and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-who-catherine-ohara-will-play-in-the-last-of-us-marking-a-significant-change-from-the-games">Catherine O'Hara as a new character for the show, Gail</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to its season two premiere, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-show-renewed-for-season-three-and-the-second-hasnt-even-aired-yet">The Last of Us was renewed for a third season</a>. At this time, showrunner Craig Mazin said: "We approached season two with the goal of creating something we could be proud of. The end results have exceeded even our most ambitious goals, thanks to our continued collaboration with HBO and the impeccable work of our unparalleled cast and crew."</p>
<p>The showrunner additionally confirmed The Last of Us TV team is working on a four season plan, stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-confirms-four-season-plan-says-no-way-to-wrap-things-up-in-three">there's "no way" the show's narrative can be wrapped up in only three seasons</a>.</p>

<p>As for Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, earlier this year the star of Naughty Dog's next game said she'd received preparation for the role - and specifically the online reaction to it - from Druckmann himself, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-online-backlash-prompted-naughty-dogs-next-star-to-get-bootcamp-ing-from-neil-druckmann">following the online abuse previously kicked up around The Last of Us Part 2</a>.</p>
<p>Back in March, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion">Druckmann explained how Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet features a fictitious religion</a> which "becomes pretty prominent" in the game's alternate history.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="PowerA 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/413a1c80020e8/powera-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Like the Switch 1 before it, the Switch 2 will no doubt play host to dozens of third-party controllers over the course of its (hopefully) long lifespan. First out of the gate is PowerA with its Advantage Wired Controller, which I received in a rather jovial <a href="https://powera.pxf.io/c/205546/1256186/15385?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.powera.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2Fcontrollers%2Fwired%2Fadvantage-wired-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-mario-time-nsgp0527-01%2F" rel="sponsored noopener">Mario Time</a> theme. You can also get a <a href="https://powera.pxf.io/c/205546/1256186/15385?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.powera.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2Fcontrollers%2Fwired%2Fadvantage-wired-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-mushroom-kingdom-nsgp0526-01%2F" rel="sponsored noopener">Mushroom Kingdom</a> themed variant along with a <a href="https://powera.pxf.io/c/205546/1256186/15385?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.powera.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2Fcontrollers%2Fwired%2Fadvantage-wired-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-black-nsgp0523-01%2F" rel="sponsored noopener">standard black design</a> – y’know, if you’re boring (joking!).</p>
<p>Boasting a similar layout to Nintendo's official <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Pro Controller</a>, the Advantage pad features offset analogue sticks, two mappable ‘AGL’ and ‘AGR’ buttons on the backside, and a handy headphone jack on the bottom. Really, the only major change in terms of layout is the placement of the start, select, home, GameChat, and capture buttons, which are all housed beneath the d-pad and right analogue stick.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7knoxgl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13CJKg9tJk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>To be honest, this alone was enough to throw me off my game; I’d often go to reach toward the centre of the pad to hit the home button, miss, and instead give the image of Mario a good ol’ fondle (Sorry, Mario) before realising the home button is actually down toward the bottom.</p>
<p>Having all of these buttons gathered together in one place <em>is</em> convenient in a way, and it does allow the artwork to really shine if you go for one of the themed variants, but it definitely plays havoc with about thirty years’ worth of muscle memory in which controllers at least housed the start and select buttons in the centre. Why fix what isn’t broken, y’know?</p>

<p>As for those mappable buttons on the back, these don’t function like the ‘GL’ and ‘GR’ buttons on the Pro Controller. Well, they <em>do</em>, but you can’t assign inputs to them quite as easily. With Nintendo’s own offering, you can simply hold down the home button and assign inputs via the quick settings menu, but that isn’t available for PowerA’s controller.</p>
<p>Instead, you need to hold down the additional ‘PRGM’ button on the back until the LED light on the bottom turns dark blue. Then, you hit the button you want to remap and then assign it to either ‘AGL’ or ‘AGR’. It’s pretty manageable in practice and won’t take long to figure out after your first couple of goes, but it would’ve been nice if it supported quick remaps via the settings menu like the Pro Controller.</p>

<p>In terms of build quality, this is very much a budget controller, so it’s <em>incredibly</em> light at just 143g. For comparison, the Pro Controller is 235g, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-controller-the-return-of-the-king">GameCube controller</a> is 210g, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-ultimate-2c-bluetooth-controller-probably-the-best-budget-switch-pad">8bitdo’s Ultimate 2C Controller</a> is also 235g. Combined with the mandatory wired setup, the lightweight design makes lengthy gaming sessions an absolute breeze – no need to worry about discomfort or loss of battery life at all.</p>
<p>On the flip side, it’s… well, <em>too</em> <em>light</em>; to the point where it comes off as being pretty cheap. It feels like there’s barely anything inside the device, and you can tell by just tapping on the exterior with your finger: it sounds very hollow. This is exacerbated by the buttons, all of which give off very loud ‘clicks’ when pressed.</p>
<p>The worst of these are those aforementioned back buttons, which when pressed, sound like they’re reverberating throughout the interior of the controller.</p>

<p>Looking at the analogue sticks in a bit more detail, I don’t have a great deal to complain about here. They’re perfectly smooth and functional, with decent travel and good grip. Again, they sound pretty loud when hitting the casing on the outside, which you’ll definitely notice if you’ve been using the Switch 2's official Pro Controller, but otherwise, they’re good.</p>
<p>I can’t say the same for the d-pad, though. It’s slightly thicker and more rounded than Nintendo’s own offering, and it feels weirdly spongy when pressed. Needless to say, this makes more precise inputs a bit tricker on some retro games, and I wouldn’t even consider using it on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>

<p>All in all, this isn’t a controller I’d recommend if you’re after a daily driver for the Switch 2. Your best options at the moment are Nintendo’s own Joy-Con 2 or Pro Controller. That said, if you’re after something cheap and cheerful for the player two in your life, this is a perfectly adequate option for you. Yes, it may feel a bit too light for some, the lack of rumble and motion control support is frustrating, and the wired setup sure isn't for everybody, but it’ll come in handy in a pinch if you’re looking for some local multiplayer fun.</p>

Indeed, now the developers have confirmed that there are some MMO-style features, such as: </p>



<ul>
<li><em>Build or join a Guild to unlock a wide range of group activities—from intense guild wars to challenging multiplayer dungeons and epic raids. </em></li>



<li><em>Prove your might in competitive duels, or step into a shared, ever-evolving world with thousands of fellow adventurers.</em></li>
