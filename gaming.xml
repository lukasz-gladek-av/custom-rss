Today, it informed me that I could now purchase a $600 Radeon RX 9070 XT <a href="https://www.centralcomputer.com/sapphire-pulse-radeon-rx-9070-xt-gaming-16gb-gddr6-graphics-card-pcie-5-0-3x-displayport-2-1-1x-hdmi-2-1-16-pin-power-connectors.html">for $850</a> — a $250 markup.</p><p>It’s not alone. I just checked every major US retailer and street prices on eBay, and I regret to inform you: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/1/23191634/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-over-3080-3070-3060-radeon-rx-6900-6800">the great GPU shortage</a> has returned. Many AMD cards are being marked up $100, $200, $250, even $280. The street price of an Nvidia RTX 5080 is now over $1,500, a full $500 higher than MSRP. And <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">an RTX 5090</a>, the most powerful consumer GPU? You can’t even get the $2,000 card for $3,000 today.</p><p>Here, I’ve built tables to show you:</p><div><h2>GPU street prices: April 2025</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Item</h3></th><th><h3>MSRP</h3></th><th><h3>Average eBay street price (Mar-Apr)</h3></th><th><h3>Best retail price (April 25th)</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$957</td><td>$880</td></tr><tr><td>AMD Radeon RX 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$761</td><td>$835</td></tr><tr><td>Nvidia RTX 5090</td><td>$1,999</td><td>$3,871</td><td>$3,140</td></tr><tr><td>Nvidia RTX 5080</td><td>$999</td><td>$1,533</td><td>$1,390</td></tr><tr><td>Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti</td><td>$749</td><td>$1,052</td><td>$825</td></tr><tr><td>Nvidia RTX 5070</td><td>$549</td><td>$715</td><td>$610</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>“Best retail price” is the actual price I saw a card for on April 25th — roughly the minimum you’d pay.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>You shouldn’t just blame tariffs for these price hikes. In early March, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628332/amd-9070-xt-gpu-retailer-partner-scalping">we found retailers were already scalping</a> their supposedly entry-level MSRP models of the new AMD graphics cards. Nor is this likely to just be high demand, given how few cards are changing hands on eBay: only around 1,100 new Nvidia GPUs, and around 266 new AMD GPUs were listed there over the past 30 days.</p><div><p>But tariffs may have an greater impact soon: on May 2nd, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/politics/646604/trump-tariffs-reciprocal-pause-canada-mexico-china-de-minimis">the de minimis exemption will no longer apply</a>, meaning shipments valued at $800 or less can be taxed, and many more shipments will likely get hit as a result. Stores like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/656165/shein-temu-price-increase-trump-tariffs-fast-fashion">Shein and Temu have already raised prices</a> in anticipation.</p></div><p>Here’s a deeper dive on the “MSRP” models of the AMD cards, which were all originally listed at $549 or $599:</p><div><h2>AMD “MSRP” GPU prices, April 2025</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Item</h3></th><th><h3>MSRP</h3></th><th><h3>April 25th, Newegg</h3></th><th><h3>April 25th, Micro Center</h3></th><th><h3>eBay street price (past 30 days)</h3></th><th><h3>Units on eBay (past 30 days)</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>PowerColor Reaper 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$699</td><td>$799</td><td>$755</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Sapphire Pulse 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$879</td><td>$849</td><td>$879</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>XFX Swift 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$839</td><td>$829</td><td>$949</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>ASRock Steel Legend 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$699</td><td>$699</td><td>$892</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Gigabyte Gaming 9070 XT</td><td>$599</td><td>$659</td><td>N/A</td><td>$913</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>PowerColor Reaper 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$699</td><td>$679</td><td>$765</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Sapphire Pulse 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$669</td><td>$789</td><td>$771</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>XFX Swift OC 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$639</td><td>$749</td><td>$746</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>ASRock Challenger 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$549</td><td>$609</td><td>$880</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Gigabyte Gaming OC 9070</td><td>$549</td><td>$669</td><td>$669</td><td>$893</td><td>36</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>eBay street prices are an average.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>I’ve focused this table on Newegg and Micro Center since they carry more models than any other retailer, though I also spotted “MSRP” 9070 XT cards at $800 and $850 at Amazon today, and an $830 card at Best Buy. Otherwise, these are the new sticker prices, not necessarily attainable prices, as most were out of stock.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay">From December 2020</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/1/23191634/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-over-3080-3070-3060-radeon-rx-6900-6800">July 2022</a>, I periodically tracked the prices of game consoles and GPUs during the covid-19 pandemic, when they were incredibly expensive to obtain. At one point, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards">some GPUs were worth triple their MSRP</a>.

Knowing he would hit “skip” at the start of every game’s tutorial as well feels like an important window into his character.</p><p><strong>Carolyn Petit</strong>: That was a wild and fun moment, one that made me want to play <em>TIE Fighter </em>again! (I was pretty confused as to why Cassian hadn’t gotten training on how to fly the damn thing beforehand though, but this wound up being explained later.) </p><p>And what I love about that whole intro sequence is that I think it works as a kind of microcosm of what makes Andor such a compelling and brilliant show. It has “fun” moments that are uniquely <em>Star Wars</em> but they’re supported by storytelling that really foregrounds the political conflict that has always been present in the series. </p><p>Right before that scene with the TIE, Cassian speaks to an Imperial technician who has aided him at great personal risk to herself. She asks him a very reasonable question: “If I die tonight, was it worth it?” He gives her a beautiful answer, one that includes the words, “You’ll never feel right unless you’re doing what you can to stop them. You’re coming home to yourself.” It’s so true, I think. So many of us are struggling right now with the potential risk involved in standing up to the malevolent political forces in our own world, but at the same time, not doing something means losing ourselves because we’re not being true to our own moral core. </p><p><em>Andor </em>knows that acting in solidarity is beautiful and that sometimes people have to make some terrible sacrifices. And it confronts us with all of this a few minutes before giving us the almost comical action of Cassian trying to come to grips with the damn ship and mowing down heaps of stormtroopers in the process! </p><p><strong>Zack Zwiezen:</strong> It was a really strong start to the show that instantly reminded viewers of what <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-andor-season-2-release-date-disney-streaming-1851694453&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-andor-season-2-release-date-disney-streaming-1851694453"><em>Andor</em></a></span><em> </em>is really about, showed us how much he has grown in a year, and also allowed the series to include a fun <em>Star Wars </em>adventure of stealing a TIE Fighter and barely escaping. Perfect opening to a new season. Other writers and showrunners should take notes. </p><p><strong>EG</strong>: That moment with the technician is one of the stronger scenes in the entire opening chapter (first three episodes) and an important element of humanity that sort of underlies the whole project and grounds it, which is that even the big bad galactic empire is full of people just waiting to be tipped over the edge into rebelling. </p><p>For every collaborator there’s someone ready to desert. The opening episodes really do a great job of teetering back and forth between hope and despair, not just because of the insurmountable odds but also because of the grim, dark, and even immoral sacrifices made to try and even them.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>That’s right. It doesn’t try to reduce or simplify things morally or in human terms, something <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-horror-andor-season-2-1851775862?_gl=1*4mmf6k*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTYxODMwNC40Mi4wLjE3NDU2MTgzMDQuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-horror-andor-season-2-1851775862?_gl=1*4mmf6k*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTYxODMwNC40Mi4wLjE3NDU2MTgzMDQuNjAuMC4w"><em>Star Wars</em>,</a></span> a series that’s broadly about good vs. evil, “light” and “dark,” has arguably done at times in the past. </p><p>In fact <em>Andor </em>is all about acknowledging the complexities, the reality that solidarity doesn’t always mean working alongside people you’re in total ideological lockstep and perfect harmony with; sometimes it means working with people you have fierce disagreements with about some things, but you’re aligned on one key principle or goal and you let that be enough.</p><p>There sure are some awful people in the Empire, though; I continue to particularly loathe that smarmy bureaucrat Syril, for instance. </p><p>And I was surprised to see, in what I think is a first for <em>Star Wars </em>as a series, <em>Andor</em> touching on how the fascist oppression of groups of people and sexual violence against women historically go hand in hand, with that vile Imperial officer Krole attempting to rape Bix. It was chilling, but I think <em>Andor’s </em>serious handling of its subject matter earned it the right to go there. </p><p>As for those “immoral” sacrifices you mentioned, what can I say? I love Luthen, and his willingness to do whatever he feels protecting the Rebellion demands. Him telling Mon Mothma “How nice for you” after he basically tells her, in his coded way, that he’s gonna have to take a certain liability out of the picture and she acts like she doesn’t quite understand what he’s saying is such a great moment, only made better by her trying to lose herself in booze and music right afterwards as some part of her struggled with the painful realization that her commitment to this rebellion had moral demands that went beyond even what she’d previously imagined.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> I also loved the way <em>Andor </em>continues to show that the rebellion wasn’t some perfectly organized group of people all on the same page in the fight against the Empire. </p><p>Watching that ragtag group of rebels  break into arguments and then get into a protracted stand-off was a perfect reminder that part of the problem you face when fighting giant organized fascist empires is that you tend to have a lot of diverse people and ideas trying to work together. And that can cause people who should be on the same side to turn on each other</p><p>I also think it is interesting that for a show named <em>Andor</em>, he’s not that big a part of the first three episodes.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Yeah! In that sense, these first three episodes did feel a bit like set-up, putting Cassian himself to the side a bit so they could both focus on laying the groundwork for Mon Mothma’s arc (I continue to be so impressed by the complexity of Genevieve O’Reilly’s performance) and in order to plant the seeds for...<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-easter-eggs-andor-season-2-first-3-episodes-1851777501/slides/11&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-easter-eggs-andor-season-2-first-3-episodes-1851777501/slides/11">something (ahem)</a></span> to happen on Ghorman later on.</p><p><strong> ZZ:</strong> Man, O’Reilly’s performance in this is so good. Who could have guessed that the actress George Lucas picked to play Mon Mothma—mainly because she looked so similar—for a few scenes that were mostly deleted from <em>Revenge of the Sith</em> would go on to be so incredible 20 years later. </p><p>Also, they should totally add that scene back into<em> Revenge of the Sith</em>. It’s a good scene and it would connect the movies to <em>Andor</em> in a fun way for people going back and re-watching them post-<em>Andor</em>.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> It was really cool (in a horrifying way) hearing those Imperial propaganda experts talk about the ways in which they manipulate galactic opinion about Ghormans by leaning into and perpetuating negative stereotypes, another thing that <em>Andor </em>takes right from the history books about how fascism works. </p><p>And I do think these three episodes successfully generated suspense around Cassian’s absence, with his friends (and, of course, poor B2EMO!) feeling the pressure rise as they awaited him. I do hope he gets to decisively shift into a more prominent and active role with the next three episodes though!</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> Let’s talk about that wedding.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/siddhantadlakha.bsky.social/post/3lngxbywwps2f&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/siddhantadlakha.bsky.social/post/3lngxbywwps2f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIAMOS!</a></span></p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> DJ DROIDBOT! I was impressed and enjoyed that opening “oner” shot that walked us through the people at the wedding and revealed Luthen at the end. </p><p><strong>EG</strong>: Imagine having multiple principals on set to film at the same time!</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Imagine having a set that big!</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>And talk about contrast. Superficially there’s the glitzy dancefloor, the wildly expensive statue, the performance of joy and celebration, but all the while there are such high-stakes political dimensions at play, and we really feel Mon Mothma working to stay focused on her political goals which are so much larger than herself, even as she’s dealing with the very real pain of a daughter who receives her coldly.</p><p> It’s grand and intimate all at once, balancing the human and the political dimensions very effectively which I think has long been a skill that sets Tony Gilroy apart. </p><p><strong>EG: </strong>She’s trying to create a better future for her daughter who is very content to live her comfortable life under the Empire.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Yes!</p><p><strong>EG: </strong>Meanwhile she’s sold out her childhood friend for being in the midst of a late-life crisis. </p><p>I also liked the subtle look her husband gives her when she’s drunkenly dancing, like “Finally she’s doing what we all want her to do, just shut up and have fun.”</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Yes, that moment with her dancing and her husband watching stuck out to me. This is a side of Mothma we’ve never seen before. Even the actress said in a behind-the-scenes video that after doing that she learned more about Mothma. And I think we all did, too.</p><p>Now, for a part I didn’t like: The death of big man Brasso.</p><p>To be clear: I don’t mind the show killing characters. This is a rebellion against an evil empire. People are going to die. But I think it was just done really sloppily. I wasn’t even sure what happened. It was a rare moment in <em>Andor </em>where I felt like the direction just didn’t work. I was confused by the moment. Wait he’s dead? How? When? He was shot? I think? I don’t know... didn’t work for me. </p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Agreed; as a character, Brasso deserved to go out better (or at least more clearly) than that.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I get that the maybe the idea was, “Hey, look, heroes like Brasso can die just as randomly as nobodies.” Sure. Fine. That’s a good point. I get it. But yeah, what a confusing death for an awesome character. </p><p><strong>EG: </strong>Brasso had worse luck dodging blaster fire than the Jedi mowed down by Order 66.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Too soon, man. Too soon. </p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Everything else about the situation Brasso, Bix and the gang endured there really resonated though.</p><p> I like that <em>Andor </em>is a show that, on one hand, we can write <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-easter-eggs-andor-season-2-first-3-episodes-1851777501?_gl=1*1ygevn2*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTYxODMwNC40Mi4xLjE3NDU2MjA5NTUuNTkuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-easter-eggs-andor-season-2-first-3-episodes-1851777501?_gl=1*1ygevn2*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTYxODMwNC40Mi4xLjE3NDU2MjA5NTUuNTkuMC4w">fun lists of <em>Star Wars </em>Easter eggs</a></span> about, and on the other, keeps offering direct parallels to how actual oppressive and fascist governments work. </p><p>The language the Imperials used about them being not just “undocumented” but “illegal” had me wanting to scream “No one is illegal!” at the screen, and Gilroy and co. are absolutely not being shy about making those connections as explicit as possible; that fucker Krole says something like “The Councils need the help or there’s no harvest. The help is undocumented,” driving home how migrant workers that are absolutely vital to industries like agriculture are often targeted.</p><p>Meanwhile, one thing I thought was really fun: the informative video about those spiders on Ghorman. It had the feel of the kinds of government-produced educational videos I’d sometimes see in class in elementary school.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I loved it! But also, I’m not sure why Krennic showed so much of it. Maybe he really likes spiders!?</p><p>Something I really appreciated about the meeting with Krennic and the other Empire members is how they aren’t all onboard, but others can sort of convince them to be worse. It’s subtle, but it shows how these decisions can happen. Even people who might think they are good, with enough power and in the wrong place, can agree to some horrible shit. And then they can say, “Well, it was a group decision.” Or blame it on the Empire and not themselves.</p><p>Okay, we’ve talked enough about themes and writing and direction etc etc. Can we talk about that Yavin-4 reveal?!</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Absolutely!</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> I’ll admit it: I made a noise. <em>Andor </em>is a show that so rarely does that kind of stuff that I squealed a bit. I’m a <em>Star Wars </em>sicko.  And I loved that reveal. I was so distracted by what was happening that I didn’t even notice the fact they didn’t reveal the planet’s name he landed on. And then I was like “Oh, you bastards!”</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> I have to admit, it was pretty cool. </p><p>I’m not someone who gets excited about references for the sake of references but this felt earned somehow; it’s cool knowing that this seemingly random planet actually goes on to become a place of vital importance in the Rebellion’s future. It feels like one more thing that deepens Cassian’s legacy as a character whose experiences and actions echo on into the future, even if he doesn’t personally live to see how.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Also, I guess the rebels are going to have to kill a lot of giant lizard pig aliens things? Maybe that’s a whole episode. Andor and the gang hunting hogs.</p><p>(Also, pushes up glasses, it’s not a planet. It’s a jungle moon. Come on)</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Hahaha my bad! I always appreciate the depth of your <em>Star Wars</em> wisdom.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> Deep cut to the main plot point of <em>Return of the Jedi.</em></p><p>How are we felling about the three-episode drop structure? It sort of extends the arc of them a bit, and makes for weaker individual episodes, but a possibly more nuanced and impactful 150 minutes? I’m not fully sold on it but I might also be too caught up in the high highs of season 1 which really didn’t kick in until mid way through.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> I think it makes sense. Those first three episodes really felt like they had their own self-contained arc for me, and I expect the remaining three-episode drops will as well.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I think it worked for me too. It basically is like a new <em>Star Wars</em> movie every week.</p><p>I also think it helps avoid a problem <em>Andor </em>had with some people in Season 1. That the show was too slow or took too long to get to big moments. Personally, I didn’t love the slower pace of the first two episodes of <em>Andor </em>season 1 but the third episode sold me on the show. So I think dropping them like this helps.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> It’s also the sort of thing that may make more sense in retrospect, as the arcs of each three-episode cluster become clearer, with each group being set in a different year, if I remember right, as they count down to uhh...help me out here Zack, BBY 0, is that right?</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Technically we are building to BBY1 as BBY0 is <em>A New Hope. </em>It’s weird. (And gets weirder when you realize that OBBY and 1ABY are sort of the same time period but not. Don’t think about this stuff.) </p><p>I’m glad you brought that up though, because I think this is the first time we’ve ever seen BBY show up in a show or movie. I wonder how many people were like “What?”</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> I know! I was surprised to see them put something mostly only known to the die-hards up there.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>“3 Years Before Andor, the main character of this show, fucking dies” was Gilroy’s first choice, I’m told.</p><p><strong>EG: </strong>Can they get Gilroy to remake <em>Rogue One?</em></p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>We can’t wrap this up without talking about Syril and Meero!</p><p><strong>EG: </strong>Oh right, that whole thing happened.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I saw some people online suggesting they aren’t a couple, which seems wild to me. It’s very clear those two are having some really aggressive and yet bland sex.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> He lives with her right?</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I think that’s what the show was implying, yeah.</p><figure id="" data-id="008a589bc2649a90ef188a05d7d7b658" data-recommend-id="image://008a589bc2649a90ef188a05d7d7b658" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucasfilm / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="008a589bc2649a90ef188a05d7d7b658" data-recommend-id="image://008a589bc2649a90ef188a05d7d7b658" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>CP: </strong>Right, what do we think is going on there? Him saying “We could...pretend you’re not back” kind of threw me off. Clearly the dynamics of their relationship are...odd, but I suspect they are together in some sense.</p><p><strong>EG: </strong>I’m curious to see where that whole thing goes. I care zero about his character, so I hope he is used more as a foil to bring interesting things out of her or force some unexpected developments.</p><p>“We could...pretend you’re not back” is what JD Vance’s couch used to say to him.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>I think Syril is fascinating <em>because</em> he’s so loathsome. Just a gross nepo loser who thinks he’s doing great and meaningful things while looking at spreadsheets. Truly a villain for the DOGE era.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I think they are going to flip. He’ll learn about Ghorman and see it as a great thing. She seems hesitant. She might even flip on the Empire and him. Also, that moment where she smiles freaked me out.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> My favorite scene with her is after the meeting when she’s walking back on Coruscant with her boss and they show a clear split between the bureaucracy of the Empire and its autocrats.</p><p>Competent careerists who have to balance the ideology of the project and whims of their superiors with actually getting the results. Imagine if we come out of this whole thing with an attempted coup because it’s clear the Death Star is a really dumb idea.</p><p>“Push oppressed populaces to the brink to build giant weapon in space” is a reoccurring Icarus moment for fascists in the Star Wars universe.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I’d love to see a storyline like that. It’s something the movies/shows haven’t really touched on. That the Empire was once the Republic and not all of those people are suddenly on board with worshiping a melted monster man wizard god and his creepy black-suited super soldier dude.</p><p>The comics have touched on how the Empire’s various bureaucrats and soldiers don’t really get Darth Vader. Maybe Vader even shows up in the show at some point. He would be the one the Emperor would send to quash a coup.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>I’ve been wondering if that would happen. </p><p>I feel like that could go one of two ways. It could be awesome because yes, he’s such a powerful figure, he looms so large in the <em>Star Wars</em> mythos and tactically it would make sense, as you say. At the same time, part of what’s made <em>Andor </em>so great is that it largely avoids the kind of recurring major players from other <em>Star Wars</em> stories. Still, if Gilroy and co. decided to go that way, I’ll be curious to see how they handle it!</p><p>Before we wrap it up, just one last thing: I want to shout out a very good piece by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/opinion/andor-star-wars-leftist-radical.html?unlocked_article_code=1.CU8.UxZJ.tDX6BOOe9MXt&amp;smid=url-share&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/opinion/andor-star-wars-leftist-radical.html?unlocked_article_code=1.CU8.UxZJ.tDX6BOOe9MXt&amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Aftermath’s </em>Gita Jackson that ran in <em>The New York Times</em> a few days ago</a></span>.</p><p> They make the important point that simply watching a show like Andor is not, in and of itself, activism or resistance, an important thing to remember in an era when many people do seem to view “consuming” the right media as some kind of meaningful act. <em>Andor</em> is ultimately still itself the product of a massive corporate empire. But I do think we can totally recognize that fact while also letting ourselves feel stirred and inspired by the craft and artistry of what Gilroy and all of his collaborators on this project are doing. </p><p>I think about how in season one, for instance, Cassian was incarcerated, sentenced for several years (actually it probably would have been forever) for no reason at all, sent to a brutal prison colony that offered, ultimately, just one way out. I think if even a few young people are struck by parallels like those, feel something stirring inside them, and learn to know an evil empire when they see one, well, that would be pretty damn cool.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong><em>Andor</em> fans, welcome to the resistance.</p><p>But yes, I’m so happy this show is back for so many reasons. It’s very good. It makes me feel things. It comes at a perfect time. And I get to talk to people I know about <em>Star Wars</em> for a few weeks without them going, “Bleh, <em>Star Wars</em> is so bad/boring/whatever now.” That’s nice. So yeah, I think I speak for all of us when I say it’s awesome that <em>Andor </em>is back.  </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/the-talos-principle-reawakened-in-the-beginning-sequence-break-puzzle-guide/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> added more than just an Unreal Engine 5 coat of paint to Croteam's classic puzzle game, The Talos Principle. It added a new suite of puzzles with the new In the Beginning expansion, which was made in collaboration with select members of the game's community.</p>
<p>16 out of the 18 puzzles included in the expansion are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858?l=english">community-made</a>, and they also happen to be some of the most challenging puzzles within the entire Talos Principle series.</p>
<p>This guide will show you how to solve the puzzle Sequence Break. Before I go into the solution, if all you want is a hint, stop here before scrolling further.</p>
<p>The hint I'll give is that the puzzle's title already suggests its solution, but think of it as a 'recording break' instead of a 'sequence break.'</p>
<p>That's about as much of a hint I can give without giving away the whole solution, but if that's what you were looking for, then follow these steps below.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Sequence Break Puzzle Guide</h2>
<p>When you enter the puzzle area for Sequence Break, you'll see a recorder to your left and the tetromino you're trying to reach behind a couple of laser walls to your right. The puzzle is mostly solved with elements on the left side of the room, right up until the final steps, where you'll head over to the right side to grab the tetromino once you've solved the puzzle.</p>
<h3>Phase One</h3>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Nothing happens without the recorder, so start the recording and walk over to the connector standing on a pressure switch on your right. Pick up the connector and connect it to the red laser generator around the corner. Once it's set, create a pause point.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Leaving the connector where it is, walk over to the pressure switch it was initially on and stand on top of it. Create another pause point here. Once both pause points are set, grab the connector and place it back on the pressure switch so you can exit the area and stop the recording.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When the recording plays, quickly grab the connector and stand at the end of the laneway across from where your recorded self will place the recorded connector. Use the connector to connect to the red laser and red node to your right, along with the recorded connector, and the red node on the opposite side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Play the recording until your recorded self is standing on the pressure switch, and walk back into the center puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>


<ul>
<li>Then, continue the recording. Once your recorded self is off the pressure switch, instead of letting the recording play out, hit 'Stop' on the recorder. You should be left with the connector sending the red laser across the puzzle area to the node that will unlock the shield blocking the way to the tetromino, which is currently blocked by the shield that is deactivated with the pressure switch that sits in front of it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase Two</h3>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Make a new recording. Walk over to the pressure switch on the right side of the puzzle area and stand on it to deactivate the shield. Create a pause point.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Stop the recording, and let it play up to the pause point. Once it's there, your recorded self will have deactivated the shield, allowing the red laser to hit the node that will deactivate the shield to the tetromino.</li>
<li>Walk over to the tetromino to complete the puzzle.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's how you solve the Sequence Break puzzle in the new In the Beginning expansion in The Talos Principle: Reawakened. Like many of these puzzles, it's a clever trick that unlocks everything. In the case of Sequence Break, that trick is stopping the recording and not letting the entire thing play out, so you can have the red laser hitting the node across the puzzle room to the one that will unlock the path to the tetromino.</p>

If only a handful of people are talking about that, though, and it’s not having a tremendous impact on sales, what’s the point? On the latest Aftermath Hours, we discuss why covering and participating in these things still matters.</p><p>This week we’re joined by freelance writer Autumn Wright, author of a very good piece that ran on this very site titled <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Games Media Can’t Ignore BDS Xbox Boycott</a>, to discuss how that’s playing out in practice during the week of both <a href="https://aftermath.site/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-bethesda-microsoft-bds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a surprise-ish <em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remaster</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/ice-water-games-tenderfoot-tactics-xbox-store-removed-bds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an indie dev removing his game from Xbox in solidarity with BDS</a>. How should the press approach coverage of a big Microsoft release in the shadow of genocide? Which coverage is actually necessary versus which serves as glorified marketing? And what can a targeted boycott achieve when taking on a globally entrenched behemoth like Microsoft?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we briefly touch on Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders, which went live this week and led to no end of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/563352/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-japan-warning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unexpected</a> (and, let’s be real, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/564231/preorder-chaos-success-failure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected</a>) hassles. Finally, the mailbag forces us to reckon with the follies of our youth.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can someday put on a live show with a line outside comparable to that of one (1) GameStop location on Switch 2 preorder day.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>With <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, I think there was more acknowledgement [among the press] of its place within this sphere of potentially funding harm [than with the BDS Microsoft boycott], but then you look at the wider conversation around that game, and it was the press saying, “Hey, I don’t know if buying this is such a good idea,” the anti-wokes turning opposition to that idea into a giant crusade, and then the game selling, like, 13 million copies.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of people who would have cared in either direction didn’t hear about any of this, so it was all not a wash necessarily – there was an impact – but what does that say about the press’ role in all of this? Because you also have people in chat right now saying that their friends don’t read articles; they watch a stream or a video. So much of the conversation around games is happening over there – most of it, even. With that in mind, how important is our role in all of this? How much does our work really impact anything?</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> With [Rowling <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jk-rowling-uk-trans-women-ruling-rcna201947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helping fund the war against trans people in the UK</a>] and the <em>Harry Potter</em> TV show, I’ve seen people be upset about all of that, but I haven’t read writeups of it. I don’t know if TV coverage is having the same [sort of moment games publications did around <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>]. JK Rowling funded something super bad, and it seems like such a clear line, whereas you could argue, if you felt so called, that the line from <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> to JK Rowling’s hatefulness is less direct. I don’t think you’d be correct. But in this case, it’s like, come on. We just had this thing. I haven’t seen a ton of TV writing about it, but I guess [the show] doesn’t exist yet.</p><p><strong>Autumn:</strong> I think that’s also gonna change very quickly now, with the news out of the UK last week. I see somebody in chat getting into the weeds of <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, of the fact that there was no organized call to boycott, that it was a different kind of boycott. But again, [considering] the broader thing about orienting how we live to get to a world where people don’t live under someone else’s boot, why do you want to engage with<em> Hogwarts Legacy</em>? Have you noticed the amount of antisemitism and classism in there? I don’t mean that to talk down to you, but think about: Why do you have to play that game, specifically?</p><p>And if you really do start to dig into it, you will start to see that it is itself creating a world where trans people don’t exist, where people do live under boots, but they’re called house elves, so it’s fine – whatever. So let’s really think about how we’re getting to that. Art does influence the world, and it does tell us who gets to be human in fiction, which then shapes reality, and that shapes politics.&nbsp;</p><p>I was reading just this past week <em>The Message</em> by Ta-Nehisi Coates, a fantastic book about what writing and art can do. I recommend it to every writer just to read – really illuminating the actual importance of what we can do. But then we were talking five minutes ago about how writing and art can do all this stuff, but if no one reads it, what’s the point? At that point, I don’t know.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>My kind of solace is that all of these things can serve as building blocks over time – that if even a handful of people read my things [about the <em>Oblivion </em>remaster or an indie dev removing his game from the Xbox store], that could filter up to other people who maybe don’t internalize all of it, but they carry some seed of it forward, which ends up somewhere else, and over time you have this groundswell of thought or opinion that wouldn’t have existed otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p>I think we’ve actually seen that with <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, in a way. I think there is more open opposition now to JK Rowling than there was even a couple years ago when people were upset about <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>. The latter almost certainly had a direct impact on the former. So there are some things that you’ve just gotta keep chipping away at, even if your pick is incredibly tiny. You do it because if you’re not doing it, you’re doing nothing, and then nothing happens.</p><p><strong>Autumn: </strong>You are creating the world you want to live in with very small actions, and that does build out. It makes me think of how, when we talk about the manosphere, people are like “Guys, you’ve gotta tell your friends that the thing they just said is really weird when they say it.” We’re doing that in small ways, by saying it’s weird that you are really invested in this [game] over the material harm that it’s [complicit in]. We should live in a world where we see oppression, and we react to it. We don’t just live with it, and we do take injustice anywhere as a threat to justice everywhere.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-gennojo-ally"><h3>Gennojo Fuckin’ Sucks, Man</h3></a><p>No, you cannot join my club, you creep</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ice-water-games-tenderfoot-tactics-xbox-store-removed-bds"><h3>Indie Dev Who Pulled Game From Xbox In Solidarity With Palestinian-Led BDS Hopes Others Will Do The Same</h3></a><p>"It's important to be able to use that limited amount of power to put whatever pressure we can on things"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-real-ending"><h3>Does Blue Prince Never End?</h3></a><p>There is so much more to Blue Prince than the stated goal.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ttrpg-books-might-be-exempt-from-us-trade-tariffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There may be an exception for tabletop games being affected by the imposed US trade tariffs. These tariffs, which have already caused several board game companies to shutter, may not affect TTRPG books. However, there are some catches.</p>

<h2>TTRPG Books Potentially Exempt From Tariffs</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, the Trump administration's 145% trade tariffs on imported Chinese goods have severely impacted the entire tabletop game industry. The vast majority of board game production happens overseas in China then is imported back for delivery. But with import costs now more than double, companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Than Games</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CMON</a> have paused board game production completely.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sentinels-of-the-multiverse-comic-artwork.jpg?itok=7KNg8Im4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sentinels-of-the-multiverse-comic-artwork.jpg?itok=0m-k60lo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This has lead to a question in the tabletop community: do TTRPG books count? This is a curious question since books are usually exempt from import costs due in part to how they are manufactured and their classification as cultural objects or means of technical information. In fact, printed books are on a limited list of products exempt from President Trump's trade tariffs via the executive order <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Annex-II.pdf" rel="nofollow">Annex II</a>.</p>

<p>This seems straightforward. Printed books are exempt from tariffs. TTRPG books are printed books, therefore, they are exempt. According to US Customs however, it is more complicated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a ruling <a href="https://rulings.cbp.gov/ruling/085214" rel="nofollow">from 1989</a>, TTRPGs, referred to as "Fantasy Role Play Books" are not classified as printed books. The ruling states that the books are "designed to enhance fantasy game play, not for passive reading." This means the books are classified not as books but as "arcade, table, or parlor games... parts and accessories thereof," the same classification given to tabletop games.</p>

<p>This ruling is contradicted by more recent findings from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/563608/rpg-books-tariff-exclusions-shadowrun" rel="nofollow">Polygon's</a> own Nicole Carpenter. According to a 2024 Customs and Border Protection ruling, the <em>Shadowrun 6th Edition</em> Rulebook was classified as a printed hardbound book. This ruling applied, "only to the specific factual situation and merchandise description as identified in the ruling request."</p>

<p>Presuming this ruling isn't amended or overruled, that means TTRPG books may be exempt from the trade tariffs if they are imported and sold separately. No dice. No miniatures. No maps. No accessories included alongside the book.</p>

<p>What does this mean for the future of TTRPGs? Considering the ever-changing volatile landscape caused by the current administration, it is difficult to be certain. But, it may mean the cost of starter sets or TTRPG bundles may go up due to this quirk of US Customs.</p>

            <p>
GOG has announced a fresh wave of additions to its Preservation Program, including Capcom's classic RPG Breath of Fire 4, which returns to PC after an absence of over 20 years.
</p>
<p>
Breath of Fire 4, if you're currently drawing a blank, follows the adventures of a young man named Ryu (who usefully has the power to transform into dragons) as he attempts to stop an immortal emperor from destroying the world. The game is celebrating its quarter-century anniversary this year - having originally launched for PlayStation in Japan and the US back in 2000 - and GOG is marking the occasion by bringing it to PC for the first time since 2003.
</p>
<p>
GOG's Preservation Program is intended to provide "the best [versions of classic games] you can buy on any PC platform", and each features a range of enhancements intended to "guarantee convenience and compatibility with modern systems". In Breath of Fire 4's case, GOG is promising Windows 10 and 11 compatibility, "improved graphics powered by an upgraded DirectX renderer", as well as new display options including anti-aliasing, V-sync, windowed mode, and "refined" gamma correction.

<p>
Missing environmental sounds are also said to have been restored and new configuration options have been added as part of an audio engine upgrade, and players can choose between either English or Japanese localisations. And if that sounds like something you might be interested in, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv">Breath of Fire 4 is available to purchase on GOG right now</a> for £8.99.
</p>
<p>
And it doesn't stop there. GOG has released a further nine titles as part of its Preservation Program, including Gremlin Interactive's stupendously weird 1996 haunted house mystery adventure <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/realms_of_the_haunting">Realms of the Haunting</a> - a sort of first-person shooter/point-and-click/FMV adventure hybrid, which pretty much consumed me back in the day. It's now gained the likes of cloud support, custom key mapping, and the ability to play either the US or UK version.
</p>
<p>
Breath of Fire 4 and Realms of the Haunting arrive alongside upgrades for <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/ultima_underworld_1_2">Ultima Underworld 1+2</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/ultima_9_ascension">Ultima 9: Ascension</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/worlds_of_ultima_the_savage_empire">Worlds of Ultima : The Savage Empire</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/ultima_worlds_of_adventure_2_martian_dreams">Ultima Worlds of Adventure 2: Martian Dreams</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/worms_armageddon">Worms: Armageddon</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/robin_hood">Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stonekeep">Stonekeep</a>, and cult classic point-and-click FMV adventure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Tex%20Murphy:%20Under%20a%20Killing%20Moon">Tex Murphy: Under a Killing Moon</a>.
</p>
<p>
GOG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-announces-preservation-program-aims-to-maintain-game-compatibility-with-modern-and-future-systems">announced its Preservation Program last November</a>, when 100 games were part of the line-up. That list has continued to expand since then with a regular influx of new additions - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fear-platinum-joins-gog-preservation-program-to-properly-recognise-monoliths-contributions-to-gaming">Monolith Production's much-loved horror shooter FEAR</a>, which was added to "honour [the studio's] legacy" in February, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Monolith's shock closure</a>.

But the Switch 2's absence from Amazon was an expected continuation of a story that has been unfolding over the past year. Amazon simply doesn't carry first-party Nintendo products these days, which means you'll only find third-party games and accessories for the upcoming console on Amazon's storefront.</p><h3>No Switch 2 preorders at Amazon?

Walmart's online storefront experienced the same shift--though brick-and-mortar stores still stocked Nintendo games on launch day. Later in the year, Walmart started selling Nintendo exclusives online in the days leading up to a game's launch. Everything with Walmart and Nintendo returned to normal this year, which is why the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=You+Won%27t+Find+Switch+2+Consoles+On+Amazon%2C+But+You+Can+Get+Games+%26+Gear&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-04-25+13%3A32%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-25+13%3A33%3A02&amp;fnarticle_id=6531143&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fswitch-2-hardware-and-software%2Fc2hlbGZfaWQ6NzQzMzY4OAieie%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fyou-wont-find-switch-2-consoles-on-amazon-but-you-can-get-games-gear%2F1100-6531143%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 2 and all of its Nintendo-made games and accessories are available at Walmart</a>.</p><h3>Why did Amazon stop carrying first-party Nintendo products?</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4483133-newamazonimg3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483133" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4483133-newamazonimg3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483133"></a><figcaption>Sorry, Mario, you can't preorder the Switch 2 at Amazon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4483133-newamazonimg3.jpg"></figure><p>The short answer is: No one knows for sure, but Amazon almost certainly <em>wants </em>to sell Nintendo products. Neither Nintendo nor Amazon has offered a reason for the dissolution of their retail partnership, but we have a theory based on the fact that Amazon and Walmart were the only retailers impacted by Nintendo stock woes last year. Both retailers have a history of offering discounts on Nintendo games and accessories outside of official Nintendo sales. As in, Switch games were often discounted for long stretches of time, to the point that getting a $10 discount on a first-party game felt like the norm. Ever since Walmart's Nintendo situation reversed course, most of the first-party game deals we see there are sold by third parties.</p><p>Today, you can find the aforementioned 2024 Nintendo games on Amazon, but they are third-party listings that pop up at launch. You'll also find a wide selection of region-free Nintendo games on Woot, an Amazon-owned discount shop. Woot has made a habit of listing Nintendo's games on launch day with $10 discounts. This practice didn't start until after Amazon stopped selling Nintendo games, so read into that as you see fit. And we'll have to wait and see if the trend continues when the Switch 2 launches on June 5.</p><h3>Amazon will still carry licensed Nintendo products</h3><p>The only Nintendo products you can't find on Amazon--shipped and sold by the retailer--are consoles, games, and accessories published by Nintendo. Beyond the Switch 2 console and Mario Kart World console bundle, this includes accessories like the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=You+Won%27t+Find+Switch+2+Consoles+On+Amazon%2C+But+You+Can+Get+Games+%26+Gear&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-04-25+13%3A32%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-25+13%3A33%3A02&amp;fnarticle_id=6531143&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-2-Pro-Controller%2F15955005005%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fyou-wont-find-switch-2-consoles-on-amazon-but-you-can-get-games-gear%2F1100-6531143%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Pro Controller</a>, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=You+Won%27t+Find+Switch+2+Consoles+On+Amazon%2C+But+You+Can+Get+Games+%26+Gear&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-04-25+13%3A32%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-25+13%3A33%3A02&amp;fnarticle_id=6531143&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FJoy-Con-2-L-R-Light-Blue-Light-Red%2F15898519412%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fyou-wont-find-switch-2-consoles-on-amazon-but-you-can-get-games-gear%2F1100-6531143%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Joy-Con 2</a>, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=You+Won%27t+Find+Switch+2+Consoles+On+Amazon%2C+But+You+Can+Get+Games+%26+Gear&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-04-25+13%3A32%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-25+13%3A33%3A02&amp;fnarticle_id=6531143&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-2-Camera%2F15940906362%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fyou-wont-find-switch-2-consoles-on-amazon-but-you-can-get-games-gear%2F1100-6531143%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official carrying cases</a>, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=You+Won%27t+Find+Switch+2+Consoles+On+Amazon%2C+But+You+Can+Get+Games+%26+Gear&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-04-25+13%3A32%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-25+13%3A33%3A02&amp;fnarticle_id=6531143&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-2-Camera%2F15940906362%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fyou-wont-find-switch-2-consoles-on-amazon-but-you-can-get-games-gear%2F1100-6531143%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 2 Camera</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-amiibo-are-even-more-expensive-than-expected/1100-6530590/" data-ref-id="1100-6530590">Amiibo</a>.</p><p>You will continue to see listings pop up for Switch 2-exclusive products, but only items published by other companies.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656405/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-xbox-ps5-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>On paper, <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> doesn’t seem to stand out amidst a recent wave of prestige RPGs, from the newly polished high fantasy of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/654770/oblivion-remaster-hands-on-xbox-gamepass-bethesda"><em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remake</a> to the medieval warfare of 15th century Bohemia in <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. </em>For one, its fantastical conquests are set in a world reminiscent of France’s Belle Époque period, an era known for its economic prosperity and radical artistic movements, from Art Nouveau to Expressionism. Add a tinge of melodrama and an emotional backstory, and its setting resembles a medley of games that take place in vaguely European worlds like <em>Greedfall</em>, <em>Bloodborne,</em> and <em>Dishonored</em>. At the same time, <em>Expedition 33</em> boasts a turn-based combat system inspired by Japanese RPGs like <em>Final Fantasy</em> and <em>Dragon Ques</em>t.</p><p>All this is to say that <em>Expedition 33</em> risks appearing banal and cliche. Fending off impossible odds in a world, where everyone wants to swing their very imposing weapons at your head amidst medieval ruins, isn’t all that unique these days. But <em>Expedition 33</em> isn’t cowered by the lineage of RPGs that came before. Instead, it displays a sense of quiet confidence, understanding that the keys of the genre — narrative and combat — need to be distinct enough to weave a poignant tale.</p><p>This is embodied in the prologue, which takes its time to unfold the game’s emotional stakes. At the start you’re introduced to the scraggly-but-charismatic Gustav, who’s nervous about his meeting with ex-partner Sophie. Apart from going through the basics of combat, Gustav spends the first half of the chapter on a leisurely stroll with her along the town’s boulevard, as they make their way toward the harbor. It’s then that the game’s conceit is revealed: the Paintress, a malignant, immortal being of sorts, wakes up once a year to paint a number on a massive monolith, culling the town’s dwindling population. When this happens, everyone of that particular age simply dissipates into petals. It’s a moment that could easily tip into mawkishness, but a palpable feeling of melancholia sets in. A lump in your throat lingers.</p><p>This scene sets the tone for the rest of <em>Expedition 33</em>. You guide a group of doomed Expeditioners like Gustav, who are embarking on a last-ditch attempt to stop the Paintress. It would’ve been easy for <em>Expedition 33</em> to plunge into an never-ending cycle of abject hopelessness, but there’s a genuine sense of wonder in traveling beyond the small town of Lumiere, and toward the vast expanse of its larger, phantasmagoric world.</p><p>One landscape has towering pink corals and shimmering sea flora, swaying like underwater tendrils, with bubbling streams rising from the ground. Another showcases the remnants of Art Nouveau architecture, with dilapidated buildings rife with elegant curves and floral patterns, as well as marble faces carved onto their surfaces. It’s as if these lands, once rich with history and biodiversity, have long been wrecked by a cataclysmic war. Despite the looming threat of certain death, even the Expeditioners were awed by the painterly allure of their surroundings, almost thrilled to be on such a lustrous journey. </p><p>Equally — and unexpectedly — resplendent is the game’s combat. Encounters typically begin with the crew striking some monstrous titans with an initial, vibrant blow (or, in unlucky instances, with enemies walking into them), and being transported to a grandiose arena. These scenes are beautiful tableaus, with every attack depicted with the finesse and flourish of stylish sword fights.</p><p><em>Expedition 33</em>’s turn-based combat appears deceptively straightforward. You can issue commands to each Expeditioner every turn, who have their own impressive set of moves. The backbone of Gustav’s attacks, for instance, is his prosthetic arm, which allows him to charge up his assaults and subsequently land a powerful finisher. Whereas another Expeditioner, Lune, embodies the mage archetype with several elemental spells at her disposal.</p><p>Adding a wrinkle to this turn-based formula is that enemy attacks can be dodged and parried. When timed right, this allows you to collect more action points for pulling off a string of attacks, or launching a countermove. Performing twitchy maneuvers like these are incredibly satisfying. A perfectly timed parry can easily turn the tide of combat, letting you deal a massive amount of damage. That’s not to say that battles are easy; executing these moves, at the right time, is contingent on your understanding of enemy movements, some of whom are prone to feigning their attacks. Most enemies even present their own twists to combat, which makes every tussle substantial.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Sandfall Interactive</cite></p></div><p>Adding some tactical diversity to combat are Pictos, which are items the Expeditioners can equip to buff their attacks. This is, by far, one of the smartest tricks <em>Expedition 33</em> has up its sleeve. There are plenty of these to collect across the map, so you can further customize each Expeditioner to a specific, preferred build. Gustav’s Overcharge, for instance, requires him to land a flurry of melee assaults to charge up the skill, so I prefer to equip him with Pictos that increase the potency of his attacks.</p><p>This is how <em>Expedition 33</em> lets you subtly refine the cadence of battles. And then there’s the joy of the grind; if an enemy proves to be too overwhelming, you can always plow through ramshackle bands of mechanical titans for experience points. That’s because the ritual of grinding in <em>Expedition 33</em> is deeply cerebral, rather than mindlessly tedious, with every encounter a sizable, yet surmountable challenge. Plus, swinging enormous swords and scythes at the heads of Expedition 33’s monstrous giants — accompanied by a rousing, atmospheric soundtrack — lets your attacks land with a really meaty thump. Fighting is a grand, stupendous affair.</p><p>There’s much more to say about the sheer extravagance of <em>Expedition 33</em>. Its characters carry shades of complexity and compassion that surface in their conversations. Its music swells and swirls with orchestral lavishness, punctuating every interaction with a note of majesty or calamity. Its tale is heart-wrenching, stirring, and humorous in equal measure. Some parts of <em>Expedition 33 </em>can be a tad superfluous — like the need to put a numerical value in the Expeditioners’ relationships, and certain dialog choices that make little sense — but these do little to mar its experience.</p><p><em>Expedition 33</em> is built upon the conventional anchors of its genre. But its grandiose tale, bolstered by a downright robust combat system, turns it into something much more than just a scrappy underdog.</p><p><sub>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33<em> is available now on Xbox, PS5, and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-is-teasing-something-nier-related-again-in-a-cryptic-website-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Re-reincarnation.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you enjoyed NieR: Automata and its predecessor, NieR: Replicant, you could be forgiven for not knowing that game actually got a sequel, and a pretty good one too. Unfortunately, that sequel, mobile game NieR: Re[in]carnation, hasn't been available for almost a year after being taken offline in April of 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But fortunately, a Square Enix website is dropping some pretty wild in-universe hints that this might be about to change.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As pointed out to us on BlueSky by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewillarowe.bsky.social/post/3lnnoessmzk2k" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">journalist Willa Rowe</a>, an official NieR website that's currently publishing a NieR special movel to commemorate the series 15th anniversary is teasing something NieR: Re[in]carnation-related via cryptic in-text hints and webpage source code. As a part of today's update to the novel, the <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nier-anniversary/15th-novel/e58f8b/space/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just-published chapter 4</a> ends with some strange text that reads as follows:</p><blockquote>[WARNING] : Recovery protocol initialized...[ERROR] : Redirecting to backup node: &lt; https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nierreincarnation/ &gt;[INFO] : Analysis comments added to the source code.<br>[FATAL] : Process forcibly halted.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">What does THAT mean? Who knows? But wait, there's more. If you hit "View Source" on that page, there are even more weird teases in the code comments, as hinted at above. They read, in order:</p><blockquote>SECURITY NOTICE: Unauthorized transmission detected. Signal disruption logged. Countermeasure protocol active. Redirecting to backup node: <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nierreincarnation/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nierreincarnation/</a></blockquote><blockquote>TODO: Optimize rendering efficiency. Contradictions in "Her" emotions may interfere with signal clarity. Ensure transission remains undistorted.</blockquote><blockquote>FIXME: Visibility settings enabled for crashed observer system. He is watching...Adjust access permissions before deployment. His name is............</blockquote><blockquote>HACK: Log discrepancy detected. Records indicate previous modification attempts due to excessive interference from The Cage. Cross-check against original transmission before proceeding.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, there's a lot here, some of which is inscrutable and some of which makes sense. "The Cage", for instance, is the main location where most of NieR: Re[in]carnation takes place. And "Her" is a key character (yes, that's Her name) in Re[in]carnation as well. Between that and the hyperlink, it's pretty obvious what all this is referencing, but what exactly will become of it remains anyone's guess.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two final chapters of the novel are scheduled to publish on May 2, a week from today, and it's possible it may also pull back the curtain on whatever's happening here. Fans are speculating that it may be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NieRReincarnation/comments/1k7l4ym/new_nier_15th_anniversary_web_novel_chapters_14/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leading up to some sort of port or re-release of NieR: Re[in]carnation</a>, which has been completely unplayable anywhere since it went offline last year. They're also pointing out that the chapters of the special novel, which are currently only available in Japanese (but which fans are translating), have some pretty significant tie-ins to all three other NieR games.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Screens  -  NieR Reincarnation</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're unfamiliar with Re[in]carnation, I highly recommend keeping an eye on this, especially if the end result is another opportunity to play it. Re[in]carnation is a good game in its own right that many slept on due to its being a mobile gacha game, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-3-has-been-in-front-of-us-all-along-per-series-creators-tease">critically, it's also the direct sequel to NieR: Automata</a>, and effectively is NieR 3, for those who have been waiting for it. Who knows? Maybe a new Re[in]carnation release could include some new content that ties the ongoing stream of loose NieR-related threads together at last.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

		<p><em>Few things underscore the differences between Rob and Patrick more than their approach to playing new video games, which is to say that Patrick is often spending his time with The Next Thing, while Rob continues to mine the past.</em></p><p><em>That split is part of what makes Remap what it is, though!</em></p><p><em>Plus, who doesn't want an excuse to talk about BioForge? Who isn't excited to potentially have Rob and Cado playing Myth II: Soulblighter co-op on stream? It's our Remember Some Games era and it's great.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob: </strong>So we talked about this on the podcast, but I’ve spent a decent chunk of this week playing <em>Myth: The Fallen Lords </em>and <em>Myth 2: Soulblighter</em>. They just had some amazing updates drop from the Project Magma team, who have basically been working to keep the <em>Myth </em>series playable for the last fifteen years. The new update is called the <em>Twice Born Edition </em>and it’s as close to a remaster as the game is likely to get.</p><p><em>Myth </em>is one of my all-time favorite games. There are countless games that channel or outright copy from Tolkien, but <em>Myth </em>is one of the few that I think fully understands how the Lord of the Rings experience should be translated into a game. Mission briefings are given via bleak, well-written journal entries that evoke the idea that the game itself is a found text, like the history the Fellowship finds in the depths of Moria. Unit descriptions are pieces of larger, unseen texts (a technique that would resurface with <em>Destiny’s </em>Grimoire), and that narrative device suggests a world of cultures, languages, and histories both known and lost to time.</p><p>The narrative points to epic battles happening off-screen but the game is not aiming to be a fantasy <em>Total War</em>. Rather it plays out like a miniatures game, one where each warrior must be painstakingly positioned and maneuvered to get the most out of them in battle. You’re usually with a special forces team or a beleaguered rearguard or a clever diversionary raiding party, in situations where you still feel like you’re part of a military fantasy epic, but the scale is a little more personal, and little more ground-level.</p><p>Which means you have ample opportunities to witness the chaos caused by the game’s physics model. Stray arrows knock out friendly troops, grenades take miraculous or cursed bounces or turn out to be duds. Flying bits of debris (usually bone and meat, being honest) will smack into other units and cause damage, or perhaps knock a spear off-course. It’s a game that feels gleefully at odds with a lot of notions of game balance: the same encounter in <em>Myth </em>might go horrifically wrong despite your best efforts or you might make a horrible mistake that somehow breaks in your favor and hands you a wholly unearned victory. But because this is all depicted on screen and driven by some simple physics and overpowered explosives, <em>Myth </em>usually feels funny and surprising rather than a game where you can get screwed by a bad dice roll.</p><p>This game also served as my introduction to Bungie, and I was kind of surprised when the next I heard of them was when they were in the early stages of promoting <em>Halo </em>before it was picked up by Microsoft. I didn’t know about their history as a shoot developer for Macs, and so I was kind of disappointed when the studio that made this fantasy tactics masterpiece became Halo Incorporated. At the time I thought <em>Halo </em>was the outlier, now I understand that if anything, the two <em>Myth </em>games are a wildly successful experiment from a shooter studio.</p><p>Playing it this week got me wondering, are there studios you’ve been a fan of that have a game or a series that fascinates you <em>because </em>it doesn’t seem to fit what they are known for?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Back when they made real box art, folks.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/giantbomb/comments/53we99/backflips_n_bioforge/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>“Did that say mecha raptor?”</u></a></p><p>Yeah, this one is easy. It’s Origin Systems making <em>BioForge</em>. I first fell for Origin Systems because of the <em>Wing Commander</em> series. More specifically, <em>Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger</em>. The more CDs a game shipped with, the better, imo. Remember <a href="https://www.indieretronews.com/2020/03/wing-commander-iii-heart-of-tiger-1994.html?ref=remapradio.com"><u>that killer box art</u></a>? Absolutely irresistible. But this was an era where it wasn’t easy to look up the history of a studio, unless you came across it in, say, a <em>PC Gamer</em>.</p><p>In my mind, Origin made <em>Wing Commander</em> games, or at the very least, flight simulator games. It was 1994 and I was nine years old. I didn’t know what <em>Ultima</em> was. I didn’t know about <em>System Shock</em>, either.</p>

                <p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 developer Sandfall Interactive has announced that the game has already sold 500,000 copies, just after launch. In a social media post, the studio said the game reached this sales milestone "sooner than we'd ever imagined."</p><p>Expedition 33 is also on Game Pass, and presumably the 500,000 figure does not include people playing via the subscription service. Expedition 33 is the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/US" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 2 best-selling game on Steam right now</a>, only behind Oblivion Remastered, and it's reached <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 70,000 concurrent players.</a> The game is also on PS5.</p><p>Some industry observers theorized that Expedition 33 might have had its lunch eaten by Oblivion Remastered, as it surprise-launched just two days before Expedition 33.

                <p>Larian Studios created one of the most beloved and acclaimed RPGs in recent times with 2024's Baldur's Gate 3, and everyone wants to know what's coming next from the studio.</p><p>It's too soon for that, however, as Larian isn't ready to pull back the curtain on its next project, codenamed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/" data-ref-id="1100-6528758">Excalibur</a>. While we wait, though, Vincke is sharing his thoughts on a wide variety of industry topics.</p><p>Speaking to GameSpot's Tamoor Hussain, Vincke discussed at a high level what's next for Larian and dug into hot-button issues like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">his stance on AI/machine learning</a>. Vincke also talked about managing risk as Larian grows in size, weighed in with his take on if single-player games are dead or not, and discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-director-says-making-dlc-for-its-games-is-boring-for-larian/1100-6531125/" data-ref-id="1100-6531125">why Larian didn't release DLC for Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p><p>These are just a few of the topics that Vincke discussed in our hour-long chat with the industry veteran--be sure to watch the full video to learn more.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9P2HPF9ss" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gy9P2HPF9ss" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>We don't know what Larian is making next, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/" data-ref-id="1100-6522049">won't be Baldur's Gate 4.</a> Beyond Larian's immediate next game, Vincke is thinking even further out and has grand plans to create a "very big RPG" that will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-is-working-toward-an-rpg-that-dwarfs-it/1100-6522051/" data-ref-id="1100-6522051">"dwarf"</a> any of Larian's previous releases. "It's an inspirational goal. That's it. I cannot say more, because it needs to stay in that dream-reality," he said.</p><p>While Larian will not make Baldur's Gate 4, Hasbro has said it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-hopes-next-baldurs-gate-game-is-here-before-2050/1100-6522712/" data-ref-id="1100-6522712">keen to expand the Baldur's Gate series with other teams. </a>"We're going to take our time and find the right partner, the right approach, and the right product," Hasbro said to fans looking for another entry.</p>
