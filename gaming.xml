<p>Previously, fans would have had to visit the eShop in either Japan or Hong Kong, but with a dedicated Taiwanese storefront, they'll have a much easier option.</p>
<p>In the announcement (translated by Google), Nintendo stated that fans will be able to "enjoy a more convenient and enriched gaming experience" and that "specific service content will be announced separately in the near future".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qwsxhk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It's yet another step in Nintendo's expansion into the Taiwanese market. The Big N opened up a new subsidiary, Nintendo of Taiwan, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/nintendo-sets-up-new-subsidiary-in-taiwan">in February 2025</a>, and the company has been running operations since 1st April this year.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Nintendo even <a href="https://www.facebook.com/justdan.taiwan/posts/pfbid033YL9t1A1e6gsMwS6wRSDRVhH8MAtdUMhpTpe2HphWwsZhUN5p36jBgXVYhf7gam4l">opened a Flagship Store</a> in the Xinyi district in Taipei in April, too. Given the company's rapid growth in Taiwan, and after its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/01/nintendo-celebrates-switch-in-style-with-packed-taipei-game-show-booth">line-up at the 2024 Taipei Game Show</a>, it seems like its presence will just keep expanding.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What has Sony learned from its biggest gaming blunder one year later? Why is Ubisoft’s CEO headed to court five years after a sexual harassment scandal rocked the company? And how many more copies will <em>Hollow Knight</em> sell as everyone rushes to play it ahead of <em>Silksong</em>‘s launch next month? Welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Take cover. The end-of-year game release onslaught is about to begin.</p> <h2>Sony is taking steps to avoid another<em> Concord</em></h2> <p>How did Sony slow-walk its way into a live service debacle that <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">cost it over $200 million</a>? A year after <em>Concord</em> launched, PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst explained what the company is doing to avoid releasing another expensive game that no one wants to play. &nbsp;“I don’t want teams to always play it safe, but I would like for us, when we fail, to fail early and cheaply,” he <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d5859ffc-c4d7-4480-98a6-c1cff07af299">told the <em>Financial Times</em></a>. He promised more info sharing between studios and executives and said, “We have since put in place much more rigorous and more frequent testing in very many different ways. The advantage of every failure is that people now understand how necessary that [testing] is.”</p> <p>What about Sony’s live-service plans moving forward? Hulst didn’t say the company is backing off its online multiplayer push, but he did hand-wave away prior commitments to launch nearly a dozen live-service projects by 2026. “The number is not so important,” he said. “What is important to me is having a diverse set of player experiences and a set of communities.”<em> FairGame$</em>, expected to be the next multiplayer game in Sony’s pipeline, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fairgame-ps5-heist-shooter-haven-jade-raymond-delay-1851780961">recently lost its studio head after a bad internal review</a>.</p>

 <h2>Ubisoft’s CEO has been summoned to appear in court</h2> <p>The French publisher <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/gaming/affaire-de-harcelement-chez-ubisoft-le-pdg-yves-guillemot-convoque-devant-la-justice_AN-202508220570.html">faces a fresh lawsuit</a> from the same victims who recently testified against former senior members of the company <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisofts-metoo-reckoning-two-months-later-1844717203">over sexual harassment allegations</a>, including ex-chief creative officer Serge Hascoët. “This new case is being brought by the same plaintiffs, a union and four people, and is based on the same facts at those for which three former employees were tried and convicted this past June, following an investigation by the public prosecutor’s office,” Ubisoft executive vice president Cécile Russeil wrote in an email to staff on August 22.</p> <p>CEO Yves Guillemot was subpoenaed to testify on October 1, though it’s unclear if the new litigation will be able to compel any new information to surface about the company’s workplace culture reckoning five years ago. “Ubisoft will continue to cooperate with the justice system in this matter, as it has done over the past five years in the review of the facts related to this case,” Russeil <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-yves-guillemot-summoned-to-appear-before-french-court-in-relation-to-harassment-trial/">told <em>VGC</em></a> in a statement. Guillemot’s son was <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-charlie-yves-guillemot-tencent-far-cry-7-1851786421">recently made co-CEO</a> of a new business group within Ubisoft that oversees its most profitable franchises, including<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> and<em> Far Cry</em>.</p> <h2><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> is getting free DLC</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Mirage players, we have a surprise coming your way later this year!</p> <p>📖 New story chapter &amp; missions set in 9th century AlUla<br>🎮 Gameplay improvements for the base game and the new location<br>🎁 All for free</p> <p>Stay tuned! <a href="https://t.co/8CjB3MRvfR">pic.twitter.com/8CjB3MRvfR</a></p> <p>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1959169826619875735?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The 2023 game has new content coming on the horizon. It takes place in AlUla, Saudi Arabia. The new story update will arrive before the end of 2025 and comes <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/letonnant-deal-dubisoft-avec-larabie-saoudite-2144626">after a report</a> that Ubisoft received funding from the Saudi government-backed Public Investment Fund, which has recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-scopely-niantic-saudi-arabia-monster-hunter-1851769360">been flooding the games industry with cash</a>.</p>

 <h2>Switch 2 games with only game key cards won’t be eligible for preservation in Japan’s National Diet Library</h2> <p>The archival body will only take “physical media that contains the content itself,” according to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202508/48598">a new report from <em>Famitsu</em></a>, <a href="http://only physical media that contains the content itself” is considered eligible for preservation. “Since a key card, on its own, does not qualify as content, it falls outside of our scope for collection and preservation.”">translated by <em>Automaton</em></a>. “Since a key card, on its own, does not qualify as content, it falls outside of our scope for collection and preservation,” a representative of the library said. While all first-party Nintendo games are contained on the physical Switch 2 carts, most third-party releases have opted for the game key card solution, meaning most will no longer be accessible if and when the servers eventually shut down sometime in the future.</p> <h2>Hideo Kojima wrote a concept for <em>Death Stranding 3</em> but doesn’t want to make it</h2> <p>The longtime director told <a href="https://t.co/69Pwg1OTCO">PlayStation Arabia</a> that<em> Death Stranding 2</em> was his finale for the series, but that he has already scripted what a sequel might be about. “So I have that in data,” he said, according to a translation <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1959427581536842060">by Genki</a>. “I hope that someone will create it for me.”</p>

 <h2><em>Peak</em> is finally Steam Deck verified</h2> <p>The summer Steam hit, which has already sold over 10 million copies, received <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">a new update</a> that fixes some bugs and gets the game working on Valve’s handheld. Unfortunately for speedrunners, however, a major game-breaking trick no longer works. “Made fog walls taller so you can’t shoot over them to win the game in a minute with the Scout Cannon exploit,” read the patch notes.</p> <h2><em>Hollow Knight</em> is skyrocketing up the Steam charts</h2> <p><em>Silksong</em> is out in less than two weeks, and everyone who never finished<em> Hollow Knight</em> is busy catching up. The game currently <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/367520#All">has over 35,000 concurrent players</a> on Steam, nearly double its April 2022 peak. Not bad for an eight-year-old game that’s already sold over 15 million copies. If the sequel sells another 15 million, it will officially be <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1959689523048378409">a bigger franchise than <em>Metroid</em></a>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/snake-eater-delta-remake-mgsv-5-comparison-vs-2000619209">How<em> Metal Gear Solid 3</em> remake plays compared to <em>Metal Gear Solid 5</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-horror-trailer-creepy-2000619530"><em>Pokémon</em>‘s new horror teasers are the perfect nightmare fuel</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bubsy-4d-new-sequel-gameplay-review-hands-on-preview-gamescom-2000619555">The new <em>Bubsy</em> game actually looks kinda rad?</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Silksong's 2019 vs 2025 Demo: All Changes + New Details I Found" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IWVJQa4wx6Q?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Borderlands 4 Coming to Xbox Game Pass?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-borderlands-4-coming-to-xbox-game-pass.1279881/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Borderlands 4 is one of the biggest launches taking place before the end of 2025, and part of modern gaming means some players are probably wondering whether it will be included on Xbox Game Pass. We have the details.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 12</a>, Borderlands 4 will have more than enough to whet the appetite with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-will-feature-30-billion-guns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 30 billion guns</a>, and we were impressed with the title after a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-preview-reveal-harlowe-demo-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re yet to secure a copy of Borderlands 4 and are wondering if you can avoid splashing out due to a Game Pass subscription, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-borderlands-4-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Borderlands 4 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not yet. Image via Gearbox</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Borderlands 4 will not be available to play with an Xbox Game Pass subscription when it launches on September 12th</strong>.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 is not a first-party Xbox title, which would result in automatic inclusion in the service, and there has not been any announcement of it joining the catalog.</p>



<p>Though Microsoft has not announced the first wave of titles coming to <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Pass</a> in September, any announcement for Borderlands 4’s inclusion would have likely been made well in advance, as it would have been a huge coup.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-borderlands-4-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Borderlands 4 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Borderlands 4 is likely to come to Xbox Game Pass in the future, although any inclusion is likely to be a long way away.</strong></p>



<p>Gearbox has a history of releasing titles on Game Pass, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-more-games-leaving-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 3 leaving the service</a> on August 31 ahead of the launch of the new title. Borderlands 3, including all of the DLC for the title, joined the Game Pass catalog in April, resulting in a four-month stint on the service.</p>



<p>That shows that Gearbox is more than happy to embrace the platform, though it’s likely the inclusion period was decided upon to raise interest in Borderlands 4. Therefore, it would be surprising if the new title were to join the service anytime soon.</p>



<p>Given Borderlands 3 was first released in 2019, it took six years for the title to join Game Pass earlier this year. As such, don’t expect Borderlands 4 to feature for a long time, potentially not until post-2030, especially with plenty of DLC planned for the future.</p>

<p>For more Borderlands 4, take a look at our exclusive chat with Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford on<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-pitchford-nervous-challenge-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> why he’s “a little nervous” about some parts of the game</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-100-million-units-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predicting the title will break the 100 million sales mark</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Saturday, NYC Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani announced that his campaign would hold a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zohrankmamdani.bsky.social/post/3lx3cikladk2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scavenger hunt</a> across the city the next day. The themed event would be entirely accessible by public transit (one of his campaign issues), and there would be a surprise at the end. The number of people who showed up, and some of the design of the hunt itself, made for some wobbles, but it was a clever way to explore the city and hang out with friends, and the latest manifestation of Mamdani’s “what if it were nice to live in New York?” platform.</p><p>Mamdani announced the first clue in a social media <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zohrankmamdani.bsky.social/post/3lx5r3ivmzk2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a> at 11am on Sunday. It referenced New York City’s youngest mayor and told participants to go to “the Gilded Age hall where that mayor spent a lot of his time.” It wasn’t too hard to figure out this one meant Tammany Hall off Union Square, though I’m committed enough to pedantry to note that Tammany Hall would have had a different headquarters nearby during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_J._Grant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugh J. Grant</a>’s time as mayor. But given that the <a href="https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/2490.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official landmark</a> for Tammany Hall is its last HQ, and that Union Square is the de facto meeting point for numerous political gatherings in NYC, that’s where I headed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>After a morning filled with personal shame wherein I tried to adjust my bike brakes, hopelessly fucked it up somehow, and had to go to my local bikeshop to get them fixed, I arrived at Union Square just before the 2pm start time. I was shocked to find multiple lines for the scavenger hunt’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zohrankmamdani.bsky.social/post/3lx6344khtk22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sticker card</a> consuming the square, one continuing down 17th St and another following Union Square West to end at 15th. While I waited, I overheard multiple curious onlookers ask what the line was for. Many participants explained that they’d seen Mamdani’s announcement on Instagram and TikTok; I’d seen it on Bluesky, and these different platforms coupled with a huge turnout, with people lining up <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/karenho.bsky.social/post/3lx737hoxfc2j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well before</a> the event even started, felt like proof that Mamdani’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/kat-abughazaleh-congress-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a> focus is continuing to reach people and bring them out to his events. Nevertheless, one passerby said “Who the hell is that?” when someone explained it was an event for Zohran Mamdani, though I’m not clear whether they were local or from out of town.&nbsp;</p><p>I was excited to discover that <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games journalist</a> and Aftermath <a href="https://aftermath.site/switch-2-line" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">line-waiting pal</a> Autumn Wright was in another line. We met up in time for the less-exciting discovery that the Mamdani campaign had already run out of the sticker cards, but we didn’t think much of it since we could still follow the clues.&nbsp;</p><p>I had worried that bringing my bike was a bad idea, presuming Mamdani’s emphasis on public transit would mean the hunt would take place across the boroughs and I’d end up either biking to Queens or dragging my bike on trains all day. My fears seemed confirmed when we got the second clue, held up on a poster by a campaign volunteer: “‘He was fresh and everyone else was tired’--whether from running against him or running on this track named after him, who’s to say.” At first, we thought the clue was leading us to a traffic circle in the Bronx, but a nudge from another participant and Autumn looking up the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/09/nyregion/metrocampaigns/a-campaign-to-remember-the-mixed-legacy-of-john-v.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quote</a> pointed us instead to a running track named after Mayor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lindsay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John V. Lindsay</a> in East River Park, a far less onerous trek.</p><p>Of course, every other person in the park was headed to the same place. There was a rush for the nearby <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-definitive-citi-bike-strategy-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CitiBike</a> dock and for a bus stop on 14th St, and I was glad I’d decided to bring my bike. Autumn and their partner snagged CitiBikes, and we made our way through Alphabet City to the park. Getting to the track by public transit was apparently far less easy; my friend Jeanne Thornton, a narrative designer and author of the video-game themed novel <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/743703/asl-by-jeanne-thornton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>A/S/L</em></a>, told me there was a “bottleneck on the first clue [due to] heavy dependence on the M14 bus, which straight up refused to pick anyone up because too many Zohran people.” While many of the clues would ultimately be accessible by subway, several of the early-game ones were best done by bus, and it’s no surprise lower Manhattan’s bus system wasn’t prepared to deal with the number of people it seems like even the Mamdani campaign <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zohrankmamdani.bsky.social/post/3lx67rosykk2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t expecting</a>.</p><p>When we got to the track, there was another crush of people waiting for the pedestrian overpass, but things were pretty <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/maxxanishi.bsky.social/post/3lx6aaknohk2g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">orderly</a> despite the crowd. We got our next clue: “We disagree with this former mayor on most things, but we’re happy to be in the same boat with him on free public transit. Meet us outside this Manhattan terminal where you’ll find the City’s shining example of free transit.”</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>It was easy to figure out that this one was the Staten Island Ferry terminal near Whitehall Street, and I actually didn’t even register the “mayor” part of this clue until writing this article. (It’s a reference to Guiliani, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/29/nyregion/mayor-to-end-50-cent-fare-on-si-ferry.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made the ferry free</a> in 1997.) Our bike ride to the terminal was frustrating due to huge swathes of the East River Greenway being under construction, though this did inspire us to lead a gaggle of struggling CitiBikers in taking over the car lane on South Street. Once the greenway opened up, we got a great view of the water, and I was excited to cheer like a <a href="https://aftermath.site/moby-dick-marathon-mystic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nerd</a> as we passed the <a href="https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/the-fleet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">historic ships</a> at the South Street Seaport.</p><p>At Whitehall, we got our next clue: “I am a member of NYC-DSA, but I would not be the first member to be elected mayor. Find your next clue at the building named after the man who was. You’ll be doing us a really big favor.” I got this one totally wrong by presuming DSA was a recent development and instead looking up socialist mayors, which sent me down an informative dead end about Schenectady mayor <a href="https://time.com/7301483/socialist-mayor-before-zohran-mamdani/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">George Lund</a>. Autumn again came in clutch by just looking up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Democratic_Socialists_of_America_public_officeholders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DSA officeholders</a> and revealing the very-new-to-me fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dinkins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Dinkins</a> was a member. (“Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?/You'll be doing us a really big favor” is a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidlublin.bsky.social/post/3lx6oa7lykk2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quote</a> from an A Tribe Called Quest song.)&nbsp;</p><p>The next location, the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/dcas/business/dcasmanagedbuildings/david-n-dinkins-manhattan-municipal-building.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David N. Dinkins Manhattan Municipal Building</a> near City Hall, was back to the east side and not terribly far, but we were definitely starting to feel the wear of zigzagging across town with CitiBikes. Jeanne also highlighted the routing to me as a problem, telling me she felt there was “too much backtracking.” Luckily, the ferry terminal to City Hall is a pretty straightforward trip by train. A cyclist I’d met back in Union Square had told me he’d brought his bike because he was worried all the transit trips would get expensive, and by stop three I could definitely imagine them adding up.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>Around this time we learned via rumblings that Mamdani had said on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:j5hrotody26iqi24hcusufxu/post/3lx67rosykk2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a> that “only people with clue cards will be able to access the final stop.” That information, combined with the slog of CitiBikes, helped Autumn and their partner decide to take a break while they pondered whether to continue. I felt committed to seeing the whole thing through, so I biked up to the Dinkins building on my own. Without other people to keep me honest, I made my standard mistake of biking by vibes instead of actual directions, then got further lost at the Dinkins building by confusing it with places I’d done jail and court support. I got to the clue only a few minutes before Autumn and their partner showed up: “Eric Adams isn’t the first scandal-ridden guy to fancy himself a ‘night life mayor.’ Find your next clue in the park named for the mayor who led this city as it was roaring, before it all came crashing down.”</p><p>This one was fun to dig into, and I quickly got the answer of mayor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Walker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James J. Walker</a>. Autumn and their partner decided to bail, and I had a lovely ride up a mostly empty Hudson Street to <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/james-j-walker-park" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James J. Walker Park</a>. (Thanks, <a href="https://congestionreliefzone.mta.info/tolling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">congestion pricing</a>!) I was utterly hopeless at the next clue: “I often quote this former mayor who said ‘If you agree with me on 9 out of 12 issues, vote for me.’ If you rearrange 12 out of 12 letters of this location adjacent to a bridge named for him, you get A RAP MAY WALTZ (and yes, see a psychiatrist.)” I figured out the mayor, Ed Koch, and the subsequent bridge, the Queensboro, pretty quickly, but I had absolutely no idea what to do next. I asked some people nearby, and as we discussed the tram to Roosevelt Island I thought we were figuring the clue out together before I realized they were just walking me to the answer of <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/tramway-plaza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tramway Plaza</a>. They were clearly disappointed in me, and my guilt over not putting in my best effort pursued me on the lengthy bike ride up to 2nd Ave and 59th St.</p><p>I took 8th Ave most of the way since it has a bike lane, and as my legs started to feel all the miles of riding I’d done, I thought about how much of the city I’d seen that I otherwise wouldn’t have. I’d passed by places I’d hung out in college and places I’d enjoyed running when I was training for the NYC marathon, revisiting memories that feel deeply tied to living in the city by being out in it. At an intersection, an older man complimented me on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cv8VA5IOOib/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vintage bike</a> and told me his own was 40 years old, and we chatted about bikes as we waited for the light. (He also told me he would never ride on tires as skinny as my 20 inchers, a sentiment I definitely agree with.) It was one of those random, lovely encounters you’d only have by moving around, being out among the city’s people instead of holed up at home. As Republicans (and Democrats like Mamdani primary opponent <a href="https://www.andrewcuomo.com/press/cuomo-unveils-subway-safety-plan-restore-order-and-confidence-nycs-transit-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Cuomo</a>) scare-monger the dangers of the city and its <a href="https://www.hamiltonnolan.com/p/the-subway-is-not-scary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transit</a>, there was definitely power in telling a different story through getting participants outside, encouraging them to interact with each other and use the city’s streets, busses, and trains.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath</figcaption></figure><p>At Tramway Plaza, a campaign volunteer reminded me that only people with sticker cards could go to the final location, telling me the requirement was due to capacity issues, and declined to show me the last clue. People who didn’t have cards definitely seemed disappointed, though most still seemed in good spirits about it. Jeanne, who’d ended her participation at Walker Park, told me she was disappointed that “you are dead in the water if you didn’t have a card–two women we’re talking to at the park are saying there should be an alternate final clue for like, a runner up party… Basically there’s no credits roll for anyone other than the lucky 1000 who got cards.” Even though I’d enjoyed the ride to my final stop, it <em>was</em> a long way to go just to arrive at an anti-climactic ending, especially since the result had nothing to do with my actual performance during the scavenger hunt.</p><p>I spoke with some volunteers, who told me they hadn’t known much about the scavenger hunt beforehand and had just been in general campaign chats when it needed staffing. One had been canvassing for Mamdani just before their shift at the hunt, while for another it was their first time volunteering with the campaign. Some participants took pity on me and showed me a picture of the final clue on their phone: “One of my favorite cafes shares a nickname of my favorite mayor [cut off in photo] time. And don’t worry, they always remember to bloom their coffee. Travel to another borough to this cafe to end the hunt!”</p><p>The folks who shared the photo told me the answer– Little Flower Cafe in Astoria, a nickname for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiorello_La_Guardia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fiorello La Guardia</a> and a reference to an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-interview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> Mamdani did with The New York Times. It wouldn’t have been a bad bike ride over the Queensboro to do my journalistic duty of checking it out, but the dread of tacking more miles on to my commute home and discomfort with the idea of hanging out outside something that seemed to already be struggling with capacity dissuaded me, and I biked back to Brooklyn instead. People who had cards apparently, after waiting in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jjlee.bsky.social/post/3lx6pyoxlss2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another line</a>, got <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jeremywilcox.bsky.social/post/3lx6ktgi7jc24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a photo with Mamdani and a free drink</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at all the clues and answers, the scavenger hunt’s theme seems to be mayoral corruption, something I already suspected given that Mamdani’s announcement video featured a bag of the brand of chips into which an Eric Adams advisor <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/08/20/winnie-greco-eric-adams-aide-attempted-cash-katie-honan-reporter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stuffed an envelope of cash and tried to pass it off to a The City reporter last week</a>. Adams, by the way, is not impressed with the scavenger hunt, <a href="https://x.com/ericadamsfornyc/status/1959294873166598282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeting</a> from his personal account that “This run around is exactly what he plans to do with your safety, your housing and your taxes. It’s all kid’s play for Mamdani” and that Mamdani <a href="https://x.com/ericadamsfornyc/status/1959767315375071618" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wants to</a> “turn our city into the Squid Games.” Cuomo, for his part, <a href="https://x.com/andrewcuomo/status/1959312164826607688" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> “defund the police but great scavenger hunts,” <a href="https://x.com/andrewcuomo/status/1959312736942223514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">followed</a>, bafflingly, by “no class free pizza for all seniors.”</p><p>I’m no political strategist, so I certainly can’t say if the scavenger hunt was successful as a campaign event. No one asked me for my contact information or said much about Mamdani’s policies, though it’s likely most people learned about the event from Mamdani’s social media and thus don’t need much education. I definitely learned more about NYC mayors and their scandals or combatting of scandals than I knew before. It’s not hard to draw a line from the theme to the scandals that plagued <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3gz35dgro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adams</a> and <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/03/andrew-cuomo-nyc-mayor-comeback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cuomo’s</a> administrations, and to read that in contrast to Mamdani subtly casting himself as a more honest alternative. And while I’m sure the whole thing wasn’t intended to piss off Cuomo and Adams, seeing them both act like babies about it made them look out-of-touch and no fun.&nbsp;</p><p>Being fun is no guarantee that you’ll make a good mayor, but Mamdani’s campaign has embraced what seems like a genuine joy and love of what the city has to offer. Several of his campaign events have involved stunts out on the streets, walking the <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/zohran-mamdani-goes-the-distance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">length of Manhattan</a> or <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/morning-spew-zohran-mamdani-takes-a-hike-faster-than-the-m34/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">racing a slow bus</a>; these kinds of things get Mamdani’s name and face out there while also portraying him as someone who actually <em>likes</em> being here. While the final stop of the hunt might have been a closed event, the hunt itself and many of his other activities have felt like reminders that there are still things to do in the city that don’t require entrance fees and private property, with the scavenger hunt pushing participants to gather in the free public spaces of our parks and plazas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As a game–if a scavenger hunt can be called a game–the need to Google some of the deeper-cut clues (Autumn overheard one participant in Union Square saying they’d used Chat-GPT to get the Tammany Hall answer) wasn’t always the most fun way to puzzle something out, though hardcore NYC history nerds might have been better at solving things on their own. Not being able to get to the end despite solving all the clues in time because I hadn’t arrived long before the event even started was also a bit of a bummer, and I can imagine feeling that letdown more strongly if I’d been spending money on travel fare or dealing with Sunday train schedules to take part. In that regard, the routing could have been more efficient; Jeanne drew me what she called an “angry map” of her experience on transit, which stood in contrast to my bike route:</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>But for me, it was a nice way to be outside and see friends, to learn some things about the city while reconnecting with the pleasures of just exploring it. A scavenger hunt doesn’t say much about how Mamdani would lead the city, but it did bring his supporters together to have a good time with each other and get his name out there to onlookers. That the turnout was so big for something with little warning, at a time when the city is <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/08/07/city-less-crowded-summer-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">traditionally empty</a>, is another reminder of the popularity of his campaign. We’ll see how that momentum carries through to November’s mayoral election.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-silksong-gta-vi-elder-scrolls-vi"><h3>What’s Going To Be The Next Silksong?</h3></a><p>"Given that Silksong is real and about to come out, what other super long-awaited games are left?"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays"><h3>Indie Devs Are Delaying Their Games Because Of Silksong [Update]</h3></a><p>'I feel like a little krill trying to not get eaten by a blue whale,' wrote one developer</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/zohran-mamdani-scavenger-hunt]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/replaced-release-date-spring-2026-cyberpunk-platformer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2-5d-pixel-art-cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-will-launch-in-spring-2026.1279851/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Replaced, the 2.5D pixel-art, retro-futuristic, cyberpunk-themed platformer that was first announced in 2021, has a new release window from developer Sad Cat Studios, with game director Yura Zhdanovich announcing, "<em>with confidence</em>," that Replaced will arrive on PC and Xbox Series X/S in Spring 2026.</p>



<p>When Replaced was revealed in 2021, it was one of the more <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-140-third-party-studios/">enticing games coming to Xbox</a>, and players were keen to get their hands on it in 2022, when it was initially due to launch. It wasn't Zhdanovich's or the rest of Sad Cat Studios' plan to have Replaced go five years between its official announcement and release, but neither could have predicted <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sat-cat-studios-delays-i-replaced-i-to-support-staff-affected-by-ukraine-invasion">Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>, and the impact it would have on the Belarus-based development team.</p>



<p>If not for the invasion, Replaced would have likely been released years ago. But the invasion, coupled with the regular complications and struggles of developing a game, pushed its launch back to 2026. In today's development update from the studio (published through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPoyEkQePA4">IGN</a>), with Zhdanovich narrating, he went through a bit of the journey the game has been on, and showed how it has improved from its prototyping phase to now.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>We know that our community is incredibly excited to play&nbsp;</em><em>REPLACED&nbsp;</em>and it’s no secret that it’s taken longer than we initially thought to deliver that to you all - we apologise for that," Zhdanovich added in a press release. "<em>We’ve always been trying to do what’s right for the project, which in turn, means delivering to you a truly special experience. The good news is that we now are very close to finishing production and&nbsp;</em><em>Replaced&nbsp;</em>will be coming to PC and Xbox Series X|S in Spring 2026."</p>



<p>For now, we have a release window to look forward to. Later this year, Zhdanovich confirmed that the studio will debut the final trailer for the game, at which point we'll also learn the specific release date.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-raising-the-level-cap/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-go-level-cap-being-massively-raised-for-the-first-time-in-five-years.1279848/</guid>

<p>Avid Pokémon GO players have been desperate for the level cap to be raised for ages. Niantic has sounded the klaxon and is finally making it happen. An October 2025 update will see Pokémon GO’s level cap receive a huge increase.</p>



<p>It’s hard to remember a time when the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-water-festival-2025-all-spawns-timed-research-collection-challenges-raids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon GO</a> level cap wasn’t 50. This is because the level cap has remained this way since it was increased in November 2020—just under five years ago. We moved from 40 to 50, and it’s stayed like this. Not for long, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-go-level-cap-will-be-80-from-october-15">Pokémon GO Level Cap Will be 80 From October 15</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A seismic leap. Credit to Niantic</figcaption></figure>



<p>The shocking announcement came from the Pokémon GO X account on August 25: “This October, we’re increasing the level cap from 50 to 80, while rebalancing the overall leveling up journey.”</p>



<p>Closer inspection of the Pokémon GO <a href="https://pokemongo.com/en/post/pgo-leveling-update-announce-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> reveals even more details: ”&nbsp;On Wednesday, October 15, 2025, Pokémon GO will release an update that increases the level cap from 50 to 80. This update will make the leveling journey more fun and engaging by celebrating leveling milestones with new rewards, new cosmetics, and more. And with this update, a number of players can expect to jump in level based on their total earned XP. But don’t worry, no player will go down in level!”</p>



<p>The leveling system is being tweaked overall. According to the blog: “Players can earn levels more frequently,” and “some players may automatically jump in level on October 15.” </p>



<p>No one will move down levels, so you don’t need to worry about this.</p>

<p>Delta Force is finally available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, and while many had been excited for the free-to-play shooter, there is one feature missing that has fans concerned. Black Hawk Down, Delta Force’s campaign mode, offers players the option to either go alone or play in co-op. At least, that’s what it is on PC.</p>



<p>Loading into the mode on console only gives players the option of “Fighting Alone”. A visit to the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2507950/discussions/0/608668448981185838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s community page</a> on Steam and Discord reveal multiple discussions on the matter. However, neither the game’s developer Team Jade or publisher TiMi Studio Group have commented publicly.</p>



<p>“[It’s] sad because they said on 3 months ago crossplay and co-op campaign on consoles,” one user on the game’s Discord wrote. “[It’s] like they lie us [sic]”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to both Delta Force’s developer and publisher for comment on the missing co-op option. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>What do you think of Delta Force’s Black Hawk Down campaign not having co-op at launch? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dawn of War 4 Wants To Revitalize The RTS Genre and I think it can</p>
      </div>
<p>Dawn of War 4 will feature not one but four campaigns when it launches. The Space Marine, Orks, Necrons, and the Adeptus Mechanicus will headline their own series of missions, and each one of these groups bring unique units, buildings, and advantages to the battlefield.</p><p>The combined campaigns will feature over 70 missions, and the story is being co-written by Warhammer 40: Black Library author John French. Theysen added that multiplayer won't be forgotten and is being worked on, but the studio is primarily focused on crafting a single-player campaign that evokes a sensation of stepping back into the golden age of RTS games. "What we look most fondly back on when playing RTS games when we were all younger, or how that shaped our tastes in the genre, the single-player campaigns were one of the things that stuck the longest with us," Theysen added.</p><p>In addition to the single-player campaign, the game will also feature Last Stand and Skirmish modes alongside 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 multiplayer when it launches in 2026 for PC. In related news, Amazon's Warhammer 40,000 live-action adaptation--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazons-warhammer-series-with-henry-cavill-could-finally-be-entering-development/1100-6528340/">with Superman actor Henry Cavill attached in a starring role</a>--is continuing at a steady pace, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazons-warhammer-40k-show-is-likely-still-years-away/1100-6533551/">but it's still years away from making its TV debut</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Gamescom 2025 was officially the biggest and most diverse in show history, according to the association that organizes the annual event in Cologne, Germany. Bringing in nearly 400,000 visitors from more than 100 countries, with international participation at an all-time high and its digital reach breaking a new record, <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/2025-excites-the-community-worldwide-and-sets-new-standards">the association is calling it the most successful show yet</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Having spent a week in Cologne to cover the show for <em>Game Informer</em>, it was both one of the most exhausting and exciting weeks of my career. I played so many amazing games, spoke to just as many interesting devs, and ultimately, came away from the show excited about the future of gaming, despite the industry's many, many problems. It turns out, I was one of 357,000 visitors from 128 countries at the show this year. More than 34,000 trade visitors attended the show, and Gamescom saw the strongest growth in this sector from the U.S., China, Canada, and Japan.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3y4kS24z2yQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3y4kS24z2yQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Speaking of international participation, a total of 1,568 exhibitors from 72 countries participated on the show floor, "with a foreign share of 70%," according to a press release. "There were also 40 country pavilions representing 35 countries, including for the first time the pavilion of official partner country Thailand, along with Dubai and Kyrgyzstan."</p><p>Digitally, Gamescom 2025 reached new heights, too, garnering over 630 million views worldwide as of this past Saturday evening (Gamescom's final day was yesterday). Gamescom says that's a 105 percent increase compared to last year's show. Seventy-two million of those views were for Gamescom's Opening Night Live last Tuesday, marking an 80 percent increase in viewership compared to last year.&nbsp;</p><p>"Gamescom combines business and entertainment like no other event worldwide, as shown by 1,568 exhibitors spread across 233,000 square meters of gross exhibition space," Koelnmesse (the event hall) president and CEO Gerald Böse writes in a press release. "With record figures once again in nearly every category, the enormous variety of experiences and global participation, Gamescom is the most important event for the global gaming community."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b4xQ-u2PyiU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b4xQ-u2PyiU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><h3>Here are Gamescom 2025 stats, at a glance:&nbsp;</h3><ul><li><p>357,000&nbsp;visitors&nbsp;from 128 countries</p></li><li><p>Over 34,000 trade visitors, with the strongest growth from the US, China,&nbsp;Canada, and Japan</p></li><li><p>More than&nbsp;630 million views across the entire show program (as of Saturday evening) – an increase of 105 percent over the previous year</p></li><li><p>72 million views for Gamescom Opening Night Live (as of Saturday evening) – an increase of 80 percent over the previous year</p></li><li><p>5.7 million page views for Gamescom&nbsp;Epix (as of Saturday evening)</p></li><li><p>1,568 exhibitors from 72 countries, with a foreign share of 70 percent</p></li><li><p>40&nbsp;country&nbsp;pavilions&nbsp;from 35 countries</p></li><li><p>Approximately 233,000 square meters of gross exhibition space</p></li><li><p>Around 80,000 people at the Gamescom city festival</p></li></ul><p>We have a ton of coverage for Gamescom 2025 up on the <em>Game Informer </em>site, with many more previews for upcoming games to come, so check out some of the pieces so far:&nbsp;</p><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul><hr><p><em>What was your favorite game shown during Gamescom 2025?

<p>The claim originally came from SwitchForce over on <a href="https://x.com/TheSwitchForce/status/1959828809559249019">X</a> (formerly Twitter), but VGC has also heard from multiple sources that a presentation is planned for <strong>12th September</strong>. If that's the case, it'll be taking place the day before the 40th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros</a>.</p>
<p>The 12th <em>is</em> a Friday, which is a bit of an unusual day for a Direct, but Nintendo has previously held presentations on the last working day of the week, with the most-recent being an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>-focused one in 2021. Others have looked at Super Nintendo World (2020), the Wii U, and a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-direct-presentation-full-broadcast-history-list">bigger general Direct in 2013</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Plus, besides 2024, Nintendo has held a Direct in September every single year, except last year. So a Direct in September is almost expected. Of course, as always, none of this is confirmed until Nintendo says anything, so remember that healthy pinch of salt!</p>

<p>One of the big reveals of this rumoured Direct will likely be Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's release date. The game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/metroid-prime-4-rating-spotted-on-nintendos-website">was recently rated</a>, meaning it's most likely ready. That and the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors</a> are the only big 2025 releases waiting on a date.</p>
<p>So, let's wait and see what happens, then.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Two minutes past midnight on Monday, <a href="https://x.com/TheSwitchForce/status/1959828809559249019">SwitchForce</a>, a leaker who has previously been accurate when making claims on Nintendo events, dropped a tease for a new Nintendo Direct coming next month, specifically, September 12, 2025. Following that tease, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-planned-for-mid-september/">VGC</a> corroborated SwitchForce's claim by reporting that its sources have stated a Nintendo Direct is coming mid-September, though they did not take a stab at the date.</p>



<p>VGC did, however, point out that there's been a Nintendo Direct in September for nearly as long as Nintendo Directs have been around, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-direct/archive/?srsltid=AfmBOooMjvltuQbJgWKKYXh3mNz-5KKgkJS8-AvxntJwYVDaiACa8RKC">save for last year</a>, and that if it is on September 12, that would put the Direct one day ahead of the Super Mario Bros. 40th anniversary.</p>



<p>While we've had leaks and reports accurately predict dates for these Direct events, what's always been less accurate in that kind of early reporting is the size of the event, regarding whether it'll be a full-blown general Direct, with first and third-party news. Or, if it's just a third-party Partner Showcase, or an Indie World Direct, or a Direct focused entirely on one game.</p>



<p>The most recent Nintendo Direct presentation was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-nintendo-switch-2-gameplay-deep-dive/">Kirby Air Riders-dedicated showcase, </a>with Masahiro Sakurai spending 45 minutes detailing everything you'll need to know about the return of the cult-classic racer. Before that, it was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/">Partner Showcase</a>, and before that, we had a <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-pauline-gameplay-details/">Donkey Kong Bananza-focused Direct</a> and a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-shows-new-courses-characters-tricks-and-more/">Mario Kart World Direct</a>.</p>



<p>In April, when Nintendo finally revealed the Nintendo Switch 2, was the last time we had a general Nintendo Direct. Hopefully, with three Directs focused on one specific game and a partner showcase between April and now, we're due for a bigger, general Direct that debuts what Nintendo has planned for the rest of the year.</p>



<p>Namely, the release date for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is one announcement that could appear tomorrow. The last we heard, it was due for a<a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-still-slated-late-2025-playable-later-this-month/"> late 2025 release</a>. There was also a playable demo at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a> in Germany and Fan Expo in Canada.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-voyagers-hands-on-preview-for-lovers-of-split-fiction-and-it-takes-two.1279809/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Co-op gaming isn’t, has never been, and will never die. Local co-op, especially, isn’t going anywhere, and many developers and publishers, thankfully, know what people want. LEGO is about as notable as any leader in the genre, and its new co-op adventure—LEGO Voyagers—seems to get everything right. Walk with me as I explain all in my Gamescom 2025 LEGO Voyagers preview.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-is-getting-the-skywalker-saga-treatment-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Star Wars</a>: The Video Game was a landmark moment in gaming: Super-popular licenses working hand-in-hand with one another. The ability to relive famous Star Wars moments with another player was the tip of the lightsaber. It spawned annual <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO</a> games (sometimes multiple releases a year) and gave friends, couples, and families the chance to enjoy cooperative play.</p>



<p>In LEGO Voyagers, you and a <em>human </em>friend need to learn every trick (and brick) in the book to overcome obstacles, move forward, and rescue a spaceship. I walked away from my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-2025-awards-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025</a> demo with a big compliment to the game—Hazelight Studios would likely be proud of this.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-stud-in-its-own-right">A Stud in Its Own Right</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/games/lego-voyagers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Voyagers</a> is a mandatory two-player game with a Friends Pass system, similar to Split Fiction, It Takes Two, and A Way Out. This means you only need to buy one copy of the game, and two players can join forces. There’s no AI or computer-controlled co-op cohort here.</p>



<p>I had the privilege of teaming up with Light Build Studios’ creative director, Karsten Lund, and got to hear his insight into the game as he led me every step of the way. The control scheme is simple enough, as one button lets you jump, and the action button attaches your character to most creations in the environment.</p>



<p>You’ll cling to planks to form a bridge, attach to fallen lights and structures to cross gaps, and even form a literal attachment with your partner as you become a giant poking device you’d only find in Olympic Pole Vault competitions to reach new heights. The handful of platforming sections I conquered won’t have you consulting help manuals or scouring YouTube for walkthroughs, but there’s just enough there to have you thinking. Voyagers could be a great learning tool for young ones.</p>



<p>Lund assured me that some of the game’s later challenges will ramp up the difficulty, though. Making this a co-op game for both young and old to enjoy—more than likely together. You also can’t help but admire how cute the game is. Our muted LEGO bricks are aesthetically endearing and are likely to be a merchandising masterstroke if the game sells—which I think it will.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-voyagers-steps-into-the-hazelight">LEGO Voyagers Steps Into The Hazelight</h2>



<p>I’m desperate to avoid the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hazelight-is-already-working-on-its-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hazelight Studios</a> comparison. The Josef Fares-founded company is seen as a modern-day pioneer of co-op-only gameplay. Creating intertwining adventures where two players must work together to prevail in the face of adversity and swat away negativity in search of the ultimate cathartic conclusion.</p>



<p>LEGO Voyagers gameplay has a similar vibe, and it’s hard to ignore. On the plus side, is this a bad thing? I don’t think so. I adore what Hazelight is doing, and the roughly 30-40 million copies sold across the studio’s first three games are symptomatic of a public that feels the same way.</p>



<p>I love to play co-op games with my fiancé. Always have done. LEGO Voyagers appeals to a wide-ranging demographic and is extremely accessible. From what I played, I don’t think LEGO Voyagers is going to break new ground, but it doesn’t need to, as it’s LEGO, it’s charming, pleasing on the eye, and a lot of fun.</p>



<hr>



<p>Make your way to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> to share your thoughts on co-op gaming. Do we need more efforts like we’re seeing from Hazelight and Annapurna/Light Brick Studio? Also, let me know what you thought of my LEGO Voyagers preview.</p>

<p>You can seemingly play Doom on any device with a screen. A modder named Aaron Christophel has managed to get the 1993 classic running on a portable Anker Prime charging station.</p>



<p>The charging station features a Synwit SWM34S SoC(system on a chip) with 8MB SDRam and 16MB of external flash memory. These specs allow Doom to be played on the built-in 200×480 LCD screen.</p>



<p>The controls are also pretty straight forward <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdOU8SqCqeY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for what Christophel</a> had to work with. You can move forward and backward by turning the dial; pushing the dial in and turning rotates you left and right; pushing the dial in without turning allows you to fire and open doors.</p>



<p>Christophel says that it was done without making any modifications to the internal hardware of the device. He was able to get it running using the debugging header connected to another device. </p>



<p>It may not be the most convenient way to play Doom, but the fact that you can is impressive in and of itself. Who knows, maybe this will also <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">become an Xbox</a>.</p>

This will be achieved by a rebalance of all XP levels to date, and the removal of additional, time-consuming levelling tasks between levels 41 to 50.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, players who have already earned the necessary XP will be boosted up to the new level system's requirements when they go live on October 18 — though the exact XP amounts required post-rebalance are yet to be confirmed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cruically, Pokémon levels, which are currently tied to your player level, will not be expanded or rebalanced, with level 50 remaining the cap there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't expect hitting the new level 80 player cap to be easy, however. Alongside the necessary XP requirements, a fresh set of levelling tasks will be added for the final climb from level 71 to 80, ensuring only the toughest Trainers hit the game's new top level (and there's still plenty to grind for).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New rewards for levelling up will include fresh avatar items, plus increased storage capacity for Pokémon, items and gifts — upgrades you would otherwise pay for. (And if you're already at the game's maximum limit for one of these, developers confirmed you'll still be boosted above that.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's even a new boost for friends at level 70 and above, who will have an increaed chance of becoming Lucky Friends with other players.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/25/unnamed-1756128853121.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon Go's current level 50 cap has stood since 2020. What do you mean you're not there yet?</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For those keen to preserve their legacy of levelling up prior to the October 15 update, existing avatar items will be retired and made exclusive to those who already earned them (for example, the Level 50 Jacket item). A pair of new profile medals will also be available, if you reached up to Level 49 prior to the new cap being introduced, and another if you made Level 50.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help players on their way to the new milestone, XP will be boosted in-game from today until October 14 with double XP for catching, and an additional 3,000 XP for winning raids and Max Battles.  Timed Research will offer further rewards, with a tasty 7 million XP on the table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a busy time for Pokémon Go, which is also now teasing its next in-game season. A video released yesterday included confirmation that Meta Metagross would debut in the coming months, alongside the long-awaited return of Keldeo — a Mythical creature only made available once via a premium purchase for a brief time back in 2022.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

That is, of course, a very welcome thing – it’s been eight years since the last Mass Effect (13 since the last <em>good</em> one), and the upcoming, undated sequel is both far away and has a lot to prove following BioWare’s recent chain of underwhelming releases. Owlcat stepping up with its own 3D, space-faring adventure is something of a relief, then – finally, after so many years of waiting, we’re getting a “new” Mass Effect from a studio that’s really proven its RPG talents with the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous">Pathfinder</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a>. But while Osiris Reborn is certainly comfortingly familiar, the hard sci-fi nature of The Expanse is new territory for this format, as opposed to BioWare’s Star Wars and Trek influences. That allows it to neatly circumnavigate any “we have Mass Effect at home” jokes, but does run the risk of being a colder cousin to Commander Shepard’s so easily likable odyssey. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Osiris Reborn takes place in parallel to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-expanse">The Expanse</a>’s core story – the first two books, if you're a reader, and the early TV seasons if you're a watcher. You’ll feel the impact of important events ripple through your adventure; the mission I watched creative director Alexander Mishulin play took place in the wake of the Eros Incident, and several minutes in the news of the Canterbury being attacked was spreading among a panicked space station. If all that means nothing to you, I don’t think there’s anything to worry about – I’m only a casual fan of The Expanse myself, with a fading memory of those early episodes, and everything seemed to slot into place. I imagine Owlcat is making efforts for this original story to be a gateway into the universe.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While familiar faces will eventually turn up, Osiris Reborn charts the journey of a player-created protagonist and a team of original characters. Among your crew of Pinkwater Security mercenaries is J, our companion for this demo mission as well as your sibling (they’re modelled after your custom character to ensure family resemblance, a nice touch that means everyone will get their own version of them.) Owlcat aims to make every companion feel present and alive, and as we explore the mercenary station J wanders off to chat with NPCs, providing the sense that he’s his own person and not just a pawn to direct in battle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we push on and gossip with a vendor and a technician, I find that the writing doesn’t hit the highs of either Mass Effect or Owlcat’s own isometric RPGs. It’s somewhat flat and lacking in character-defining flourishes, and as a result I’m not yet convinced these companions will be as charming or engaging as those in the series Osiris Rising is so clearly built upon. But don’t take that as me writing them off – The Expanse has some excellent, complex characters that reward a slow burn, and so there’s every chance your crew will get where they need to be over the course of the 30-ish hour campaign. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The siblings previously escaped the disastrous Eros Incident by stealing a spaceship from the shadowy Protogen corporation, and the repercussions of that are where the demo kicks into action: Protogen has followed us back home to demand justice. It’s here we’re presented with a classic RPG choice: we can ask our Pinkwater Security colleagues to resist and cover our escape, or simply try to slip away unaided. One persuasion check later, the station’s senior officer has agreed to have his mercenaries hold the line while we make our exit. Mishulin promises there will be repercussions for this, both immediate and delayed. As we crawl through the station’s vents, the roar of battle echoes as our allies hold the line against Protogen. Later, we see the cost of that choice: dead bodies strewn through the corridors. After unlocking the station’s armoury in search of new equipment, we find it completely stripped of guns – every rifle taken in an attempt to secure our safety. These are perhaps somewhat surface-level consequences, and I suspect the alternative route wouldn’t have been significantly different (Protogen later announced that they would have dealt with us reasonably peacefully, so certainly there’d be fewer bodies.) The real question is how our choices ripple across the campaign. Perhaps by resisting and losing so many mercenaries, we’ve set ourselves up for more significant failure later on down the road.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Expanse’s hard sci-fi nature means there’s not really the opportunity for space wizards or aliens with bizarre abilities.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the station’s staff were doing plenty to fight off Protogen, there were multiple opportunities for us to deal out our own punishment. Like Mass Effect, combat is a core part of The Expanse, and is similarly a cover-based shooting affair augmented by abilities. The rocket grenades are perhaps the most fun – thrown explosives with their own guidance thrusters that zoom across the arena like fireworks. There’s a lore reason for such extravagant properties: thrown explosives don't tend to go where you want when there’s little-to-no gravity, and half the battle sequences shown in the demo were in such spaces. Anchored to the side of the station by mag-lock boots, these fights didn’t seem significantly different to those waged inside, despite a bespoke system that adjusts the way movement feels and handles, but were made striking by the way bodies and debris float across the arena. Destructible environments splinter and shatter under heavy gunfire, which does occasionally eliminate the enemy’s cover, but mostly seems there to score cool points rather than be a significant tactical advantage. And it really does look cool, especially when explosions tear entire wall panels apart. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My main concern when it comes to combat is the threat that there will be few options beyond guns. The Expanse’s hard sci-fi nature means there’s not really the opportunity for space wizards or aliens with bizarre abilities, and so it may be that the entire combat experience is delivered via the muzzle of a gun. Mishulin assures me there’s a wide variety of firearms that provide a range of experiences even within weapon classifications (there are three assault rifles and all of them have significantly different properties, he explains), plus the distinction between a sniper-focused marksman and the more typical run-and-gun class. But that’s all very Call of Duty, and my hope is that Owlcat has a smart, more RPG-style approach beyond that. With any luck, there will be technical characters such as hackers that provide a more specialised, ability-driven approach.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Expanse: Osiris Reborn Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I can’t say I’ve instantly fallen in love with any one single part of Osiris Reborn, and I’ll need to see at least a few more hours to know if I’ll truly connect with its characters – arguably the most important part of an RPG. But what I have seen appears to be exactly the kind of foundations I’ve been looking for since I took Shepard on their final mission. It’s combat-forward, but conversation-heavy. It’s about the team, but with none of the micromanagement of more traditional computer RPGs. And The Expanse itself is a promising ore vein to be mined – it may be a colder, more grounded universe that puts hard restrictions on several RPG staples, but it’s also a world rife with complex politics that hopefully will lead to conflicts that are deeper and more nuanced than the typical bleeding heart leftie vs tyrannical fascist scenarios so common in this genre.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn’t exactly the first time Owlcat has “done a BioWare.” As the demo came to a close, Mishulin compared the studio’s Pathfinder games to Baldur’s Gate 2. This project sees the developer take inspiration from a later era of BioWare – and so Owlcat must also tread the same path as its muse, shifting from isometric to cinematic. But it knows it can’t just follow in those exact footsteps. “We are building on that legacy and expanding what players anticipate from this experience,” said game design producer Yuliya Chernenko when The Expanse: Osiris Reborn was announced. I wouldn’t say I saw much evidence of that expansion in this demo, but I hope that it exists and will be revealed in time. But even if it falls short of those ambitions and is simply a hard sci-fi version of Mass Effect, I think I’d still happily settle for that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-is-our-best-hope-for-a-new-bioware-style-rpg]]></content:encoded>

Say goodbye to outgoing headliner Bruno Mars, and say hello to 2D, Noodle, Russel, and Murdoc. This is the first time aside from Metallica last summer that the Festival headliner has been a group rather than an individual, and Epic is handling the Gorillaz a little bit differently than they did those elder statesmen of metal.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Gorillaz in the Fortnite item shop</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4555027-fest_10_gorillaz_itemshop_2dnoodle_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555027" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4555027-fest_10_gorillaz_itemshop_2dnoodle_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555027"></a><figcaption>This bundle of Gorillaz cosmetics will be in the Fortnite shop all season long.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4555027-fest_10_gorillaz_itemshop_2dnoodle_1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>When Metallica was the headlining artist, there were skins for each member in both the shop and in the music pass.

Naturally, all the Gorillaz skins are cel shaded.</p><p dir="ltr">Those two brought some stuff with them, of course, as they each have a back bling and musical instrument: a mic stand for 2D and a guitar for Noodle. The selection of shop stuff is rounded out by a camo wrap, a contrail, a jam track for the song Clint Eastwood, and both an emote and a jam track for the song Dare.

This change can be toggled in settings if you don't like the new look.</li><li dir="ltr">They added a "Good" popup for when you miss the center of the note to go along with the existing "Perfect" popup, to make it easier to track those in your peripheral vision.</li><li dir="ltr">You can sort by length and difficulty when browsing songs on the Main Stage.</li><li dir="ltr">Folks with guitar controllers and other non-gamepad devices can now strum when they calibrate using the in-game "tuneup" tool.</li></ul><p>The Festival Main Stage got a makeover, too, as you can see above.</p><h2 dir="ltr">A tease for next season</h2><p dir="ltr">In a surprising move, Epic's announcement for Season 10 also included a tease for what comes next, which it described as a "celebration" of Festival with "Fortnite-original rewards and awesome music." That could very well mean it won't have a headlining artist like Gorillaz or Bruno Mars, and Epic wants to mentally prime us for that in advance.</p>

                <p><em>Until Dawn is celebrating its 10-year anniversary today, August 25, 2025. Below, we explore the fascinating legacy and origin of a classic horror game.</em></p><p>Video games are an incredible medium for horror stories. Some of the greatest games of all time are firmly planted in the horror genre. While games such as Resident Evil and Silent Hill showed audiences the importance of tension in gameplay, the advancement in gaming technology allowed for more cinematic experiences in gameplay design and storytelling.</p><p>In 2015, one of the best examples of horror storytelling in gaming was released and left a lasting legacy that can be felt to this very day. That game was Until Dawn.</p><p>Developed by British developer Supermassive Games, Until Dawn actually started life as a game for Sony's scarcely supported PlayStation 3 peripheral: the Playstation Move. Supermassive sought to create the experience of living through a slasher film and designed the game to appeal to couples in their early 20's, promising a game that would deliver the blood, guts, and scares that come with slasher films.</p><p>This early version of the game had players controlling on-screen flashlights from a first-person perspective, guiding their characters through dark environments and interacting with objects with the motion controls to progress the game. The version of the game did not make it out of alpha testing, and Supermassive went back to the drawing board.</p><p>When Until Dawn finally reemerged, it was a title for the newly released PlayStation 4. Gone were the first-person perspective and motion controls. They were replaced by fixed, cinematic camera angles and more interactive gameplay design, akin to the works of Quantic Dream like Heavy Rain and Detroit: Become Human. Supermassive also made the transition to the Decima engine, a proprietary PlayStation engine that would eventually power games such as Horizon Zero Dawn and Death Stranding, that would help provide photorealistic graphics. Until Dawn went from being a title that potentially would not have found an audience due to requiring a motion peripheral to a game that would provide a more loving tribute to horror films that could be played using just the controller.</p><p>With this change in direction, the game was entirely recast with actors whose likenesses were used in the game, including Academy Award winner Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere (Scream 4 and 6), and Peter Stormare (Fargo, John Wick: Chapter 2), among many others. Supermassive tapped writers Larry Fessenden and Graham Reznick, known for their work in horror films, to pen the script, providing an even deeper layer of authenticity to the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4554694-2359174350-29263.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554694" data-ratio="0.56279988710133" data-width="3543" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4554694-2359174350-29263.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554694"></a><figcaption>Until Dawn (2015)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4554694-2359174350-29263.jpg"></figure><p>Until Dawn's story starts off as a treasure trove of slasher tropes and eventually evolves into something far more sinister and supernatural. Characters begin as one-note cliches and archetypes and eventually blossom into fleshed-out people with meaningful relationships. Thanks to that strong writing, it's devastating when one accidentally dies due to a bad decision by the player. While most horror games of the era emphasized action, Until Dawn provided players with a sense of dread and a fear of the unknown unlike anything else at the time.</p><p>Until Dawn ended up being more of a movie-like experience that let player's' decisions affect the ultimate outcome of the story. The game featured a "butterfly effect" mechanic that showed players the exact moment one of their decisions or a character's death affected the story and helped incentivize repeat playthroughs to see the other possible narrative paths. Until Dawn also held onto some of its roots as a PlayStation Move title, DualShock 4 controller's motion control capabilities, and even included a "Don't Move" mechanic that asked players to hold their controllers as still as possible to determine certain outcomes and fates.</p><p>Until Dawn was a massive success both critically and commercially. It helped turn Supermassive into a reliable source for interactive horror experiences and the studio went on to make more cinematic games, such as The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry, but none of these titles ever quite reached the high bar set by Until Dawn.</p><p>Supermassive revisited the Until Dawn universe with the virtual reality games Until Dawn: Rush of Blood and The Inpatient, the latter of which was set around 60 years before the original game and brought back Fesseden and Reznick as writers.</p><p>Until Dawn would receive the full remake treatment in 2024 when Sony announced a version for the PS5. The remake, developed by Ballistic Moon (which was founded by former Supermassive employees), features a new third-person camera angle, a new musical score, and extended prologues and new endings. One of those endings is open-natured retconning the original's conclusions, implying that a direct sequel to Until Dawn could one day be possible.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4554695-untildawnremake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554695" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4554695-untildawnremake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554695"></a><figcaption>Until Dawn's remake</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4554695-untildawnremake.jpg"></figure><p>But the remake was not received well. It featured a myriad of performance issues, minimal improvements over the PS4 original, and felt unnecessary overall, when the original still holds up to this day.</p><p>Until Dawn's legacy would come full circle in 2025, when Sony released a film adaptation of the game. There was speculation when the film was announced about how exactly the movie would adapt the game, since a prime part of Until Dawn's storytelling was the possibility for narrative branching based on the player's decisions and their success or failure in gameplay at key moments. Would the film adapt a "canon" version of the game's story? Would it reuse the same actors? Would it be a secret project connecting to the recently released remake?</p><p>The answer, it turned out, was none of the above. Instead, the movie Until Dawn tells a wholly original story that pays tribute to video games in numerous respects. The film tells the story of Clover (Ella Rubin) and her friends travelling to a mysterious cabin in search of her missing sister. While there, they encounter numerous threats, and every time the characters are killed, the day resets, trapping them in a time loop.</p><p>Facing a new threat every night, the group realizes the only way to break the loop is to survive until dawn. While the film features some tributes to the original game (and even features Stormare reprising his role), it ultimately ends up a mishmash of ideas and cliches that fail to capture the experience of the game.</p><p>That is perhaps what's most fascinating about the legacy of Until Dawn: It's a video game inspired by horror films that spawned a horror film inspired by video games. What started off as a PlayStation Move game took on a whole new life and cemented its legacy not only in video games but the horror genre in general.</p><p>While numerous attempts have been made to recapture the magic of the original game, none have reached the high levels of sincerity, rich storytelling, and gameplay that Until Dawn delivered. A decade later, Until Dawn remains one of the definitive horror gaming experiences.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/">Pokemon Go</a> developer Niantic has announced some big changes to the mobile game, as starting in October, progression is being completely overhauled. Not only is the level cap being raised substantially from 50 to 80, but players can also expect several other changes geared toward making progression feel more meaningful with new rewards and cosmetics.</p><p>The update will go live on October 15, and existing players will have their levels determined based on their total earned XP to date. <a href="http://pokemongo.com/en/post/pgo-leveling-update-announce-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Niantic says</a> no player will go down a level and there'll also be a limited-time update with XP bonuses and a Timed Research event. Here's a breakdown of all the changes:</p><ul><li>Level cap increases from 50 to 80</li><li>Tasks for Level-Up Research for levels 41 to 50 will be removed</li><li>New Level-Up Research tasks will be added to levels 71 to 80</li><li>Players at level 70 and higher will have an increased chance of becoming Lucky Friends with other players</li><li>New rewards will be added to level-up progression, like increased storage capacity for Pokemon, items, and gifts.</li><li>New avatar items can be earned starting at level 25</li></ul><p>Players who experience a jump up in level will receive rewards associated with reaching those levels at that time, and Niantic will share details on these at a later date. Before the update goes live, players can also earn new cosmetics by reaching levels 40 through 50. The items include a Level 50 Jacket and an all-new avatar pose, and these will not be available once the leveling overhaul is implemented. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4555893-poke-go-prizes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555893" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4555893-poke-go-prizes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555893"></a><figcaption>You only have until October 14 to get these Pokemon Go prizes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4555893-poke-go-prizes.jpg"></figure><p>From now until October 14, several bonuses will be available to help players level up more quickly in Pokemon Go. These include:</p><ul><li>2 × Catch XP from Nice, Great, and Excellent throws</li><li>+3,000 XP from winning raids</li><li>+3,000 XP from winning Max Battles</li></ul><p>Time Research quests that can net up to 7 million additional XP. Additionally, an existing level 47 Level-Up Research task will be changed so it's easier to complete; rather than exploring 25km eight times in a week, the task only asks you to do so twice.</p><p>In case you missed it, the final month of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-events-raid-bosses-spotlight-hours-community-day/1100-6533384/">Pokemon Go's Delightful Days season is almost over</a>. The event has seen several debuts this month like Gigantamax Butterfree and Shadow Kyogre, and a few days remain to take part in the Dynamax Chansey raid.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Nintendo hosting a Nintendo Direct in September would not be surprising at all given Nintendo historically hosts Direct events in September. Regarding the potential September 12 date, that timing is conspicuous given it is one day before the 40th anniversary of the release of 1985's original Super Mario Bros.</p><p>As for what Nintendo may have to show or discuss at a potential Nintendo Direct in September, people are speculating that the company may finally reveal the release date for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. The game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-is-still-scheduled-to-launch-within-the-next-150-days/1100-6533663/" data-ref-id="1100-6533663">confirmed for release in 2025</a> but doesn't have a specific date on the calendar yet.</p><p>It is one of the Switch 2's big games coming in 2025, alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> on October 15. Many have been expecting Nintendo to share more information about the inevitable next 3D Mario game, but as of yet, there is nothing to suggest an announcement will come in September.</p><p>A Nintendo Direct in September could help Nintendo set the stage for the all-important holiday shopping season and help give people further reason to buy a Switch 2. While the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/" data-ref-id="1100-6532341">Switch 2 got off to a hot start upon launch in June</a>, experts said early sales were always going to be strong due to pent-up demand and how the enthusiast crowd is not as price-sensitive. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-price-was-not-an-issue-at-launch-but-next-test-is-this-holiday-analyst-says/1100-6533403/" data-ref-id="1100-6533403">"next test" for the Switch 2</a>, some have said, will be how the console performs during the holidays with the mass-market consumer.</p><p>The latest Nintendo Direct took place on August 19 and it was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/kirby-air-riders-16-things-we-just-learned-about-the-switch-2-racing-game/2900-6889/" data-ref-id="2900-6889">beefy broadcast focused exclusively on Kirby: Air Riders.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-price-hikes-announced-for-the-us-every-system-going-up-by-50/1100-6534127/" data-ref-id="1100-6534127">Microsoft and Sony have raised console prices this year</a> due in part to US President Donald Trump's tariffs, but Nintendo is keeping the Switch 2 at $450 or $500 for the Mario Kart World bundle. However, one industry expert said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-could-get-more-expensive-in-2026-analyst-predicts/1100-6534130/" data-ref-id="1100-6534130">Nintendo could raise the price of the Switch 2 in 2026.</a> Nintendo itself, meanwhile, has said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-increasing-price-of-switch-and-other-devices-in-the-us/1100-6533633/" data-ref-id="1100-6533633">cannot rule out a price hike for the Switch 2.</a></p><p>Nintendo has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-increasing-price-of-switch-and-other-devices-in-the-us/1100-6533633/" data-ref-id="1100-6533633">raised prices on the original Switch and some Switch 2 accessories</a> due to market factors.</p>

<p>Other than the Switch 2 reveal trailer and a follow-up at the Partner Showcase in July, we know little else about the game, so hopefully we'll get some news next month.</p>
<p>Nintendo doesn't usually attend the Tokyo-based showcase, so this might be the only Nintendo-published game at the event. We'll see!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-go-level-cap-80-october</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-go-level-cap-to-increase-to-80-in-october.1279752/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Niantic and The Pokemon Company have announced that later this year, the level cap for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>will be increased, which the developer says will lead to a "more fun and engaging" leveling experience.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://pokemongo.com/en/post/pgo-leveling-update-announce-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Niantic says that on October 15th, the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>level cap will increase from 50 to 80, which, according to Niantic, will lead to players "celebrating leveling milestones with new rewards, new cosmetics, and more".</p>

<p>According to Niantic, the new level cap means that some players "can expect to jump in level based on their total earned XP", but that nobody's level will decrease. As such, when the update arrives, if you suddenly find yourself at a higher level, that's why.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-go-level-cap-increasing-art.jpg?itok=eXrT9rau 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-go-level-cap-increasing-art.jpg?itok=GX_FWCQL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Go</em>'s level cap will be increasing in October.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only is the level cap itself increasing, but leveling between 1 and 80 will be rebalanced, according to Niantic. Naturally, Level-Up Research tasks for levels 41 through 50 will be replaced with tasks from levels 71 through 80.</p>

<p>You can also expect other goodies like a boosted chance of becoming Lucky Friends with other players when you hit level 70, as well as new rewards for progression, including increased storage capacity and new avatar items.</p>

<p>By the time October 14th (the day before the update is set to hit) arrives, you'll get a "special medal" commemorating the highest level you've achieved in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em>, and if you hit 50, you'll get a special jacket and avatar pose.</p>

<p>Between now and October 15th, you'll get double catch XP from Nice, Great, and Excellent throws, and you'll get an extra 3,000 XP for winning raids and Max Battles. Timed Research will also become available to those level 7 or over, giving you the chance to "earn over 7 million XP", Niantic says.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-go-level-cap-increasing-bonuses.jpg?itok=piSccBxn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-go-level-cap-increasing-bonuses.jpg?itok=AjXSrQJ5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you play&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>between now and October 15th, you'll get bonuses galore.</figcaption></figure><p>News of the level cap follows the announcement of a new season in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em>, with various new 'mons set to debut from September 2nd, including Mega Metagross, Keldeo, and more.</p>

<p>All of this follows the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/niantic-scopely-sale-games" rel="nofollow">sale of Niantic to the Saudi-backed firm Scopely</a> back in February, a move that Scopely was quick to reassure fans would not affect the day-to-day operations of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em><em>.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-september-switch-2-mario-metroid-prime-4-date-2000619997</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-next-switch-2-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-coming-soon-and-will-probably-be-a-big-one.1279749/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Switch 2 <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748">has been out in the wild for several months now</a>, but we still know very little about what Nintendo has planned for its future. Could that be about to change? The next Nintendo Direct is reportedly planned for mid-September and seems poised to offer way more than just a deep dive into the company’s holiday lineup.</p> <p>While there’s a big Nintendo Direct almost every September, the company’s post-Switch 2 launch marketing has been all over the place. <a href="https://x.com/TheSwitchForce/status/1959828809559249019">A new rumor from SwitchForce</a>, however, claims a Nintendo Direct is planned for September 12. That’s a Friday, which would be a bizarre time for a Nintendo showcase. Perhaps that’s the Japan date, which would put the showcase during the late afternoon on Thursday, a much more believable time for a livestream. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-planned-for-mid-september/"><em>VGC</em> corroborated the broader claim</a> that Nintendo is holding a mid-September Direct, but was unable to specify the date. It’s possible Nintendo’s plans could still change.</p> <p>It’s worth noting that the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> for the NES arrived on September 13, 1985, making next month the franchise’s 40th anniversary. That would make a Nintendo Direct the perfect time to announce a new Mario-themed Switch 2, Switch Online multiplayer spin-off, the return of <em>Super Mario 3D All-Star</em>s, or something more. I’m hoping for an HD remake of <em>Super Mario Galaxy 2</em>.</p>

 <h2>Where is the Switch 2’s new 3D <em>Mario</em>?</h2> <p>Fans are also still waiting on a release date for <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-red-samus-trailer-date-switch-2-1851772697"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a>, which Nintendo continues to affirm will come out in 2025. With <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-horror-trailer-creepy-2000619530"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> coming in October and <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> in Novembe</a>r, December is looking like the only option at this point, unless the company can sneak out its new sci-fi shooter earlier than expected. There are still some Switch 1 games ripe for Switch 2 updates like <em><a href="https://x.com/MONOLITHSOFT/status/1959813021230149807">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a></em>.</p> <p>As for what lies beyond this year, there are already some previously announced exclusives, like<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-duskbloods-elden-ring-hidetaka-miyazaki-switch-2-1851774753"><em> The Duskbloods</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-splatoon-3-raiders-upgrade-price-maps-1851784179"><em>Splatoon Raiders,</em></a> waiting in the wings. But Nintendo has yet to tease new arrivals in some of its biggest franchises, like <em>Animal Crossing</em>,<em> Super Smash Bros.,</em> and<em> The Legend of Zelda</em>. And then there’s Mario. Reports that the <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> team is a splinter group from the original <em>Mario Odyssey</em> team suggest the plumber’s next big platforming adventure could be just around the corner. Would Nintendo really let the Switch 2 go its whole inaugural year without a new <em>Mario</em> game?</p> <p>The company has seemingly spent the last few years of the Switch 1’s lifecycle saving up big releases for its new hardware. Maybe it’ll finally pull back the curtain on what some of them are next month.</p>

<figure><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158180/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Sometimes the lines between remaster and remake can be blurred. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> seems much more like a full remake, and a few games called remakes don’t quite live up to expectations. For <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> - based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/harvest_moon_ds_grand_bazaar">Harvest Moon DS: Grand Bazaar</a> - even the term remake doesn’t quite seem to do it justice. This feels more like a fresh new entry in the <strong>Story of Seasons</strong> franchise that picks up the best elements of the DS title to deliver a spectacular farming sim that gleefully digs its own path.</p>
<p>Grand Bazaar casts you as a fledgling farmer in Zephyr Town, a gorgeous little place with a friendly cast of characters waiting to become your friends, or if you play your cards right, your spouse. While you may be familiar with the regular farming mechanics in this series, Grand Bazaar’s titular mechanic - the bazaar - adds an engaging twist to proceedings that kept me up for hours.</p>
<figure><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158184/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Every Saturday you take your best produce or crafted items to the bazaar and peddle off as much as you can, granting you the ability to earn a little more cash than the regular way of selling, but also the chance to level up your bazaar. Doing so brings other vendors to Zephyr Town along with more options as new shopkeepers allow you to spend your hard-earned money on new gameplay elements, expansions for your barn, farm, or pockets, and other neat additions.</p>
<p>Much like the addictive push and pull of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a>’s shop mechanics, Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar effectively balances its addictive farming gameplay with the bazaar-building side of things to keep you hooked. Ringing your little bell draws customers over, and occasionally they will flash up with an item they want; if you quickly place the requested item on your stall, they'll rush over. Plus, you can use the new Nature Sprites (more on those later) to cheer for you, which unlocks helpful bonuses and put a big stupid grin on my face every time I set off this fanfare.</p>
<figure><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158179/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Actually navigating your bazaar is a touch annoying, as you use full 3D movement to approach your stalls. I would have preferred to just press left and right to move, which would make the process much quicker. But, for me at least, the addictive loop of farming and selling at the bazaar meant often I played the game until I fell asleep holding my Switch 2 in bed. While I’ve never played the DS original, I have played other <strong>Harvest Moon</strong> / <strong>Story of Seasons</strong> games, and with the upgrades on Switch 2, Grand Bazaar might nestle into the very best of the series.</p>
<p>Now onto the other side of things, the farming. Much of this is what you expect, especially if you’re a genre aficionado. Grab some seeds, use a hoe to till some soil, scatter the aforementioned seeds, then keep them watered and fertilised to see the fruits of your labour. You eventually get a barn and get to look after some animals, and keeping them fed and happy rewards you with produce like eggs, milk, and even wool.</p>
<p>One thing that gets my goat with farming games is when the farming feels like busy work, and occasionally Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar nudges that feeling. Thankfully, better farming tools are steadily introduced which improve your ability to till crops and slowly allow you to make more crops and earn more cash. However, you'll also have to contend with your stamina, much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a>.</p>
<figure><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158182/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here, managing stamina is particularly painful. Smashing rocks or watering multiple tiles of soil sees your stamina plummet, and while you can eat food or take a bath to replenish this, you essentially have the energy of an 80-year-old after a marathon. Importantly, you can find ways to permanently increase your stamina, but for the first 40-50 hours of the game at least, these opportunities are very sparse.</p>
<p>One of the key changes in Grand Bazaar is the movement. You can double jump, just like the original, but you now also have a glider, which you can use to take advantage of the wind to sail across Zephyr Town easy-breezy. Between the ability to farm multiple tiles at once, the immensely satisfying platforming, and the small but richly-packed Zephyr Town, it's so fun to scurry around and do your chores. You can even hop across rooftops and, on very windy days, you can use the extra height to glide to hidden areas and smash some rare rocks or find other foragable items. Just watch out for hurricanes, where you’ll have to use the new windscreens to keep the blustery menace from ruining your crops.</p>
<figure><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158185/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Another new mechanic comes in the form of those aforementioned Nature Sprites, adorable little creatures dotted around the map. Hand them your foragables like fish, mushrooms, and more, and they will increase the overall quality of these. However, the vast variety of items and different possible qualities means your inventory fills up much quicker than you’d like. Make sure to invest in storage or pocket space immediately. Thankfully you can quickly place boxes around town and in the many windmills - where you can craft better and more complicated delights - so you don’t have to lug everything around.</p>
<p>Fishing, unfortunately, is easily the weakest part of the game, which is a shame as I normally love catching fish. The actual gameplay is fine — you press certain buttons to reel in your fish — but it is painfully slow, especially with bigger fish. Compared to catching bugs, which you pick up immediately, or the fact you can just instantly smash rocks, I rarely wanted to spend my precious moments reeling in fish, so this part of the game stayed largely forgotten for me.</p>
<p>However, one part I really love is cooking. You earn recipes by eating food from the local restaurant, unlocking the item once you’ve gulped it down for the first time. Cook with your crops and animal produce to make dishes that not only top up your stamina, but also grant buffs like increased running speed or temporary stamina increases. It’s all instant, and you can make multiple of the same recipe at once provided you have the materials. I’ve been eagerly anticipating the occasional Cook-Offs, one of the many seasonal events that give you a chance to show off your wares, or earn some trophies for your house.</p>
<figure><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158183/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There’s a lot of smart choices in Grand Bazaar which help to make the most of your time and keep you engaged. A request system helps you unlock new bazaar vendors, and these often test your abilities. You can ring a bell to say hello to folks as you run around, allowing you to build friendship points easily. And when it comes to bazaar time, you can choose different pieces of decor to help keep food fresh or sell more items in bulk.</p>
<p>Marvelous has really taken a lot of time to perfect the gameplay loop of Grand Bazaar, and that polish has also spilled out into the characters and the visuals. When greeting your townsfolk, you’ll now be met with fully voice-acted dialogue, adding charm and personality to every interaction. The voiceover work here is lovely, and makes it <em>much</em> harder to choose who you want to marry. You aren’t restricted by gender option either, so there’s plenty of bachelors or bachelorettes to pick from, and that’s before mentioning some of the new characters added to this remake. If you must know, I’m hoping to settle down with June if I can impress her with enough tea.</p>

<p>While the Harvest Moon series is well known for its adorable chibi style, here everyone has been given more human-like proportions. It works with the gorgeous visuals to make Zephyr Town feel a touch more realistic and homely. The visuals on Switch 2 are crisp and colourful, with a rock-solid frame rate. Trees blow with the wind and the water ripples with a gorgeous detail. It might not be the most demanding game on the Switch 2, but it might be the best-looking Story of Seasons entry, even if the occasional texture can look very pixelated up close.</p>
<p>After about 50 hours with the game, I do have a few other small nitpicks. While it’s nice to be able to organise your items by quality or freshness, it’s annoying you can’t quickly sort by sale price. One other niggle is the implementation of HD Rumble. I might be spoiled by the clip-clop of the horse in Stardew Valley, but here it’s just a flat ‘BZZZTT’ whenever you hit anything. It’s annoyingly sharp and loud, especially in handheld.</p>
<p>Overall, though, Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar is a fantastic reinvention filled with smart choices and heartfelt polish. I’ve had a blast doting over my farm animals, training up my dog so he can better corral my flocks, and spending time getting ready for the bazaar. Then, when Saturday hits, I open up my shop and enjoy the flurry of purchases, before spending my money on some much-needed new abilities, changes to the town, or some of the many customisation features. Even if they do demand quite a lot of wool and dye from you.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you’re in the mood for an engaging, endearing, and cute farming game, Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar should tickle your pickle with aplomb. It might not have the depth of other farming sims, but it's fantastic to control, and the well-written (and voiced) characters alongside the many tasks and calendar packed with events to occupy your time, make you feel like part of a bustling little community.</p>
<p>I fell in love with Zephyr Town, and thanks to the satisfying gameplay and intricately connected web of rewards, I can't see myself putting it down any time soon.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At The Game Awards 2025, Saber Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/turok-origins-is-an-upcoming-co-op-game-by-saber/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> Turok: Origins, a sort of reboot of the classic sci-fi shooter franchise. </p>



<p>As some old-school gamers may already know, Turok was originally a comic book character who appeared as a master Native American tracker, survivalist, and hunter in late 1954 in comics published by Dell Comics. Later, he would also appear in comics published by Valiant Comics, Dark Horse Comics, and Dynamite Comics, but his fame mainly came from the successful video game series created by Acclaim in 1997. Five years later, just before the launch of Turok: Evolution, Acclaim could boast that the franchise had already generated over $250 million in sales revenue.</p>



<p>However, the IP's luck didn't last much longer. Following the release of Evolution, there was only one more installment, the 2008 game developed by a studio called Propaganda Games. While not well-received by critics, the game sold more than one million copies in its first two months on the market, prompting the Vancouver-based studio to start working on a sequel. Propaganda was owned by Disney Interactive Studios, though, which decided to shut down the studio (and the new Turok title) in 2011 after Tron: Evolution also disappointed.</p>



<p>Around seventeen years later, Saber Interactive is hoping to reignite the interest of long-time fans in the series. They are, after all, quite experienced in the feat following the successful revival of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine, not to mention the upcoming Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake.</p>



<p>During a Gamescom 2025 presentation, we learned that most of Saber Madrid, a studio composed of around 250 employees, has been working on Turok: Origins for nearly five years now. The game will feature a story campaign of around fifteen hours, and the narrative will somehow connect to that first game installment from 1997.</p>



<p>The story sees the legendary warriors dealing not only with the usual dinosaurs but also with an alien threat, the so-called Xenia civilization, that seeks to eradicate all human life from the galaxy. The Turok and humankind as a whole are losing the war, so they embark on an interplanetary quest to find a superpower capable of turning the tide of the conflict. Yes, that means there will be various planets to visit in the final game; Ancient temples, wasteland canyons, and dense jungles are just a few examples of the places you'll find in Turok: Origins. </p>



<p>Following the brief presentation, we tried a demo of the game itself. The game supports three-player online cooperative action, so it's no wonder that there are three playable characters with their own weapons and perks and Ultimate abilities. During game sessions, players can also extract Echoes from fallen foes and the environment to unlock powers in real-time.</p>



<p>Other than that, Turok: Origins plays like pretty standard shooter fare. The maps are fairly linear and don't allow that much exploration, so you'll just be mowing down enemies while heading toward the next control point. When you have injured a foe enough, you can swoop into melee range to trigger a cool-looking execution move. The demo required using the grappling hook occasionally, but it was only available at predefined points, rather than giving players free rein on where to go.</p>



<p>One thing that long-time franchise fans will be happy to learn is that the developers have added the option to switch in real-time (by long-pressing the d-pad) between first and third-person view. The game had been announced as a third-person title, but Turok games have always been played in first-person view, and now you have that option available.</p>



<p>The highlight of the demo was the boss fight with a giant Tryceratops-like creature, which not only charged us but could also teleport and had a lightning attack. Indeed, Saber had previously said that the Xenia aliens control some of the dinosaurs with their technology and have empowered them with it.</p>



<p>Turok: Origins doesn't have a release window yet, but it looked fairly polished based on the Gamescom 2025 demo. Whether its structure and content will be enough to draw players remains to be seen once the final version becomes available. Meanwhile, we can confirm that the game will run at 60 frames per second on consoles (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-cant-run-turok-origins-60-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">except for the Xbox Series S version</a>). </p>

            <title><![CDATA[EA will Announce the Early Access Release Date for Skate Tomorrow]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-skate-early-access-release-date-cover-art-reveal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-will-announce-the-early-access-release-date-for-skate-tomorrow.1279731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next entry in EA's Skate series will have its cover art revealed tomorrow, but more importantly, the early access release date for Skate is due to be announced in a new trailer premiering tomorrow, August 26, 2025, at 9am PT / 12pm ET / 5pm BST.</p>



<p>EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-launches-into-early-access-in-summer-2025-major-playtest-update-coming-july-2/">announced this past June</a> that Skate would launch in early access sometime this summer. Well, at the time of this writing, summer is nearly over, so if that's still the case, then we might see Skate get shadow-dropped tomorrow. Or, it'll be out in the coming weeks. Either way, Skate has been in closed playtesting for months at this point, and considering that it'll be an early access release, it feels like EA could decide to launch it at any point.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="skate. | Early Access Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p14MSdRtNIo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Which, admittedly, feels odd considering the amount of excitement there was around the return of the series when EA and Full Circle <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-4-new-studio-full-ciricle-staffing-up/">first announced it.</a> Back in 2021, when Full Circle was just starting up for the purposes of making this new Skate game, you never would have guessed that the hype around a Skate 4 would wane as much as it has, or that EA might just drop the game without much of a marketing lead-up.</p>



<p>In fairness, that was before we knew that this new iteration of Skate would be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-free-to-play-live-service-full-crossplay-2/">full live service-focused game</a>, and that it would require <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-always-on-online-multiplayer-activities-some-without-skateboards/">players to always be online</a>. Neither fact has helped ingratiate players to this new version, and it'll be interesting to see how the early access release fares once it is in public hands and no longer just for playtesters with access to a closed beta.</p>



<p>After years of waiting, tomorrow, Skate fans will finally have a date to look forward to for a new Skate game.</p>
