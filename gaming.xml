			<p>The first Dying Light 2 DLC, Bloody Ties, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-bloody-ties-release-date-story-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in October 2022. Originally, Techland had promised two story DLCs included with the Ultimate Edition, and the second DLC was supposed to be far larger than Bloody Ties.</p>
<p>It turns out it became so large that it's now its own standalone game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Beast</a>. The upside is that the aforementioned owners of Dying Light 2 Ultimate Edition will get it for free once it is released. What about the future of Dying Light 2, though? Here's what Franchise Director Tymon Smektala told me at Gamescom 2024.</p>
<p><em>We have promised five years of support for the game. There will be more updates coming to Dying Light 2 this year and in the next years. That's all I can say; we don't want to reveal too much right now because the message that we have right now is that Dying Light: The Beast is a new zombie adventure set in the world of Dying Light. Kyle Crane is back and we have a great game on our hands. We'll focus on this for a moment, and then we'll get back to Dying Light 2 quite soon.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Right now, we are not planning a narrative DLC for Dying Light 2, but the game will be supported and you can expect more content coming to it over the next years.</em></p>
<p>The last major content update for the game was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-tower-raid-open-beta-is-out-now-introducing-a-brand-new-co-op-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tower Raid Open Beta</a>. If Techland doesn't produce any more major story DLCs, the Polish studio may focus more on cooperative multiplayer content in the game's future.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the studio is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-techland-fantasy-game-new-concept-art-climbing-huge-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working</a> on an open world fantasy RPG based on a brand new IP. However, we haven't really heard any updates on this project in a year and a half.</p>

<p>Sony may have accidently leaked some of the games being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-september-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shown during Tuesday’s</a> State of Play via the PlayStation Store. </p>



<p>Multiple <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/some-of-the-state-of-play-24-09-2024-games-leaked-by-playstation-store.374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people have seen a collection</a> on the PlayStation Store titled “State of Play” with a list of a number of games that could be appearing at some point during the show.</p>



<p>According to the collection, the following games could be part of the event in some way:</p>



<ul>
<li>Astro Bot</li>



<li>The Last of Us Part 1</li>



<li>Stellar Blade</li>



<li>Horizon Zero Dawn</li>



<li>LEGO Horizon</li>



<li>TMNT Shredders Revenge</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li>



<li>Metro Awakening VR</li>



<li>Dynasty Warriors Origins</li>



<li>Fantasian Neo Dimension</li>



<li>Fear the Spotlight</li>



<li>Dragon Age The Veilguard</li>



<li>Sonic x Shadow Generations</li>



<li>Alan Wake 2</li>



<li>Hell is Us</li>
</ul>



<p>Obviously, until the event actually airs it’s hard to no for sure exactly what will be appearing. There are also rumors of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-circulate-that-days-gone-is-getting-ps5-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Days Gone Remaster</a> being announced in the near future, possibly during the show. </p>



<p>The full event will feature over 20 games shown over a 30+ minute show. Based on the list of games above, even if it’s 100% accurate, there are still at least five games not shown via the store. As far as what’s on the list, one would assume that it could range from DLC announcements to release date reveals.</p>

                <p>Jason Rohrer is known for <a href="https://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/jason-rohrer/" rel="nofollow ">creating video games with some pretty off-the-wall concepts</a>, but his latest venture--a battle royale known as Project Skydrop--takes things a step further. Rohrer teamed up with friend and musician Tom Bailey to create the game, and unlike most battle royales, Rohrer's new adventure won't see players fighting to the death. There is a catch, however: Project Skydrop takes place in real life, and the winner will receive a custom-made solid gold trophy.</p><p dir="ltr">Rohrer says he's been working on Project Skydrop since 2021, and after years of planning, plotting, and acquiring a sufficiently impressive reward for the winner, the game is now afoot. The treasure--a 10.9-ounce 24-karat solid-gold trophy worth roughly $26,000--was commissioned and paid for by Rohrer himself, but according to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/project-skydrop-jason-rohrer-treasure-hunt-begins/" rel="nofollow ">a profile by Wired</a>, the winner may also receive a "life-changing amount of bitcoin," with the exact number dependent upon how many players take part in the hunt.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY53B3Y8gc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EKY53B3Y8gc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The game only lasts for 21 days, and at the time of writing, there are 16 days left for players to track down the prize. Rohrer has revealed that the trophy is located "somewhere in the northeastern United States," and at this point, Project Skydrop might sound like a simple (albeit extremely lucrative) treasure hunt. So what exactly makes it a battle royale?</p><p dir="ltr">Rohrer says <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> inspired him to put the treasure somewhere inside an ever-shrinking circle. The circle was 500 miles wide the day the hunt began, and has been shrinking each day since. Every day, the circle grows smaller, and a map on <a href="https://projectskydrop.com/" rel="nofollow ">the game's official website</a> is updated to show players the size and location of that day's circle.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, each day of circle-shrinking is accompanied by a new photo of the 24 karat trophy. The photos started out as close-up shots of the prize's hiding place, but as the circle shrinks, the photos of the trophy zoom farther and farther out, giving players a more detailed view of the surrounding area each day. Based on the circle's current position, the prize is hidden somewhere in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, or Vermont.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time Rohrer has sent players on a wild goose chase in exchange for some premium loot. In Fall 2021, Rohrer created Project Skydrop's precursor. With the help of his kids, Rohrer hid a chest containing $3,000 worth of silver coins in a state park near his home in Dover, Delaware. Then he slipped some clues about its location into his (computer) game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/595690/One_Hour_One_Life/" rel="nofollow ">One Hour One Life</a>. Rohrer feared the clues--which were hidden in a poem that was programmed to disappear from the game after just one day--were too cryptic, and would ultimately prove too difficult for players to solve.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4371917-skydrop%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4371917" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4371917-skydrop%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4371917"></a><figcaption>The game's one-of-a-kind prize is hidden somewhere in the northeastern US.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4371917-skydrop%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Eight hours later, One Hour One Life players had decoded the poem and were headed to the chest's location. Rohrer was amazed--and slightly frustrated--by the speed with which players had solved the puzzle. After the Dover chest's rapid discovery, Rohrer began working to create the "perfect" treasure hunt: one that "doesn’t last 10 years and doesn’t last one day." Thus, Project Skydrop was born.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the game's 21-day run time, Rohrer told Wired it's all about the spectacle.</p><p dir="ltr">"Three weeks is a pretty good timeline for a dramatic arc," he said of Project Skydrop's lifespan. "It seems long enough for people to feel like they have a chance, but not so long that everyone loses interest."</p><p>For more information on Rohrer's wild battle royale (including the latest updates on the shrinking circle's location) see <a href="https://projectskydrop.com/" rel="nofollow ">the official Project Skydrop website</a>, where Rohrer has set up a live video stream of the trophy to ensure the game's dramatic end is caught on camera.</p>

            <p>
Satirical Doom WAD Thatcher's Techbase has returned to Bethesda's official mod browser - now shorn of Maggie and anything else that might conceivably be deemed offensive - after initially being booted for daring to dabble in "real-world politics".
</p>
<p>
Thatcher's Techbase - which sees players descending to the Tenth Circle of Hell in order to thwart the return of "one of humanity's greatest threats" - has been around for a while, originally launching in 2021. However, when Bethesda's official community published mod support arrived for Doom in August, developer Jim Purvis opted to take advantage of it, giving console owners the chance to play the WAD for the first time.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, it wasn't long before Bethesda <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-yanks-thatchers-techbase-doom-mod-from-in-game-browser">stepped in</a>, yanking Thatcher's Techbase from its browser after telling Purvis the mod had been reported for "real-world politics". Purvis was also instructed to "educate" himself on modding guidelines and community rules.
</p>

<p>
And with his education now complete, Purvis has restored the mod to Bethesda's browser in a new, passive-aggressively inoffensive form. "To celebrate its 3rd birthday," he <a href="https://x.com/letshugbro/status/1838551302017540397">wrote on social media</a>, "I am rereleasing Thatcher's Techbase for Doom 1 &amp; 2! However, in light of the recent Educational Notice received from Bethesda, all real-world politics have now been removed."
</p>
<p>
"The team here at 3D: Doom Daddy Digital has worked tirelessly to remove all references to real-world politics from Thatcher's Techbase," Purvis continued, "and create a Doom WAD that can be enjoyed by all gamers, regardless of political persuasion."
</p>
<p>
To that end, the mod, in a blaze of malicious compliance, is now known as ███████'█ Techbase, while its accompanying logo has been altered with the absolute bare-minimum of effort, its "Thatcher's" bit half-heartedly doused in a splotch of red digital paint. In-game, meanwhile, changes include tweaks to signage, with one picture of Maggie now obscured by a jolly smiling face, its caption altered from "PURE EVIL" to "PURE NICE" (the 'nice', incidentally, has been rendered in jaunty Comic Sans, immediately making this whole enterprise infinitely more offensive than the original).
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, a whole bunch of fliers have been  replaced, with one notably changed from "No pit closures" to "No politics, no religion, no drama". And perhaps best of all, an area designed to resemble the House of Commons has been gracefully robbed of its capacity to offend by removing every single one of its textures.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The team here at 3D: Doom Daddy Digital has worked tirelessly to remove all references to real-world politics from THATCHER'S TECHBASE and create a DOOM wad that can be enjoyed by all gamers, regardless of political persuasion.</p><p>Take a look at the screenshots below! <a href="https://t.co/XozWz7G9eg">pic.twitter.com/XozWz7G9eg</a></p></div>— Jim (@letshugbro) <a href="https://twitter.com/letshugbro/status/1838551460142862759?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>
But that isn't quite everything. Composer Barry "Epoch" Topping (of Paradise Killer fame, among other things) has also reworked the soundtrack for ███████'█ Techbase "to ensure no politically-motivated rhythms can be heard by players". Now, as you're descending into hell to confront whoever the milk snatcher has been replaced with, you can enjoy a <a href="https://x.com/letshugbro/status/1838552884775907338">more uplifting version</a> of the soundtrack, played in a major rather than minor key.
</p>
<p>
███████'█ Techbase is available to download right now via Bethesda's official Doom mod browser, but if you really must sully yourself with all that "politics", the original version <a href="https://t.co/y3abUSFRBF">remains available</a> to play on PC players through the usual, non-Bethesda channels.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-pulls-out-of-tokyo-game-show-cancels-press-previews-of-assassins-creed-shadows/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, a dev diary showcasing Assassin's Creed Shadows went<a href="https://wccftech.com/new-assassins-creed-shadows-dev-diary-featuring-gameplay-leaks-online/"> live on the IGN China website</a>. Since then, <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1838504341289783532" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft has announced</a> that they are canceling their appearance at the Tokyo Game Show, which was due to take place from September 26 to September 29. In addition, Ubisoft has also canceled press previews of Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>
<p>The Assassin's Creed Shadows press previews were reportedly due to take place next week, with the embargo date being released during that time. However, they have since been canceled. It's not been confirmed as to why the press previews have been canceled, but it's a safe guess that it has something to do with the various leaks of Assassin's Creed Shadows appearing online, and the huge controversy that has gone along with them.</p>
<p>Regarding their appearance at the Tokyo Game Show, they've cited their reason as "various circumstances," which is a very broad and vague response as to why they are no longer showcasing at the exhibition. In addition to their appearance as an exhibitor at the Tokyo Game Show, they've also canceled the stream that was scheduled for September 26. Again, the reasons haven't been stated, but it's possible that it's due to the significant amount of criticism Assassin's Creed Shadows has been facing, with complaints citing that the game is an inaccurate representation of Japanese history and culture.</p>
<p>While the game is still expected to have a preview event at the end of September, it's unsure as to whether there will be any event showcasing the game at all this month. Ubisoft has had a rocky year financially, with their <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-drop-another-7-shareholders-concerned/">share prices dropping significantly</a> and their revenue taking a huge hit with games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-funnels-more-money-into-star-wars-outlaws-marketing-than-any-other-game/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and XDefiant not quite performing the way they were hoping.</p>
<p>Additionally, their shareholders are pushing for them to restructure the company, and to hire a new CEO, which, so far, the changes have not happened. Whether they will go ahead remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Although they are no longer doing the live stream showcasing the game, Ubisoft has stated that the ongoing giveaway campaign will continue despite the fact that the broadcast is no longer going ahead.</p>
<p>There is already huge speculation as to whether Assassin's Creed Shadows will be delayed with all of the ongoing controversy and peculiar cancelations, but now it seems even more likely after they pulled out of the biggest Tokyo Game Show to date. Whether it will be severely delayed or it will just be a couple of weeks or months, remains to be seen.</p>

            <p>A week ago, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/among-the-many-beauties-of-arco-is-that-its-a-secret-gentle-introduction-to-bullet-hell-shooting">belabouring the nuances of Arco</a>, I expressed a wish to play more bullet hell games with time freeze mechanics, the better to savour the intricacy of their projectile patterning. Now here's Moon Watch, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>-ish pixelart shooter in which you have a watch that stops time when you stand still. Snug within that frozen instant, you're free to laugh in the gurning faces of the living dead while you idly choose and aim garlic grenades, stake launchers and bouncy ice comets.</p>

<p>At least, until you run out of energy for garlic grenades, stake launchers and bouncy ice comets. In a sadistic reversal of the premise - akin to offering a child a spoonful of pudding, only to swap it for a spoonful of disgusting, nutritious vegetables - energy for weapons must be restored by moving about. So when you're not laughing in the faces of the living dead, you'll be carefully kiting them and dodging their shrapnel, with one eye glued to the energy reservoirs in the bottom left.</p>
<p>Why is Moon Watch "Vampire Survivors-ish", rather than "Vampire Survivors-like"? Well, firstly because many of the abilities have to be manually aimed and fired using the mouse. And secondly, because the game is made up of distinct levels or arenas sprinkled across a roguelitey campaign path. Each arena asks you to hold out for a certain time, rather than being a continuous, upward spiral of enemy waves and unlockables - it's a bit reminiscent of Into The Breach, I guess.</p>
<p>The vampire swarms aside, similarities with Vampire Survivors include a choice of three unlocks when you level up. These are the usual mix of passive buffs and new weapons for your hand. You can get turrets, for instance, and throwable zombie bait, and a teleport dash. I'm sure you can figure out some way to combine these things.</p>
<p>What else is there to tell? Well, the starting character is some kind of warrior-nun who looks like the ogreish blonde girl from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUsnJ9jlwns">Hey Arnold!</a>, but doesn't seem nearly as ogreish. When you beat a level she does a victory twirl, even as the remaining zombos mob her position like pigeons spotting a dropped sandwich. I find this charmingly plucky. Also, developers The Jaspel are the same depraved, genre-muddling scientists wot did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/backpack-hero">Backpack Hero</a>.</p>
<p>Find the demo for Moon Watch on <a href="https://thejaspel.itch.io/moonwatch">Itch.io</a> with a full release to follow on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878030/Moon_Watch/">Steam</a> at some point in the tactically deferred future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sega held a Sonic Central stream today, September 24, to give updates on several ongoing projects within the series. If you missed the show, you can watch it below, but if you just want the highlights, we’ve got you covered.<br></p></div></div><div><p>The show started with updates on the Sonic mobile games, including the <em>Fall Guys</em>-esque party game <em>Sonic Rumble </em>(which looks to be in much better shape now than it seemed in its first trailer earlier this year), new characters in <em>Sonic Dash</em> and the mobile version of <em>Sonic Forces</em>, and the announcement that they’re bringing Shadow to <em>Sonic Dream Team</em>. We are in the best timeline.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="622c8555407339416444fe59a8cc8cab" data-recommend-id="image://622c8555407339416444fe59a8cc8cab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="618" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic towers over a Dark Chao." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonic towers over a Dark Chao." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="622c8555407339416444fe59a8cc8cab" data-recommend-id="image://622c8555407339416444fe59a8cc8cab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="618" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic towers over a Dark Chao." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After a montage highlighting the <em>Sonic </em>in-person events over the past year, Sega announced <em>Chao Tales</em>, an eight-episode animated series that will follow Sonic as he visits a Chao garden and takes care of the weird little alien guys.<br></p></div><div><p>Next up, Sega spotlighted several crossover promotions between Sonic and other games. This includes a <em>Roblox</em> event that has you playing as Sonic and fighting Metal Sonic that is available now, new <em>Sonic</em>-themed skins in <em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>, and <em>Sonic</em>-themed cosmetics for <em>Two-Point Museum</em> so you can create a museum that will teach the kids about the history that really matters, like Shadow’s sacrifice against the BioLizard in 2001's <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>.</p></div><div><p>As we pivot from games to merchandise, we get an extended (and pretty funny) bit about the upcoming Sonic Lego packages. This includes sets featuring Shadow, Knuckles, Rouge, Sonic, Tails, and much more. Jakks Pacific is also making a new Shadow toy based on <em>Shadow Generations</em>, complete with weird Sephiroth wings. First 4 Figures also announced it is creating a new statue based on Shadow’s winged appearance in the game. Those are only a few of the many pieces of merchandise shown off during the show.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="900853da7e3d70f4db2a98b711d5bed3" data-recommend-id="image://900853da7e3d70f4db2a98b711d5bed3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1427" data-height="799" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic grinds on a rail." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonic grinds on a rail." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="900853da7e3d70f4db2a98b711d5bed3" data-recommend-id="image://900853da7e3d70f4db2a98b711d5bed3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1427" data-height="799" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic grinds on a rail." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Topgolf, the gamified driving range, is adding a digital golf game based on <em>Sonic</em> in locations around the country. The game features Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy as playable characters who will move through obstacle courses based on your golf swings. It’s “coming soon.”<br></p></div><div><p>After a tease earlier this week, Sega has finally properly announced a Sonic and DC Comics crossover that initially showed Shadow dressed and acting as Batman. This will apparently be a long-term partnership between the two that’s kicking off with a five-part comic series starting in March 2025. The comics will be written by long-time <em>Sonic</em> writer Ian Flynn and feature Knuckles as Superman, Amy as Wonder Woman, Sonic as The Flash, Silver as Green Lantern, and Tails as Cyborg. The collaboration will extend throughout the year with merchandise in the fall, and more crossovers are planned for 2026.</p></div><div><p>Next we had a story trailer for <em>Sonic X Shadow Generations</em>, which put the spotlight on several villains Shadow will have to face again in the new storyline. We had already seen Black Doom from Shadow’s 2005 self-titled game, but we got our first look at Mephiles from <em>Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</em>. It also looks like Shadow will see Maria Robotnik again after her death in his tragic backstory. Or a facscimile of her, at least. <em>Generations</em>’ whole deal is about reliving memories, and so if Shadow is going to retread his past, it only makes sense that he’d see her again when the game launches on October 25.</p></div><div><p>In the lead up to <em>Sonic X Shadow Generations</em>, Sega is rolling out the <em>Dark Beginnings</em> animated mini-series. This three-episode animated series will follow Shadow’s origin story and include appearances by his teammates Rouge the Bat and E-123 Omega. We saw some new footage featuring those characters and the whole thing looks pretty sick. The first episode will be released tomorrow, September 25, with the second and third to follow on October 3 and 10, respectively.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="01b6308cd20316b697e2774dc23893d0" data-recommend-id="image://01b6308cd20316b697e2774dc23893d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1532" data-height="836" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Gerald Robotnik journal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Gerald Robotnik journal." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="01b6308cd20316b697e2774dc23893d0" data-recommend-id="image://01b6308cd20316b697e2774dc23893d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1532" data-height="836" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Gerald Robotnik journal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Because the <em>Sonic </em>team loves a bit, they put together a retro commercial for the Gerald Robotnik journal that will be packaged in day-one physical copies of <em>Sonic X Shadow Generations</em>.

The commercial is tongue-in-cheek, but has some references to Gerald’s descent into madness revealed at the end of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>.

<p>Diving into a video genre—for example, the strategy genre—can be challenging when you have little to no experience. On the surface, it appears easy enough. You click often, control units, or choose which buildings to construct. Simple, right? No, not always. Thankfully, monthly subscriptions like Xbox Game Pass are cost-effective for testing new games you might not usually play. With that said, can you play Frostpunk 2 on Xbox Game Pass?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-frostpunk-2-on-game-pass">Is Frostpunk 2 on Game Pass?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, know that Frostpunk 2 is a rather challenging game. Even on its lowest difficulty setting, you’ll find that the constant, looming threat of freezing cold temperatures and a severe lack of food supplies can bring an untimely end to your colony. It’s now often a slow death, either. It’s fast-paced and unforgiving. Thankfully, you can play Frostpunk 2 on Xbox Game Pass, allowing ample time to test its mechanics and decide whether it’s worth adding to your library in earnest.</p>



<p>Frostpunk 2 launched on Game Pass on day one, alongside its retail release, ensuring everyone could play the game. Despite being on Game Pass, the game has sold hundreds of thousands of units already in its first week, making it a critical success for developer 11 bit studios!</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-play-frostpunk-2">Where to Play Frostpunk 2</h2>



<p>Alongside being available on Xbox Game Pass, you can also play Frostpunk 2 on the following platforms and storefronts:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/frostpunk_2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GOG</a></li>



<li><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/frostpunk-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a></li>



<li><a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10008442/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/frostpunk-2/9pn2k1lqn94d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Store</a></li>
</ul>



<p>You’ll note that Frostpunk 2 is listed as “Announced ” on the PlayStation Store. It’s coming to PS5 at some point, but there’s no official word on precisely when which likely has something to do with the strategy game being made available on Xbox Game Pass on day one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/gamurs-group-has-more-shitty-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gamurs Group, owner of sites like Dot Esports, Destructoid, and Twinfinite, had another <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamurs-group-employees-reportedly-hit-with-more-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">round of layoffs this morning</a>, with several former staffers reporting they were laid off via impersonal emails while they slept. </p><p>A former Gamurs staffer told Aftermath that they woke up today to find their Slack access and work email had been cut off. The email they received informing them they'd been laid off addressed them by first name but included no mention of their position or other inclusion of their name.&nbsp;</p><p>Other former staffers echoed this experience on Twitter. Former Dot Esports and Tech Radar Gaming Editor Vic Hood <a href="https://x.com/hood_vic/status/1838483276064788549" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> on Twitter that she “woke up to an email that I’ve been let go.” Former Twinfinite and Game Skinny Managing Editor Tom Hopkins <a href="https://x.com/tomhopkins9/status/1838489596448928131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> “I have also been made redundant by Gamurs and Twinfinite over a generic email when I woke up this morning.” Former DotEsports employee Isaac McIntyre <a href="https://x.com/isaacmcintyre/status/1838485662498259151" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> their layoffs was “Done by a 5:00pm email (no calls) and instant account-wide logouts, which was frankly disappointing considering my time with the company.”</p><p>This is seemingly par for the course for Gamurs layoffs, with former employee Mike Straw <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1838553591981670451" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeting</a> that "This is exactly how they let me go last year...a boilerplate email that simply read 'Dear Freelancer' despite me being a staffed editor."</p><p>The former Gamurs staffer told Aftermath, “I'm honestly just a little heartbroken. Some really good people were let go today, with no warning, and it's going to just leave more scars on what's left of the sites under Gamurs. I don't know how a company can expect good writers to flourish when the ground beneath them is so shaky.”</p><p>Gamurs as a company seems to have no interest in writers flourishing, with <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-gamurs-group-games-journalism-escapist-dot-esports?giftLink=565a53d46178fcc56baa5645a6273ae9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former and current Gamurs employees</a> telling Aftermath back in March about low pay, chaotic layoffs, and a company flailing after traffic in the face of changing search and social media algorithms. One former writer told us then,</p><blockquote><p>It's hell…Everyone is stressed out. Coworkers are randomly getting cut for 'performance issues' week-to-week across all sites. The articles are all mindless. The only thing that matters is Google and what Google readers want. Creating a balance between work and life? Impossible. Corporate is breathing down everyone's necks to make sure every single writer is doing four articles a day. Gamurs is now a race to the bottom where every site is at risk of becoming an SEO content farm. The days of actually reporting are over. The acquired sites are losing all semblance of meaning and brand.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Before today, Gamurs previously had layoffs in <a href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-group-layoffs-destructoid-pc-invasion-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">July</a>. Meanwhile, despite regularly conducting layoffs, over at the Gamurs Group <a href="https://gamurs.breezy.hr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">career page</a> you can find a host of open roles, with freelance positions paying per piece at abysmal rates that include <a href="https://gamurs.breezy.hr/p/804a21810e09-prima-games-freelance-games-writers-general" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$11-60 USD</a>, <a href="https://gamurs.breezy.hr/p/708956bd1bd6-the-escapist-freelance-ea-fc-writer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$15-75</a>, and <a href="https://gamurs.breezy.hr/p/4331529b541f-destructoid-freelance-weekend-writer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$16-90</a>.</p><p>Everyone involved here--from former Gamurs staffers, to the remaining folks at Gamurs, to people looking for work in games journalism, to people reading the work these sites put out--deserves better than this. We all deserve work <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/gaming-sites-writers-ai-editor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made by humans</a>, for humans to read, and the people who make that work deserve to be paid fairly and treated humanely, including when layoffs happen. </p><p>But that's not the day we're having today! Seeing this happen, time and again, is infuriating and heartbreaking, and my sympathy and rage go out to all affected.</p><p><strong>Update, 12:34pm:</strong> An email from Gamurs CEO Riad Chikhani and Chief Content Officer Kevin Morris, shared with Aftermath, said 30 people have been laid off across Gamurs. The message cites the company "restructuring our operations" and points to changing algorithms, including <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/08/helpful-content-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google's Helpful Content update</a> and <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/introducing-google-discover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Discover</a>, as making "clear that a larger reset and re-adjustment of priorities is necessary to ensure long-term sustainable growth for our business."</p><p>The execs also write that "we will be changing our pay structure for freelance writers to better reflect the value of longer, more in-depth work" and promise future details into what exactly that means.</p><p>They write that "As search has changed, it’s more clear than ever that doing what we love is actually the best path forward: creating great, high quality content about topics our audience cares deeply about." Given that this is the strategy writers at these sites were employing prior to Gamurs' acquisition of many of them, and given Gamurs' relentless pursuit of the exact <em>opposite</em> strategy since, I'm curious to see how this works out. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The new translucent shells come in five colors: green, pink, red, purple, teal, as well as a completely clear one. The controllers have black handles that make the colors pop, and new Chroma D-pads and back paddles that add a nice finishing touch.</p><p>Because the Cipher series is part of the design lab, Xbox owners can mix-and-match their favorite translucent shell with their preferred color scheme for the rest of the buttons and triggers. The Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 starts at $150, which isn’t too bad for one of the best controllers out there, even if it still doesn’t come with all of the bells and whistles like drift-resistant hall-effect joysticks. </p><p>In addition to the new Elite variants, players looking for a cheaper option have something new to choose from as well. The Ghost Cipher Special Edition controller is only $70 and makes the entire body of the controller see-through with white and grey pieces inside and golden accents on the D-pad and triggers. It’s a companion piece to the previously announced Sky Cipher controller which is transparent blue. </p><p>At this point, I’d love to see them do that with the full set of the Elite’s colors, but for the base controllers. Especially that old-school Xbox green. And remember, you don’t need an Xbox Series X/S to make use of the new controllers. They work on PC, android, and iOS as well. Also the Nintendo Switch if you’re willing to jump through some extra hoops. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Each game also comes with a screenplay and explainer “Master” book, and <strong>on Steam and Xbox at least, the mainline <em>MGS </em>games are being sold for $16 apiece</strong>. If you’ve wanted to get into the legendary stealth series, this is as good a deal as any, and it’s a journey well worth taking.</p><p>Should you decide that you want to keep going, some of the later entries in the franchise, especially some spinoffs, are also on sale. <strong><em>Metal Gear Solid 5: The Definitive Experience</em>, which bundles both the prologue <em>Ground Zeroes </em>and <em>The Phantom Pain</em>, is going for $18 on Steam and Xbox</strong>. My opinion of them is mixed, but most folks hold them up as standard bearers for open-world stealth games. <strong>The increasingly popular </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-rising-revengeance-xbox-series-x-s-pc-kojima-1851274738&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-rising-revengeance-xbox-series-x-s-pc-kojima-1851274738"><strong>cult classic <em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</em></strong></a></span>&nbsp;<strong>is a completely different type of game, following the cyborg ninja Raiden as he hacks enemies to pieces in exceptionally bloody fashion, and you can also get it for $18 on Steam or for $12 on Xbox via backwards compatibility</strong>. If you’ve come this far, <strong>you might even be interested in checking out the widely panned zombie-themed <em>Metal Gear Survive</em> for $18,</strong> though most people would probably say you’re better off saving that money. I’m not your parent though, just your friendly neighborhood writer.</p><p>Outside of the <em>Metal Gear </em>games, Konami’s catalog isa little all over the place, but that’s kind of great in a way—it means that the publisher has a little something for everyone. For example, <em><strong>Silent Hill: Homecoming</strong></em><strong>—no one’s favorite </strong><em><strong>Silent Hill </strong></em><strong>game—is on sale on Steam for $8 in case you’re looking for a horror game to pick up ahead of the scary season</strong>. A pair of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh </em>games—<em>Legacy of the Duelist </em>and its updated version <em>Link Evolution</em>—are on sale for $5 and $10, respectively, and I’ve learned that this franchise’s video games are quietly popular, so go nuts picking them up and all their discounted DLCs.</p><p>Elsewhere, Konami publishes a lot of retro collections and modern games that are deliberate throwbacks to the early days of video games. <strong><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</em>, for example, is currently $15 on Steam and Xbox, and <em>Rocket Knight Adventures: Re-Sparked Collection </em>can be picked up for $21.</strong> Even the most recent <em>Contra </em>title, a remake of the 1987 original, is on sale, as well as a collection of previous games in the series.</p><p><strong>There’s also a </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/sale/konamipublishersale2024/?tab=2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/konamipublishersale2024/?tab=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>number of bundles on offer</strong></a></span><strong>, but the most significant one is the <em>Castlevania Collections Bundle</em>, which packages pretty close to 20 <em>Castlevania </em>games from the series’ decades-long history for $58.47. </strong>You get it, there’s a lot here and there’s miraculously even more:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>CYGNI: All Guns Blazing - $</strong>23.99 (was $29.99)</li><li><strong>Contra: Operation Galuga - </strong>$23.99 (was $29.99)</li><li><strong>Super Bomberman R 2 - </strong>$29.99 (was $49.99)</li><li><strong>GetsuFumaDen: Undying Moon - </strong>$14.99 (was $24.99)</li><li><strong>Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection - </strong>$3.99 (was $19.99)</li></ul><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong><em>Contra Anniversary Collection</em></strong><em> - </em>$3.99 (was $19.99)</li></ul><p>So regardless of whether or not you’re in the mood for a stealth game, a 2D beat ‘em up, a bloody good hack ‘n’ slash, or one of the foundational series to gaming’s favorite made up genre (Metroidvania), Konami’s sale might have something that’ll interest you. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A former QA at 343 Industries says that Microsoft is directly to blame for the issues that seemed to plague Halo Infinite from the start.</p>



<p>In a response to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnDrkD1ejGU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube video covering</a> the Halo Infinite campaign, DLC, and more, former QA Briggs William Crane posted a lengthy comment — h/t to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/ex-343-qa-claims-microsoft-contracting-policies-one-of-the-biggest-issues-ms-exclusives-seeing-a-downturn-in-quality-and-halos-struggles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st </a>for spotting the message — on his thoughts as to why game struggled. He says it was due to a number of factors, but one of the biggest is Microsoft’s “contracting policies”.</p>



<p>“Microsoft’s contracting policies are single handedly one of the biggest issues that Halo faces,” Crane, who now works at Epic Games, said. “Can you imagine how difficult it is to do your best work knowing that they’ll get rid of you in 18 months and there’s nothing you can do about it? Plus that forces people out the door just as they become fully trained and competent at their positions.” </p>



<p>He then continued that a “significant” number of 343 Industries’ workforce is made up of contracted workers, including the past Master Chief Collection team.</p>



<p>“The self inflicted brain drain is maddening to watch, and it’s (in my opinion) why most Microsoft exclusive titles are seeing a downturn in quality,” he said. “They’ve created a business environment in which the talent they should be trying to cultivate is being pushed out the door and is then nabbed by other studios.”</p>



<p>He added that it felt like it was done so Microsoft can “have the luxury of being able to easily lay off employees” at will.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that this is one former employee’s thoughts on the state of Microsoft and, more specifically, the Halo franchise. As such, it should be </p>

<p>Earlier today, Ubisoft canceled its online appearance at the Tokyo Game Show due to “various circumstances”; however, Insider Gaming has learned that Ubisoft has also canceled its press previews of Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>According to various sources, the Assassin’s Creed Shadows press previews were scheduled to take place next week, and the embargo date for the previews would be announced then. </p>



<p>At the time of writing, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is still scheduled to release on November 12, 2024, however, the recent announcements may suggest that the game might be delayed.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out to Ubisoft for comment but, as of yet, has yet to reply on the cancellation of the previews, but did not offer comment on the cancellation of the Tokyo Game Show. Earlier today, Ubisoft announced <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1838504341289783532" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a statement</a> about Tokyo Game Show:</p>



<p>“We regret to inform you that due to various circumstances, we have decided to cancel our online participation in Tokyo Game Show 2024 which was scheduled to start at 3:00 PM on September 26th,” the statement reads.</p>



<p>“We apologize for the short notice. We sincerely apologize to everyone who was looking forward to the broadcast.”</p>



<p>The company said that the “currently ongoing giveaway campaign” would continue despite the fact that the broadcast was no longer happening.</p>

Despite Tekken series creator Katsuhiro Harada doing his best to convince us that Heihachi Mishima was actually, really, <em>truly</em> 100% dead this time around, lo and behold the third DLC character for Tekken 8 is none other than the King of Iron Fist himself. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The upcoming free story expansion for Tekken 8, titled Unforgotten Echoes, is all about explaining the how and the why of Heihachi’s return, and as part of a preview event, I got to play the entirety of the two-hour-long DLC campaign. My general impression? If you’re able to turn your brain off and just let it take you for a ride, it’s more good (albeit quite silly) ass Tekken story content.</p><p>While Unforgotten Echoes is an eight-chapter story of how and why Heihachi survived being tossed into a pool of lava at the end of Tekken 7, it actually begins by catching you up with what Eddy, Yoshimitsu, and Lidia were all doing during Tekken 8’s campaign. Eddy now works under Lidia as a part of a resistance force against G-Corp, alongside Yoshimitsu, who… I’m gonna be honest, largely just feels like window dressing throughout this entire DLC. Sorry Yoshimitsu fans, if you were disappointed at his lack of a presence in the base Tekken 8 story, this DLC still doesn’t really give him much of a chance to shine. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The early fights with Eddy do largely feel like filler, as there isn’t really much story consequence to them, but at least they’ve got some cool moments like Eddy reuniting with Jin for the first time since Tekken 6, and they also do a good job of including snippets of gameplay from old Tekken games as flashbacks, which is a very cool touch. </p><p>Eventually, Eddy, Lidia, and Yoshimitsu all get wrapped up in the lives of a group known as the Tekken Monks, which is where Heihachi comes into play. I don’t want to spoil how Heihachi managed to survive, or anything regards to his specific journey through the DLC, but I will say that the DLC does a good job of showing another side of Heihachi, and the way it ties back into the main storyline of Tekken 8 left me with a big old smile on my face, even more eager to see what’s next in the storied series. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As for Heihachi himself, the word that comes to mind when describing what he feels like to play is "powerful".</p></div><p>As for Heihachi himself, the word that comes to mind when describing what he feels like to play as is “powerful”. That’s not to say that I think he’ll be one of the best characters in the game, but rather that his moves hit with such incredible force that “powerful” is just the first word that comes to mind. His attacks feel extremely impactful and brutal to look at, with a moveset that is filled with screen shaking stomps, slams, chops, and no shortage of electric wind god fists. It’s all extremely satisfying, even if he seems like a character that will require some serious time in the lab to get good with, thanks to usual just frame timings of the aforementioned Electric Wind God Fist that all Mishimas share, on top of also having a new stance in the Wind God’s Kamae, and a new mechanic that seemingly buffs his attacks and gives him access to new moves once he gets it to level 3.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Ultimately, Unforgotten Echoes was a fine way to spend two hours, and does a good job of setting up whatever comes next in the world of Tekken by reintroducing Heihachi into the fold. Most importantly though, it’s free, and is a neat way to give the DLC characters a test drive to see if they fit your style of play before you drop actual money on them. Time will tell if Bandai Namco decides to do something similar for future DLC packs, or if this was just a special one-off due to Heihachi’s role in the story, and as a celebration of Tekken’s 30th anniversary. </p><p>In any case, you’ll be able to experience it all for yourself once Unforgotten Echoes is released in for Deluxe and Ultimate Edition owners on October 1, and for everyone else on October 4.</p><p><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

            <p>Sega has confirmed a collaboration with DC on a series of Sonic the Hedgehog comics that will see the blue blur teaming up with the Justice League.</p>
<p>Earlier this week for Batman Day, the Sonic the Hedgehog social media account teased the collaboration, but at today's Sonic Central live stream further details were revealed.</p>
<p>The comics will see mash-ups like Shadow as Batman, Sonic as The Flash (naturally), and Knuckles as Superman, beginning as a series of comics in March 2025 written by Sonic writer Ian Flynn.</p>

<p>The comics will be accompanied by tie-in merchandise, including apparel and toys, and the collaboration will continue into 2026.</p>
<p>Indeed, much of the stream's focus was on merchandise as Sonic becomes something of a cash hog for Sega.</p>
<p>That included a Shadow motorcycle helmet from HJC, a Shadow PalVerse Palé figurine, and even (bizarrely) a collaboration with TopGolf.</p> <div>

<p>More interesting are the two new Sonic Lego sets on the way: Sonic's Campfire Clash, as he relaxes by a fire, and Super Shadow vs Biolizard, based on the boss fight from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-sa2-dc">Sonic Adventure 2</a>.</p>

<p>As for actual games, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-unveils-fall-guys-like-sonic-rumble-as-sonic-mania-plus-hits-mobile">previously revealed Sonic Rumble</a> will arrive this winter on mobile and PC. It's a 32-player battle royale with multiple modes that sees players racing through levels, surviving the longest, or battling for rings.</p>
<p>The stream also showed a fresh look at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-sonic-x-shadow-generations-i-can-finally-admit-shadow-is-better-than-sonic">forthcoming Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> - it will receive a series of animated shorts on YouTube ahead of its release next month that form a prologue. An extended edition of this animation with deleted scenes will be available exclusively to PlayStation players. The physical day one edition will also come with Robotnik's journal.</p>
<p>Lastly, the stream ended with a quick behind the scenes look at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-trailer-reveals-keanu-reeves-shadow">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film</a>, set for release on 21st December. It promises to include plenty of Easter Eggs as it dives further into Sonic lore.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
