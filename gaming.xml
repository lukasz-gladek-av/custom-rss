The game, like 2020's <em>THPS 1+2</em>, is a full remake of two past games from the Tony Hawk franchise, specifically <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 </em>and <em>4</em>. The new remake is being developed by Iron Galaxy and is set to launch in July.

While many of these challenges did have timers, between those challenges players were free to skate around, explore, and collect money. </p><p>When news of this first broke on the<em> Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> subreddit, there was a lot of disappointment from fans of <em>THPS4. </em>They had hoped that the more freeform career mode—which later evolved into the open world of<em> Tony Hawk’s Underground</em>—would be recreated for the new remake. That’s not the case. </p><p>There will still be a free skate option in <em>THPS4</em> levels, letting you freely skate around and explore, but you won’t able to complete level challenges in that mode. For some players this is a dealbreaker, with some complaints stating that this game is really just a remake of <em>THPS3</em> with levels from <em>THPS4 </em>added in as a bonus. </p><p>Personally, as someone who always found <em>THPS4 </em>to be the oddball of the classic games—not as good as <em>THPS3 </em>and not as fresh as <em>THUG</em>—I’m not too upset about these changes. But I can understand that for fans of <em>THPS4</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>the changes to career mode are a big bummer. </p><p><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</em> launches July 11 on Xbox, Game Pass, PlayStation, Switch, and PC. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/siege-is-free-to-play-this-weekend-because-somehow-it-isnt-already/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This upcoming weekend, Rainbow Six Siege will be free-to-play for all Xbox Game Pass members. If you’re like me, you might be surprised to learn that Siege, a live-service tactical shooter from Ubisoft, is not already a free-to-play game. </p>



<h2 id="h-siege-somehow-isn-t-free-to-play-after-10-years">Siege Somehow Isn’t Free-To-Play After 10 Years</h2>



<p>As part of its <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/06/free-play-days-03-06-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#FreePlayDays program</a>, Rainbow Six Siege will be free to play on Game Pass, starting now until Monday, March 10. AEW: Fight Forever, Born of Bread, and Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown are also free-to-play during the weekend. But Siege’s inclusion is a fascinating one, because if you didn’t know any better, you’d assume that Siege was a free-to-play game already.</p>



<p>Siege hits all the characteristics of a free-to-play game. It’s a live service shooter with all the live service fixings: seasonal passes, loot boxes, a robust cosmetics shop, and dozens of operators that require vigorous grinding or premium currency to unlock. Not only does the standard edition of Rainbow Six Siege cost money, but there’s also three separate upgradeable versions: Deluxe Edition, Operator Edition, and Ultimate Edition. Now currently, there’s a Ubisoft sale on Steam, so you can get the standard version or the Deluxe Edition for less than $7. However, nowhere on the Steam store listing does it explain the differences between the versions.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Way back when the game first launched in 2015, Siege struggled to bring in the numbers that Ubisoft hoped for. However, it slowly improved in player numbers as it released a wave of free content and became a shining example of how a “live service game” could flourish. By 2017, Ubisoft said Siege was attracting 2.3 million players every day. Games like Fortnite, VALORANT, and Apex Legends adopted those same live-service tendencies, but removed a huge entry barrier by releasing as free-to-play.</p>



<p>But why is Siege still not free-to-play at this point? Some players would say it keeps cheaters at bay by making them pay to get in. Maybe the pay-upfront approach is the right one, since Siege is celebrating its 10 year anniversary, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-siege-x-update-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heading toward its next “major evolution” in Siege X</a>. Coincidentally , the Ubisoft sale on Steam ends on March 13, the same as the Siege X world premiere. Between that premiere and the release of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, it’s going to be a big month for Ubisoft.</p>



<p>Were you also surprised to learn Siege wasn’t free-to-play? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

It turns out it was (mostly) bullshit, but the RTX 5070 is already selling out regardless, despite major price hikes. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Reviews for Nvidia’s  GeForce RTX 5070 went live this week and all of them harped on Huang’s claim. “To call [the two cards] the same is an absolute flat-out lie,” tech channel <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntSylZ1Bp1Y&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntSylZ1Bp1Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gamers Nexus said in its video</a></span> after comparing the performance with the 4090. “This is a 4090 Killer… and I’m a Liar,” was the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUaztYdgoj0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUaztYdgoj0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">title of Linus Tech Tips’ review</a></span>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review-no-its-not-4090-performance-at-549/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review-no-its-not-4090-performance-at-549/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ars Technica</em> wrote</a></span> that it was “hard to classify the RTX 5070 as anything other than a disappointment.”</p><p>The site’s testing showed performance for the 5070 at just slightly above that of last year’s 4070 Super, despite a significant increase in power consumption. The only way Nvidia’s claim of performance parity with the 4090 even begins to make sense is by using the company’s new DLSS Multi-Frame Generation tech.<strong> </strong>It significantly boosts framerates by interpolating three frames for every one actually rendered frame. The result made <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>and other games feel sluggish and subject to lots of visual artifacting while moving.</p><p>But broken CES promises are only part of the story. Outside of that context the 5070 might be a fine incremental improvement on last year’s models at a similar price. But the graphics card market right now is so chaotic and undersupplied that no one actually expects to be able to get the new budget cards at the official $550 MSRP. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/news/nvidias-rtx-5070-was-in-stock-on-launch-day-but-at-terrible-prices&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/nvidias-rtx-5070-was-in-stock-on-launch-day-but-at-terrible-prices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As <em>PC Mag</em> notes</a></span>, launch day stock almost immediately sold out, if it was ever really available to begin with.</p><p>The 5070 cards people could actually find for sale were $650 or more, and things will seemingly only get worse until new stock emerges. In the meantime, there are scalper listings in the $1,000s. One ray of hope is AMD’s new Radeon RX 9070 line, which has been getting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-graphics-cards&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-graphics-cards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rave reviews so far</a></span>. It’s also selling for above the $550-600 MSRP at the moment, but seems to be less scarce overall. There’s no telling just how the broader graphics card market will shake out amid trade wars and the ongoing AI arms race, but decent competition for Nvidia can’t hurt. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

April's a busy month in the world of The Last of Us. Not only is Part 2 coming to PC, the long-awaited second season of HBO's live-action TV adaptation begins too - and Sony is squeezing into the middle of that mushroom-scented sandwich with a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/06/first-look-at-the-dualsense-wireless-controller-the-last-of-us-limited-edition/">limited edition DualSense controller</a> themed around developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s acclaimed games.
</p>
<p>
The DualSense wireless controller – The Last of Us Limited Edition, as it's officially known, arrives on 10th April (Part 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-finally-gets-itself-a-pc-release-date">comes to PC on the 3rd</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">show starts on the 13th</a>), featuring "glossy trophy icons" representing key moments, characters, and events from both games.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, you've been lumbered with me instead of Eurogamer's resident The Last of Us expert Victoria Kennedy for this one - so instead of an insightful breakdown explaining how all the little pictures relate to the game, my only passing thought is the black and white design and subtle embossing looks surprisingly tasteful. Not sure about those big white icons though.

<p>
Anyway, here's what Naughty Dog has to say about the whole thing: "We wanted to ensure that both instalments of The Last of Us are represented, via trophy icons printed in black gloss across the controller body. Among the trophies, three particular images will immediately stand out for TLOU fans: The firefly, moth, and wolf. Players will recognise the Fireflies’ iconic spray-painted logo that originated in Part 1, while the moth and wolf represent the intertwining lives and duality between Ellie and Abby in Part 2."

<p>
Sony's The Last of Us DualSense controller launches on 10th April and costs £74.99 / €84.99 / $84.99. However, anyone looking to jump in line early - given the "limited quantities" it's being released in - can <a href="http://direct.playstation.com/">pre-order on the PlayStation website</a> starting at 10am, 14th March, local time.
</p>
<p>
All this The Last of Us activity comes as Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann this week warned fans, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-boss-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3">"don't bet" on there being a The Last of Us Part 3</a>.

Dark and Darker's legal troubles began in 2023 (shortly after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/medieval-battle-royale-alike-dark-and-darker-is-having-a-moment-in-steam-next-fest">demo had a bit of a moment on Steam</a>) when Nexon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-developer-denies-stolen-code-allegations-following-police-raid">accused Ironmace of copyright infringement</a>, claiming members of the development team had used "materials and assets they worked on during their time" at Nexon to create Dark and Darker - an accusation Ironmace repeatedly denied.
</p>
<p>
As the legal accusations continued to fly, Nexon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-has-been-removed-from-steam-following-a-cease-and-desist-demand">issued a cease and desist order forcing the game off Steam</a>, but things appeared to be looking up for Ironmance after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-dev-says-nexons-trade-secret-and-copyright-lawsuit-against-it-has-been-dismissed">court dismissed Nexon's request for an injunction</a> last January. By March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-has-been-removed-from-steam-following-a-cease-and-desist-demand">Dark and Darker had released on the Epic Games Store</a> and it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-is-back-on-steam-and-now-its-free-to-play">finally returned to Steam in June</a> - but it looks like the dance is beginning again, with Dark and Darker having now been removed from the Epic Games Store.

<p>
Addressing the situation in a message shared on the official Dark and Darker Discord (as <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/dark-and-darker/delisted-epic-games-store">spotted by PCGamesN</a>), developer Ironmace wrote, "The decision appears to be based on claims made by opposing parties in an ongoing legal dispute. We are currently working to understand the exact reasoning behind this removal."
</p>
<p>
"It seems that the removal process is not yet fully complete," the studio added, "as Dark and Darker is no longer listed, but Dark and Darker: Legendary Status is still available for purchase. Please be aware of this potential confusion."
</p>
<p>
Ironmace didn't explicitly name the opposing parties in its "ongoing legal dispute", but these latest developments are almost certainly connected to the studio's battle with Nexon, which reached another milestone earlier this year. In February, a South Korean court ruled Ironmace hadn't committed copyright infringement with Dark and Darker, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-developer-sued-by-nexon-for-copyright-infringement">Nexon had argued</a> - but the studio wasn't entirely off the hook. The court also decided Ironmace <em>had</em> infringed on Nexon's trade secrets, ordering the studio to cough up around $6m USD in damages.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Nexon said it "planned to seek further legal judgment through a higher court", so there's a good chance Dark and Darker's removal from Epic is related to Nexon's escalation. We've reached out to Epic and Ironmace for comment on the situation.

      <div><p>Today, Hero Forge launched a new Kickstarter campaign to add custom dice to their services. The aptly named Hero Forge: Custom Dice campaign has already found great success, reaching its funding goal within an hour of going live.</p>

<h2>The Hero Forge: Custom Dice Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to its Kickstarter campaign page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/heroforge/custom-dice/description" rel="nofollow">Hero Forge: Custom Dice</a> lets you order customized polyhedral dice for your home games. This customization is an extension of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hero-forge-full-color-miniatures-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hero Forge's service</a>, printing custom miniatures of various custom characters. It is a service they have provided to tabletop players since 2014, bringing endless personalized minis to gaming tables around the world.</p>

The service can print any kind of dice: D4, D6, D10, percentile dice, D12, large or XL D20s. If you play a lot of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer</em></a>, you can order bricks of D6s for your wargames. If you're more of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic</em></a> player, you can print a custom spin-down die to keep track of life totals.</p>

<blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/625502/amd-rx-9070-xt-launch-pricing-msrp-possible-bait-switch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Yesterday, reviewers agreed: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/624423/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review-benchmarks-price">AMD is finally beating Nvidia with its RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards</a>, assuming they actually launch with sufficient stock at their $549 and $599 prices.</p></div><p>But this morning’s launch, while better than recent Nvidia launches <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-launch-day-retail-stock-status-looks">in terms of supply</a>, may not have met that bar — and AMD would not deny reports that even the best-priced models of these GPUs are capped to specific quantities, after which they may be sold at higher than $549 or $599.</p><p>When <em>The Verge </em>checked this morning, major US retailers Best Buy and Newegg listed as few as a single model of each GPU at their MSRP, which sold out quickly, of course. Most cards are listed for a $100 premium over that MSRP, if not more.</p><p>Micro Center appears to be doing far better, with <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?N=0&amp;NTX=mode+MatchPartial&amp;NTT=9070+&amp;NTK=all&amp;sortby=pricelow">as many as five 9070s and five 9070 XTs</a> at MSRP and a website that claims they’re even still available for purchase if you visit one of its 28 US locations in person.</p><p>What happens next? It’s not unusual for each graphics card partner to sell a variety of fancier grades of the same GPU at higher prices with fancier cooling and overclocking — but retailers are now suggesting that even the prices of entry-level cards won’t hold.</p><p>“We have now learned how the recommended prices, also known as MSRP prices, work for the launch of the AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT […] they will apply to a limited number of cards,” wrote Swedish retailer Inet.se, <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/retailer-confirms-radeon-rx-9070-msrp-only-applies-to-first-shipments-price-set-to-increase-later">as documented by <em>VideoCardz</em></a>.</p><p>“MSRP is capped quantity of a few hundred, so prices will jump once those are sold through,” UK retailer Overclockers UK also reportedly wrote.</p><p>Even Best Buy seemed to suggest that $549 / $599 prices were only temporary. When we visited this morning, the Best Buy website described them like they were on sale, though the company has since removed the “save $80” and “save $130” you see below. AMD says the Best Buy listings were an error.</p><p>We asked AMD:</p><div><ul><li><span>Can you confirm or deny that the best prices on the best-priced cards are capped in this way?</span></li><li><span>Can you confirm or deny that only a fraction of the best-priced models of 9070 and 9070 XT will be sold at their announced MSRP?</span></li><li><span>Can you confirm or deny that AMD has okayed any board partners or retailers whatsoever to raise their prices beyond MSRP after selling through a certain quantity or certain number of shipments?</span></li></ul></div><p>AMD would not confirm or deny. It did address the larger question of MSRP availability with this statement from chief gaming solutions architect (and gaming marketing boss) Frank Azor, though:</p><div><blockquote><p>It is inaccurate that $549 / $599 MSRP is launch-only pricing. We expect cards to be available from multiple vendors at $549 / $599 (excluding region specific tariffs and / or taxes) based on the work we have done with our AIB partners, and more are coming. At the same time, the AIBs have different premium configurations at higher price points and those will also continue.</p></blockquote></div><p>On X, <a href="https://x.com/AzorFrank/status/1897668346298220588">Azor tweeted</a> that AMD is working to replenish stock “in the coming days and weeks,” adding, “MSRP pricing (excluding region specific tariffs and/or taxes) will continue to be encouraged beyond today so don’t despair.”</p><p><strong><em>U</em></strong><em><strong>pdate, 4:30PM ET:</strong> Added that AMD says the Best Buy listings were in error. </em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-the-board-game-review.1127517/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-the-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Not many games in the past decade have generated as much buzz in the zeitgeist as FromSoftware’s Elden Ring. In a time when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">board games based on video games</a> are becoming commonplace, it was only a matter of time before FromSoftware’s behemoth made its way to the tabletop. Steamforged Games – creators of other major video game adaptations like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-the-board-game-series-buying-guide">Resident Evil</a>, Monster Hunter World, and FromSoftware’s Dark Souls – took up the flask to do just that. Now, after a highly successful crowdfunding campaign in 2022, Elden Ring: The Board Game (referred to as just Elden Ring going forward) is nearly in the hands of backers and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxXbpk?object_uuid=59c39b23-0b80-410e-8ab6-b923b8ed768b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">available for preorder</a> for everyone else. Rise, Tarnished. It is time to fight once more.</p><div catalogid="ded2258a-cbef-4998-acb9-d421d76514ac" id="216332"><div id="216332" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Elden Ring: The Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign board game</a>, meaning you and your fellow players progress through a series of scenarios, leveling up and improving your characters as you play through the story. Steamforged Games has created three of these “campaigns” for prospective Tarnished to choose from – Realm of the Grafted King, The Weeping Peninsula, and Stormveil Castle – with Grafted King serving as the larger “base game” and the other two as standalone expansions. These expansions can be tackled on their own or played after Grafted King, allowing you to carry over your characters and continue their adventure, growing ever stronger in the process. Depending on which box you purchase, you will have access to different classes, including the Vagabond, Samurai, Astrologer, and Prophet in the Grafted King (base game) box; the Hero, Prophet, Astrologer, and Bandit in Weeping Peninsula; and the Confessor, Prisoner, Samurai, and Vagabond in the Stormveil Castle box.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This game is an imposing thing, arriving in large boxes filled with fearsome-looking monster miniatures, hundreds of cards, cardboard tokens, tiles, and a plethora of books containing rules, combat maps, and scenario guides. It’s one of the most intimidating games in my collection, made even more terrifying by the fact that I only own one of the campaigns – I have yet to get the other two boxes or any of the bonus boss sets that can be added in. For such a large game, Steamforged has knocked Elden Ring out of the park in terms of production value, featuring some of the most detailed miniatures I’ve seen, along with great-feeling cards and sturdy cardboard components.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scenarios come in a handful of varieties that do a good job of keeping things fresh, so you’re not doing the same thing back-to-back. However, not every scenario type lands as well as others. Narrative scenarios ask you to read paragraphs of story, choose different actions to take (potentially making skill checks), and then draw the appropriate card to see what happens. While these are well-written and I appreciate the inclusion of skill checks, this type of scenario didn’t do much for me – if I wanted to do a bunch of reading or storytelling, I’d simply read a book or play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By far, my favorite are Exploration scenarios, which excellently capture the spirit of discovery and the feeling of never knowing what lies beyond the next hill – something that almost defines the source material. In these scenarios, you and the other players explore a region of the map, flipping and placing random tiles as you work to complete various quests. Tiles can contain enemies, items, Sites of Grace, or other surprises for you to uncover and take advantage of. I’m a big fan of the “grow as you go” approach to map creation in board games – whether it’s in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-board-game-buyers-guide">Betrayal at House on the Hill</a> or Clank! Catacombs – as it enhances both the sense of discovery and the game’s replayability due to the random nature of tile placement. These scenarios offer a balanced mix of everything Elden Ring has to offer – combat, story, and exploration – without feeling overwhelming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remaining three scenario types are strictly combat-focused: Gauntlet, Dungeon, and Boss scenarios. Gauntlets throw you into incredibly difficult encounters with mobs of enemies and special rules sprinkled in. Dungeons are similar but culminate in a strong boss at the end. Finally, Boss scenarios – where you and your friends square off against the game’s true threats – are the ultimate test of your builds and teamwork. Between these scenarios and the encounters you stumble upon while exploring, Elden Ring is a combat-heavy experience, which isn’t a bad thing considering that the combat is really solid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat takes place on grids formed from ring-bound notebooks included with the game. Some fights require multiple books to be laid out in a multi-page spread, creating a battlefield where players and enemies move strategically in their struggle to defeat one another. Attacks with spells and weapons have specified ranges, but depending on the row you’re standing in, players can gain additional boons – such as dealing extra damage, modifying turn order, or blocking more effectively. My friends and I frequently found ourselves deep in deliberation over positioning, trying to survive the onslaught of incoming attacks. Alas, even our best-laid plans often led to our demise – because the enemies in this game are <em>TOUGH</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Basic enemies each have a card displaying their actions, with symbols indicating attack placement, movement, and other mechanics. It takes some time to get used to what all the symbols mean, but it’s manageable. Once an enemy has taken its listed actions – or passed if it can’t fulfill all the steps – its turn ends. That's straightforward and relatively easy to manage. Bosses, however, are terrifying. They have entire decks of actions, each with its own place in the initiative order. Sometimes, you get lucky and their attacks land last. Other times, they pounce on your party before you can react. It’s brutal and unforgiving, but thanks to scalable health pools based on player count, the fights never felt unfair. Every boss battle was exciting and full of tense moments where we held our breath, hoping to stagger the boss or dodge a devastating attack. Despite just being miniatures moving on a grid, the combat offers surprising depth and strategy that makes it shine.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Elden Ring forgoes dice entirely, opting instead for a card-driven deck-building experience.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One aspect that may surprise players is that Elden Ring forgoes dice entirely, opting instead for a card-driven <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deck-building</a> experience. Players play cards from a deck dictated by their equipped weapons, skills, and gear. However, damage dealt and mitigated – along with special effects like Bleed – are determined by a separate Attribute deck. Different Attribute cards contain symbols representing Strength, Dexterity, and other stats, with attack and defense decks favoring certain symbols over others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Character progression is a core component of campaign board games, and Elden Ring is no different. Similar to the video game, not only can you level up your class for new abilities, but you can also customize your character by swapping weapons, armor, accessories, and Attribute cards, as well as increasing overall stats through Trait cards. This is all managed via the Rune system, which functions as an equipment load limit. Your total Rune count increases as you progress in the campaign, allowing more customization. However, the tracking method is lacking – Steamforged provides small Rune cards to track your total, but they aren’t abundant enough for every player and add to the card clutter. A simple tracker, like the one used for health, would have been far more effective. As it stands, the best method is to track Runes on paper, which feels clunky. Hopefully, a better solution will emerge from the community or Steamforged itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Elden Ring’s strengths, my initial experience was frustrating – not due to the game itself, but because I started with Stormveil Castle, the third campaign. While technically a standalone expansion, it assumes your characters have completed earlier quests and starts with adjustments to gear, runes, and decks. This made it overwhelming to set up for fresh players. I strongly urge anyone interested in this game to start with Realm of the Grafted King.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Where to Buy</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QxXbpk?object_uuid=59c39b23-0b80-410e-8ab6-b923b8ed768b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Steamforged Games</a><em></em></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">More Board Games Based on Video Games: </h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Mar 6, 2025 8:39 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Steamforged Games has managed to adapt one of the most monumental video games of this generation, and the result is largely a success. Elden Ring: The Board Game captures the spirit of exploration, intense combat, and character progression, while maintaining the challenge fans expect. Even with its blemishes, Elden Ring pulled me in with its fantastic miniatures, engaging tactical combat, and breadth of customization. Given Steamforged’s history of supporting their games, I wouldn’t be surprised if more campaigns and expansions are on the horizon. If you have a group of board game enthusiasts – especially Elden Ring fans – this is an easy recommendation. Just start with Realm of the Grafted King. Now, get out there, Tarnished, and see what’s waiting.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/newzoos-latest-report-forecasts-anticipated-boost-to-console-from-major-releases-gradual-growth-on-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Newzoo has released<a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/global-games-market-update-q1-2025?utm_campaign=5745787-2025-Newzoo-Press&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-__Dq-HWVzJK08jsx_6t5jYPEY6DxXW-ixoHYynq9c2ftlODIAJQBurdpm-hpCBe74HoSVI9UKPBo2ONoLUJYJ5h29KoQ&amp;_hsmi=350466789&amp;utm_content=350466789&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> its latest report</a> and has also announced that it has implemented new changes that will make the reports more accurate than ever. The company is dedicated to refining its data products so that all information provided about the gaming industry is trustworthy and helps provide a true insight into the industry. This has been achieved by improved data integration with Newzoo's Game Performance Monitor, as well as new acquisitions where they acquired the Steam Data Suite, which is now known as Newzoo's Business Store Intelligence.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>As a result of these new changes, Newzoo has created a new report that dives into the industry's global forecast and what comes next in terms of revenue and growth compared to previous years.</p>
<p>Comparing the industry to the last three years, it's set to recover as a whole, to a more mature "new normal." All three platforms (Console, Mobile, PC) are expected to return to growth. However, it won't be a massive amount of growth and will stay in the low single digits. Thus far, it's forecasted to be 3.7%.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The PC market is forecast to grow similarly to the mobile market in the sense that microtransactions, such as in-game cosmetics, loot boxes, and battle passes, will drive the revenue on that platform. Among the PC market, Fortnite and Roblox will continue to remain popular and get consistent engagement, with new content streams being released regularly. Growth in China specifically is expected to slow down, while Japan's popularity will continue to rise over this period.</p>
<p>While some may feel that consoles are dying out, Newzoo predicts that it will instead actually get a major boost, thanks to some upcoming major releases. This includes the highly-anticipated release of Grand Theft Auto VI that is set to release this year, which is triggering increased hardware upgrades. While the publishers aren't mentioned, those that are developing titles for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S expect that they will profit from the peak install base.</p>
<p>Thus far, console users are set to have a good amount of games releasing that will bring in a lot of revenue, including Grand Theft Auto VI. Most recently is <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, which has already proven to be incredibly popular. The Nintendo Switch 2 is also set to release this year, which means there will be some highly-anticipated games from audiences of all ages, including Pokemon Legends: Z-A.</p>
<p>The mobile market has reached market maturity, where player growth has lowered significantly to below 3% annually outside of the typical growth regions. Eastern Asia has particularly low player growth compared to other regions.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-plans-starfield-not-saying-anything/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bethesda-has-%E2%80%98exciting-things-planned%E2%80%99-for-starfield-this-year-but-remains-silent.1127427/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-plans-starfield-not-saying-anything/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It seems like a lifetime since Starfield was released, but it wasn’t even two years ago that Bethesda Game Studios’ space-based RPG epic hit the market. For many, the game came and went without too much of an impact, and for others, it was the title of a lifetime, positively bursting at the seams with untold potential.</p>



<p>I’m probably in the former camp there.</p>



<p>Recently, the team posted on social media, expressing an appreciation for the patience of fans worldwide and stressing that there are exciting things in store for Starfield this year, but the squad is remaining tight-lipped for now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-next-starfield-dlc-anyone">Next Starfield DLC, Anyone?</h2>



<p>In September, a year after Starfield was released, Bethesda published Shattered Space, the first (and so far, only) major expansion for the game. It wasn’t an overwhelming thing and it left some players feeling short-changed, but at least it was an evolution on the game that has kind of run stagnant over the last eighteen months or so.</p>



<p>The game that took 20 years to emerge fully seemed to run out of steam very early on, which wasn’t good.</p>



<p>If we look at some representative examples of how the world is treating Starfield, we can see that things aren’t looking too positive. On Twitch, the game peaked at 552,021 viewers when it was released, but as I write this, just 40 people are watching Starfield gameplay.</p>



<p>By contrast, Fallout 4 has 648 viewers, which isn’t much better, but that game is <strong>a decade old</strong>.</p>



<p>On Steam, Starfield’s player count has dropped by 99% since its release. Talking of Fallout 4, the post-apocalyptic RPG’s player count on the PC platform more than tripled Starfield’s count at the time of writing.</p>







<p>That’s part and parcel of the lifecycle of a single-player game, though – so I won’t be too harsh on Starfield for not bucking the trend.</p>



<p>Bethesda planned to release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-wants-annual-starfield-expansions/">one major expansion</a> for Starfield every year, and given the track record for how early we heard about Shattered Space, we <strong>should </strong>have something on the board for the next expansion, but never mind. It has been almost six months since Shattered Space dropped, and we’re none the wiser.</p>



<p>But fear not! On <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldGame/status/1897709518013997493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the team at Bethesda Game Studios assured fans that all is well and that there’s something in the pipeline:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We know you’re eager for an update, and we truly appreciate your passion for Starfield. The team has been hard at work, and while we’re not ready to share specific details just yet, we have a lot of exciting things planned for the game this year that we can’t wait to talk about when the time is right. </p>



<p>We’re always listening and taking your feedback to heart. Thanks for being part of this journey with us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Let’s bear in mind that the folks at Bethesda haven’t given us a solid update on The Elder Scrolls 6 in almost a decade, so there’s that.</p>



<p>Are you still playing Starfield? Let me know in the comments what you’re up to out there in the vast expanse of space.</p>
