		<p>The end of the world is nigh in Code Vein II, as the calamitous Luna Rapacis progresses and corrupts the Revenants who had, until this point, been able to live in harmony with mankind. But there’s still time to fix this. With a story that’s somewhere between Quantum Leap and X-Men: Days of Future Past, you need to jump back in time to visit and team up with Revenant heroes of a century ago, looking for a way to reawaken them in the present and stop what’s coming.</p>
<p><iframe title="Code Vein 2 Preview –&nbsp;Anime Soulike of Future Past" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FxZSqlaieMM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Back in 2019, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/26/code-vein-review/">the original Code Vein</a> brought a whole host of interesting ideas to the Soulslike form, from the ability to jump between character build Blood Codes, to the Partner NPC characters that would fight alongside you throughout. And yes, it came with anime-style graphics too. The Soulslike subgenre already felt pretty full and saturated back in 2019, but now in 2026, it’s bursting at the seams with competition. Bandai Namco’s answer is to take the core of what worked well before, and then bring so, so much more player customisation to the table.</p>


<p>Code Vein II Producer Keita Iizuka explained, “Code Vein belongs to the soulslike genre, but even within the action RPG there are many more genres, for example, exploratory open world games. But there aren’t as clear-cut boundaries as before, I would say. So yes, probably you are right, it’s becoming even more competitive, however because of that, it’s very important for us to really be mindful of our strength. It’s because of their competition that we are more stimulated to create something even better. So that’s something that we have hopefully realised and achieved in this version.”</p>


<p>Take the Partner system in general. It’s still great to have another AI partner there to draw aggro from enemies, dish out some damage of their own, and be ready to revive you with a chunk of their own health should you fall –&nbsp;this Restorative Offering now puts them into a cooldown for a time – but now all of that is optional. This is now branded as Summoning, but you also have the choice to use Assimilation, to absorb you Partner and add their strengths to enhance your powers, stats and abilities. If you found the Partners a touch frustrating to in their behaviours before, then you can sideline them through the whole game now.</p>
<p>Iizuka-san explained, “The reason why we allowed Assimilation is because by just having two characters all the time for every fight, the fighting style became fairly set, so the Partner just takes on a certain role and the player would take a certain role. We wanted to remove that kind of boundary, so that’s why we have created the assimilation mode, to be able to really see the fights from a different angle.</p>
<p>“The emotional arc is an important one. So the characters, you will be able to really spend one-on-one time with them to learn more about their backstories, their emotions, really have very heartfelt conversations. So that’s something that we have really valued.”</p>

<p>You’ll spend time with these characters regardless of how you play. This new world and story sees your protagonist journeying back in time to team up with the Revenant heroes of legend, the Fallen Heroes of the Resurgence, and our hands-on saw us partnering with Josée Anjou back in the day. Battling alongside her through the Sunken City to find a source for the pollution within the Sunken Pylon dungeon that we played. Along the way, there’s various narrative interludes that explore Josée’s character, the relationship she had with her sister and what befell them.</p>
<p>“The preview that you have played focused on Josée’s as her main narrative of her arc,” Iizuka-san said, “but there are other arcs involving other characters, and the scenes that you would be able to experience. With the time travel axis as well, you would be able to go back in time and then meet the characters at different points in their lives, to change the outcome, but also to experience the weight of history as well. So I hope that the players get to enjoy that.”</p>
<p>Putting the narrative focus on a range of characters that aren’t your own is an interesting way to frame the story, especially with the potential to bounce back and forth between time periods, and it also makes sense with just how goofy you can make your custom character. There’s a huge range of visual customisation that lets you fully indulge your more absurdist impulses. Want to wear a top hat with a snowman sticking out the top of it? Well, I certainly did when fiddling with the character creator, and that’s just scratching the surface of what’s possible here.</p>
<div id="attachment_467552"><p id="caption-attachment-467552">Is that a snowman in your hat?</p></div>
<p>“It’s not something that we actively specifically ordered to the developing team […] but the customisation team really took on an active role in coming up with this even further evolved version of the customisation build system,” Iizuka-san told us.&nbsp;“ But something that, as a team, we were very conscious of, is that we wanted to deliver a system that is easy to build, customisable, and that the outcome is always great-looking anime-like characters. So there are many numbers of parts, but always the end result to something that is great. That is something that we want to aspire to create.”</p>
<p>The visual customisation is echoed within the combat builds, again taking the core of the ideas from the original Code Vein and expanding them greatly. The Blood Codes that you apply determine the attributes of your character through six categories, with the equipment and weapons that you then equip putting a burden on these figures, which can lead you to being overburdened and suffer penalties to your play, in turn pushing you to align your choice of weaponry and play style.</p>
<p>Talking about the new possibilities here, Iizuka-san said, “So we have added two new categories into the weapons, as well as two different drain attacks as well, and when it comes to Formae, there are many different varieties that we have added. So by combining them all, there are a lot more that the players could enjoy, so I hope they do.”</p>
<p>You’ll really want to make the most of your Formae abilities (formerly Gifts), the skills that you can use for offence or defence, building up to the Bequeathed Formae as your most powerful ability, summoning a special weapon to your hands to unleash hefty damage. That will require you to have enough Ichor, drawn from enemies by performing Jails (the rebranded Blood Veil) to drain their blood. There’s additional Boosters sprinkled on top for what is a particularly broad and complex system of stats, abilities and synergies for players to find.</p>

<p>It’s this depth of customisation that could end up being Code Vein II’s biggest strength. The Sunken Pylon dungeon felt a little by-the-numbers with its Soulslike structure and fairly samey abandoned, ruined industrial look. There is a more open overworld that can be navigated on a motorcycle, which I didn’t get to play, and I’d be curious to see just how the story handles bouncing between time periods and the character growth. There’s not too long to wait, though, with Code Vein II out later this month.</p>
<p>The opening of 2026 is a busy one for Soulslike fans, and Code Vein II is first in line with a refreshed take on the original’s anime visuals, more extensive character customisation, and a characterful time-travelling tale.</p>

<p>As for why the record has been smashed, Valve almost certainly owes that to the ongoing Steam Winter Sale, which ends today at 10am Pacific and which features huge discounts on a number of popular games (as well as smaller discounts on newer or more evergreen titles).</p><p>Since many of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-best-of-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="506dd7fd-a10c-4745-bcb4-ef7cfe0636c8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2025's best-selling games</a> on Steam are live-service titles as well, it's not unreasonable to assume that players are flocking to those games over the holiday period, which is probably why the concurrent in-game player count record has been broken too.</p><p>This news comes after what has been a rather checkered year for Steam, with Valve facing challenges from the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horses-steam-ban-indie-horror" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4a11cd5-8771-4a5c-86ba-ff196e272f59" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Horses </em>developer Santa Ragione</a>, No More Robots' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-more-robots-review-flag-rejection-valve" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5b8f68ae-5137-4e39-9011-498f4b4b7c21" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Mike Rose</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3d619c44-1572-4d4c-9fdf-64af4c3b37db" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s Cara Cadaver</a> over what appear to be contradictory censorship policies that seem to ignore important context.</p><p>With that said, legendary <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rance-series-coming-to-steam" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7bdd01fa-043a-41f0-af9b-a0305684ffa0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">eroge series <em>Rance</em></a><em> </em>is about to make its Steam debut, albeit in what will probably end up being a heavily censored form subsidized with a patch downloadable from its publisher's website.

            <guid>1397176</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Now that its officially 2026, Apple waited no time at all to discount its 2025 model of the MacBook Air. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">Amazon is currently Apple MacBook Air with the M4 chip, priced at just $799—down from the regular $999.</a> This 20% price cut saves you $200, making it one of the deepest reductions since its release last year. It’s a great opportunity to kick off the new year with a powerful, versatile laptop.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Everyday Performance</h2>
<p>The 13-inch 2025 MacBook Air remains a top pick for those who want portability without compromising on performance. Weighing just 2.7 pounds and boasting a sleek design, it continues the Air’s legacy of being incredibly lightweight while delivering the power of larger machines. Despite its slim build, it comes with a 10-core CPU, up to a 10-core GPU, and supports up to 24GB of memory. With the new M4 chip, this laptop performs up to twice as fast as the M1 MacBook Air and is up to 23 times quicker than Intel-based versions of the Air.</p>
<p>Apple designed the M4 chip with Apple Intelligence in mind, optimizing the system for faster task execution, efficient information processing, and handling demanding workflows effortlessly. The MacBook Air stays smooth and responsive whether you’re working on reports, editing videos, or managing multiple tabs.</p>



<p>If you’re often on the go and need long-lasting battery life, the MacBook Air delivers. Apple claims it can last up to 18 hours on a single charge, easily getting you through an entire workday. The 12MP front camera, with 1080p video capability, is perfect for virtual meetings, classes, or chatting with friends and family. The three-microphone array ensures crystal-clear sound, eliminating the need for external microphones.</p>
<p>The backlit keyboard makes typing easy in low-light environments, and Touch ID gives you a quick and secure way to unlock your laptop. On the sides, you’ll find two Thunderbolt ports for fast data transfer and connecting peripherals. The MagSafe charging port keeps your power cable securely in place but detaches safely if pulled. Plus, after all these years, Apple has kept the headphone jack in tact—a nice bonus for those who prefer wired audio.</p>
<p>If you’re already part of the Apple ecosystem, the MacBook Air makes it easy to sync with your iPhone, iPad, or other Apple devices via features like AirDrop, iMessage, and Handoff.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">The MacBook Air is discounted in several configurations. The 256GB model is the most affordable, priced at $799</a>. The 512GB version is now $999. For those who need more memory, the model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is $1,200. Each of these represent a $200 discount from their original list prices. Choose from four stylish colors: sky blue, silver, starlight, and midnight.</p>

<p>The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is reportedly set to receive new DLC in 2026, developed by Fool’s Theory. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-rumored-to-get-brand-new-dlc-in-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reports</a> about a new Witcher 3 DLC have been circulating online since June 2025, when it was claimed that the third major expansion for the game would be announced in 2025; however, it never was. New details have now surfaced online thanks to a Polish Noble Securities Analyst, which provide an expected release window for the DLC as well as The Witcher 4. </p>

<p>Eurogamer also followed up on the original source, Borys Nieśpielak, who stated that the information about The Witcher 3’s 2026 DLC has been verified by “several” independent sources. Nieśpielak also pointed to a statement from CD Projekt RED’s recent earnings call, which states that “Given our current progress, there is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year.” However, CD Projekt RED’s official response states that the company “does not comment on rumour or speculation”. </p>

            <p>On its release back in 2023, Nintendo kept the Imprisoning War Sages from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> shrouded in a certain amount of mystery. In fact, despite them playing a fairly key role in terms of the overall backstory, we only saw them in the game very briefly.</p>
<p>That changed in last year's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which was set before the events of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Here, the Hyrule Warriors team was able to shine more of a light on the war's Sages, who we now know to be Ardi of the Gerudo, Qia of the Zora, Raphica of the Rito and Agraston of the Goron.</p>

<p>In Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, players are able to take on the role of each Sage as well as the likes of Princess Zelda and Rauru, as they fight through waves upon waves of bokoblins, Lynels and more.</p>
<p>But, why did Nintendo keep Tears of the Kingdom's Imprisoning War Sages under wraps like it did until the spin-off prequel? Well, director Hidemaro Fujibayashi has now said if the developer had shown the Sages' faces and shared their names before then, the story of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom "would have naturally grown too much" for the game.</p><p>"In Tears of the Kingdom there was a central theme running through the main story, and the Sages are depicted with their faces hidden by masks and without names," Fujibayashi said in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/898/G089833/20251205029/">4Gamer</a> (translated by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-explains-why-it-kept-the-imprisoning-war-sages-a-mystery-in-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">NintendoEverything</a>). The director then went on to state there were "many things" Nintendo "intentionally held back" for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> sequel.</p>
<p>"If we had shown [the Sages'] personalities and faces, the story would have naturally grown too much," Fujibayashi further explained. "That's why I'm truly happy that the Sages have been more carefully picked up upon here in the Imprisoning War."</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-impressions-review-story-gameplay">Alex took Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment out for a spin</a> ahead of its release, calling it the series' "richest offering yet".</p>
<p>Since its release in November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-free-update-adds-more-weapons-and-enemies-to-the-chaos">updates for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment have added additional weapons</a>, as well as new Vicious enemies.</p>

            <p>There are a few series staples you can expect from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>: a guy called Cid, moogles, chocobos, that lovely arpeggio motif in the music, and… surveys? If you've been reading this site for a while - or, indeed, following the Final Fantasy series - you'll know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> likes to lobby the fanbase to hear our thoughts about the series' identity and future.</p>
<p>The publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-15-survey-hints-at-possible-future-updates">did it for Final Fantasy 15 back in 2017</a>, it did to find out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-polling-final-fantasy-fans-on-moogles-in-ff15">what we all thought about moogles in 2015</a>, Naoki 'Yoshi-P' Yoshida <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-on-dawntrail-criticism-community-feedback-and-the-future-of-final-fantasy-14">regularly uses surveys</a> to poll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">FF14</a> players, and Square Enix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-successfully-expanded-the-series-audience-says-dlc-director">found out that more young people played Final Fantasy 16</a> via a survey in 2024. Keeping with tradition, then, we're seeing the Japanese company once again ask players about the storied series in a poll. And it closes on 9th January.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, we don't really know anything about where the mainline series is going. Yoshi-P said in an interview last year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/not-a-clear-cut-answer-whether-final-fantasy-17-will-be-turn-based-says-naoki-yoshida-following-clair-obscurs-success">the team isn't even sure whether the game will be turn-based or not</a> (though we do know, at least, Square Enix wants to keep whatever game comes out of its current work a 'cinematic experience').</p>
<p>If you've got big thoughts about what you want to see - something more turn-based, maybe? Something more in line with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> or Metaphor Refantazio, perhaps? - then you can <a href="https://questant.jp/q/6K9FPT4N">head on over to the link</a> and have your say about what you'd like to see more (or less) of in the series going forward.</p><p>Personally, I was electrified by the comments Kazutoyo Maehiro, director of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> remake, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-could-open-the-door-to-a-sequel-if-it-sells-well-says-director">made in an interview last year</a>. Basically, he mentioned that if the re-release sold well, then it would "open the door" to a sequel and "prove the business viability of the strategy RPG genre."</p>
<p>There's an open field at the end of the survey where you can leave whatever comments you like. This is where I've opted to pop my interest in more Final Fantasy Tactics-related titles. Feel free to add what you want, but please, keep it civil.</p>

<p><em>Phantom Blade Zero</em> made more than a few heads turn when it was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-0-is-a-new-unreal-engine-5-powered-dark-action-rpg-coming-to-playstation-5/">revealed in May 2023</a>,</strong> with its distinctive style <strong>blending traditional kung fu with steampunk and cyberpunk</strong>. However, many dismissed it as yet another <strong>soulslike</strong>. Fortunately, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-not-soulslike/">this won't be the case</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Edging closer to a more <strong>traditional action game</strong> than a soulslike, the game in development by S-Game is setting out to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/"><strong>one of the best games of the current console generation</strong></a>, featuring intense action, linear yet articulate level design, exceptional enemy encounter design that forces players to employ every game mechanic effectively, epic boss battles and some of the smoothest animation in video games.</p>



<p>Though in the works by what is essentially an unproven team, <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em> truly has everything to <strong>succeed</strong> when <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-slashes-its-way-on-pc-and-playstation-5-this-september/"><strong>it launches this September.</strong></a></p>

<p>Seemingly <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-hard-r-not-fully-open-world-2024-2025/"><strong>ditching the open-world</strong></a> of <em>Marvel's Spider-Man</em>, <em>Marvel's Wolverine</em> will take <strong>a third-person action adventure route</strong> where players control the legendary Logan, explore a variety of locations, meet an ensemble cast of Marvel Comics characters, and gruesomely take down enemies using his <strong>superior strength and Adamantium Claws</strong>. With the vehicle traversal and varied locations teased in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/">last year's gameplay trailer</a></strong>, there are plenty of reasons to be excited about the game.</p>



<p>With <strong>Sony's first-party premier action-adventure game series not receiving new entries this year</strong>, <em>Marvel's Wolverine</em> is undoubtedly <strong>the game to look out for for fans of the genre</strong>, even those who aren't too keen on the Marvel Comics universe.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> voice actor Ned Luke - aka Michael de Santa - got swatted for the eighth time over Xmas. I don’t mean that somebody belted him on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper. I mean that somebody put in a hoax call to emergency services in a bid to have armed police sent to his house. The latest incident happened this December while Luke was streaming GTA Online with Rob Wiethoff, the voice of John Marston in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>.

<p>“Swatting” is, obviously, <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/first-ever-uk-swatting-sentence-passed-after-man-shot-in-face-by-armed-unit-due-to-hoax-call-13118559">very dangerous</a> in a country like the USA, where there are more guns than humans and the police are especially well-armed. It has gotten <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ks/pr/ohio-gamer-pleads-guilty-swatting-caused-death">a couple</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tennessee-man-targeted-his-twitter-handle-dies-after-swatting-call-n1274747">of people</a> killed, that I know about.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the cops seem pretty relaxed in the footage, possibly because they’re aware that Luke is a frequent target of such malevolent pranking - indeed, one of them can be heard saying "you've been swatted again". If it were me, I’d be lying on the floor nonetheless with all limbs extended at 45 degree angles, but Luke just gets up with a sigh and says hello to the fuzz, then goes back to playing GTA Online for an hour and a half. I guess it’s just as well he didn’t answer the door in character for Michael.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-5-voice-actor-ned-luke-swatted-police-live-streaming-twitch-2000655992">Kotaku</a>, Luke says he was repeatedly swatted in late 2023, after his address was leaked online, and that at one point, the police ordered him to step outside his house. He's also initiated legal proceedings against some of the swatters, with one person due <a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown/status/2004926105275498972">to appear in court for sentencing</a> this month - we'll keep an eye out for that, I guess. It’s not clear there’s any real motivation for Luke's repeated swatting, beyond random people being spiteful.</p>
<p>This feels like the kind of morbid present-day cultural phenomena the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> should parody, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6s-wholesome-boris-bike-docking-revealed-in-alleged-wip-rockstar-portfolio-video">Boris Bikes</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-appears-to-have-its-own-florida-man-parody">Florida Man</a>, but then again, that would only be encouraging the arseholes.

              <p>Buying a new desktop computer can be a bit of a bear, especially if you want something that can both save you some space and money. But because we’re here to help, we’ve found something that satisfies both conditions and then some: the KAMRUI AM21 Mini Desktop wth an AMD Ryzen 7 processor.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6659/">You can purchase the KAMRUI AM21 Mini Desktop for $499 from Amazon (originally priced at $699), which nets you a discount of $200 or 29% off.</a> That’s nothing to sneeze at, so if you’re ready to plunk your cold, hard cash down on, it’s go time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6659/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A mini PC that has all the bells and whistles of its larger cousin</h2>
<p>The KAMRUI AM21 Mini Desktop features an AMD Ryzen 7 8745HS processor, 32GB of DDR5 5600 MHz memory, and a 1TB M.2 2280 NVME PCIe 4.0 SSD in a space-saving desktop chassis. This is an 8-core, 16-thread chip that runs up to 4.9 GHz and has integrated Radeon 780M graphics that provide smooth 1080P gaming resources. In other words, it’s deceptively powerful, despite its small size. And that means you can put it just about anywhere and still expect some serious performance.</p>
<p>Storage begins with a 1 TB M.2 2280 NVMe PCIe 4.0 x4 SSD, but there are two M.2 2280 slots available for expansion. These can accommodate up to 4 TB of NVMe storage. Although the listing mentions that SATA SSD expansion is not supported, users will need to utilize NVMe SSDs when expanding their storage.</p>



<p>This mini-desktop ships with Windows 11 Pro, KAMRUI Care support, and Amazon’s standard product support options. That means there are tons of ways to get help, so if you find yourself needing it, it’s there for you. You never know what kinds of issues can crop up when you’re setting up a new computer.</p>
<p>Pound for pound, this is a small but mighty computer that can replace a typical desktop or laptop, depending on which one you use regularly. And you can’t forget how much you’re saving on it, as well as how small it is in comparison to the commonly-accepted desktops on the market. You can get a ton done with it, and then some. Then you’ll even have some money left over to buy accessories or other items should you need to finish outfitting your work area. Or your casual home office, whichever ends up becoming true.</p>
<p>If your New Year’s resolution is to get a better PC that can improve your productivity and make things easier, this is an excellent pick. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6659/">Just act quickly, because this deal likely won’t be around for long, and it isn’t the type of discount you’ll not want to sink your teeth into.</a></p>

<p>A new claim reveals that NVIDIA plans to re-release their GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs to counter the ongoing memory shortage. </p>



<p>The GPU market has been suffering from a memory shortage recently, ever since AI has blown up worldwide. We have already heard reports on how it’s going to impact NVIDIA, with some claiming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-prices-to-5000-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prices will get ridiculous</a> in 2026. Now, a new claim reveals how NVIDIA plans to counter this issue.</p>







<h2 id="h-nvidia-is-reportedly-re-releasing-geforce-rtx-3060-to-counter-ongoing-memory-shortages">NVIDIA is Reportedly Re-Releasing GeForce RTX 3060 to Counter Ongoing Memory Shortages</h2>



<p>The new claim about NVIDIA bringing back GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs comes from <a href="https://x.com/hongxing2020/status/2008043115308065078" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hongxing2020</a> on X (formerly Twitter), via <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-to-bring-back-geforce-rtx-3060-q1-2026-tackle-memory-shortages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech</a>. The tweet from today only states that NVIDIA is re-releasing GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs along with an expected release window of Q1 2026. However, no additional details were provided, so we don’t know whether they will release one of the variants or both 12GB and 8GB versions when it is expected to arrive. Additionally, no pricing was revealed either. </p>



<p>The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 was released back in 2021 and was built on the Ampere Architecture. The GPU was also packed with other gaming features such as Ray Tracing, NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex, and much more. There were 192-bit 12GB GPUs and 128-bit 8GB GPUs, both featuring GDDR6 memory configurations. The GPU launched at USD $329 when it was released, and players are hoping it returns at a similar price. </p>







<p>In other news, the memory shortage could lead NVIDIA to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-cutting-rtx-50-series-production-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut RTX 50 series</a> production this year. Additionally, an ARC Raiders backpack had single-handedly crashed the NVIDIA website last month. What are your thoughts on NVIDIA re-releasing RTX 3060 GPUs in 2026?

            <title><![CDATA[Can You Preload Hytale Early Access Before Launch?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-preload-hytale-early-access-before-launch/</link>
            <guid>1397119</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The long wait for the release of Hytale is coming to a close, with the eagerly anticipated early access release now right around the corner, and if you have questions about the preload status, Insider Gaming has all the crucial information.</p>



<p>Hytale’s early access release is<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> set for January 13 on PC</a>, and thousands of players are expected to dive into the Minecraft-inspired title as soon as they possibly can, which may lead to strain on the servers.</p>



<p>That may lead to slow downloads for players, with preload a potential way to avoid such issues, and this guide explains whether the option is available for Hytale.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-hytale-have-a-preload-option">Does Hytale Have a Preload Option?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Roaring onto the scene. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is no preload option available for Hytale. You will need to wait for the early access release on January 13 to download the game in full.</strong></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HytaleInfo/comments/1psbpco/preload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit </a>post covering the topic, a fan responded with details of the lack of preload available in Hytale, with a developer stating that it “would require more system to be built to decrypt downloads” and they “don’t have the capacity for it.”</p>



<p>The good news, however, is that it shouldn’t take too long to download Hytale when early access becomes available, as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">system requirements</a> for the game state an installation size of around 8GB. However, it’s recommended to have at least 10 GB of available storage, with 20 GB stated to be a safe bet.</p>



<p>As Hyutale procedurally generates a world that can continue to expand, the more you explore, customize, and build, the more memory will be required.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-hytale-have-a-preload-option-in-the-future">Will Hytale Have a Preload Option in The Future?</h2>



<p><strong>Hytale may have a preload option in the future when major updates are rolled out, allowing you to download the newest content for the game before the servers are live with new content, but this is speculative at this point.</strong></p>



<p>Many live-services games allow players to pre-download major updates before they are able to play them, with major examples including Fortnite, and this approach means players are able to dive into enjoying content as soon as the servers are back online.</p>



<p>At this stage, however, it’s not known what approach Hytale will take, particularly in early access, given that new patches are expected to deploy bug fixes and new content regularly.</p>

                <p>Through most of last year, IO Interactive assured players that its upcoming James Bond title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007 First Light</a>, was set for an early 2026 debut. The game had been scheduled to debut on March 27, but the release date has now been pushed back to May 27.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/2003511022141817016" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a statement posted online</a> late last month, IO Interactive's Hakan Abrak called 007 First Light the company's "most ambitious project to date" while mentioning the Bond staples included in the game like car chases, gadgets, and wild globe-trotting adventure. However, he went on to say that the decision to delay it "allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one."</p><p>"The game is progressing well and is fully playable from beginning to end," added Abrak. "So these two additional months will allow us to further polish and refine the experience, ensuring we deliver the strongest possible version at launch. We're confident this sets 007 First Light up for long-term success, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and continued support we've received ever since we first announced the game."</p><p>In November 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-dev-reacts-to-gta-6-delay-and-explains-why-the-game-is-good-for-the-industry/1100-6536420/" data-ref-id="1100-6536420">Abrak spoke about GTA 6's delay</a> and why he thinks it was a good thing for 007 First Light and the industry in general. The new game features Patrick Gibson as a much younger James Bond than the character is usually portrayed, and the story will introduce a new origin for 007.</p><p>007 First Light narrative director Martin Emborg recently told GameSpot that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-knows-the-key-ingredient-to-a-great-james-bond-adventure/1100-6537117/" data-ref-id="1100-6537117">Lenny Kravitz's pirate king Bawma</a> won't be the only villain featured in the game. He also highlighted Kravitz's role in the creation of the character.</p><p>"We knew the character of Bawma was a larger-than-life, colorful character," said Emborg. "So, when Lenny came on board, he helped shape the character in a big way. He's had a major impact on Bawma; The cool outfit, the character traits, the backstory, all of these things we went back and forth and crafted this character together. We designed the character in cooperation with him."</p><p>007 First Light will be available on Switch 2, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

            <guid>1397098</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="552">Drones come in a crazy wide range of styles and performance levels for a variety of use cases. Some of the more affordable options are essentially just toys, ideal for casual fun at parties or for quick park outings with friends. This is not one of those drones. The DJI Mavic 4 Pro is a premium-grade model specifically built for professional aerial photography and videography. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6658/">Normally priced at $2,699 on Amazon, it’s currently available for a reduced price of $2,199—a $500 discount. Kick off the new year with an awesome new piece of tech.</a></p>
<p data-start="554" data-end="1321">For professionals seeking a versatile drone, the DJI Mavic 4 Pro is exceptional. This model features three distinct cameras. First, there’s a 28mm Hasselblad camera that boasts a massive 100MP resolution, perfect for wide-angle shots. Additionally, a 70mm medium telephoto camera offers 48MP, and a 168mm telephoto camera provides 50MP for capturing detailed close-ups from a distance. With the combination of the main lens and two telephoto lenses, you can achieve sharp, high-quality zoom shots, as well as breathtaking wide shots. The dynamic 360-degree gimbal system ensures smooth, stable camera movement, whether you’re shooting cinematic sequences for a film or broadcasting live sports events.</p>

<p data-start="1323" data-end="1624">Tracking your subject with precision is key for drone photography, and the DJI Mavic 4 Pro makes this easier than ever. The ActiveTrack system enables 360-degree vehicle tracking, allowing the drone to follow moving subjects from as far as 200 meters away, all while maintaining awareness of its surroundings.</p>
<p data-start="1626" data-end="1915">The included DJI RC 2 controller enhances the flying experience with its 7-inch, bright, and rotatable screen, making it easy to monitor your footage while keeping your focus on the drone’s performance. The controller is also collapsible, making storage and transportation more convenient.</p>


<h2>Fly Safely, Even at Night</h2>
<p data-start="1917" data-end="2309">The DJI Mavic 4 Pro is capable of capturing stunning visuals even in low-light environments. Thanks to its 0.1-Lux nightscape omnidirectional obstacle sensor, the drone can detect nearby objects in the dark, preventing potential collisions even when visibility is limited. This makes it an excellent option for shooting after the sun sets or in dimly lit conditions.</p>
<p data-start="2311" data-end="2721">The Mavic 4 Pro offers an impressive flight time of up to 51 minutes on a single charge, giving you ample time to capture long, cinematic shots. It also comes with 64GB of onboard storage, which can be expanded up to 512GB if needed. You can easily transfer photos and videos to your smartphone via the DJI Fly app, with transfer speeds of up to 80MB/s, all without having to remove the SD card from the drone.</p>
<p data-start="2723" data-end="2905" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6658/">Now is the perfect time to get the DJI Mavic 4 Pro as it sits with a significant $500 discount.</a> Take advantage of this limited-time offer and elevate your aerial photography and videography game.</p>

            <p>Cubey sandbox crafter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> launches into early access next Tuesday, January 13th, after a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">dicey few months</a> in which it was cancelled, bought out by the original developers, and revived like a majestic square-beaked phoenix. It’ll also have a native Linux version, allowing anyone fed up with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-most-important-pc-gaming-news-stories-in-2026">Microsoft’s continued bullshit</a> to play it on a system running something that <em>isn’t</em> an increasingly bloated or prematurely abandoned Windows.</p>
<p>There are caveats, mind. In a <a href="https://x.com/slikey/status/2006774600491827296">Xitter post</a> announcing the Linux version, Hypixel co-founder and tech director Kevin Carstens – well spotted by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/01/native-linux-support-for-hytale-will-be-launched-as-experimental/">Gaming on Linux</a> – stresses that it’ll be an "experimental" endeavour, potentially susceptible to bugs specific to different distributions (sub-versions) of the open-source OS. And the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, which runs the Linux-based SteamOS, is in a trickier position still. Carstens explains that limited testing on a docked Deck, with the handheld aided by a mouse and keyboard, suggests it can run local singleplayer fine, though it’s "not officially recommended" as a Hytale-playing device as the game currently lacks controller support.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's easy to see this as the latest move in a campaign of expectation management on Hypixel’s part, the newly minted developer-owners having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-early-access-release-date-set-in-stone-for-january-2026-but-its-devs-admit-the-first-impression-will-be-rough">previously warned</a> that Hytale is "still very much unfinished and broken", as well as electing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-wont-be-on-steam-right-away-as-its-devs-want-to-avoid-overindexing-on-negative-reviews-from-players-who-arent-as-well-informed-yet">not to release on Steam</a> until it’s been hammered into better shape. Broadly, though, this is still good news for Linux PC owners. It remains a rarity for games to get full-blooded native ports, and even a buggy Linux version can sidestep the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-have-killed-apex-legends-steam-deck-support-in-the-name-of-anti-cheat">pitfalls</a> of running a Windows game on a compatibility layer, as the Steam Deck does for most of its playable catalogue.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t count the Deck out entirely, though. It’s apparently already cleared the performance hurdle – Hytale is "well playable" on it, according to Carstens – and considering that the Java version of fellow block-manipulator Minecraft can be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-minecraft-on-steam-deck">tweaked and tuned</a> to run on Valve’s portable PC, despite its own lack of controller/gamepad support, it’s not outside the realm of possibility that Hytale could find a similarly custom-built solution. At the very least, Linux compatibility bodes well for the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a>, which also runs SteamOS and adopts a PC-like box design that lends itself better to mouse and keyboard piloting. It even <em>looks</em> a little like a Hytale block.</p>

<p>Steam hardware surveys indicate <a href="https://www.club386.com/steam-hardware-survey-shows-how-linux-is-slowly-eating-into-windows-market-share/">Linux usage grew slightly in 2025</a>, amid widespread (and vocal) consumer dissatisfaction with Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nearly-a-third-of-all-gaming-pcs-are-still-running-windows-10-even-as-microsoft-prepare-to-kill-it">shuttering of Windows 10</a>, stuffing of Windows 11 with unwanted and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-detail-agentic-ai-plan-for-windows-11-immediately-admit-it-might-install-malware-on-your-pc">potentially dangerous AI 'features'</a>, and questionable military contracts. While I’m not aboard the boycott train just yet, the possibility of freeing myself from the Redmond monopoly is becoming more and more attractive, especially when more and more developers are taking Linux seriously as an alternative. And when it’s just not nearly as rubbish for games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-problems-we-had-with-gaming-on-linux">as it used to be</a>.</p>
<p>But what say you, reader? Should we be paying more attention to Linux, potentially outside the relatively 'big' SteamOS developments? Here’s a poll – let us know. Feed us with data, that we may all be nourished.</p>

            <p>Gerry from the River rides up to a noticeboard. Between contracts, he scans the pinned scraps for a fresh job to take on, only for his eyes to rest on one particularly peculiar bit of prose. 'There's a mysterious extra DLC for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> in the works', this bit of paper claims. 'Oh, you mean <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-3s-final-patch-delivering-cross-platform-mod-support-has-been-delayed-until-2026">that anniversary patch</a> which was delayed last year?' Gerry's mutant brain asks in response. 'No, seemingly not that one,' the sentient scrap replies.</p>
<p>Gerry grumbles to himself in mild confusion. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s a decade old at this point, and while CD's love of relentlessly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-latest-patch-disengages-autodrives-sticky-handbrake-and-gives-it-a-pass-to-run-every-red-light">adding more stuff</a> to their games is well-documented, they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-plan-to-release-the-witcher-4-5-6-within-six-years-of-one-another-and-oh-are-those-pigs-flying">surely busy</a> focusing on the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2</a>?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Yet, the bit of paper, symbolising reporting from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-there-really-going-to-be-a-2026-witcher-3-expansion">Europeanvideogamer</a> which cites claims by Polish industry whisper hearer Borys Nieśpielak, remains adamant such a thing is coming. Having initially claimed that an extra Witcher 3 DLC was in the works at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-remake">Witcher 1 Remake</a> developers Fool's Theory last summer, Nieśpielak's latest comments on the subject see him stick to his guns and point to a comment from CD Projekt's <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">latest financial report</a> published late last year.</p>
<p>Said comment is from CD Projekt chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz, and came at the end of a discussion about the company's potential to achieve the upcoming moneymaking targets they've set. "Given our current progress, there is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year, having an impact on our results," the finance fellow said, not shedding any more light on said content.</p><p>Outside of Nieśpielak's claims and the vague financial report chat, a <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk">Polish investing site</a> has reportedly cited Mateusz Chrzanowski - an analyst at investing firm <a href="https://noblesecurities.pl/">Noble Securities</a> - as having predicted "the next paid add-on (DLC) for The Witcher 3" to be released in May 2026.</p>
<p>Gerry from the River thinks, scratching his white whiskers. It's all very strange. What would such a DLC even feature, assuming it's more than just a few extra bits of gear or similar stuff? A quest similar in scope to the brief mission added to the game with 2022's next-gen update, this time tying in with The Witcher 4 rather than Netflixy witchering?</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077's last few patches were pretty vehicle/transport heaving in terms of their additions, so maybe the option to take a scenic cart ride along the roads of the Northern Kingdoms if that's anything to go by? Perhaps the integration of some more popular mod - no, wait, that's it. The new mode of transport is <a href="https://www.vg247.com/witcher-3-mod-geralt-centaur-horse-man">this weird mod</a> which allows Geralt to run around as a half-man, half-horse centaur after blowing a magic horn finally being added to official Witcher canon. Then, boom, The Witcher 4 rocks up and Ciri's developed the ability to grow hooves on command, going on to have neigh problem founding the first Witcher school of the horse, much to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/turns-out-a-relatively-important-plot-point-in-the-witcher-games-shouldnt-exist-at-all-so-says-the-books-author">the chagrin of Andrzej Sapkowski</a>.</p>
<p>Its secrets are stolen and animal melding magic becomes the latest problem to threaten The Continent, as mages begin taping bear claws and wolf mouths to themselves. To save the world, Ciri has to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Witcher3/comments/18s8fzg/do_ya_think_that_this_was_allusion_to_cyberpunk/">travel into Cyberpunk 2077 again</a> and have a set of mantis blades installed to teach these misbehaving magicians who's boss. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekts-mysterious-project-hadar-is-now-their-research-focus-as-cyberpunk-2-and-witcher-4-gather-steam">Project Hadar</a> turns out to be the first game in a third CD Projekt series in which we follow a modern day half-dog Keanu Reeves as he tries to drag society away from a future of dystopian metropolises and instead towards a park-centric system of governance inspired by the game of fetch.</p>
<p>Or maybe it'll just be a couple of new swords, Gerry thinks as he gallops off to hunt another monster.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-hits-all-time-low-with-controller-included-to-clear-out-stock-while-playstation-stays-at-full-price-2000656517</link>
            <guid>1397083</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="518">If the holidays came and went without the new gaming console you were hoping to unwrap, Amazon is offering a solid second chance to treat yourself. Right now, you can pick up the Xbox Series X and finally experience Microsoft’s most powerful console in stunning 4K. The standard retail price for the Xbox Series X has recently settled at $650, but for a limited time, Amazon is discounting it by 8%. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6384/">That price drop knocks $50 off the total, bringing the console down to $600—a meaningful savings given today’s market.</a></p>
<p data-start="520" data-end="1351">Okay, let’s pause for a moment to get a lesson on Xbox Series X’s unusual pricing history. When Microsoft launched the Xbox Series X alongside the Series S back in 2020, the flagship console carried a $500 price tag. That price held steady for years, which is typical for console generations. However, in May 2025, Microsoft announced a price increase, bumping the Series X up by $100 to $600. Just a few months later, the company raised the price again, pushing it to $650. This makes the current generation one of the rare cases where console prices have increased rather than dropped over time. With that context in mind, Amazon’s current deal effectively brings the Series X back to its 2025 spring and summer pricing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6384/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="1353" data-end="1819">Xbox Series X vs. Xbox Series S</h2>
<p data-start="1353" data-end="1819">When comparing the Xbox Series X to its more budget-friendly sibling, the Xbox Series S, the reasons for the price difference become clear. One of the biggest advantages of the Series X is its ability to run games in native 4K resolution. While both consoles support high refresh rates of up to 120 frames per second and HDR visuals, the Series X is built for players who want the sharpest image quality possible on modern displays.</p>
<p data-start="1821" data-end="2145">Another major distinction is the inclusion of a disc drive on the Series X. This is a big deal for players who prefer owning physical copies of their games or who already have a collection of discs. Beyond gaming, the console can also double as a Blu-ray player, making it a useful addition to your home entertainment setup.</p>


<p data-start="2147" data-end="2690">Both the Xbox Series X and Series S rely on Microsoft’s Xbox Velocity Architecture, which is responsible for the fast load times that define this console generation. This technology also powers Quick Resume, a feature that lets you suspend and switch between multiple games. Instead of closing out a game and rebooting it to the start screen later, Quick Resume saves your exact progress and returns you to the same spot when you jump back in. It’s especially convenient if you like to bounce between different games without worrying about finding a save point every time.</p>
<p data-start="2692" data-end="2971">The Xbox Series X also functions as a complete media hub. You can download popular streaming apps like YouTube, Netflix, HBO Max, and Dropout, and enjoy supported content in full 4K with HDR.</p>
<p data-start="2973" data-end="3476" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">To get the most out of the Xbox ecosystem, Game Pass Ultimate is well worth considering. The subscription includes online multiplayer through Xbox Live and access to a massive library of games you can download and play at any time. It’s often compared to Netflix, but for video games. One standout title in the Game Pass catalog is the critically acclaimed <em data-start="3330" data-end="3359">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. With numerous awards and glowing reviews, it’s a great example of the value Game Pass offers right out of the gate. You can hit the ground running with one of the best titles to come out last year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil 4's helpless companion character Ashley was once planned to star in a newly-designed intro made for Capcom's acclaimed remake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everyone knows by now how Resident Evil 4 opens: with fan-favorite character Leon S. Kennedy thrown into the action as he investigates the abduction of Ashley Graham, the U.S. president's daughter. And in the final version of the brilliant <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a>, this is again how the game begins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Capcom planned — and at least partially built — a new introduction sequence dubbed Chapter 0 which would have seen players sneak around as Ashley, before she's finally dragged off by brainwashed ganados. And now, a fresh video showing some of the mission has been put together.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ashley's Chapter 0 would have taken place in an expanded version of the forested area outside the game's main village, close to where Leon is ultimately seen creeping along at the beginning of the remake. A snippet of this survived in a trailer for the remake, where Ashley witnesses a grisly ritual sacrifice prior to getting captured. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The non-combat mission sees Ashley sneak along, hiding from a patrolling ganado, and spotting another who is carrying Luis — presumably to the basement where Leon finds him later. But, ultimately, we all know Ashley is going to get captured — something that, after a brief chase sequence, we then see play out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're keen to see the remains of this mission in action, modder Michael "Thekempy" Kemp has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXI-MrzgZXU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> of its surviving elements — though it seems like much of the mission was unfinished, or removed from the game's final version.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Resident Evil Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Resident Evil 4 remake features plenty of extra sequences not found in the original Resi 4, it's easy to see why this one fell by the wayside. It's hard to imagine anyone being surprised by Ashley's capture, since that sets up the whole game, and the character already has her own short sections of gameplay later on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there's the fact that Ashley is, well, not loved by some Resident Evil fans. The Resi 4 remake goes some way to making her less of a damsel in distress, but it's perhaps unsurprising that Capcom ultimately chose not to open the game with her, rather than simply letting players jump straight in to Leon's mission.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Resident Evil 4 remake is the series' most relentlessly exciting adventure rebuilt, refined, and realised to the full extent of its enormous potential," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4-remake-review">Resident Evil 4 Remake review</a>, scoring it 10/10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

<figure data-uuid="bcbf723b45c63"><a title="Lego Game Boy 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bcbf723b45c63/lego-game-boy-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Lego Game Boy has, to be expected, proven to be a smash hit with Nintendo fans, and has no doubt been a blisteringly hot product over the Christmas period.</p>
<p>But it seems as though many folks have forgotten what a Game Boy cartridge actually looks like, as photos cropping up online showcase the Lego cartridges with the top panel placed in the centre, not offset to the left as it should be (thanks, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lego-nintendo-game-boy-set-cartridge-mistake-indent-piece-center/">Polygon</a>).</p>
<p>Look, it's an easy mistake to make, especially since <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/1pw67vd/even_the_gameboy_box_art_has_the_cart_wrong/">one of the official images</a> from Lego itself shows the cartridge in its incorrect state. As such, we're not going to call out anyone by linking out to a specific post online – that's just mean, y'know?</p>
<p>It's also entirely possible that those building the cartridges incorrectly might be on the younger side and perhaps have never seen a real Game Boy in the flesh. Though to be honest, we feel like those interested in this build will be older folks who want to tap into a bit of nostalgia.</p>
<p>Either way, if you happen to have built the Lego Game Boy set and maybe gotten the cartridges a bit wrong, then hopefully this post will set you straight. And at the end of the day, there's really no right or wrong way to do it – it's your Lego set, so enjoy it however you like!</p>

<p>It’s shaping up to be another big year for Nintendo, and one of the earliest releases of 2026 is the 3.0 update for Animal Crossing: New Horizons and the Switch 2 edition, with the full details of the release date and start times in this guide.</p>



<p>Though it turns six in Spring, having initially released in March 2020, New Horizons continues to be one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-nintendo-switch-games-to-gift-christmas-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Switch games available</a>, and the drop of new content will keep fans occupied until the inevitable release of the next game in the Animal Crossing series.</p>



<p>If you’re eagerly awaiting the Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 update and Switch 2 edition, Insider Gaming has all the release date details, along with the expected start times.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-amp-switch-2-edition-release">When Does Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 &amp; Switch 2 Edition Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Squad up. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Nintendo announced the Switch 2 edition of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and the accompanying 3.0 free update, will be released simultaneously on January 15.</strong></p>



<p>The Switch 2 edition brings graphics enhancements, including 4k resolution, to the game, alongside online support for up to 12 players at a time, a 3x increase on the maximum number of players supported in the game on the original Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Those without a Switch 2 console will still benefit from the update, however, as there’s an array of new content to enjoy, including the Resort Hotel with customizable rooms, tasks to craft special island goods, expanded storage space, and new collaboration items with the likes of LEGO, Nintendo, The Legend of Zelda, and Splatoon.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-does-animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-amp-switch-2-edition-release">What Time Does Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 &amp; Switch 2 Edition Release?</h2>



<p><strong>The exact start time for the release of the Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 update and Switch 2 edition has not been confirmed. However, previous update times suggest the new content will be available from 8 pm ET on January 14.</strong></p>



<p>The January 15 date covers the Japanese release of the update, which means players in the United States should be able to play on the evening of January 14, while those in the UK and Europe will likely see the update drop in the early hours of the morning of January 15.</p>



<p>The estimated release time is based on previous major Animal Crossing: New Horizons updates, including the 2.0 edition; however, that release was almost four years ago, so the timings could be tweaked. This article will be updated if an official release time is confirmed.</p>



<p>In the table below, you can see the expected release time and date for the Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 and Switch 2 edition across major time zones.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> developer Sandfall will focus on what those at the studio personally think is "cool" for its next game, rather than feel any pressure to focus on what anyone else thinks it should do.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was met with widespread acclaim on its release last year, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">rounded out 2025 by scooping up the coveted Game of the Year accolade at The Game Awards</a>. This success has meant many eyes are now on Sandfall and what the studio will do next, with plenty of high expectations.</p>
<p>So, has this pressure changed how those at the studio will approach the developer's next game? Well, according to Sandfall's chief operating officer and production director François Meurisse, this new-found pressure is "not so important to us".</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=2961&amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;clickref=grd-gb-3689496626345421370&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.magazinesdirect.com%2Fuk%2Fedge-subscription%2Fdp%2F39f150bb">Edge magazine</a>, Meurisse said Sandfall already has "some great ideas" which it is "excited to explore". He also noted the studio isn't starting "from the same point" that it was when it began work on Clair Obscur. "The team already has five more years of experience. So maybe we can do some great stuff," he said (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-next-game-will-simply-focus-on-what-we-think-is-cool-ive-seen-too-many-tv-shows-and-books-be-swayed-trying-to-please-a-lot-of-people/">GamesRadar</a>).</p><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen added she is "a bit of a people pleaser", and therefore it is "always in the back of [her] mind that we have a lot of fans now, and they have certain expectations and certain feelings towards the game". She admitted she would be kidding herself and us if she said she "didn't think about that" from time to time. However even though this may be the case, she said the team's creative "North Star" will always be its "own personal taste" in terms of what it thinks "is cool", and what the team itself enjoys.</p>
<p>"I've seen too many TV shows and books be swayed trying to please a lot of people, and in the process you end up losing the heart of what's there," Clair Obscur's lead writer said.</p>
<p>"So [we] feel like we need to trust our instincts and continue to trust the vision behind the studio."</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, the success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was publicly acknowledged once again by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-publicly-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-calling-the-game-of-the-year-win-a-historic-first">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>, who said its Game of the Year win was a source of "great pride for Montpellier and for France".</p><p>During the awards show last month, developer Sandfall Interactive announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-expansion-is-available-right-now-adding-a-photo-mode-and-vibrant-new-world">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's previously teased expansion was available for all players</a>. While of course a welcome addition for the many fans out there, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fans-cant-get-over-just-how-difficult-the-updates-new-bosses-and-challenges-are-now">this expansion and its bosses have proven tricky for some</a>.</p>
<p>For more, I recently spoke with actor Maxence Cazorla - who performed the physical side of things for Clair Obscur's Gustave, Renoir and Verso, and voiced Esquie - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-characters-a-life-changing-experience-and-the-mysterious-project-w-for-maxence-cazorla-expedition-33-is-more-than-just-a-game-of-the-year-contender">about his work on Expedition 33, and what the game has meant to him personally</a>.</p>

            <p>
Before we begin the year’s first round-up of new PC game releases, an apology: we skipped feeding the Maw for one whole week back in December. In a deceptively carefree comment, I explained that I had too much seasonal blogmange to prepare, but this was actually a PR excuse to minimise hysteria. You see, back in November <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-a-skating-demon-tries-to-eat-the-moon-and-terminator-game-appropriately-rewrites-history">the Maw ate me</a>, and I have only just exited its digestive system. During past emergencies, I’ve done this by hooking onto gumlines and working my way from tonsil to tonsil. This time I forgot to bring my climbing axes, and was obliged to escape in… the other direction.
</p>
<p>
It is best not to share more. Thankfully, the Maw’s internal odours are only smellable in the 11th through 17th dimensions, though they can still be detected in Normie Spacetime – you may have noticed that all the reflections are pinstriped today. Anyway, now that I’ve properly explained the break in service, let’s gingerly dip our still-reeking fingers into the spumes of commerce. 
</p><!--more-->
<h2>Monday 5th January</h2>
<ul>
<li>Last year was all about horses. This year, perhaps, is the year of crabs. Step forward (or more likely, sideways) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1833200/DuneCrawl/">Dunecrawl</a>, in which you and up to three other players roam a desert open world atop weaponised crustaceans.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 6th January</h2>
<ul><li>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4009730/Feed_the_Reactor/">Feed The Reactor</a> is an incremental clicker in which you drop different types of fuel into a cosmic vortex. Generating energy helps you level up the reactor and unpeel the narrative layers of a “strange galaxy”. An alien fishperson complains that they are always at war with Crustacea. See, crabs again.</li>
<li>Trigger-happy Satisfactory players and the mayoral kind of Helldiver might appreciate <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1631270/StarRupture/">StarRupture</a>, an early access game from the Green Hell devs in which you build outposts on planets and defend them against swarms of… crablike monsters?!?</li>
<li>There are 19 bosses in the fetchingly ghastly pixelart metroidvania <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2741830/Death_Machine/">Death Machine</a> and surely at least one of them is an invertebrate with eight legs, a carapace and large pincers.</li></ul>
<h2>Wednesday 7th January</h2>
<ul><li>Our next two offerings come from the worryingly crab-agnostic Julian. Firstly, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2896260/ODDCORE/">Oddcore</a> - a deranged and fizzy FPS theme park of backroom spaces and dysfunctional corpo messaging. Seems lovely. No obvious crab presence though. Stop resisting progress, Julian.</li>
<li>Now this is more like it. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3791450/EvoCreo/">EvoCreo</a> is a creature collector with old school console (specifically, I’m thinking Game Boy Advance) graphics and turn-based combat. There are over 170 critters or Creos to bosh and bag. If one of the Creos isn’t a crab, I am going to call the Pokémon Company and complain that ilmfinity aren't ripping them off correctly.
</li></ul>
<h2>Thursday 8th January</h2>
<ul><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1933930/Ancient_Farm/">Ancient Farm</a> is an ancient farm simulator set in ancient Egypt. The wily bastards at A2 Softworks thought they could shirk their obligations to crabs by setting this on dry land, but then they slipped up and added rivers. Acanthothelphusa niloticus is coming for your ass, A2.</li></ul>
<h2>
Friday 9th January</h2>
<ul><li>If you were hoping for a feelgood game to close out the dingy first week of January, tough luck, you’re getting Ice-Pick Lodge’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-3">Pathologic 3</a> instead. 12 days to save the worst town bar possibly Silent Hill from a nightmare disease. Impose quarantines and roadblocks. Examine pustulating torsos. “Struggle to balance mania and apathy”. If there are crabs in this, they are the kind that live in your pubic hair. 
</li></ul>
<p>
Other vidyagame happenings this week: it’s time for another helping of hardware tradeshow CES in Las Vegas. James has set up a very large telescope on the Treehouse roof, and is combing the stalls for talk of GPU and RAM price changes, new screen formats, and novelty alarm clocks. For the most part, though, we’ll be spending this week firming up coverage plans for 2026. Like migrating Cuban red crabs, we must throw ourselves into the seas of discourse, striving to lay our writing-eggs before the tides return us to the shore.

            <title><![CDATA[Our Most Wanted Games of 2026 – #35 to #31]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/05/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-35-to-31/</link>
            <guid>1397041</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you’re reading this, then you’re surely wracking your brains and trying to remember all of the games that have been announced for 2026. Some of the big guns are easy to remember, and we’ll get to those later, but the breadth and depth of the games industry makes thinking of more than a dozen pretty tricky. So, we’ve opened up our book of dates, consulted with our filofax and card references, put boots on ground and feet up on desk, and come up with another five games you should keep an eye on. We have another ecletic mix of games from street racing to horror, sprinkled with some superheroes and supervillains beating each other up.</p>
<h2>35 – Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</h2>
<p><em>PS5, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a> was one of the biggest surprises announced in 2025. A 4v4 tag team fighter is not something that anyone was expecting for Marvel, Sony and Arc System Works to collaborate on, but from the first glimpses of gameplay, it looks amazing.</p>
<p><iframe title="MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6fbfrV5qqnU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Since the announcement of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, Arc System Works has hosted a closed beta so players could try it out, but the team has been quiet on who else will be on the roster. We still only have the initial eight from the announcement trailer with those being Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Miss Marvel, Star Lord, Ghost Rider, Dr Doom, and Storm. Hopefully, we will not have to wait too long to get a release date and more roster reveals in 2026.</p>

<h2>34 – Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 16th April 2026</em></p>
<p>Developer Big Bad Wolf is one of many game developers in recent years that has looked to Lovecraft for inspiration, and who can blame them when Lovecraftian horror has such an appeal to audiences? Big Bad Wolf’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/06/cthulhu-the-cosmic-abyss-launches-an-occult-interpol-investigation-in-2026/">Cthulu: The Cosmic Abyss</a> takes us to a future where in the year 2053 occult events are occurring more regularly, and the planet’s resources are scarce making companies explore the ocean floor for new opportunities. Unfortunately, those two events collide.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ThN3eSfWqUo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss you play as occult investigator Noah who is investigating the disappearance of miners in the Pacific Ocean. This investigation leads Noah and his AI companion Key to the lost city of R’lyeh, where Cthulu’s influence is strong and will warp Noah’s mind too, affecting how you go about investigating clues and solving the puzzle of what’s happened.</p>
<h2>33 – Screamer</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 23rd March 2026</em></p>
<p>Milestone is resurrecting the old street racing franchise <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/screamer">Screamer</a>, giving it a much-needed modern upgrade. It is an anime style arcade racer where teams compete against each other in fast cars to win races and take each other out, competing in a tournament to win some prestige and get some answers, which are much needed in the dystopian world.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Screamer - Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lh5ElfqaS74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So far, Milestone has announced five of the teams that make up the competitors including Green Reapers, Strike Force Romanda, Jupiter Stormers, Anaconda Corp, and Kagawa-Kai. Each team has its own distinct style, with each of the three racers in each team having their own cars to use, like colourful cars of Strike Force Romanda who are a former girl group. Screamer is standing out as an arcade racer to keep an eye on.</p>
<h2>32 – Tides of Tomorrow</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 24th February 2026</em></p>
<p>Tides of Tomorrow is an ambitious game which weaves a single player and multiplayer experience together to shape its narrative. The world is already an unpredictable mess in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tides-of-tomorrow">Tides of Tomorrow</a> where deadly plastification is threatening to kill every living thing. It’s a troubling situation made worse by living in a post-apocalyptic flooded world, but as you’re rescued from drowning, you aren’t the first who is given the chance to shape its future. This innovative narrative sees you follow in the footsteps of another player, whose journey through the game’s story before you has left its mark with a rippling impact that can dramatically change what you encounter.</p>

<p>In Tides of Tomorrow, you will have to navigate the water world of Elynd which is filled with various characters that have jobs and tasks for you to complete. You will have to make decisions that will not only impact your own path, but that of others too with your actions impacting their game worlds. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/28/tides-of-tomorrow-preview-youre-not-the-first-player-to-come-through-these-parts/">Tides of Tomorrow Preview,</a>&nbsp;Stefan said, “Tides of Tomorrow is a truly fascinating game, DigixArt blending player choice into the narrative that they’ve constructed, potentially giving dramatically different experiences for every player far beyond gaming’s traditional good and evil playthroughs.” Tides of Tomorrow could prove to be one of the most ambitious narratives of 2026.</p>
<h2>31 – The Blood of Dawnwalker</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBA</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-blood-of-dawnwalker">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a> is the first game from Rebel Wolves, the studio founded by game director of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Konrad Tomaszkiewicz along with CD Projekt RED alumni, including Chief Publishing Officer Tomasz Tinc, and Narrative Director Jakub Szamałek. Having such big names behind it, The Blood of Dawnwalker has high expectations placed on it as a new dark open world RPG.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Blood of Dawnwalker — Cinematic Trailer &amp; Gameplay Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HkICrJEVTjI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Coen is the main character and he is a Dawnwalker, making him part human and part vampire. He has come to be a Dawnwalker after a powerful vampire saves Coen’s sister’s life and takes Coen’s blood as payment. It is not a simple transaction as this vampire wants to rule over humanity. As the Dawnwalker, Coen has two different ability sets depending on the time of day. During the day, Coen is a human and is limited to human skills but at night he gains his vampire powers allowing him to enter different locations and use vampire powers in combat. The world reacts to Coen’s decisions and lack of decisions, shaping how dangerous it is him for him and the people he cares for.</p>
<p><em>That’s it for today, but come back tomorrow where we’ll make it up to the midway point of our Most Wanted games.</em></p>

<figure data-uuid="f14e8073f7421"><a title="Age of Imprisonment" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f14e8073f7421/age-of-imprisonment.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, it seemed almost inevitable that we'd see a new <strong>Hyrule Warriors</strong> title. According to a new interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/898/G089833/20251205029/">4Gamer</a> (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-and-koei-tecmo-explain-how-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-came-to-be/">Nintendo Everything</a>), the folks over at both Nintendo and Koei Tecmo thought the same thing, and so it didn't take long for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> to get the green light.</p>
<p>Nintendo veteran Eiji Aonuma seemed especially confident in Koei Tecmo's interest in the project, stating to TOTK director Hidemaro Fujibayashi that they shouldn't make the first move and instead wait for Koei Tecmo to reach out. As expected, it did so almost immediately after TOTK's release.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2rikmhl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>As for producer Yosuke Hayashi, it only took a weekend of playing TOTK to realise that a game set during the Imprisoning War would be worthwhile. He states that TOTK was "sending us a message" to create a new title, and so he pitched the idea to Ryoyta Matsushita who, coincidentally, had already begun to put a plan together.</p>
<p>Here's a snippet from the interview with Hayashi and Matsushita from Koei Tecmo, and Eiji Aonuma from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hayashi:</strong> We all eagerly awaited the release of Tears of the Kingdom – I personally played the weekend immediately following its release. I felt like the game was sending us a message of something like “Make a Warriors game set in the time of the Imprisoning War!” After the weekend I spoke to Matsushita saying, “Let’s make it!” and we drew up a plan.</p>
<p><strong>Matsushita:</strong> In truth, I had also actually been putting a plan together before he spoke to me (laughs). I felt like the ‘seeds’ of a Warriors game were scattered all over the place.</p>
<p><strong>Aonuma:</strong> On the Nintendo side, during Tears of the Kingdom’s development, Fujibayashi established in detail exactly what the Imprisoning War was. And after it was finished, he said to me, “Maybe we could ask Koei Tecmo this time too?”, but I responded with “No, let’s wait to hear from Koei Tecmo first” (laughs). It was almost immediately after that that they contacted us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Age of Imprisonment turned out to be a roaring success, earning a score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">9/10 in our review</a>. We said that "Lessons have been learned from both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_definitive_edition">Hyrule Warriors</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a>, resulting in a game that balances big-time story with top-notch combat that's got proper depth to it".</p>

            <p>It's a new year, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> developers Team FOLON have kicked it off by revealing that the massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> mod's second DLC is currently planned to rock up in the irradiated tube station of our lives pretty soon. This add-on's dubbed Last Orders and looks to have at least something to do with a trip to the pub.</p>
<p>To be fair, that makes perfect sense. Fallout: London's first DLC was dubbed Rabbit and Pork, so following up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-londons-first-dlc-rabbit-and-pork-is-finally-out-and-adds-30-new-quests">last year's meal of new quests</a> with a drink is only human.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Team FOLON lead Dean 'Prilladog' Carter announced Last Orders' target release window, the first quarter of 2026, in a couple of festive/new year announcements on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/475034106527481887/1455992215397732372">Fallout: London's Discord server</a>. "From 2026 onwards, things will be much less quiet," he wrote. "Expect quarterly updates and more shared content covering both Fallout: London and the future of Team FOLON Ltd.</p>
<p>"If you're here for the Last Orders DLC, we're very close, but it still needs testing and to go through the boring red tape. Our current aim is Q1 2026. Soon™. We hope to align this with another exciting update about something else..." In the earlier of the two posts, Carter added that the modders' reason for not totally committing to that early 2026 window right now is due to the fact the Rabbit and Pork DLC ended up taking longer than originally anticipated to finalise. "No promises though, not after last time," as the modder put it.</p><p>While Last Orders'll likely be surprisingly beefy if its predecessor's 30 new quests, 80 new characters, and 8000+ lines of dialogue are anything to go by, Fallout: London's third DLC remains the one I'm really keen to see arrive. Dubbed Wildcard, it's set to add in a cut questline designed to serve as the mod's version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a>' Yes Man main quest path, something the modders were <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-mod-cut-new-vegas-style-wild-card-main-quest-future-update">initially forced to put on ice during development</a> due to the Russo-Ukrainian war's outbreak disrupting the life of the main modder working on it.</p>
<p>That DLC, the last of Fallout: London's currently announced add-ons, remains release dateless for now. Meanwhile, news about Last Orders has been accompanied by the arrival on Nexus Mods of fan-made <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/786">Simplified Chinese</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/600">Japanese</a> translations for the massive mod, bringing down a couple more language barriers which might have prevented folks taking a trip to post-apocalyptic England thus far.</p>
<p>If Last Orders' current release plan holds fast, it looks like there'll be reason for radshrews of all tongues to consider <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amid-the-purple-haze-of-fallout-london-i-rage-mocked-by-the-violet-vistas-of-my-own-stupidity">giving Fallout: London another crack</a> at some point in the next few months.</p>
