                <p>For over a year, Nintendo and Amazon have been joint partners in a lawsuit targeting sellers on Amazon's site who illegally sold fake Amiibos and pirated Nintendo cartridges. Now, the two companies are asking the court to render a summary judgment against the counterfeiters to the tune of a $7 million penalty.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/522449/amazon-nintendo-counterfeit-amiibo-cartridge-lawsuit" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Nintendo and Amazon arrived at the $7 million figure after calculating that the group of sellers moved at least $2,343,386 of fake Nintendo merchandise or games. Essentially, Nintendo and Amazon are arguing that both companies were harmed by the actions of these sellers, and thus a penalty of three times the amount they made is a justified response.</p><p>Nintendo and Amazon are aware of the sellers' real identities, but none of the group responded to the lawsuit or showed up in court to defend themselves. That's why the two companies' request for summary judgment may have a good chance of going through. The lawsuit also argues that the penalty will deter others from attempting to commit the same crimes.</p><p>"This [$7 million] amount is conservative and on the low end of the range of damages available for Defendants' wrongdoing, but it is significant enough to provide deterrence against future counterfeiting conduct," wrote lawyers for Nintendo.</p><p>Nintendo recently took action against <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/live-action-legend-of-zelda-fan-film-gets-shut-down-by-nintendo/1100-6529246/" data-ref-id="1100-6529246">a Legend of Zelda fan film</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-loses-legal-battle-with-an-unexpected-super-mario/1100-6529098/" data-ref-id="1100-6529098">a supermarket called Super Mario</a> in Costa Rica. The Zelda project was canceled and pulled from Kickstarter, while the owner of the Super Mario supermarket was able to keep the name in part because supermarkets aren't covered by any of Nintendo's trademarks.</p><p>As for the Amiibos, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xenoblade-amiibo-figures-are-back-in-stock/1100-6527491/" data-ref-id="1100-6527491">Xenoblade 2 figures</a> and Metal Gear Solid's Solid Snake <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-snake-amiibo-is-being-reprinted-preorder-at-best-buy/1100-6529001/" data-ref-id="1100-6529001">are both getting reprinted this year</a>.

            <p>
Two years after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/akka-arrh-review-llamasoft-returns-with-intrigue-and-delight">reimagining Atari's unreleased 80s arcade prototype Akka Arrh</a>, design legend Jeff Minter is back with another psychedelic spin on an arcade game from yesteryeat - this time a "reality-defying reinvention" of 1984 Atari shooter I, Robot that's launching this "spring".
</p>
<p>
In I, Robot's original guise, players helped a self-aware robot (officially named "Unhappy Interface Robot #1984") destroy the all-seeing eye of Big Brother. This involved navigating each stage's maze of platforms in order to reach special red blocks and unleash a powerful laser blast - the main wrinkle being that death was instant if the player jumped while the eye was open.
</p>
<p>
Minter's newly unveiled reimagining takes the same basic premise - complete with a maze of platforms and that jump-phobic all-seeing eye - but tweaks the core action so that players are required to flip all the tiles across each stage in order to escape. "If you make it across the tiles," Atari explains in its announcement, "you'll have to race down a tube and blast away any enemy shapes that move into your path and try to stop you."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/activision-unfair-labor-practice-guns-cwa-call-of-duty<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In December, shortly before Christmas, Activision terminated Allen Junge, a QA worker in Minneapolis, Minnesota. According to the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the union that represents Junge as well as <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-online-studios-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 1,000 workers across Activision and Microsoft</a>, the publisher claimed it was following protocol after Junge overstepped with a Slack post about guns in the wake of the US presidential election. But CWA believes Activision was retaliating against Junge for his role as a "core part of the wave of unionization across the video game industry" and has filed an unfair labor practice asserting as much.</p><p>In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lhue564um22p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a statement published this week</a>, CWA said that Junge helped lead a 2022 walkout at Activision and played a key role in allowing the hundreds-strong Activision Quality Assurance group to win union recognition in 2024. Prior to his firing, Junge had acted as a spokesperson for the union at a rally against Activision's "refusal to approve certain ADA job accommodations," which Jordan Kunze, another Activision QA employee and Junge's union steward, told Aftermath centered around the company's return-to-office mandate, an ongoing point of contention that some employees <a href="https://aftermath.site/activision-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-mandate-that-they-see-as-soft-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have described as “soft layoffs.”</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Trouble began when Activision brass pulled Junge and Kunze into a meeting about a November Slack post Junge had made about guns. Some employees, CWA says, had been discussing the idea of arming themselves as a defensive measure in the wake of Trump’s reelection, and Junge stepped in with “recommendations for safe and responsible firearms ownership and training, especially for those from LGBTQ communities and other marginalized identities.” Activision, CWA and Junge say, construed Junge’s post as a call to violence when he says that, in reality, he advised de-escalation and education above all else.&nbsp;</p><p>"When I decided to make this post, I wanted to be helpful for my coworkers and do what I could to prevent people from making rash decisions about their personal safety,” Junge said in an email to the company, relayed by CWA. “I have learned that the only way to be safe around firearms is to be completely informed and vigilant in how they are handled. I also did not want to create the appearance that only lethal force is capable of self-defense, which is why I repeatedly emphasized the need to avoid conflict and obey all applicable laws, as well as gave advice on less-lethal self-defense. To my dismay, I learned that the determination to terminate my employment included the verbatim language used to teach firearm safety in professional classes, as well as multiple out of context phrases and themes that were not discussed in the investigation.”</p><p>In response to CWA's filing of an unfair labor practice, Activision provided a brief statement:</p><p>"We expect our employees to adhere to our Code of Conduct and guidelines," an Activision spokesperson told Aftermath. "When there are violations to those guidelines, we take&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;and appropriate action.&nbsp; We can confirm this exit was unrelated to any protected activity."</p><p>Junge declined to be interviewed about his termination and the ensuing unfair labor practice, but Kunze provided additional details to Aftermath. Here is Junge’s Slack message, as dictated to Aftermath by Kunze:</p><blockquote><p>I thought I'd try to help ensure people are making informed decisions about their self defense. I am of the belief that if your existence as a person is threatened by the upcoming political administration or if you are an ally to these marginalized groups, you should purchase and learn how to use a firearm. I want to explain how to do so in an educated way so nobody makes rash decisions.</p><p>First off, let's start with education. Buying a firearm is a huge responsibility, and simply owning one is not enough for it to be an effective tool for self defense. While I make this call generally, it's more like a call to defend yourself, rather than any kind of call to action. Please decide for yourself if a firearm fits your needs for protection. Start by taking a firearm safety course Before you even consider touching a gun, you must know how to operate it safely. These courses are relatively cheap and will teach you things you need to know.&nbsp;</p><p>However, let's cover some basic rules anyway. Never point a gun at anything you don't intend to destroy. Always treat a gun as if it's loaded, especially if you're the one to unload it. Always know your target and what's behind it. Never put your trigger finger on the trigger unless you are immediately about to shoot. Always keep the gun stored and unloaded and in a safe place inaccessible to others. Always keep the gun clean. Know how to disassemble it. Only use a gun in self defense as an absolute last resort.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you take your safety class, you should consider taking a concealed carry course if you plan to carry at any protests. This will give you the right to possess your firearm in a concealed holster in public. This is recommended as openly carrying may be illegal in your area and statistically makes you more likely to be robbed for the gun.&nbsp;</p><p>Next let's talk about purchasing the firearm. Start by double checking regional laws that may restrict or delay your purchase, like in Minnesota hand guns require a request to purchase from the police, which is active for seven days after a background check. For first-time owners, I would recommend a used small-caliber pistol sold at a licensed reseller within range. Buying used will make it cheaper and usually stores with a range will allow you to operate the gun before purchasing.&nbsp;</p><p>After you pass the background checks and own your firearm, it's time to purchase. Don't bother with expensive targets or anything silhouette-shaped right away. Purchase the smallest paper plates you can find. Get the cheaper bullet in your caliber and practice hitting all shots as close together as possible. Practice as often as possible, though a couple hours every weekend should suffice. Make sure you really clean the firearm as well. Gunpowder creates a lot of dirt that will prevent the gun from operating if it builds up.&nbsp;</p><p>You'll want to do this because the most important part of self defense for the gun is accuracy, not where you shoot. Unlike our games, getting shot anywhere will significantly slow, if not stop, the assailant, so being calm and accurate while under pressure is the most important element.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, well, why should you get armed? There are a lot of good reasons and even more bad ones, but I believe purchasing in self defense is the most understandable reason anyone can have. A political environment stochastic possibility simply for existing, being armed is a genuine deterrent. This goes both for you and anyone around you that may be at risk of these threats. Additionally, cop watching, ala Panthers, does keep the police more responsible, even when they know guns will not be leveled at them. Having participants carry firearms at protests also prevents violent police responses, and counter-protesting with firearms to protect such things as drag queen story hour is also a well-known anti-fascist tactic to prevent and deter their presence.&nbsp;</p><p>Be safe and act responsibly. Your community is counting on you.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Kunze went on to say that conversation about guns is far from uncommon in Activision Slack. This is, after all, the publisher of <em>Call of Duty</em>, a series that fetishizes weaponry on a regular basis.</p><p>"I mean, we're literally making games about shooting and killing people, creating new weapons in it, customizing your guns, upgrading them,” said Kunze. “We've had people talk about how they didn't feel safe and thought they needed to buy guns. We've had people who have asked for advice on types of guns to buy, and they're all still here. … [Guns come up] more than a few times a day, some days. Other times it's weekly. I genuinely don't think I've seen a full week pass by where there wasn't some reference to guns, whether it be related to real life, a game, politics, wars. There's always something about it."</p><p>CWA also claimed that Activision Slack includes channels dedicated to non-work-related topics like "wrestling, personal finance, weightlifting, and <em>Star Trek</em>," with "controversial political takes and edgy memes" making regular appearances.</p><p>CWA and Kunze allege that Activision purposefully took Junge’s words out of context.</p><p>"They took the line 'Don't point a gun at anything you don't intend to destroy' and said it contained inflammatory language, such as using a gun to destroy things, counseling that carrying weapons at protest was appropriate, and advising that in a pinch, anything can be used as a weapon," said Kunze.</p><p>Activision, Kunze added, claimed that workers from across the company expressed discomfort at Junge’s post, but recent petitions calling for his rehiring have garnered hundreds of signatures.</p><p>“Most [responses] have been like ‘Seriously? He got let go for that?’” said Kunze. “Our coworkers were very upset that Allen was fired.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is noteworthy that, during a podcast appearance this week, former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick made the cynical proclamation that pervasive harassment claims against companies like Riot and Activision Blizzard were "fake," a product of CWA's need for more members.</p><p>"I can tell you exactly what happened," Kotick said on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grit</a>. "The Communication Workers of America Union started looking at technology. They kept losing because they represented the news guild, Comcast, and they realized they were losing members at a really dramatic rate, so they gotta figure out: How do they get new union members? So they targeted a bunch of different businesses: Google, some other tech companies. Tesla, SpaceX, and us." </p><p>An ensuing lawsuit led to <a href="https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/2023/12/15/civil-rights-department-announces-settlement-agreement-to-resolve-employment-discrimination-and-equal-pay-lawsuit-against-activision-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a $55 million settlement</a> on Activision Blizzard's part. However, the State Department concluded that "no court or any independent investigation has substantiated any allegations [of] systemic or widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard." Meanwhile, Riot also settled, paying out <a href="https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/2023/05/16/civil-rights-department-secures-court-approval-of-100-million-settlement-against-riot-games-over-alleged-discrimination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$100 million</a> following a class-action suit for "systemic sex discrimination and harassment."</p><p>Nonetheless, Kotick concluded that at his company, there was neither smoke nor fire.</p><p>"[CWA] came up with this plan, hired a PR firm, and they started attacking our company. They got these two agencies to file these lawsuits to claim there was some sexual harassment. We didn't have any of that," he said. "I mean, think about it: I dated Sheryl Sandberg. You think we had a problem with pay equity and gender pay at Activision? She literally wouldn't do a 'lean-in circle' at the company until I showed her our pay equity fillings."</p><p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-activision-ceo-bobby-kotick-blasts-fake-lawsuits-against-us-and-riot-games-claiming-union-workers-used-harassment-claims-to-drum-up-members" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RPS notes</a>, Sandberg, formerly COO at Meta, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sandberg-facebook-kotick-activision-blizzard-daily-mail-11650549074" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faced her own set of allegations</a> that she helped pressure UK tabloid Daily Mail to drop stories about a temporary restraining order obtained by an ex-girlfriend of Kotick, who claimed that Kotick harassed her at her home. Ultimately, Kotick's ex retracted some of her allegations, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sandberg-facebook-kotick-activision-blizzard-daily-mail-11650549074" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to WSJ</a>, and stopped pursuing a longer-lasting restraining order.</p><p>Activision workers represented by CWA say their main goal, at this point, is simply to get Junge his job back.</p><p>"Our biggest hope is to get [Allen's job back],” said Kunze. “I think it would also be nice to gain access to what [leadership] finds acceptable and what they don't. Because they definitely didn't do themselves justice in their termination letter."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/common-side-effects-adult-swim-max-hbo"><h3>You Should Be Watching Common Side Effects</h3></a><p>The difficult-to-Google Adult Swim show takes aim at the healthcare industry</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sony-playstation-network-outage-psn-ps5-pc"><h3>The PlayStation Network Outage Is Modern Gaming In A Nutshell</h3></a><p>PSN went down for 24 hours, and Sony won't even give us an explanation</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room have released a brand new <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-the-masquerade-of-seattle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developer diary</a> for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, where you can hear about Phyre's role as the Sheriff from Project Design Director, Level Designer, Environment Artist, and Game Designer. Each member breaks down the mechanics of the game and what role Phyre plays as a whole. Alongside the developer diary, The Chinese Room has released a Community Talks video, which talks about the work that the Environment Art team has done. You can find this video below, which goes into detail about the art of Seattle.</p>
<p><iframe title="TCR Community Talks 3: The Environment Art of our Seattle" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eDC2TzniBu8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The latest dev diary takes the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-content-expansion-plans-to-be-announced-in-2025/">total up to 26</a>, which dives into detail about the city, the inhabitants found residing there, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNzggacI-EU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the rules</a> that they have to follow. There are some main mechanics that are implemented by the Masquerade, which will be noticeable throughout your time in the game to keep you in check. To be able to continue through Bloodlines 2, you need to maintain the Masquerade. If you don't, you will die. However, to keep you in line with this fulfillment, there will be a Masquerade meter at the top of the screen, which will be color-coded so that you know how careful you have to be around Seattle.</p>
<p>Phyre's job as Sheriff means that they have to keep the peace, which includes snuffing out attempts to breach the Masquerade from the outside. This includes gangs causing trouble, assaults in the public eye, and more. To handle these situations, quick thinking is required, as well as the ability to be discreet and not draw attention to the ongoing situation.</p>
<p>It's a known fact that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 takes place in Seattle. To make it easier to navigate, the developers have split Seattle up into five districts: Uptown, Downtown, Chinatown, Financial, and Industrial. Each district offers something unique, including its own dangers that may not be found in other districts in the city.</p>
<p>There will be key locations that can be found in each district, from pawn shops and nightclubs in their respective districts. While some may be hoping for some pretty pictures taken in the Space Needle, Seattle has been designed to be darker and grungier than ever, a suitable spot for vampires to lurk in the shadows.</p>
<p>The next developer diary for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will be released on February 26, 2025. This diary will be diving into the cast of mortals, and the roles they play in the game.</p>

Diablo 3 had a major expansion with Reaper of Souls and a smaller DLC adding the Necromancer class. It is possible that Blizzard keeps the annual releases plan intact by releasing a smaller DLC in 2025, like a new class without a new region. For now, it looks like Diablo 4 fans will have a longer wait than expected for the next major expansion, with only seasonal updates expected in 2025.</p><p>Diablo 4's first major expansion, Vessel of Hatred, launched in October 2024, adding a new region and class to Diablo 4, along with new loot and end-game content to run.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/exoborne-playtest-now-live-on-steam-ends-february-17/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Sharkmob and Level Infinite have announced that the tactical open-world extraction shooter Exoborne will have an open playtest, which will be available for players to dive into until 17 February. Unfortunately, this playtest is only available via Steam on PC, but the sign-up process for those who have access to it is incredibly easy to sign up, as you just have to visit the Steam page for Exoborne and press the "Request Access" button. This playtest is available worldwide. If you want to see what you can expect from your time in Exoborne, make sure to check out the new trailer below, which has been released specifically to celebrate the news.</p>
<p><iframe title="Exoborne Playtest | Live Now" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GXp6CC66gVo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the trailer, Sharkmob has released an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tqnPjrA29k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 minute long video</a> that is a walkthrough of the gameplay, showcasing some of the main features that you can expect to experience in the game. This is the second title to be developed by Sharkmob, with the first being the short-lived Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt. Exoborne was first announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/exoborne-is-a-tactical-open-world-extraction-shooter-in-development-at-sharkmob/">two years ago</a>, and there have been minimal details about the game since.</p>
<p>This five-day global playtest will provide a lot of valuable feedback to the developers, as well as critiques and reports of any bugs that may be present during the playtest.</p>
<p>If this is your first time hearing about Exoborne, this title is set to be an open-world, tactical extraction shooter that takes place in a ravaged world that was torn apart by extreme forces of nature. As a result, you need to customize and adapt your exo-rig to be able to gain an advantage over other players and to be able to sustain yourself during devastating weather changes.</p>
<p>Compared to other battle royales, Exoborne offers the opportunity to navigate a world with unprecedented verticality, which provides plenty of new opportunities for exploration, hiding spots, and advantages to gain against your opponents.</p>
<p>As you progress through the game, your progress will continue to unlock new gear and equipment that will benefit you in your future sessions.</p>
<p>While a fair amount of battle royales don't have a story, Exoborne has an ever-evolving story, which will help set the scene for any future content updates and mysteries that are uncovered in the world of Exoborne.</p>
<p>At the moment, Exoborne doesn't have a set release date, and the game is being developed using Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Will you be diving into the playtest for this new battle royale?</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-daggerheart-miniseries-announced-featuring-age-of-umbra-campaign-frame</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-daggerheart-miniseries-announced-featuring-age-of-umbra-campaign-frame<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Critical Role has announced a new <em>Daggerheart</em> miniseries. The multimedia company behind the acclaimed actual play series has confirmed a new mini-campaign to showcase their upcoming original fantasy TTRPG. This new campaign will feature their grimdark campaign frame: The Age of Umbra.</p>

<h2>The Daggerheart Miniseries Announcement</h2>

<p>In a social media post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Critical Role's own Matt Mercer posted a video. In the video, he showed off the final version of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-darrington-press-hotly-anticipated-ttrpg-is-now-available-for-pre-order" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a> core rulebook. While showing off the book's pages, Mercer lingered on an entry for campaign frames. One of those campaign frames is the Age of Umbra, a grimdark fantasy setting.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-age-of-umbra-page-screenshot.jpg?itok=YbKs-jy8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-age-of-umbra-page-screenshot.jpg?itok=LDACuj5C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The video ends with Mercer confirming that Critical Role will be producing a new <em>Daggerheart</em> actual play miniseries set in the Age of Umbra. According to a report by <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/critical-role-to-run-grimdark-daggerheart-miniseries.711559/" rel="nofollow">EN World</a>, Mercer intentionally created the Age of Umbra to be similar to the Soulsborne series or the board game Kingdom Death: Monster. It is a dark, grim, and challenging world, a sharp contrast to the core game's lighter, more heroic tone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It is a landscape that has been without gods for over 100 years; they abandoned the people and the realm itself is kind of rotting and dying. The survivors that exist there have to hold on to what community there is to get by as the dark things in the shadows grow darker and larger as time passes."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The announcement of this <em>Daggerheart</em> miniseries is during an interesting transitionary period for Critical Role. The show just wrapped up its third campaign with an impressive <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-concludes-campaign-3-with-epic-8-hour-finale-new-godly-exu-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">8.5-hour finale</a>, and they have announced several smaller series like <em>EXU: Divergence</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This has led to speculation that <em>Critical Role</em> may move away from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and pivot entirely to <em>Daggerheart</em> for future campaigns. But given that the studio remained committed to Campaign 3 while producing and publishing the gaslamp fantasy RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/candela-obscura-core-rulebook-review-comprehensive-guide-to-newfaire-and-horror" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Candela Obscura</em></a>, those worries appear unfounded.</p>

Her straight-forward kit has a lot of interesting quirks that enable them to mesh well together and excel in specific-use cases. Understanding how to make the most of her tools is key to keeping yourself and the rest of your team in the fight.</p><h2 id="h187992"><a id=""></a>Healing is your priority, but don’t forget to dish out some damage too</h2><p>Luna Snow’s ease of use and fantastic healing are the primary reasons why she’s considered a top Strategist. While everyone loves a healer who can keep the team in top shape, that doesn’t mean Luna is a one-trick pony. Her low damage is offset by burst-fire hitscan shots that can potentially shred an opponent with a small health pool. I’m not advising that you play her like a DPS (damage-per-second) hero, but there is nothing wrong with dealing damage alongside your team when you have the ability to. Aside from potentially eliminating an enemy, it’s an ideal way to charge up your Ultimate.</p><h2 id="h187993"><a id=""></a>Prioritize Idol Aura for flankers or emergency Burst Healing</h2><p>One of Luna’s most interesting abilities is Share The Stage. This marks an ally with Idol Aura, which grants them a portion of the healing that Luna is providing to others. My suggestion is to put this on any teammate who’ll be flanking the enemy since you won’t have line-of-sight. Spider-Man, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774">Venom</a></span>, and Psylocke should all be top of mind to give Idol Aura too. Don’t be embarrassed about needing to give it to an Iron Man either, depending on how erratic they’re flying around.</p><p>The other aspect that makes this ability amazing is that Luna will generate 35-percent bonus healing if her target is an ally she marked with Idol Aura. If one of your Vanguards is close to death, throw Idol Aura on them and then heal like normal. That bonus will make a major difference and have them in a safer range of health before you know it. Just remember to switch back to a flanker afterward! </p><h2 id="h187994"><a id=""></a>Absolute Zero can halt momentum and even some Ultimates</h2><p>It wouldn’t feel right for an ice-based character to not have a freezing crowd-control ability. Fulfilling that role is Absolute Zero, which emits a large projectile that will freeze an enemy for 2.7 seconds. The effect will cancel out if the target is attacked after the initial 0.5 seconds of being frozen. While this likely exists as a buffer to allow them to be frozen for even a short amount of time, Luna’s primary attack is a three-round burst-fire that comes out in 0.5 seconds. Letting loose with a few shots after throwing out the Absolute Zero projectile is a smart way to maximize damage.</p><p>You’ll ideally want to use this against any flankers attacking you or to keep any annoyingly nimble characters still so you can score some headshots. Targeting an Ulting enemy is an excellent use for the ability, as it can interrupt or, in some cases, completely cancel an ultimate. Feel free to use this even more liberally if you’re the sole healer on the team, since it is one of two abilities that provides self-healing at a rate of 30 HP/s for three seconds. It’s certainly better than nothing.</p><h2 id="h187995"><a id=""></a>Focus on healing with Ice Arts</h2><p>Two obvious drawbacks for Luna are that she requires great aim and can’t usually heal multiple characters at once. If you have crap aim like I do, this can be a pretty big barrier. Making up for that is the Ice Arts ability, which temporarily replaces her primary fire with long-range beam shots. Although the higher DMG and healing values are less effective due to the much lower firing rate, the beam has a sizable hitbox and can pierce teammates and enemies alike. It will also turn back into the normal primary fire with full ammo, so you can use this as a free reload of sorts.</p><p>The big takeaway here is not how great the ability is. While you can deal damage with these beams, it’s better to use them for healing. A notable downside to the Ice Arts ability is that landing any headshots won’t score you a critical hit. Being able to line up multiple enemies with a single shot can also be pretty situational. I strongly suggest using Ice Arts when your teammates are grouped up and in need of heals. That being said, just like Absolute Zero, this ability also provides self-healing. Don’t be afraid to use it if you’re in dire need of health.</p><h2 id="h187996"><a id=""></a>Save your Ultimate for dicey situations</h2><figure id="" data-id="ed551ddafc5e850c9d78518d0cd33229" data-recommend-id="image://ed551ddafc5e850c9d78518d0cd33229" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Luna Snow poses with her hand in the air to signify the end of her ultimate." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luna Snow poses with her hand in the air to signify the end of her ultimate." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ed551ddafc5e850c9d78518d0cd33229" data-recommend-id="image://ed551ddafc5e850c9d78518d0cd33229" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Luna Snow poses with her hand in the air to signify the end of her ultimate." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Luna’s Ultimate is considered the most OP (overpowered) for good reason. For an unnecessarily long twelve seconds, she can swap between empowering allies around her with a 40% damage boost or healing them at a rate of 250 per second. That healing rate is enough to survive the harshest onslaughts and attacks outside a Scarlet Witch or Iron Man Ultimate. Save this move for when your team rushes to take over a point or situations where you’re struggling to defend against your opponents. It’s a ridiculous ability and I hate dealing with it when the opposing team uses it. However, I also love it when I get to use it, so I guess I’m part of the problem.</p><h2 id="h187997"><a id=""></a>Make use of Iron Fist’s team-up attack if you have it</h2><p>Luna is one of the few characters who is a part of multiple <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-best-team-up-attacks-season-zero-1851733122&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-best-team-up-attacks-season-zero-1851733122">team-up abilities</a></span>. The one worth highlighting here is Frozen Chi, an ability she gains when teaming up with Iron Fist. Using it will discharge an icy ring that heals allies while also knocking back enemies and applying a slowing effect. It’s a fantastic addition to her kit that doubles as both another crowd control ability and area-of-effect healing.</p><p>Keep the above tips in mind and you’re sure to be the <em>Marvel Rivals</em> healer that everyone deserves.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/overwatchs-stadium-a-round-based-competitive-mode-that-borrows-from-deadlock-valorant/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Overwatch’s spotlight showcase on February 12 included <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-adds-ability-altering-perks-brings-back-loot-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a massive amount of content planned for the next couple seasons</a>. Among that content is a huge new competitive mode, Stadium, that borrows from other popular titles, and provides a completely unique experience.</p>



<p>This is Stadium, and it’s coming to Overwatch 2 in Season 16.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-stadium-mode-in-overwatch">What is Stadium Mode in Overwatch?</h2>



<p><a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24177197/overwatch-2-spotlight-a-new-era-of-innovation-and-excitement/#:~:text=Stadium%3A%20The%20Ultimate%20Battleground" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stadium</a> is a best-of-seven-rounds competitive mode, where players use currency earned from previous rounds to buy new items and upgrades. The upgrades menu is strikingly similar to the one used in Deadlock, in that players have a finite amount of slots for traits and items. There are even starter builds that let players pick predetermined items and powers, but only for new players. Like in games such as VALORANT or Counter-Strike, players are limited to what they can afford in early rounds, but can save up for more powerful abilities later on.</p>



<p>Players will have the ability to buy, trade, and sell their abilities during any round. There abilities provide dozens of different effects, like extra projectiles, ability cooldown reductions, extra damage, extra charges, and slowing effects.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Each round of Stadium will consist of a game of one of three core modes: Control, Push, or Clash. While Stadium is a best-of-seven, a “mercy rule” will end the match if a team loses the first three rounds. There’s also a bounty system that rewards taking down dominating players.</p>



<p>Stadium will give the players the choice of playing either first-person or third-person on restructured maps. It will also feature its own ranked mode. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-can-i-play-stadium-in-overwatch">When Can I Play Stadium in Overwatch?</h2>



<p>Stadium mode will launch in April 2025, as part of the Season 16 update to Overwatch 2. When the mode launches in Season 16, there will be 14 core heroes available to play. More heroes, maps, and modes will be added over time, and Stadium will be subject to changes stemming from player feedback.</p>



<p>Is Stadium a mode you must try out when it launches later this year? Let us know down below and in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1197/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

Freya is a former search-and-rescue operative but now works as a bounty hunter. Her basic crossbow attack will rapidly shoot bolts at enemies. However, her alternate fire sees her taking aim to deliver a high-speed explosive bolt for big damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442960-overwatch2freya.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442960" data-ratio="0.56214285714286" data-width="1400" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442960-overwatch2freya.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442960"></a><figcaption>Freya wields and explosive crossbow and a bola launcher that can pull enemies together.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442960-overwatch2freya.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Movement and positioning seems to be a big part of Freya's toolkit, with Blizzard stating she is a "challenging and rewarding" character that will take "precision and a steady aim to master." She has both a quick dash ability (that reloads her crossbow in the process) and a move called Updraft that will launch her into the sky. Her Bola Shot ability pulls enemies together, setting them up for a damaging combo from teammates or a well-placed explosive crossbow shot.</p><p dir="ltr">Freya will join Overwatch 2's roster as part of Season 16 later this year, but players will get the chance to try her out during Season 15 as part of a trial weekend.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442962-overwatch2aquaconceptart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442962" data-ratio="0.44625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442962-overwatch2aquaconceptart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442962"></a><figcaption>Aqua will join Overwatch 2 as part of Season 18.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442962-overwatch2aquaconceptart.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While Blizzard shared plenty of details about Freya, she wasn't the only new hero the developer revealed. Aqua, a staff-wielding, water-bending Chinese hero, will join Overwatch 2 as part of Season 18, Blizzard announced, bringing with him an "innovative playstyle." Blizzard at this stage has only shared concept art for Aqua, but said more details about his abilities would come closer to his release.</p><p dir="ltr">New heroes were just a part of all the announcements to come out of Blizzard's Overwatch 2 Spotlight stream.

                <p>One of the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch/" data-ref-id="5000-355766">Overwatch's</a> most best-known features, loot boxes, are coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a> as part of Season 15 on February 18--though you won't be able to buy them directly as was originally the case.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, loot boxes will return as part of Overwatch 2's seasonal free and premium battle passes, as well as rewards for weekly and event challenges. Blizzard is looking to bring more transparency to the system as well, giving players more information in regards to item-drop chances and rarity guarantees.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf5dPQ7YeE8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Cf5dPQ7YeE8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">An item of Rare or better quality has a chance to drop from every loot box. After opening five loot boxes, players will be guaranteed an Epic-quality item, and after 20 loot boxes, a guaranteed Legendary. Legendary loot boxes, one of which can be earned via the free battle pass (and two through the premium battle pass), have a 100% chance to reward a Legendary item.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard said it will release more details about the return of loot boxes next week, but it is already a bit of a full-circle moment for Overwatch. Whereas once loot boxes were maligned as a microtransaction thanks to their random rewards, Blizzard is now citing the community demand as the reason behind their return.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-ditches-loot-boxes-pvp-roadmap-promises-new-heroes-and-maps-regularly/1100-6504688/" data-ref-id="1100-6504688">Overwatch 2 ditched loot boxes when it transformed from Overwatch 1 in 2022</a> and went free-to-play. Since then, fans have complained about a lack of rewards in Overwatch 2 compared to its predecessor, with the only real way to earn cosmetics for free coming from the free version of the game's battle pass or the occasional event. In the original Overwatch, players regularly earned loot boxes just by leveling up their account through playing, which was done away with for the sequel.</p><p dir="ltr">The return of loot boxes is just one of the surprises Blizzard had in store as part of its recent Overwatch 2 Spotlight livestream. Also coming as part of Season 15 is the addition of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-injects-more-moba-energy-into-overwatch-2-with-new-perks-system/1100-6529410/" data-ref-id="1100-6529410">Perks, gameplay-augmenting choices for each Overwatch 2 hero</a> that players will get to choose over the course of a match.

            <p>
Inkle - the studio behind Eurogamer favourites including Heaven's Vault, A Highland Story, and 80 Days - has unveiled its latest narrative-rich adventure: 1920s boarding school mystery Expelled!, which is coming to PC, Switch, and mobile on 12th March.

If Expelled rings a distant bell, that might be because <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highland-song-studio-inkle-teasing-1920s-mystery-at-miss-mulligatawneys-school-for-promising-girls">it was originally teased last June</a>, under the name Miss Mulligatawney's School for Promising Girls. At the time, details were scant - its Steam description merely contained a flyer for the titular academy promising, "The best education the 1920s have to offer!" - but now all has been revealed.
</p>
<p>
Expelled is being pushed as a follow-up to Inkle's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/get-away-with-murder-in-inkles-surprise-new-game-overboard">well-received 2021 ocean liner whodunnit Overboard!</a>, and is described as a "next-gen visual novel with a wicked twist". It sees players attempting to clear their name following the fenestration-based attempted murder of a boarding school prefect, all by mounting their own investigation - which might also involve a spot of blackmail and betrayal, depending what they're willing to do to avoid expulsion.

All this sees players - in the role of scholarship student Verity Amersham, voiced by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Amelia Tyler - navigating the simulated story world of a 1920s boarding school (in which students and staff move around independently in real-time, remembering everything they see and responding appropriately) in order to eke out truths and exploit secrets. Players have just one day to solve the mystery and escape punishment through subterfuge and cunning - perhaps even choosing to frame someone else if it'll save their bacon.
</p>
<p>
Inkle says one playthrough of Expelled should last no more than 45 minutes, but each run features new leads and opportunities making it "massively replayable". And it's not just a question of avoiding expulsion; players can also work toward other targets, such as rising to the position of head girl, or solving further mysteries - such as uncovering your best friend's dark secret. And all this is accompanied by a jazz soundtrack featuring music from the likes of George Gershwin, Paul Whiteman, Louis Armstrong, and Bessie Smith.

<p>
Expelled!: An Overboard! Game launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2963890/Expelled/">Steam</a>, Switch, iOS, and Android on 12th March.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/610599/overwatch-2-season-15-16-update-stadium-new-character-freja-loot-boxes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Overwatch 2</em> is getting quite the shakeup in 2025 as it faces growing competition from other online shooters. It starts with the season 15 update that’s coming on February 18th that’ll tease a new hero and introduce an in-game Perks system for existing ones, plus the return of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278781/overwatch-2-season-14-6v6-test">6v6 competitive queues Blizzard tested late last year</a>. There’s also the return of loot boxes and then, in April, a <em>Counterstrike</em>-like mode, two new characters, and a revamped ranked queue that lets you ban heroes and vote on maps.</p><p>Reintroducing loot boxes may be a polarizing move, as games that implement them have received backlash over the years for their predatory nature. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/16/23171133/overwatch-2-loot-boxes-free-to-play">Blizzard removed them from <em>Overwatch</em> a few years ago</a> in favor of an in-game shop when it restructured its monetization model after going free-to-play. The company will responsibly publicize drop rates and is guaranteeing that you’ll receive an item of “Rare” rarity or better in each box, plus a guaranteed “Epic” after opening five and a “Legendary” after opening 20. We’re not sure whether you’ll still be able to purchase cosmetics directly from a rotating in-game shop, but you can earn loot boxes as part of weekly and event rewards, and you can get up to three guaranteed Legendary loot boxes in each seasonal battle pass.</p><p>Stadium is arguably the biggest change announced for <em>Overwatch 2</em> so far. The new gameplay mode is a best-of-seven romp between two teams of five that’s akin to <em>CounterStrike: Go</em> or <em>Valorant</em>. You’ll earn currency each round, with rotating maps and objectives alternating between Control, Clash, and Push.</p><p>The cash goes toward upgrades for your hero that are unique to the mode, whether you’re unlocking an ability or upgrading it with enhanced potency or transformative effects that buff your offense and team utility. You can even choose between first-person or third-person POVs. It’s getting its own ranked queue, too, and launches with 14 heroes to start, with more planned to be added in future updates alongside a steady rollout of new maps.</p><p>Season 16 will also introduce Freja, a high-mobility character who can dash horizontally and jump vertically while wielding a dual-mode crossbow that enables both rapid-fire shooting and precision sniping. You’ll be able to play her for a bit during a trial weekend in Season 15. Blizzard is also teasing a new character for Season 18 named Aqua, appropriately named for his water-based abilities.</p><p>As for the new Perks system, it promises to enhance all of the game’s heroes with two unique upgrades per match. Your first upgrade is a minor one that lets you choose one of two slight boosts, perhaps a slightly stronger passive or a reduced cooldown for a core ability. The second upgrade offers a more substantial play style shift designed to help turn the tides of battle — Torbjorn can choose between a stronger level three turret or the ability to mount it on a wall, for example.</p><p>These drastic changes are almost necessary for any service-based online arena shooter to stand out amidst growing competition, as evidenced by <em>Fortnite</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315134/fortnite-ballistic-counter-strike-first-person-shooter-fps">recently receiving a similar mode</a> as Epic Games continues experimenting. There are only so many players to go around, after all, especially with newcomer <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337409/marvel-rivals-fantastic-four-season-1-date-trailer">Marvel Rivals</a></em> making a loud and very noticeable Namor-sized splash of late.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two major changes to Overwatch are coming in Season 15 of the long-running hero shooter from Blizzard: the debut of gameplay perks and the return of loot boxes. Billed as the “boldest gameplay evolution yet,” perks let players level up their hero abilities with new effects mid-match.</p>



<p>Check out the full details on all the <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24177197/overwatch-2-spotlight-a-new-era-of-innovation-and-excitement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new changes</a> coming to Overwatch in Season 15 below.</p>



<h2 id="h-overwatch-s-biggest-content-change-arguably-since-the-sequel">Overwatch’s Biggest Content Change Arguably Since the Sequel</h2>



<p>The new perk system allows player to upgrade their hero’s kit during a match by earning level experience. Players can earn level experience by getting kills, dealing damage, and healing. The perks are similar to Reality Augments in Fortnite: when a player unlocks the ability to get a perk, they can use their controls to select one of the two options. If a player switches heroes during a match, their hero level will reset, but they will earn experience faster. Players can equip three perks per match: two Minor perks, and one Major perk.</p>



<p>In addition to the new perks system, Season 15 will re-introduce loot boxes. Players will be able to earn loot boxes from weekly and event rewards, as well as one Legendary loot box from the free battle pass, and two more from the Premium pass. A Rare or better item will drop in every box, an Epic item is guaranteed within five consecutive boxes, and a Legendary it guaranteed within 20 consecutive boxes. If an item you already own is in the box, it will re-roll it with an item of the same rarity.</p>
