            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Every year needs its marquee bad game, and just two weeks into 2026, it looks like the new yeare might already have a contender. </span><i><span>Code Violet </span></i><span>is a survival horror game from TeamKill Media, the team who made the apparently also awful </span><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/quantum-error/"><i><span>Quantum Error</span></i></a><span> from 2023. Both games are currently sitting at a 40 on review aggregate site Metacritic, and given that </span><i><span>Code Violet </span></i><span>only has a handful of reviews thus far, there’s still time for the dinosaur-shooting </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>knockoff to tumble down farther in the ranks.</span></p> <p><i><span>Code Violet</span></i><span> mixes the claustrophobic corridors and over-the-shoulder shooting of games like </span><i><span>Resident Evil 4 </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Dead Space</span></i><span> with the dinosaur-infested setting of </span><i><span>Dino Crisis</span></i><span>. Or it tries to, at least. From the sound of it, the game doesn’t pull any of this off anywhere near as well as the games it’s clearly trying to emulate, and its simplistic shooting never quite manages to make its dinosaur foes feel terrifying enough to overpower you.</span></p>

 <p><span>“In a straight up skirmish with these scaly foes, a well-timed dash back can really befuddle the raptors, shattering their simple gameplan of running at you, taking a big swing, pausing, and doing it again,” Jarrett Jawn writes at </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/code-violet-review"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>. “There’s limited space before you hit a wall or a door that might have automatically closed behind you, though, so you can only backdash so much before making yourself a much easier snack to catch. The camera will collide with these barriers far sooner than [protagonist] Violet will, rendering any encounter that doesn’t take place in the dead center of the room a completely unintelligible mess for as long as it takes you to get the camera refocused.”</span></p>

  <p><span>Several reviewers state that everything about </span><i><span>Code Violet</span></i><span>’s combat seems undercooked in a way that makes it hard to even interpret visually or through audio cues. </span><i><span>PushSquare </span></i><span>reviewer John Cal McCormick, meanwhile, described the shooting as “limp” and its guns “weightless.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Shotguns should boom, but firing one in </span><i><span>Code Violet</span></i><span> feels like when you bite the end of the paper off a McDonald’s straw and blow through it so the wrapping flies off,” McCormick writes.&nbsp; </span><span><br> </span><span>“Less of a boom, and more of a wildly unsatisfying thwip. Hit boxes seem erratic, and visual feedback is largely non-existent. It’s often unclear if you’re actually hitting your target or not until the dinosaur you’re shooting at unconvincingly keels over.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Outside of the actual pointing and shooting, several reviewers noted the odd tonal dissonance between the game’s survival horror setting and the way it frames its protagonist Violet, with her&nbsp; fanservice-driven wardrobe and </span><i><span>Code Violet</span></i><span>’s insistence on giving players an unimpeded view quickly growing tiresome, corny, and at odds with the moment at hand.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Although the character model is highly detailed, it is done so in a sexualised manner, which is further enhanced through the array of revealing costumes that you can dress her in at save points,” </span><a href="https://cogconnected.com/review/code-violet-review/"><i><span>COGConnected</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> Jaz Sagoo writes.</span></p> <p><span>“In a pivotal moment in the story, Violet bawls at the death of a comrade,” McCormick says. “The comrade was killed by a space dinosaur, incidentally. And as the tears stream down her face, and the voice actor puts their all into each wail, the camera pans back to reveal Violet is dressed like a sexy cowgirl complete with arse-less chaps.”</span></p>

 <p><span>If you scroll down to the comments on most of these reviews, you’ll find that a lot of folks aren’t terribly surprised by this, given </span><i><span>Quantum Error </span></i><span>was also a certified stinker. There are also plenty of people saying what they really want is for Capcom to bring back </span><i><span>Dino Crisis </span></i><span>so we can get a real dinosaur horror game instead of these knock-offs. But from the sound of it, you’re better off waiting for Capcom to pull the franchise out of cold storage than playing </span><i><span>Code Violet</span></i><span>.</span></p>

            <p>A lot of you are gaming hard, it seems. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a> has been on a steady growth trajectory for years now, with the Covid pandemic alone adding five million unique users only in 2020. On 1th January, Valve's platform crossed the 42 million barrier, setting a new record.</p>
<p>As reported and explained by <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-reaches-new-concurrency-record-42-million-users/">Wccftech</a>, the PC distribution platform has now more than doubled its concurrent user average since 2020, with new record peaks of activity becoming more and more common in recent years. The previous activity record was 41.6 million users in October 2025.</p>
<p>The full analysis solidifies the feeling that Steam (and PC gaming as a whole) has blown up in popularity in the post-pandemic era: "A quick data analysis reveals distinct growth phases during this period. Before the pandemic, the Steam platform was growing slowly, at a rate of +4.5 percent per year. The lockdown year obviously exploded the platform (as well as all other gaming platforms) with +31.5 percent in a single year, followed by a stabilisation phase and the current phase, which are both between 13.9 percent and 12.6 percent annual growth rate."</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-helped-push-steam-to-have-highest-grossing-december-yet/">Last month also was Steam's highest-grossing yet</a>, partly thanks to recent hits like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-expeditions-one-in-ten">Arc Raiders</a> and viral indie sensations like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">Peak</a>, on top of everything else. The quality of the more recent Steam sales has also been on the upswing, often countering the deep deals found on other storefronts.</p><p>Another reason behind this growth is the rising popularity of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a>, Valve's portable PC that's cracked open PC gaming for plenty of folks who wanted the benefits of Steam and other platforms without the technical hassles which typically come with gaming computers. Even with its technical limitations, it’s become the go-to "console" for plenty of more casual players.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1q6om9p/oc_epic_games_store_grew_users_by_173_over_6/">Epic Games Store has also seen plenty of growth</a> over six years, but as we expected, most users only show up for the free games given out each week, refusing to spend money on a platform that isn’t nearly as fleshed out as Valve’s beyond the games themselves.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/12/my-hero-academia-alls-justice-preview-rising-to-the-final-challenge/</link>
            <guid>1403473</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>After a ten year run, My Hero Academia’s superhero high school drama has come to an end. The manga wrapped up its story in 2024, the anime adaptation aired its eighth and final season at the end of 2025, and now in 2026 it’s time for the video game series to smash through to its conclusion with My Hero Academia: All’s Justice.</p>
<p><iframe title="MY HERO ACADEMIA: All’s Justice | WE ARE HERE Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tA3j0dUkU0I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The main draw for All’s Justice is to get to play through and experience this final story arc of My Hero Academia. There’s a fair bit of required knowledge because of this, like “Who’re these All For One and One For All fellows?” and “Wait, there’s a frog girl and a pervy boy with sticky balls for hair?” There’s also a real feeling that, if you’ve not kept up with the story so far, you’ll want to go back and catch up, whether you do so via the previous two games –&nbsp;One’s Justice and One’s Justice 2 –&nbsp;or work your way through the source materials.</p>


<p>Still, given that it’s the final showdown, you should know roughly what to expect, as it builds up to one climactic battle between Midoriya and All For One. Along the way, there’ll be other big narrative beats for other key characters and heroes, and no doubt a few noble sacrifices. It’s one of these battles that we got to experience, with the bull-headed Bakugo taking on All For One. It’s a titanic battle, set amidst a ruined chunk of the city, and mixing together animated scenes with the super-powered combat at the core of this game. Given that it’s Bakugo fighting, this chunk of the story is suitably filled with explosions.</p>


<p>The combat system remains familiar from the previous two games in the series, and this genre in general. You nip around a 3D battle arena looking to get into position to unleash a string of close-quarters hits, make the most of your particular character’s Quirk abilities, including their cinematic Plus Ultra attack, and keep a watchful eye for when you need to guard, counter or dodge incoming attacks. There’s the typical cat and mouse of trying to close the gap to enemies, with the AI sometimes keeping a quite frustrating amount of distance when you’ve got a generally close combat character, like Bakugo with his explosive fists.</p>
<p>What’s new for this game is the Rising meter. This builds up as you fight, and once filled lets you trigger a souped up version of your fighter, boosting their attack power, movement speed and recovery speed. It gives you a good boost, coming with a little cinematic and a change in stance or form. For Bakugo, his shoulder blasters come up, for Izuku he engages his armoured fists into a more powerful mode, for Fumikage, his Dark Shadow grows and takes centre stage to absolutely batter enemies.</p>

<p>This really comes to the fore in the full 3v3 battling, where you get to choose three characters and switch back and forth between them, adapting character abilities and play styles as you go. There’s a tactical element to choosing when and where to use Rising, just as much as there is for using a Plus Ultra attack, or saving that up to use multiple charges in a multi-character Plus Ultra Combo.</p>
<p>Through the game are two control modes, with the “Normal Control” mode the default which is recommended for beginners where a single button is all that’s needed while your character dynamically unleashes combos, Quirks and Plus Ultra moves. I personally found the “Manual Control” mode gave me much better results, as I had more control over what my character was doing.</p>
<p>Away from the story mode, the game is wrapped up in an open world area virtual space which you can explore in a number of ways. The Team Up Mission mode presents a whole host of scenarios for you to take a team of three into. Confronting the Formidable, for example, takes a battle from the story and rewrites it as a training scenario for Midoriya created by teacher Eraser Head. It does go a bit sideways, though, when the AI characters that have been created go rogue…</p>

<p>The main problem I found with this was that there felt like there was a chunk of filler in this scenario. It’s a handful of fairly tame battles, some lame chase scenes where you’re running down an alley filled with barrels and metal bars, and then random encounters when going between mission points in the open world. I have to hope that other Team Up Missions are more engaging, but there was a bit of fun to be had in the scenario.</p>
<p>By contrast, the Hero’s Diary mode (which is unlocked by completing the Team Up Mission mode) cuts out the chaff and features original mini-stories for a bunch of the supporting characters from Class 1-A. Each character memory has three segments, which are either a cutscene, battle or some kind of exploration or other task. Minoru Mineta has to try to race through checkpoints by mastering the parkour possibilities of his hair balls, Mina Ashido just wants to find cats in a playground, Eijiro Kirishima has a boisterous battle to prove he’s the toughest character of them all.</p>
<p>As My Hero Academia: All’s Justice looks to wrap up this series narrative in explosive fashion, the fresh additions of Rising and Plus Ultra Combo are going to bring an added layer to the 3V3 combat. I’m a little less convinced about how essential the additional modes and open world are going to be, but they are there as asides to the core pillars of this finale, giving more characters their time in the spotlight.</p>

            <guid>1403467</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Tom Clancy's The Division</strong> initially launched on PC, PS4, and Xbox One on March 8, 2016, meaning that March 8, 2026, will mark the 10-year anniversary of the series launch. It's not entirely clear how <strong>Ubisoft</strong> intends to celebrate the occasion yet, but a poster spotted at the esports event, <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6JP/status/1996490814843740451">FPS Day,</a> in Japan seems to have one indication of how, as event attendees shared pictures of a <strong><em>"The Division: Definitive Edition"</em></strong> poster online.</p>



<p>Shared to X (formerly Twitter) by multiple users, a large poster for The Division: Definitive Edition that seems to be legitimate was shared ahead of a 10th anniversary panel taking place at the event.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>A 'Definitive Edition' of the first Division game has yet to be officially announced by Ubisoft, though we do know that there are several projects within the series in the works. At last week's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDt-guVbQMs">New Game Plus Showcase,</a> executive producer <strong>Julian Gerighty</strong> shared some new information and gameplay on The Division 2: Survivors and The Division Resurgence, two upcoming titles that were first announced at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a></strong>.</p>



<p>He also spared <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-in-production-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-division-1-ubisoft-massive/">a few words for <strong>The Division 3</strong>,</a> saying, "<em></em><em>It's shaping up to be a monster</em>. <em>I can't really say anything more than that. But this is, within these walls, in Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will be as big an impact as Division 1 was</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's unclear what the 'Definitive Edition' of the initial game will look like, particularly because Ubisoft has already been adding new features to The Division to help celebrate the game's 10-year anniversary, like a <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/2001336590119866505">60 FPS update for current-gen consoles that was released almost a month ago</a> at the time of this writing.</p>



<p>A video shared by the <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/2010628433223545297">official Ubisoft Japan X (formerly Twitter) account</a> also details how the company will celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first Division game with a special in-game event in The Division 2, but there's no mention of a 'Definitive Edition' for the first The Division game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If this 'Definitive Edition' is a new version of the first Division game set to release for current-gen platforms, then we may only be hours away from the official confirmation at the aforementioned 10th anniversary panel. Wccftech has reached out to Ubisoft for a comment on what's happening, but did not receive a reply ahead of publishing. We'll update this article if/when we hear back.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/beats-pill-is-now-the-most-affordable-way-to-get-an-apple-portable-bluetooth-speaker-after-a-new-year-price-cut-2000658301</link>
            <guid>1403458</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good music can instantly lift the mood and the vibe of any space. Those shopping for a solid Bluetooth speaker today – we’ve got great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6422/">Amazon has dropped the price of the Beats Pill speaker by 33%, offering it now for just $100.</a> That’s after a nice $50 savings, and the offer applies to all color options. These include the stunning Champagne, the classic Black, and the bold Red.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6422/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>No Compromises on Sound</h2>
<p>Beats Pill – well, looks like a large pill, but in a good, minimal way. The speaker includes a removable lanyard and soft-grip silicone backing for easier portability. It can be slipped into any bag or simply carried using the lanyard when you’re heading out.</p>
<p>Sound quality is nothing short of impressive. Beats Pill features a bigger, bespoke racetrack woofer that displaces 90% more air volume for deeper bass, plus a redesigned tweeter which offers crisp highs and rich mid-range tones. The result? Balanced, yet punchy sound for all your favorite tracks. Whether you’re starting your day with a motivational podcast or want your music to match your workout energy, expect an immersive sound experience. Conversations come through clearly, while tunes hit with satisfying bass that moves you.</p>
<p>Even better, the woofer’s material and structure are designed to minimize low-end distortion, even when you have pumped the sound all the way up. Feeling like having your own private Coldplay concert in your lounge? Push the volume to maximum to get in the feels. Additionally, the Beats Pill supports not only Bluetooth connectivity but also USB-C connections to other devices. The latter offers high-resolution lossless audio, which preserves the detail and depth of audio, letting you enjoy the music exactly the way its creator intended. You can even pair two of these speakers together for an even larger sound setup in Amplify mode or Stereo mode. Just ask a friend to bring theirs, connect the two, and get the party started.</p>



<p>Note that despite Beats being owned by Apple, this speaker plays nicely with both Android and Apple devices. You can connect it to your smartphone, laptop, computer, TV, and more without a problem. Best of all, the included microphone lets you take calls and activate voice assistants like Alexa and Google right through the speaker. Once you’re done, your track picks up right where you left off.</p>
<p>Durability comes from the speaker’s IP67 dust and water resistance, which makes it easy to take it anywhere – beach, poolside, bathroom, great outdoors – with you. Battery life is just as impressive. A single charge gets you around 24 hours of playback, making the Beats Pill more than capable of keeping the party going all night and into the next day. It can even serve as a handy power bank when needed, as you can use it to charge your phone or other devices via USB-C cable.</p>
<p>We highly recommend this speaker to anyone looking to enjoy their favorite tracks to the fullest on the go.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6422/"> It typically retails for $150, which isn’t bad considering all the features the Beats Pill packs, but you can treat yourself to one for just $100 today.</a> The discount is expected to expire soon, so it’s best to get your orders in without wasting time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6422/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-lego-sets-release-date-price-pikachu-charizard-2000658895</link>
            <guid>1403455</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We’ve known for a little under a year now that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-pokemon-pikachu-date-price-mega-bloks-teaser-1851770713"><span>Lego and </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>were collaborating</span></a><span> on sets featuring Pikachu and friends, and now we finally know what they are, how much they cost, and my god, how do y’all afford this as a regular hobby? They look incredible, though.</span></p> <p><span>The first five </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>Lego sets include models for <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/pikachu-and-poke-ball-72152">Pikachu</a>, <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/eevee-72151">Eevee</a>, a Pokémon Center, all eight Kanto gym badges, and a huge set featuring <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/venusaur-charizard-and-blastoise-72153">Charizard, Venusaur, and Blastoise</a>, and will launch on February 27, aka Pokémon Day, commemorating the series’ 30th anniversary.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658897" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658897"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658897">© The Pokémon Company / Lego</figcaption></figure> <p>For anyone who collects official Lego sets, these prices might not deliver much sticker shock. I’m super tempted by the one of Pikachu jumping out of a Poké Ball, but oof dah, $200 is a lot. The Eevee one is the most affordable here, running $59.99, and it’s also the most straightforward model. It’s just Eevee being a little brick guy. However, the Kanto starter trio is a staggering $649.99, which isn’t too surprising when you consider how elaborate it is. It has 6838 pieces, each of which helps build Charizard, Venusaur, and Blastoise in their natural habitats. The standout is Charizard, who is the centerpiece of the set as it flies off what looks like a volcano. The whole thing’s pretty neat, but is it “more expensive than a PlayStation 5” neat? You decide.</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, you won’t find the Pokémon Center and Kanto Badge sets on store shelves. The badges are only available if you buy the starter trio set from February 27 to March 8, and the Pokémon Center is a Lego Insiders reward, available to you if you have 2600 points through your membership.</p>

  <p>Aiming this product line squarely at adults with nostalgia for the brand, The Pokémon Company also released a live-action promo telling folks that Legos are for older Pokémon fans who have bills to pay and lower back pain. I guess kids are also unlikely to have the $650 lying around to pick up the most elaborate of these sets.</p>

<p>The first five LEGO Pokémon sets have been revealed, and they feature iconic Pokémon like Eevee, Pikachu, Charizard, Blastoise, and Venusaur. </p>



<p>The LEGO x Pokémon partnership was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-x-pokemon-partnership-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in 2025</a>, and since then, fans have been eagerly awaiting what kinds of sets this collaboration will entail. The five new sets are intricate pieces where you can not only recreate some of the most popular Pokémon in the series, but also badges and Pokémon centers. </p>







<h2 id="h-lego-pokemon-sets-prices-release-and-other-details">LEGO Pokémon Sets: Prices, Release, and Other Details </h2>



<p>A post by <a href="https://www.thebrickfan.com/lego-pokemon-2026-sets-officially-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Brick Fan</a> reveals the first-ever collection of LEGO Pokémon sets, and they are set to release on February 27, 2026. The first three sets feature beloved Pokémon from the games, Pikachu, Eevee, Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise. In contrast, the other two include a Kanto region Badge set and a Mini Pokémon Center. Learn more details about each LEGO Pokémon Set below, including price, pieces included and more. </p>



<h3 id="h-pikachu-with-poke-ball">Pikachu with Poké Ball </h3>



<p>The first one features the most iconic Pokémon of all, Pikachu, leaping out of a Poké Ball. It is a 2,050-piece set that features a black lighting-rod-shaped base and blue lighting coming out of the Poké Ball. The price for LEGO Pokémon Pikachu with Poké Ball set is $199.99. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-eevee">Eevee</h3>



<p>Next up is Eevee, another fan favourite, which is the smallest out of the 3 Pokémon-based sets. Coming at 587 pieces, the Eevee set also features movable tail, head, and limbs, allowing builders to change the pose as they like. The LEGO Pokémon Eevee set has been priced at $59.99. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-venusaur-charizard-and-blastoise">Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise</h3>



<p>The Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise LEGO set is the biggest of them all, featuring the final evolutions of all the Kanto region starter Pokémon. Coming at 6,838 pieces, it features themed pedestals for each of the Pokémon, with flora under Venusaur, a volcano under Charizard, and a waterfall under Blastoise. It seems these three LEGO Pokémon can be placed on their own as well. The LEGO Pokémon Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise is the most expensive of the lot, priced at $649.99. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-kanto-region-badge-collection">Kanto Region Badge Collection</h3>



<p>Next, we have the Kanto Region Badge Collection, which consists of Gym Badges that players can collect in this region. It is a 312-piece set; however, it cannot be purchased conventionally. The only way to get your hands on the LEGO Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection set is by receiving it as a gift with purchase when buying the LEGO Pokémon Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise set. The offer is only available between February 27 and March 8, 2026. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-mini-pokemon-center">Mini Pokémon Center</h3>



<p>Last but not least is the Mini Pokémon Center, the best place to give all your Pokémon a good rest after a strenuous battle. It is a mini-replica of the Pokémon Center that also features a place to rest small Poké Balls. Similar to the Kanto Region Badge Collection, the LEGO Pokémon Mini Pokémon Center can’t be purchased conventionally; it is reserved for LEGO Insiders members and can be bought for 2,500 Insider Points while stocks last.</p>

            <p>Lego has lifted the lid on its previously announced Pokémon sets, which include Pikachu and Poké Ball, Venusaur, Charizard, Blastoise and Eevee.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/pikachu-and-poke-ball-72152">Pikachu and Poké Ball set</a> includes 2050 pieces, and retails for £179.99. This model of Pikachu can be displayed in either a battle stance or resting pose. Meanwhile, the Poké Ball can be displayed either opened or closed. In a nice homage for fans of the Pokémon series, the studs of the display base form a '25', which is a a nod to Pikachu's Pokédex number.</p>

This model includes the three posable Kanto partner Pokémon in their fierce and final evolution forms. The vines and feet on Venusaur are moveable, while Blastoise has an "articulated head, arms and water cannons". As for Charizard, users will be able to pose their wings, legs, arms and head.</p>
<p>The model's stands, meanwhile, are set on beach, jungle and volcano-themed bases, to represent each Pokémon type. Lego has also teased an Easter egg for users to find.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/eevee-72151">smaller build is Eevee</a>, with this model coming in at 587 pieces and retailing for £54.99. As with the other models, Eevee can be posed, with Lego saying users will be able to make it look as though the Pokémon is "on the move". You will also be able to move the model's ears, feet and legs. Eevee also has an articulated tail.</p>
<p>Again, Eevee's model features a hidden Easter egg, which Lego says highlights the Pokémon's "many evolutions".</p>
<p>These Lego sets are all available to pre-order now, and will be shipped on 27th February. Those that pre-order will also receive the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/kanto-region-badge-collection-40892">Kanto Region Badge Collection set</a>, providing stocks last.</p>

<figure data-uuid="27deebf30322b"><a title="Persona 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/27deebf30322b/persona-5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Atlus</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/persona_5">Persona 5</a> originally released in Japan in September 2016, which means it's been nearly a <em>decade</em> since the latest mainline entry first hit shelves. Fans are exceptionally eager to see what <strong>'Persona 6'</strong> might look like, and according to a brief tease from the franchise's <a href="https://asia.sega.com/p30th/en/">30th anniversary website</a>, we might not be waiting too much longer to get our first glimpse.</p>
<p>As covered by our pals over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/persona-anniversary-site-mentions-next-chapter-for-the-series">Push Square</a>, the Google link to the 30th Anniversary website includes a short snippet of information that reads: "Come celebrate the journey as we usher in the next chapter for the series."</p>
<p>Now, it's possible that this could be referring to the upcoming <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/persona_4_revival">Persona 4 Revival</a> which, at the time of writing, has not yet been confirmed for the Switch 2. That seems a little odd though, right? To us, "the next chapter" is more likely a reference to the inevitable brand-new game which, unless something drastic happens, is likely to be called Persona 6.</p>
<p>But still, we're not going to get <em>too</em> excited for the time being. It's a really small piece of information and we think it would be a remarkable coincidence if a Google description was our first official indication of Persona 6.</p>
<p>Atlus will no doubt have much more to say as we work our way through 2026, so we'll let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/icarus-sales-1m-steam-winter-sale</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Icarus </em>creator Dean Hall has revealed that his game, which was released four years ago, received a huge sales boost from the recent Steam Winter Sale, and for that matter, so did its DLC.</p><p>Speaking on social media platform <a href="https://x.com/rocket2guns/status/2010559063088934997" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">X</a>, Hall revealed earlier today that <em>Icarus </em>clocked up just shy of a million base game sales during the Steam sale, and that RocketWerkz also managed to sell just under a quarter of a million "DLC units".</p><p>As a quick reminder, <em>Icarus </em>was on offer at a pretty hefty discount during the sale; while the game would usually set you back $35 (as, indeed, it would if you picked it up now), buying it during the Steam winter sale would have cost you just $3.50.</p><figure role="group">

  </article>

<figcaption><em>Icarus </em>racked up a pretty healthy sales total during the Steam winter sale.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are several DLC packs available for <em>Icarus</em>, including three major expansions and a number of smaller additions to the game. Hall doesn't break down which of the packs were most popular during the sale, unfortunately.</p><p>Still, given the fact that <em>Icarus </em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/icarus-release-date-takes-flight-this-december" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f3f90dad-acfd-4ecf-81f3-78c72b65f1bb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">entering its fifth year</a>, getting a million-sale boost, however deep the discount may be, is a pretty impressive feat. There's clearly still an appetite for Hall's particular brand of session-based survival.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Icarus</em>, it's a survival game that shares some of its DNA with extraction shooters. You can either choose to take on timed missions to complete objectives under pressure or simply explore <em>Icarus</em>' hostile terraformed environment at your own pace.</p><p><em>Icarus</em>' popularity has almost certainly been aided by the pedigree of its creator; Dean Hall is also one of the people responsible for perennially popular zombie survival game <em>DayZ</em>, so his name lends gravitas and credence to this title as well.</p>
<p>Right now, <em>Icarus </em>is only available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1149460/ICARUS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a>, but it's coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S sometime this year as well.

            <p>A poster advertising a definitive edition of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division">Tom Clancy’s The Division</a> appears to have been spotted by folks attending a Ubisoft-run eSports event in Japan. At least, that's assuming this isn't some elaborate ruse designed to draw in spies from other game studios, while only Jack Ryan can see what's truly going on.</p>

<p>Snaps of the poster from attendees of <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/esports/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/5JKjM9XlbV6Lyd2xNYzkIf/apac-cup-at-fps-day-details">FPS Day</a> - an event in Tokyo currently hosting grand final of Rainbow Six 6 Siege's APAC cup - began to pop up over the weekend.

<p>According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-poster-for-the-division-definitive-edition-has-reportedly-appeared-at-a-ubisoft-event-in-japan/">VGC</a>, the event's set to host 10th anniversary panel for The Division today. I've reached out to Ubisoft in case the company fancy providing definitive proof of this definitive edition prior to any definitive announcements they might have planned.</p>
<p>Since The Division's release in 2016, it's been followed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-division-2-review">a sequel</a>, with The Division 3 having been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-building-a-team-to-make-tom-clancys-the-division-3">announced back in 2023</a> but had gone pretty quiet until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-3-is-gearing-up-to-be-a-monster-says-series-executive-producer/1100-6537293/">fairly recently</a>.</p>
<p>Brendy (RPS in peace) expressed an appreciation for The Division in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-division-pc-review">near decade old review</a>, despite the shooter having plenty of hangups and annoyances which could get on your wick:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reading this, you might think I have mixed feelings. Really, I have mostly-good feelings. I have all the same problems with The Division as I had with its closest bedmate, Destiny. The transparency of its bit-by-bit progression system, the gating of areas by level, the sponginess of its enemies, its reliance on scrubbing the map clean of icons, all designed to make you grind first and think later. And yet I enjoy it a lot more than the latter.</p>
<p>I think this is all down to the setting and the fine detail of the streets. In Destiny, you get Peter Dinklage nattering on about "the light" and "the darkness" and any other fantasy sci-fi cliché you can pull out of your cryo tube. In The Division you get enemies with motives, a world with a reason for being the way it is, and bosses with some semblance of character. I'm not saying there are no clichés (a virus has run amok). It's just that they are of a much higher quality.</p></blockquote>
<p>We'll have to see if this a case of loose lips sinking the secretness of a Typhoon-class ballistic missile submarine-level repackaging of a near ten year old shooter, or some sort of goof.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A quick word-association exercise will usually produce the word “Bose” when the question is “luxury headphones.” In terms of performance and especially active noise cancellation, that’s absolutely true. But in terms of price, even Bose’s newest models are more accessible than you might think, and never more accessible than right now <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6718/">thanks to this $50-off Amazon deal on the QuietComfort Ultra 2 wireless headphones</a>.</p>
<p data-start="690" data-end="1017">The QC Ultra 2s dropped just this past October at $450, but lately Amazon and other retailers have quietly slashed the price deep into deal hunter territory. That means this $400 Amazon deal represents savings on months-old Bose headphones that would make even the most hardened tech shopper blink and the most devoted audiophile reach for their wallet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="690" data-end="1017">Serious Sound, Serious Deal</h2>
<p data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Here’s the wild part: Despite its premium positioning and outstanding , this deal pushes the QC Ultra 2s <em data-start="1101" data-end="1108">below</em> the cost of some older Bose QuietComfort models (yeah, the ones that aren’t even “Ultra”). So if you were on the fence about spending bigger on flagship-level noise cancellation, this Amazon deal makes the argument a whole lot easier.</p>
<p data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Bose took their stellar original QuietComfort Ultra headphones and made several significant upgrades to create the QuietComfort Ultra 2s. This latest model delivers Bose’s very best adaptive noise cancellation performance, with AI-based background noise suppression and Wind Block tech for listening in windy conditions. Bose added two new sound modes – Immersion and Cinema — along with support for wired lossless listening via audio or USB-C cables. The Cinema mode is a high-performing spatial setting which balances the overall audio in favor of dialogue, ideal for streaming and podcasts.</p>


<h2 data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Truly Premium</h2>
<p data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Even the physical look of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2 headphones is a step up from the originals, with more premium materials, polished metal yokes, and an overall sleeker and more modern look. The over-ear comfort level of the Ultra 2s is a step up from the already-pleasing original Ultras, and the battery life has been upgraded from 24 hours to 30. But it’s the active noise cancellation that Bose really leans into, and if you’re still recovering from holiday travel that involved overcrowded planes or trains stuffed with noisy commuters, you know the real value of a pair of world-class noise-cancelling headphones.</p>
<p data-start="1019" data-end="1366">Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra 2 wireless headphones pair easily with any Bluetooth device — Apple, Google, Android, and any properly equipped smart TV, for starters — and the Bluetooth Core 5.4 connection is strong and steady. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6718/">This somewhat unexpected Amazon sale bringing the QC Ultra 2 headphones down to $400 so soon after their release is the best way for you to experience true Bose sound without breaking the bank.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Peak Dev Explains The Completely Bonkers Psychology Behind Game Prices]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/game-pricing-indie-steam-peak-content-warning-2000658886</link>
            <guid>1403395</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Game pricing is more all over the place than it’s ever been as developers explore the top and low ends of the spectrum, as well as everywhere in-between. And that’s before seasonal sales, subscription services, and monthly giveaways. Indie games in particular used to have to fight to prove they were worth the price of admission in the eyes of gamers used to big blockbuster spectacles produced on AAA budgets. But the psychology underlying those perceptions isn’t as clearcut as some might think, according to one of the developers of 2025’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-steam-reviews-lethal-company-aggro-crab-1851786254">top-selling “friendslop” climbing sim <em>Peak</em></a>.</p> <p>The game <a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-steam-reviews-lethal-company-aggro-crab-1851786254">launched last June</a> at a discounted sale price of $5. That was $3 below what would be it’s “normal” price of $8. Co-creator Nick Kaman recently explained the logic behind the maneuver <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/peak-interview">to <em>Game File</em></a>. “We had this joke of, like, how much is a game really?” he said. “In a player’s mind, what does it mean to spend five bucks? Well, that’s five bucks. But six bucks? Well, that’s still five bucks. Four bucks is also kind of five bucks.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “Three bucks is two bucks. And two bucks is basically free. So we’ve got these tiers: You know, twelve bucks… that’s ten bucks. But thirteen bucks is fifteen bucks. And we found that eight bucks is still five bucks. It doesn’t become ten bucks. Seven ninety nine, that’s five bucks, right? So, eight bucks going to five bucks is the biggest differential we could find in pricing, so we found it very optimal.”</p>   <p>The developers of<em> Peak</em> didn’t randomly pick $8 out of a hat. That was the <a href="https://kotaku.com/content-warning-impressions-1851407637">price of <em>Content Warning</em></a>, another hit in the multiplayer virality sim genre. But the overall logic lines up with something game designer and Suspicious Developments studio founder Tom Francis recently wrote about indie game pricing. His take was <a href="https://www.pentadact.com/2026-01-08-15-years-of-indie-dev-in-4-bits-of-advice/#price">part of a four-point advice guide</a> for new developers based on his 15 years of experience making games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/heat-signature-is-a-thrilling-game-about-spaceship-heis-1818625899"><em>Heat Signature</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/tactical-breach-wizards-impressions-strategy-steam-1851626007"><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></a>.</p>

 <h2>Steam indie game pricing is a “solved problem”</h2> <p>According to Francis, game sales are a function of three things: 1) how many people come to the Steam Page, 2) how much the Steam page makes them want to buy it, and 3) how much it costs. “We just ask people how much they think the game should cost, and every time we’ve gone with the price most people chose, and every time they’ve sold great and reviewed great,” he explained.</p>

 <p>He pushed back against the older conventional wisdom that meeting player expectations rather than setting them would lead indie game prices in a race to the bottom. “Among the many genres and models that didn’t exist back then is the occasional janky/silly/ugly game charging $5 to encourage a kind of ‘fuck it, why not’ good will, and blowing up if it lands right with streamers,” he wrote. “That might bring the median price down, but it’s not a sign that people will no longer pay $20 for an indie game.”</p>

 <p>You can see this philosophy in action with the recent release of <em>Rising Front</em>, a pretty ugly-looking, very rudimentary WWI and Revolutionary War battle sim FPS (complimentary). Its 1.0 launch on Steam on January 9 was accompanied by an influx of fairly positive reviews. It’s normally priced at $15 but is currently on sale for just $12. According to Kaman, that’s actually $10. Maybe after reading the <em>Peak</em> developer’s comments, <em>Rising Front</em>‘s creators will lower it to $8.</p>

<p>Hytale’s pre-purchases have helped Hypixel Studios secure development costs for the next 2 years. </p>



<p>Hypixel Studios’ highly anticipated title, Hytale, is all set to release in early access tomorrow, January 13, 2026, and it seems that it could be a massive launch as the founder of the studios is expecting over one million players. The founder may not be wrong, as the pre-purchases alone have helped them secure capital to keep supporting the game. </p>







<h2 id="h-hypixel-founder-reaffirms-his-commitment-to-support-hytale-for-10-years">Hypixel Founder Reaffirms His Commitment to Support Hytale for 10 Years</h2>



<p>Through a new post on <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010691717637222614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Hypixel’s founder revealed that they have “officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases.” That, along with his personal commitment to support the game for the next 10 years, will make the fans happy that the game’s future is in good hands. In the same thread, the founder also revealed that the development team now consists of over 50 developers. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Hytale has had a turbulent history to reach where it is now. Riot Games had closed down the game for good; however, Hypixel Studios decided to reacquire the rights of the title and breathe new life into it. The popularity of the title is now higher than ever, and the early access launch will decide what lies in the future for this sandbox game blended with RPG action and adventure. </p>







<p>In other news, Hytale is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-skipping-steam-initially-to-avoid-negative-reviews-console-launch-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skipping the Steam launch initially</a> to avoid negative reviews during early access, and a console launch is also planned.

He added: “combined with my personal commitment of 10 years, we are looking very strong for the future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Three pre-purchase options are available: the Standard Edition costs $23.99; the Supporter Edition costs $41.99; and the Founder's Edition costs $83.99. Collins-Laflamme confirmed the Hytale development team is now “50+ or so.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It all points to enormous early success for Hytale, which has endured a tumultuous development. Hytale was announced in December 2018 with a trailer that has an incredible 62 million views on <a href="https://youtu.be/o77MzDQT1cg?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube</u></a>. Here’s the official blurb, as it was back then:</p><blockquote>Hytale combines the scope of a sandbox with the depth of a roleplaying game, immersing players in a procedurally generated world where teetering towers and deep dungeons promise rich rewards throughout their adventures. Hytale supports everything from block-by-block construction to scripting and minigame creation, delivered using easy to use and powerful tools.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Excitement around Hytale was fueled by the experience of the developers themselves, who co-founded Hypixel, one of the most influential Minecraft servers in the world. Riot invested in the project and eventually bought the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in November, League of Legends developer Riot Games confirmed it had sold the rights to Hytale back to Collins-Laflamme after it had acquired the game back in 2020. Riot said that after considering "a range of options," it decided to sell the IP rights back to Collins-Laflamme as this "gives players the best chance to one day experience a revised version of the game they've been waiting for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Development on the game had been stagnating despite its sale to Riot, but Collins-Laflamme set out to resurrect the dying IP, confirming he had rehired scores of developers who had worked on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2006090043665088900" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> published at the end of 2025, Collins-Laflamme expressed his "anger" at what had happened to Hytale over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The game has insane potential, but four years of engineering went into rebuilding the engine rather than gameplay features," he said. "That leaves us with a four-year gap and a lot of catching up to do, and that rebuilt engine is never gonna be used.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When you don’t invest in gameplay, you don’t just lose time. You lose momentum, iteration, and player feedback. Now the focus has to be on gameplay first and rebuilding trust by actually shipping things at a rapid pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s a damn miracle we were able to salvage Hytale. It was barely playable. All basics were broken. Camera, movement, combat, crafting, building, gameloop, sounds, rendering. Everything, everything was wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It should have taken years to fix, but within weeks, we got the game into a playable, fun state. And now, instead of slowing down or celebrating a release, we have to keep pushing for years to make up for the time that was lost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So yes, I feel anger. And I’m turning that into focus and execution. I’m committing more money, more time, and personal sacrifice to deliver the game this vision deserves."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <guid>1403380</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> has issued a warning to fans ahead of what is expected to be a hugely popular early access launch tomorrow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Minecraft-esque sandbox game Hytale’s hotly anticipated PC early access release date is set for January 13, and Hypixel Studios said it expects over 1 million players to turn up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale founder Simon Collins-Laflamme took to <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010458001455640636" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X / Twitter</a> to make the bold 1 million player prediction, and to call on fans to download the launcher today (January 12) and log in “to help us significantly reduce launch-day stress.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">1 million players on launch day may sound like wishful thinking, but Hytale is one of the most anticipated games around, and views to its various trailers are enormous. This one does feel like it’s going to be big.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In November, League of Legends developer Riot Games confirmed it had sold the rights to Hytale back to Collins-Laflamme after it had acquired the game back in 2020. Riot said that after considering "a range of options," it decided to sell the IP rights back to Collins-Laflamme as this "gives players the best chance to one day experience a revised version of the game they've been waiting for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Development on the game had been stagnating despite its sale to Riot, but Collins-Laflamme set out to resurrect the dying IP, confirming he had rehired more than 30 developers who had worked on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale was announced in December 2018 with a trailer that has an incredible 61 million views on <a href="https://youtu.be/o77MzDQT1cg?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube</u></a>. Here’s the official blurb, as it was back then:</p><blockquote>Hytale combines the scope of a sandbox with the depth of a roleplaying game, immersing players in a procedurally generated world where teetering towers and deep dungeons promise rich rewards throughout their adventures. Hytale supports everything from block-by-block construction to scripting and minigame creation, delivered using easy to use and powerful tools.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Excitement around Hytale was fueled by the experience of the developers themselves, who co-founded Hypixel, one of the most influential Minecraft servers in the world. Riot invested in the project and eventually bought the studio. Now, it's ready to go it alone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Hytale and Hypixel Studios are independent again, and we are returning to the original vision from the 2018 trailer," <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collins-Laflamme said in a statement issued in November</a>. "Because we went back to an older game build that was now meant for prototypes, some parts of the game will feel behind, but momentum is strong, and we’re working fast to make this into the game we all dreamed of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Modding and creative tools are in a decent state; however, they’re not where we want them long term. That being said, they’re ready for players who want to create content on day one. This is a good moment for modders, server owners, and creators to step in early! They will play a significant role in Hytale’s future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Since the cancellation, we’ve rehired more than 40 former and new team members, bringing the total to 50. Reacquiring a game from a AAA studio and preparing an early access launch within weeks is rare, and players will be able to watch the progress as it happens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you don’t feel comfortable pre-ordering, please don’t. This is true early access, meaning it’s still very much unfinished and will be buggy for a while, but you have my and the team's commitment to make Hytale the game we’ve always wanted it to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The first impression will be rough, but the path ahead matters more."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, in a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2006090043665088900" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> published at the end of 2025, expressed his "anger" at what had happened to Hytale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The game has insane potential, but four years of engineering went into rebuilding the engine rather than gameplay features. That leaves us with a four-year gap and a lot of catching up to do, and that rebuilt engine is never gonna be used.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When you don’t invest in gameplay, you don’t just lose time. You lose momentum, iteration, and player feedback. Now the focus has to be on gameplay first and rebuilding trust by actually shipping things at a rapid pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s a damn miracle we were able to salvage Hytale. It was barely playable. All basics were broken. Camera, movement, combat, crafting, building, gameloop, sounds, rendering. Everything, everything was wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It should have taken years to fix, but within weeks, we got the game into a playable, fun state. And now, instead of slowing down or celebrating a release, we have to keep pushing for years to make up for the time that was lost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So yes, I feel anger. And I’m turning that into focus and execution. I’m committing more money, more time, and personal sacrifice to deliver the game this vision deserves."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite now allows creator-made games to sell in-game items — and immediately, the platform's most popular experience Steal the Brainrot has added $45 premium item bundles and a chance-based roulette wheel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Steal the Brainrot is Fortnite's biggest third-party game, and over the weekend saw a concurrent peak of more than 1 million users. These players were among the first to witness Steal the Brainrot's new paid-for in-game offerings — such as a 4,900 V-Buck "Present Rot" bundle of two randomized items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games enabled third-party microtransactions last Friday, after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-a-turbulent-time-for-fortnite-battle-royale-epic-games-doubles-down-on-rivalling-roblox-letting-creators-sell-their-own-items-for-the-first-time">previously announcing a U-turn on the policy</a> that had set it apart from rival gaming platform Roblox — where Steal a Brainrot originated. Now, third-party games can offer premium in-game items and effects, with developers pocketing 37% of the proceeds — temporarily doubled to 74% for 12 months — while Epic Games itself takes the remaining cut. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Particular criticism for Steal the Brainrot has been levied against a new roulette-style wheel which lets you pay 100 V-Bucks (around a dollar) for random in-game effects or dollops of cash. The spinner's chance-based outcomes include a 2% chance at a Secret Lucky Rot, or a 0.5% chance at a a Secret Grande Rot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Fortnite killed the entire reason why they were better than Roblox with this one update," one fan <a href="https://x.com/cdn724/status/2010106699567276307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> on social media in response. "Can't even implement custom weapons in two years but they can put in tools to create predatory practices with!!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We returned to loot boxes on Fortnite, [in] the most popular mode depending on the day, just years after Epic Games was fined for having them on the original Fortnite (Save the World)," <a href="https://x.com/cdn724/status/2010106699567276307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> another.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I was optimistic about In-Island Translations, but after seeing this gambling style wheel In Steal The Brainrot I think I'm all set... <a href="https://t.co/gMXjIOg1g4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/gMXjIOg1g4</a></p>— TheCoolDoggo (@thecooldoggo) <a href="https://twitter.com/thecooldoggo/status/2010179198338416965?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Steal the Brainrot's 4,900 V-Buck "Present Rot" bundle has also come under fire — not only for its price, but for it being advertised as a limited-time discount on its usual 5,400 V-Buck cost. One of the constraints Epic Games has placed on third-party microtransactions is a 5,000 V-Buck upper limit for any individual item — meaning this item's saving is discounted from a price that couldn't actually be sold</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Super disappointed in the Brain Rot guys, not only very ethically questionable to do a 'discount' while the feature is not even 24h out but the real prize is not even possible according to the rules," Fortnite third-party developer <a href="https://x.com/Richytoons/status/2010042859735662624" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richytoons</a> noted. "You make us all look bad with this kind of stuff."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Implementation by other developers seems less egregious, with the popular Murder Mystery game simply allowing players to buy cosmetic items that don't impact gameplay, while Tilted Zone Wars allows users to pay 50 V-Bucks (less than a dollar) to flood the game's map for all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exactly how developers will implement Epic Games' rules on monetization in the long-term remains to be seen. Oddly, Steal the Brainrot suddenly disappeared offline overnight last night for several hours, leading to fan speculation that the game had been pulled by Epic Games over its monetization usage. But a developer update has said a now-fixed bug was the cause, and at the time of writing the game is now back available, reportedly with no discernible changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite fans first <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-fans-say-the-game-is-opening-the-door-to-loot-boxes-by-allowing-creator-made-modes-to-sell-paid-random-items-though-their-sale-is-restricted-in-certain-countries-and-sellers-are-required-to-disclose-odds">voiced concerns last year that Epic Games' plans risked opening the door to loot box mechanics and predatory monetization</a> within the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair has made the surprise announcement of an official Palworld Trading Card Game, due out this summer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair has partnered with Japanese TCG specialist Bushiroad for Palworld Official Trading Card Game, which has a July 30, 2026 release date. The teaser trailer is below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>This game is a 2-player competitive card game where you can enjoy strategic and tactical battles through deploying various unique Pals. Players fight alongside their Pal companions, gathering resources, and building bases as they aim for victory. These adorable and dependable Pals will utilize their own unique traits to lead you to victory. Team up with your trusty Pals and experience the thrill of overcoming formidable enemies through this exciting trading card game.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, the announcement has sparked further comparisons between Palworld and Pokémon, which has a hugely popular trading card game of its own. “They really are going the Pokémon route and merchandising everything,” said one fan. “Palworld anime when?” added another. “Nintendo: heavy breathing,” said one YouTube commenter. “NOW THEY JUST TROLLING!!!!” laughed one fan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Pocketpair announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld-palfarm">Palworld: Palfarm</a>, a farming and crafting spinoff that was revealed just a week after Nintendo revealed cozy farming sim <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-pokopia"><u>Pokémon Pokopia</u></a>. Pocketpair ended up issuing a response after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-tinfoil-hats-are-out-in-force-pocketpair-dev-responds-after-pokmon-fans-question-timing-of-palworld-palfarm-announcement-just-a-week-after-pokmon-pokopia-nintendo-direct-reveal">some Pokémon fans questioned the timing of the Palworld: Palfarm announcement</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair has certainly moved quickly to capitalize on Palworld’s explosive success. (In March 2024, Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe said the company couldn’t handle the massive profits the game had generated.) While working on its 1.0 release, the Japanese studio is developing Palfarm, working on this new Palworld TCG, running a publishing studio of its own, and it has its other game, Craftopia to update.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld: Palfarm First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair is of course embroiled in a high-profile patent battle with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company over Palworld, which is expected to progress this year. The Nintendo-Palworld lawsuit, which has been ongoing in Japan since its announcement in September 2024, involves three patents, two related to monster capture and release, and one related to riding characters. For more details, check out IGN’s coverage of the lawsuit, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rewrites-patent-mid-case-in-ongoing-lawsuit-against-palworld-dev-pocketpair-but-why"><u>why Nintendo re-wrote patents mid-case</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-mods-dont-count-as-prior-art-as-theyre-not-full-games-attempting-to-sway-judge-in-palworld-lawsuit"><u>Nintendo’s recent move to discount mods as "prior art."</u></a> All the while, Nintendo has been busy obtaining patents — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-should-never-have-received-controversial-summon-character-and-let-it-fight-pokmon-patent-ip-lawyers-say"><u>some of which IP lawyers said should never have been granted</u></a> — as it develops its case against Pocketpair, which has vowed to defend itself in court.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
