<figure data-uuid="17cca6068e279"><a title="Super Mario Odyssey" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/17cca6068e279/super-mario-odyssey.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Eight years ago today, a little game called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> launched on the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>We've said so much over the years about this incredible entry from Nintendo, we won't go over it all again here. But <a href="https://x.com/ima_1966/status/1982703457338540178">a recent post</a> from ex-Nintendo developer Takaya Imamura caught our eye and we simply felt compelled to highlight it, if only for how old it instantly made us feel.</p>
<p>Imamura-san highlighted Odyssey's anniversary and drew an amusing comparison to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>. Essentially, eight years prior to the N64 classic puts Nintendo right in the middle of the Famicom/NES days. The company would subsequently launch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land">Super Mario Land</a><em>,</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land_2_6_golden_coins">Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins</a>, <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island">Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</a> all before our favourite plumber would dive headfirst into the 3D realm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It’s unbelievable that this is a game from 8 years ago! Eight years before Super Mario 64 was still the heyday of the Famicom, and I myself was a student back then."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, since Odyssey, we've had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_maker_2">Super Mario Maker 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>. Sigh... it's a different world we live in now, huh?</p>
<p>Naturally, we're confident Nintendo is simply taking its time to ensure it delivers a new 3D Mario title worthy of its remarkable legacy, but it just goes to show how quickly the company could churn out bonafide classics back in the '80s and '90s.</p>
<p>As we mentioned, however, if nothing else it just makes us feel so very, very old. How has it been eight years already? That's nearly a <em>decade</em>, for goodness' sake!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-battlefield-redsec-launches-tomorrow/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-battlefield-6-free-to-play-battle-royale-mode-officially-called-battlefield-redsec-launches-tomorrow.1335916/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Battlefield 6 battle royale mode has finally been revealed and will officially be called Battlefield REDSEC. <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-shadow-drop-next-week-rumour/">As rumoured</a>, it'll launch tomorrow, and it'll be free-to-play.</p>



<p>EA and Battlefield Studios revealed the mode with <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1982824837849760155">a short post on the official Battlefield X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, which included a link to a gameplay trailer that'll go live tomorrow, alongside the mode itself going live.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We'll have more official knowledge on the mode tomorrow when the gameplay trailer goes live, which will likely <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news">be followed by a blog post on the Battlefield 6 website</a>, though for now we do have other claims from ModernWarzeon, the X (formerly Twitter) account who initially leaked the REDSEC title and correctly claimed it would be shadow dropped tomorrow.</p>



<p>According to ModernWarzone, Battlefield REDSEC will arrive with a Duos and Squads queues, letting players hop in as teams of two or teams of four, with a maximum player count of 100 players for matches.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 BF6 BR LAUNCH PLAYLIST 🚨</p><p>EXCLUSIVE: Duos (2) and Squads (4) is currently planned to be the ONLY team sizes available at launch for the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale / RedSec.</p><p>So with 100 player count max thats a total of 25 teams of 4 or 50 teams of 2 in every match of RedSec <a href="https://t.co/Uy2D7vlCUh">pic.twitter.com/Uy2D7vlCUh</a></p></div>— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1982171308839276707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Battlefield REDSEC will also be arriving alongside Season 1 for Battlefield 6, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">which, as I noted in my preview,</a> is adding a couple of stellar Conquest maps with Blackwell Ridge and Eastwood, but a couple of lacklustre game modes with the permanent and limited time modes to come. What makes the arrival of REDSEC even more exciting is that it'll be a peek at what is arguably going to be the best map in Battlefield 6, Eastwood, since the opening map for REDSEC is set in Southern California.</p>



<p>REDSEC is EA and Battlefield Studio's response to Call of Duty: Warzone, and it could not have come at a more opportune time for Battlefield since the Call of Duty brand <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-identity-concerns-black-ops-6-carry-forward-black-ops-7/">continues to be in an identity crisis</a>. It also seems like EA and Battlefield Studios are taking advantage of Battlefield 6 launching more than a month ahead of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, capitalizing on FPS players who would otherwise be spending their time waiting for the new Call of Duty to release.</p>



<p>Of course, they could still be doing that while playing Battlefield 6, dropping it for Black Ops 7 when that arrives in November, but for now EA has the chance to get its hooks into players that would otherwise not give Battlefield the time of day. We'll see how REDSEC does when it arrives tomorrow.</p>

            <p>What happened today? Well, Astarion said something sassy, Lae'zel tried to teach Gale how to build a shed, and Shadowheart wrote a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gauntlet">Gauntlet</a> of Shar-themed parody of 'Is This The Way To Amarillo'. That's about how I imagine the journal entries a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> mod lets you write as part of an impressive in-game diary system will go.</p>
<p>Well, that and at least 100 words per day of moaning about having a little squid thing in your brain.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The mod's dubbed <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/19332?tab=description">Tav's Journal</a> and has been developed by Mazzle23. It repurposes a clever tool they created for custom in-game mod instruction pages the other month, letting the player take simple quest logs and turn them into detailed diaries packed with entries in which you can document whatever you like. So, when you look back through the events of a playthrough, instead of Larian's default synopses, you'll have unique personal records of what you were doing or thinking at whatever point.</p>
<p>Naturally, it's aimed at the likes of those who get really deep into roleplaying or completionists who might be noting down details to return to, taking the sort of writing you might have done on a physical notepad up until now into the game itself.</p><p>Assuming you're in it to feel more in the shoes of your tadpole-brained adventurer, you can kick off as you would in physical DnD by filling out the character profile and biography section for your character. Mazzle23 boasts of "large text areas for detailed storytelling and notes", so feel free to go full War and Peace if you've time and a person in mind whose life thus far can't be summed up swiftly. Handily for more verbose narrative-weaving entries, the mod's diaries come with their own auto-save system and the ability to jump between editing and read-only modes.</p>
<p>They also include two kinds of to-do list, with the one for long-term goals mirroring the usual quest log, while the other provides for day-specific tasks "tied to particular journal entries" which I assume you'll set up yourself. 'Tell Gale he smells, then laugh when he cries' for instance.</p>
<p>The aesthetically-pilled will be glad to learn that the mod boasts some visual customisation too, with six page themes to pick from and multiple fonts, in case you can't feel truly at one with your dwarf unless you're scrawling across a stone tablet in Comic Sans. Any worries about having to ruin previous work in order to tailor a diary to a fresh playthrough have been planned for, with each character being able to create and maintain their own simultaneously, while you can also duplicate journals if you want templates or backup copies.</p>
<p>All in all, it's a really impressive thing to have pulled off, with Mazzle23 noting than an option to export journals as PDFs and auto-tracking for in-game stats are among the additions they're working on for future updates. If you fancy giving BG3 journaling a go, you'll need grab both the <a href="https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se/releases">BG3 script extender</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/18883?tab=description">Mazzle's EZ-Documentation</a>.</p>

            <p>
Is it bad that I find the office labyrinth of Pager rather cosy? Is it a sign that I have finally gone full 9-to-5 zombie, or have I simply been mugged on Memory Lane by a composite of 90s aesthetics and technologies - pebbly Macintosh wallpaper patterns, mock-Bauhaus prints and yes, pagers, though I never owned one of those as a kid. 
</p>
<p>
I even like the background whine of the omnipresent CCTV cameras, which grows abruptly piercing as I walk beneath them. These are very much the wrong emotions for anything that bills itself as influenced by Kafka. If I have accidentally invented the cosy Kafka genre, I am sorry.

<p>
Created by the evidently self-deprecating bilge, and available in full now on <a href="https://bilgetbd.itch.io/pager/devlog/1095316/pager-full-version-is-out-now">Itch.io</a> with a browser demo, Pager is 60 floors worth of laidback 1-bit dread. You are some kind of office worker. Your boss sends you instructions via pager. The instructions tend to be things like "take this box to room 4". You go to room 4 and it's full of fish swimming by the light of distant stars. The next instruction is to jump three times. Pager does not have a jump button.
</p><p>
It's a gentle spoof of corporate ladder-climbing, a send-up of arbitrary and unknowable bosses and bureaucracies. It mixes humour with horror with a surprising sleepiness. There are a couple of soft jump-scares in the demo, but I was more unnerved by the crackling noise emitted by the butterfly you occasionally find perched on a coffee cup. Butterflies should not crackle. Still, even the butterflies can't wholly undermine the peace I glean from these mostly dark rooms full of dotcom memorabilia. Kafka aside, Pager's inspirations include Severance, Lynch, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a>, Serial Experiments Lain and Sonny Boy. If I have accidentally invented the cosy Lain-alike, I am sorry.

I'm not as bowled over by the demo (which includes the first 10 floors) as I thought I might be, after cooing over the screens. I think the scenarios could be longer, and perhaps wittier. They have a certain dad joke energy, at times - a touch of WarioWare minigame, but couched in a way that leads you to expect something more fiendish.</p>
<p>The developer comments on the Itch.io page that Pager "shouldn't give you any satisfaction", and do you know, I feel like I might ultimately be dissatisfied by a game that declines to give me any satisfaction. But perhaps it's a wind-up - the trailer includes a few scenarios that seem more elaborate and chilling, and the individual puzzles appear to follow a larger story. At the very least, I think it's worth you firing up the demo, especially if you think human art peaked with the launch of Kid Pix. Pager is also available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2810550/PAGER/">Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is making it easier than ever to upgrade your laptop without blowing your budget. In fact, you don’t even need to spend more than $500 on a reliable device that’s ready to take on everyday tasks, multitasking, and even some light gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5021/">Right now, the 15.6-inch HP laptop is down to $499, after a steep 71% off its original price of nearly $1,700.</a> You’re saving an unbelievable $1,200, and this model is only $100 more than the entry-level version with 16GB RAM and 256GB storage. It’s also the lowest we’ve seen it drop to in 30 days. Act fast to grab yours, as the discount might wrap up anytime now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5021/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Responsive, Fast Performance for Work and Entertainment</h2>
<p>Looks-wise, it’s a classic HP laptop. You’re getting that sleek silver finish in a slim, portable frame. It’s lightweight enough to carry around all day without feeling like it’s dragging your shoulder down. Power-wise, though, it’s a whole different story.</p>
<p>The laptop is powered by an Intel N100 processor (quad-core, up to 3.4GHz) for responsive performance for all your tasks. It’s not built for heavy creative workloads, but it’ll handle most regular workdays without slowing you down. With the processor, you’ve got 32GB of RAM for efficient multitasking, plus a 1TB PCIe SSD that offers a huge space to store all that you own. It also runs on Windows 11 Pro, meaning you’ll get to work on one of the most user-friendly, efficient systems out there.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch Full HD anti-glare display pushes detailed visuals that are easier on the eyes. Whether you’re working on presentations or watching a movie, picture quality stays vibrant and sharp. Battery life is just as impressive. Most of it will depend on how you use it, of course, but you can expect to get through a few hours without worrying about plugging it in.</p>
<p>You’re also getting a full set of modern connectivity options that include Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C, two USB-A ports, HDMI, a headphone/mic combo jack, and a smart AC power pin. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5021/">Considering how you’d normally pay over $1,000 for a device with all these features, grabbing the laptop for under $500 feels like a steal</a>. It’s got impressive visuals, a reliable processor, sufficient space, and much more at a discount. Again, we don’t expect the offer to last long, which is why it’s best to grab it sooner rather than later.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Report: Next Xbox Could Be The First Console To Kill The Multiplayer Paywall]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/next-gen-xbox-paid-multiplayer-game-pass-2000639263</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/report-next-xbox-could-be-the-first-console-to-kill-the-multiplayer-paywall.1335901/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For over two decades, Microsoft has been charging Xbox owners anywhere from $4 to $10 a month for access to online multiplayer. The full suite of features was bundled as Xbox Live Gold and has since morphed into being part of Game Pass. The company is now reportedly exploring doing away with that fee for <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-pc-windows-rog-ally-2000638181">its next-gen console</a>, bringing it more in-line with PC gaming where the perk is provided by companies for free.</p> <p>According to a new report <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more">by<em> Windows Central</em></a>, the “current plan” is for the next Xbox to have no paywall for multiplayer. The outlet adds that “it remains to be seen if that plan actually plays out into reality,” but it sounds like there is at least serious consideration within Microsoft for abandoning the last remnants of its Xbox Live legacy with the arrival of the new system or systems which are currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-next-gen-xbox-price-specs-leak-release-date-2000635303">rumored to be releasing near the end of 2027</a>.</p>

 <p>It would be another seismic shift for the company’s gaming division which has long collected this multiplayer tax in exchange for the ability to play annual hits like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Madden</em>, and <em>NBA2K </em>online. While it’s become standard to allow players on console to access free-to-play games without making them pay for platform memberships, forcing players to pay for online gameplay in premium titles like <em>Diablo 4</em>, <em>Mario Kart World</em>, and <em>Helldivers 2</em> has generated massive amounts of what feels like effectively passive income for the respective console makers.</p>

 <p>It’s unclear how many of Game Pass’ millions of subscribers are currently enrolled simply to play with friends online, but that benefit alone is responsible for a huge portion of the cost of the most expensive tier of the program. While Game Pass Ultimate for console users <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">was recently raised to $3</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">0</a>, the service is still just $16.50 on PC where <em>Sea of Thieves</em> and other live-service hits can all be played online for free. Ditching the multiplayer paywall on a more Windows PC-like next-gen Xbox would also require overhauling those pricing schemes.</p> <p>If the plan does go through, there will be two immediate questions: Why did Microsoft spend all of those previous years charging Xbox users for multiplayer? And how will Sony and Nintendo continue to justify charging for multiplayer on the upcoming PlayStation 6 and current Switch 2? Competition between platforms is good, and Microsoft providing valuable and meaningful alternatives in the future would be one way to help pressure both Sony and Nintendo into doing the same.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/when-is-the-fortnite-live-event-the-simpsons-x-fortnite-live-event-start-time-explained.1335898/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite’s regular slew of updates continues, and fresh off the back of another Fortnitemares event, the final part of Chapter 6 will begin after a special live event to mark the start of The Simpsons mini-season.</p>



<p>Following on from the Star Wars-themed mini-season earlier this year, The Simpsons will drop with a special Springfield map to explore, including various POIs, alongside a new Battle Pass, weapons, and more content.</p>



<p>A special live event is planned in Fortnite to mark the start of The Simpsons mini-season, and we’ve got all the details on what time you need to be in the game to catch it.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-fortnite-live-event">When is The Fortnite Live Event?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It was all yellow. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Epic Games has confirmed the live event for Fortnite ahead of The Simpsons mini-season will take place on Saturday, November 1.</strong></p>



<p>The long-awaited, and heavily rumoured, Simpsons-themed season will bring down the curtain on Chapter 6, with one month of themed content before the jump into Chapter 7 in December.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1982818597702713829" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games’ tweet</a> confirming the live event announced that the alien duo Kang and Kodos will have a “special announcement” for players to watch in-game, which will likely be followed by a period of downtime before The Simpsons mini-season kicks off properly.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-is-the-fortnite-live-event">What Time is The Fortnite Live Event?</h2>



<p><strong>The live event ahead of The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite will begin at 11 AM ET, Epic Games has confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>Expect the servers to be extremely busy, as they always are for the live events, and enter the game in advance of that time to secure your spot. At this stage, it’s unclear whether PvP will be turned off for the duration of the event to allow players to tune into the action without the threat of elimination.</p>



<p>In the table below, we’ve highlighted the start time of the Fortnite live event in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Fortnite Live Event Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">8 AM – Nov. 1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM – Nov. 1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">11 AM – Nov. 1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">3 PM – Nov. 1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">1 AM – Nov. 2</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

After a failed mission wipes Decem’s memories, set out to relearn the reason for his existence by retrieving memory fragments scattered across a futuristic utopia. Along the way, seek out the dark secrets behind the seemingly perfect world Decem was created to maintain.</p><p>Dash and slash through Mirrormares, mental anguish manifesting as mechanized foes. Decem leaves a temporary trail of light in his wake, and his Spatial Retrace ability stops time, empowering him to instantly teleport back to any point of the trail. Retrace to set up enemy-interrupting surprise attacks from unexpected angles, and solve mind-bending puzzles where the confines of time and space block the path forward.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Battle behemoth mechanical bosses with tactical thinking and keen spatial awareness, manipulating time and space to Decem’s will. Create a personalized fight style with seven Primary Combat Modules and twenty Secondary Modules for a custom combination of light and heavy strikes, charge attacks, counters, stances, and much more.</p><p>Encounter other Enforcers, learn about their missions, and explore a visually stunning world across crumbling ruins and bustling cities. Discover the forgotten past and determine humanity’s future in one of five multiple endings.

                <p dir="ltr">Microsoft revolutionized online multiplayer in the console space with Xbox Live in 2002. And ever since then, playing games online has come at a cost for Xbox owners. But that might not be the case going forward with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/">the next-gen Xbox system</a>, according to a new report.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more" rel="nofollow ">Windows Central</a> states that "the current plan is for the next Xbox specifically to have no paywall for multiplayer." This would be a notable change, as an (at least) Xbox Game Pass Essential subscription is needed for online multiplayer for Xbox at this time. However, Microsoft doesn't charge for access to free-to-play multiplayer games, like Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone--two of the most popular games in the world.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Another reason for this possible change comes from the fact Windows Central reports that the next-gen Xbox will offer a console experience combined with a full Windows PC interface, if desired. As such, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-is-good-hardware-let-down-by-annoying-software/1100-6535471/">the ROG Xbox Ally handhelds</a>, the next-gen Xbox would then allow access to various PC storefronts, such as Steam and <a href="http://battle.net/" rel="nofollow ">Battle.net</a>. If Microsoft were to keep charging for online multiplayer, then the theory goes those owners might just forgo the Xbox Store and utilize Steam instead on the device.</p><p dir="ltr">Last week, Xbox president Sarah Bond said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-will-be-high-end-with-a-curated-experience-xbox-president-says/1100-6535604/">next Xbox would be "a very premium, very high-end curated experience."</a> She also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-reconfirms-next-gen-xbox-hardware-is-in-development/1100-6535554/">reconfirmed that Xbox was working on new hardware</a>, after rumors surfaced that Microsoft might exit the console space.</p><p>Microsoft is also apparently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/free-xbox-cloud-gaming-plan-with-ads-is-officially-in-testing-microsoft-confirms/1100-6535714/">testing out a free Xbox Cloud Gaming plan with ads</a>. This would have players watch a couple of minutes of video ads, for example, before having access to a curated selection of games or possibly ones they already own. Last but not least, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-games-will-be-on-playstation-going-forward-says-microsoft/1100-6535712/">Halo games will be on PlayStation going forward</a>, starting with Halo: Campaign Evolved.</p>

When asked whether Halo Studios used AI in any capacity, whether that be retouching assets or rebuilding environments, Conn explained that AI can streamline workflows, but people create the games.</p>

<p>"I want to be very clear … People are creative. People make games. AI can improve workflows. It can do things for the game," Conn said. "But I want to be very specific and clear that the people are the ones who are creating the game, and there’s an opportunity to improve a workflow, or something along those lines, we’ll look at it again. It really should be additive to the creation of a game."</p><p>Hermann echoed Conn's sentiment, explaining that, like other tools developers use when making games--such as Photoshop or Unity--AI is simply the same thing. It's the brush that helps the artist paint. It can aid in the execution, but it's people who hold the creative spark.</p><p>"It's a tool in a toolbox," Hermann said. "I may go a little off message here, but some of that gets very challenging when we look at how integrated AI is becoming within our tooling. We use Photoshop. There's generative fill, for example. The boundary lines can get a little fuzzy. I will say, though, again, to Damon's point, it really is about that creative spark that comes from people and improving just overall workflows."</p><p>The question remains of whether Halo Studios was required to use generative AI when making the game. And for that, an Xbox representative told Rolling Stone that no such mandate exists.</p><p>"There is no mandate to use generative AI in our game development, and that includes Halo: Campaign Evolved," the Xbox representative told the publication in a later statement.</p><p>This comes at an interesting time for Microsoft/Xbox and the games industry at large. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-admits-xbox-hasnt-protected-its-creative-teams-but-doing-so-is-very-important/1100-6535690/" data-ref-id="1100-6535690">recently admitted</a> that the company doesn't always do the best at protecting the creativity of its staff. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reached-4-trillion-valuation-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6533588/" data-ref-id="1100-6533588">Microsoft reached a $4 trillion valuation</a> despite the myriad layoffs, with a report suggesting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">the company's astronomical profit goals could be doing more harm to Microsoft</a> than good. And some studios, from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">EA</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-invests-70-million-to-become-ai-first-company/1100-6535653/" data-ref-id="1100-6535653">Krafton Inc.</a>, are going all in artificial intelligence, with prominent developers saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">the technology should be embraced</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devs-who-dont-embrace-ai-are-selling-themselves-short-ex-god-of-war-dev-says/1100-6535614/" data-ref-id="1100-6535614">game developers are selling themselves short</a>.</p><p>Still, it's quite fascinating to see an Xbox exclusive make the jump to PlayStation. It really does seem like Microsoft is leaning into its latest marketing strategy, which purports that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">everything is an Xbox</a>--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/your-next-car-could-also-be-your-xbox-thanks-to-lg-and-cloud-gaming/1100-6534573/" data-ref-id="1100-6534573">even your car</a>.</p><p>Halo: Campaign Evolved will launch sometime in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <p>Co-op ghost hunting game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> is, somewhat surprisingly, being made into a board game.</p>
<p>Images and a teaser video for the project were shared over the weekend, showing a cardboard tile, card and dice-based reinterpretation of the game playable by four people. Build a haunted property using the tiles, fill it with randomised items, draw a Ghost Type card from the Investigation Pile, pair it with a randomised evidence pool, and get going.</p>
<p>There's a Ghost Behaviour board that keeps the ghost's actions feeling unpredictable as you play, and as your sanity depletes (as it does in the video game), the ghost becomes more aggressive. I don't quite know how you'll make it scary without all the set dressing and sound effects that accompany the video game experience, but perhaps the tension will translate - who knows? Maybe play it in a haunted house just in case?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia: The Board Game</a> is being made in collaboration with Lost in Cult, which is better known for making bespoke physical editions of culty video games. Phasmophobia will actually be the first board game it's made, it seems.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are now open ahead of the board game's estimated Q4 2026 release date. A standard version of Phasmophobia: The Board Game will cost you £80, and a deluxe edition - which features glow in the dark hand prints and foil-backed cards, among other things - will cost £120.</p><p>Phasmophobia has been a phenomenal success as a video game, selling more than 25 million copies and transforming the life of originating solo developer Daniel Knight. I went to meet him earlier this year to hear and then tell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-phasmophobia-how-the-witcher-3-inadvertently-saved-the-ghost-hunting-game-that-sold-25-million-copies">his incredible Phasmophobia success story</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-could-be-playing-vanquish-right-now.1335862/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You. Yes, you!&nbsp; The person reading this. Have you ever strolled down the street on a crisp autumn day and thought to yourself “I could be playing the 2010 action game <em>Vanquish</em>, developed by PlatinumGames at the peak of their mastery, at this very moment?” If that thought has ever crossed your mind, then I have good news for you. There is, in fact, very little stopping you from playing one of the best action games ever made provided you have about twenty dollars and a platform to play it on.</p><figure></figure><p>If you do not know <em>Vanquish</em>, or only know about it vaguely by reputation, I’m excited for you. You may have overlooked it at the time because it was a third person cover shooter in 2010 and generally Japan was in a patchy place with releases in that era. Imagine the general growling tone and demeanor of <em>Gears of War</em>, but now imagine if it has held up well. You play Sam Gideon, voiced by Gideon Emery, an actor who also voiced Gideon in <em>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</em>. Sam is a guy who works for DARPA, which in this universe is like being a Jedi.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Vanquish by DECosmic in 1:25:08 - Summer Games Done Quick 2021 Online" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M3MDo9HmUMY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Vanquish is basically if a cover shooter was a SHMUP, a dynamic that inverts the flow of a stodgy subgenre that died an ignoble death for good reason. Gideon’s suit primarily lets him do two things: slow down time in small increments or rocket boost while sliding on his knees. Instead of the chunky “roadie run”, you’re flying. You can also end a slide by meleeing quite hard, which sends an enemy flying and feels phenomenal. Like <em>Godhand, </em>parts of <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>and the oft-overlooked GameCube game <em>P.N.03</em> before it, Vanquish has a performative, arcade-y feel as each encounter is aggressively scored. This is not meant to be a game that you consume and forget about, but a game where every encounter can be analyzed and replayed. Like<em> Ninja Gaiden</em>, you are meant to get better at playing <em>Vanquish</em>, and speedruns of the game are truly harrowing to watch. </p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: SEGA</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now is as good a time as any to bring up the fact that Sam Gideon smokes a whole lot. This is the extent of what many people know about this game, the left bumper lets Sam light up a cig and throw it while behind cover, which has tactical uses if you want to distract enemy fire. Though I personally think smoking is a terrible idea and have avoided it most of my life, it also makes Sam look cool as hell, which is not something you are supposed to admit any more. That said he’s also a cyborg or cyborg-adjacent, maybe he can’t get emphysema. I think we should encourage more cyborgs to blast cigs in games, because I simply don’t see that a lot in my day-to-day life.</p><figure></figure><p>Thoroughly explaining the plot of <em>Vanquish </em>would not really not benefit you that much. Some rough notes though: San Francisco gets hit with an orbital death laser that causes people to start exploding. President Elizabeth Winters, who looks suspiciously like Hillary Clinton (a move 2012’s <em>Black Ops II </em>would also pull) sends you to retaliate against Russia in orbit. This involves sending a galactic fleet to one of those rotating wheel space stations like in <em>Citizen Sleeper </em>or <em>Gundam.</em> Gideon’s coworkers are a woman floating in a holographic <em>Minority Report </em>interface named Elena, a bunch of marines and a gigantic pissed guy named Lt. Col. Robert Burns, who looks like he’s there to directly make fun of <em>Gears of War</em>. They got veteran voice actor Steve Blum, voice of Spike Spiegel, to play Burns and both him and Gideon Emery are constantly growling at each other in such a similar timbre that you could mistake them for the same guy. If <em>Gears of War </em>is the goofy crystallization of the post-Iraq invasion, Oorah pissed guy culture, then <em>Vanquish </em>is what happens when Japanese creators turn it inside out.</p><figure></figure><p><em>Vanquish </em>was directed by Shinji Mikami and is the peak of his career post-Capcom. It’s easy to directly draw a throughline through the games he directed previously; the same lighthearted goofiness that’s in <em>God Hand</em> can be seen poking through, particularly when you dropkick an enemy in the stomach after rocketsliding at about fifty miles an hour. It also immediately preceded PlatinumGames’ work on <em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</em>, one of the best games ever made and debatably the best <em>Metal Gear </em>game if you’re the kind of person that likes being confrontational with strangers on the internet. If you enjoy watching a cyborg do some of the sickest shit you’ve ever seen, either game will serve you well.</p><p>Replaying <em>Vanquish</em> is a reminder that, as the saying goes, they simply don’t make them like this any more. I know that my love of <em>Vanquish</em> is not tinted by the specific familiarity that comes from playing a weird game when it comes out, because I played it only in the last few years at the badgering of friends who kept saying “man, you <em>gotta </em>play <em>Vanquish</em>.” Few games like this stand the test of time and feel this good even now. They remastered the game a few years ago and rereleased it along with <em>Bayonetta</em>. Hell, you can throw it on your Steam Deck and it handles it with little trouble.</p><figure></figure><p><em>Vanquish </em>is also a bittersweet game in context because it’s debatable that the PlatinumGames that made this game as well as the specific environment that would have fostered it into being still exist. Platinum has had a few rough years lately. Their last big game was <em>Bayonetta 3 </em>and the less said about <em>Babylon’s Fall </em>the better. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platinumgames-loses-more-game-directors-reveals-former-vice-president-hideki-kamiya" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Much of its staff left</a> and most of its prominent figures have gone off to do their own thing. Mikami himself went to found Tango Gameworks and left it in 2023 before its closure by Microsoft and revival by Krafton, only then found another studio named Kamuy. One hopes that <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> can herald a turning point for Platinum; there are hints of the old Platinum buried in that deeply confusing game. That said, the task of being forced to do the lion’s share of Team Ninja’s dirty work in recreating a technical masterpiece while also being published by <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-microsoft-xbox-30-percent-profit-margin-twitchcon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Studios in 2025</a> are not things I would wish on my worst enemy.</p><p>But perhaps it is more productive to focus on the good times, on a single, impossible game like <em>Vanquish</em>, which can be bought for just under twenty American dollars, often less, and which you may have sitting in your Steam library right now, waiting for a moment like this.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-microsoft-xbox-30-percent-profit-margin-twitchcon"><h3>What The Hell Is Microsoft Doing?</h3></a><p>"They added a new Clippy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I love a good escape room, heading to an often rather innocuous door or shopfront in a less-than-prominent position in town, and then heading into a themed room that’s filled with themed puzzles and secrets to unpick. Since 2020, there’s been more than a few attempts to translate this experience to one you can enjoy at home, and between escape room envelopes, advent calendars, and online portals, it’s video games that manage to capture the tone best of all. Escape Simulator 2 is the latest, thoroughly enjoyable escape room puzzler.</p>
<p><iframe title="Escape Simulator 2 - Coming October 27th to Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rRqKQMewWy8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s an immediacy to Escape Simulator 2’s puzzle rooms, as you simply appear in a space and start running around, finding puzzles and clues, and putting the pieces together. There’s no preamble, no big cutscenes and drama, you’re just chucked into the three distinct settings and themes –&nbsp;Dracula’s Castle, the sci-fi themed Starship EOS and the piratical The Cursed Treasure. That said, there is a throughline to each setting’s collection of four puzzle rooms, the rooms connecting well from the end of one to the start of the next.</p>


<p>There’s a really pleasing interactivity to all the environments, letting you pick up so many incidental items, inspecting books and scraps of paper, dragging crates across the floor, spinning and sitting around in chairs, filling your inventory with all manner of tools, and the like. Anything you grab that’s important is generally quite obvious, with giant gems, special keys and statue pieces, but they are marked with an icon just to be clear. It is important to mess around in these spaces, though, as there’s a lot of visual clues tucked away in corners and on ceilings –&nbsp;not to mention puzzle pieces that are hidden everywhere for pictures back in the lobby.</p>


<p>Oh, and this can all be played in co-op, and I played through the whole game with my better half. So much of the escape room feel comes from playing them with friends and family, where you can all go off and work on your own puzzles, compare discoveries, ask for and offer help, and you have that exact same feel in Escape Simulator 2. Right down to not really having a clue what your teammates have found and done half the time! That said, Pine Studio say that you can play with up to 8 players online, and while that might be possible, I’d say that the included rooms are going to be best with 2-4 players. You can often all look at a puzzle together, with everyone’s cursors floating around together.</p>
<p>So far, so similar to the original game, but Escape Simulator 2 does push in a new visual direction. There’s more darkness, there’s more detailed environments and characters compared to the more cartoony original, and it generally looks good, but there are plenty of quirks and rougher edges to the game’s presentation in general.</p>

<p>There’s no clipping with other people that you’re playing with –&nbsp;quite necessary if there’s going to be eight running around –&nbsp;and that leads to plenty of looking through unintentionally bald heads, or being half through someone’s head. There’s some odd or missing animations both in first and third person. Things like climbing out of a cryo bed or shifting from a ladder, or a puzzle suddenly shifting you to a completely different perspective with no explanation, and a bunch of other examples. It just takes a few seconds to figure out what’s happened, but it takes you out of the moment as you go “wait, what just happened?” I also wish that, since you can share a view of a puzzle screen, you could also share the clues you’re trying to use –&nbsp;these you can pin on screen, which is rather handy.</p>
<p>Similarly, the hints system is a little odd sometimes. It has to cater to a lot of freeform puzzling, and on the few occasions that we used it, it did generally do well – it spawns a paper diagram so you can pass this and share it with others –&nbsp;but there were a couple points where it wasn’t offering us any hints. That was particularly annoying at the end of the Starship EOS series, with what’s likely the penultimate puzzle being a pure puzzle with no hints. We’ll have to go back and finish this another time.</p>

<p>So it’s a little bit ropey in some ways, but then, what escape room isn’t? This takes you to more fantastical locations than an in person escape room could possibly hope to, and there’s a bright future for this game with both DLC from Pine Studios and a second generation of the Room Editor – I’ve not experimented with this, but over 4,000 rooms were built in the first game, and the tools here are more extensive again.</p>

			<p>The current generation of Xbox and PlayStation consoles is now more than five years old, making it well past the time we would start hearing about what the next generation of consoles will look like. We've <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-magnus-bill-of-materials-may-push-its-price-well-beyond-1000/">seen several rumours</a> on what the next-generation Xbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">hardware will include</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">on top of comments</a> from <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-president-says-game-exclusives-are-antiquated/">Xbox president Sarah Bond</a>, a picture of Xbox's next console is starting to form. Now, a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more">Windows Central</a> seems to piece it together a bit more clearly, framing the next Microsoft console as a best of both worlds between the PC and console experience.</p>



<p>The report leans both on comments from Microsoft executives like Sarah Bond and Phil Spencer and sources who spoke to Windows Central, so understand that nothing about this is finalized, but it does paint a picture that makes sense as to what the next console from Microsoft will look like.</p>



<p>Both Phil Spencer and Sarah Bond have alluded to the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X handhelds</a> as a peek at Microsoft's thinking for its next generation of hardware, with the Xbox Play Anywhere becoming more of the focus with all Xbox games being playable on the Xbox PC app and Xbox consoles moving forward.</p>



<p>According to Windows Central's report, what those allusions mean is that the next-generation Xbox console will provide a console experience with its UI and the ability to natively play console games, though its foundation will be that of "<em>a curated Windows gaming PC</em>."</p>



<p>Basically, you'll be able to access your Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG, and Battle.net games just like you're able to on a PC, with the Xbox Full-Screen Experience that's currently live on the ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Ally handhelds acting as the home base for the device. On top of all those libraries, you'll also be able to access and play all the games currently playable on your Xbox Series X/S consoles, including original Xbox titles, Xbox 360 games, and your full catalogue of backwards compatible titles already available on Series X/S.</p>



<p>Another part of what'll make this device a 'best of both worlds' between console and PC is that the paywall for playing online multiplayer games will be removed for the next generation. Since the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 days, console players have had to pay for the ability to play multiplayer games online, whereas that has never been the case for PC players. That paywall will finally be removed with Microsoft's next console, according to this report, to further align itself with the PC gaming experience this new device is allegedly trying to provide.</p>



<p>Of course, this will also come with more changes to the structure of Microsoft's Game Pass service, though those details aren't clear, and likely won't be until we're much closer to the actual release of next-generation hardware.</p>



<p>It's an interesting proposal, to say the least, that we'll finally see a combination of PC perks like having access to multiple gaming libraries and not having to pay for online multiplayer on top of the ease-of-use that consoles provide. If Microsoft can execute on it all, that is.</p>

She also singled out the 45mm model because “it wears small,” and because its larger size means that its 35-percent bigger battery (compared to the 41mm edition) lets it last longer. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24239115/google-pixel-watch-3-review-smartwatch-wear-os-wearable">Read our review.</a></span></li><li><span>It’s not common for <strong>Nintendo’s Joy-Con controllers</strong> for the Switch to get any sort of meaningful discount, but you can get a set of neon pink and green ones at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fjoy-con-l-r-wireless-controllers-for-nintendo-switch-neon-pink-neon-green%2FJ7GSL57SJ7" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> for $64.99 (was $89.99). These can slide onto a Nintendo Switch, of course, but they’re compatible wirelessly with a Switch 2 console, as well. If you want to recharge them via your Switch 2, you’ll need an extra accessory for that, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F2N1GPK8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Fastsnail’s $19.99 product</a> that can simultaneously charge any combination of four Joy-Con or Joy-Con 2.</span></li><li><span>Workout gear can get expensive, but good sweat-ready wireless earbuds don’t need to cost you dearly. <strong>Anker’s Soundcore Sport X20</strong> are down to their lowest price yet at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-True-Wireless-Extendable-Cancelling-Waterproof/dp/B0CRT6HQ82/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, costing $55.99 (was $79.99, but the previous best was $64). These are built to be a ready-for-anything companion, with an IP68 rating that ensures that they’re waterproof, dustproof, and sweatproof. In terms of fit, these stand out compared to other similarly-priced options because of their rotatable and extendable ear hooks. Personally, I don’t trust earbuds to stay in my ears (my ear fin-equipped Pixel Buds Pro 2 struggle to stay put), but the hooks make them seem like a great, no-fuss option. Not only that, they offer active noise cancellation and 12 hours per charge (up to 48 hours if you refill them in the included charging case).</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/806949/ps5-ps-plus-premium-console-bundle-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/boost-sound-for-just-30-with-this-deal-on-the-anker-soundcore-2-speaker-2000639101</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The right speaker can bring life to any party, and even make those weekend solo sessions way more enjoyable. But you don’t have to spend big to get quality, room-filling sound paired with a solid battery life. If you’re in the market for a good Bluetooth speaker that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5022/">The Anker Soundcore 2 portable Bluetooth speaker is now down to just $28 on Amazon, after a massive 38% discount.</a> This deal only applies to the Black color, but some other options are discounted as well. Just note that the discount is a limited-time one, so we recommend acting fast to grab it. The retailer might be pushing the price back up sooner than you think!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5022/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Richer Sound, Both Indoor and Outdoor</h2>
<p>The build is truly portable and comes with a basic, no-fuss design. You’ll find all the controls at the top, so getting the party started is fairly simple. You’re getting dual 6W neodymium drivers that blast rich sound that captures all the highs and lows well. The BassUp technology offers more depth at all volume levels. You can crank it all the way up or keep it low-key for a self-care night. Either way, you’ll get clear sound without distortion.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity offers a stable 66-foot range, which translates into clearer sound even when you’re not super close to the speaker. Prefer keeping things wired? There’s a built-in AUX port for plugging your devices. The battery life is just as solid; you’re looking at about 24 hours of playtime on a single charge. For reference, that’s going roughly 500 songs without worrying about plugging it in. Everyone’s favorite playlists get a chance!</p>



<p>The speaker is also rated for IPX7 waterproof, so it can handle a few splashes and light rain easily. You can take it to the beach, hang by the pool, or even bring it into the bathroom for a private shower concert. It also supports wireless stereo pairing, meaning you can pair two of these for bigger, wider sound if you’re planning to host larger gatherings.</p>
<p>All things considered, this is a great speaker for anyone looking to boost sound on a budget. It’s compact and easy to carry, plus it offers superior sound. Anker has made it outdoor-friendly, so it can handle dust and water quite well. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5022/">It’s down to just $28 right now, and definitely worth grabbing while the deal’s still live.</a></p>

<p>A new report says a new Xbox Partner Preview is scheduled for November and will focus heavily on Xbox Play Anywhere games. </p>



<p>Xbox has been in the news recently due to fresh details about its next-gen consoles. The president has already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-president-confirms-series-x-s-successors-are-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the successors to the Series X/S consoles are in development, and a new report also says that games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-insomniacs-spider-man-will-be-playable-on-next-xbox-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War and Insomniac’s Spider-Man will be playable</a> on them. It has now been revealed that a partner preview event is scheduled for next month. </p>



<h2 id="h-november-s-partner-preview-event-will-focus-on-xbox-play-anywhere-games">November’s Partner Preview Event Will Focus on Xbox Play Anywhere Games</h2>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-has-a-partner-preview-event-slated-for-november-with-xbox-play-anywhere-as-the-headline-act" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WindowsCentral</a>, Jez Corden’s sources at Microsoft have revealed that a Partner Preview showcase is scheduled for November; the date hasn’t been confirmed. Moreover, third-party titles from Microsoft’s publishing partners are going to be a focus of this event, and “will feature almost entirely (if not actually entirely)&nbsp;Xbox Play Anywhere&nbsp;titles.” </p>



<p>The report also mentions other upcoming events where Xbox will have a presence. The first event is this month itself, with IGN hosting the ID@Xbox showcase on October 28, 2025. This event will also focus on Xbox Play Anywhere and should feature announcements for Game Pass, Cloud Gaming, PC, and console players. </p>



<p>Moreover, Xbox is expected to have some kind of presence at The Game Awards, scheduled for December 11, 2025. However, it is not known what Microsoft will feature at the event. And then, there’s the Developer_Direct event, which will be hosted in January 2026 and should feature some big announcements.</p>



<p>In other news, Xbox <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-will-not-mandate-the-use-of-ai-confirms-phil-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not mandate the use of AI</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-ranked-season-2-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-season-2-ranked%E2%80%94release-date-start-time-rewards.1335826/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A has sucked in trainers from across the world, and Season 2 of Ranked is now right around the corner with a fresh batch of rewards to claim.</p>



<p>The first Pokémon release on Nintendo Switch 2, albeit still available on the original console, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-first-week-sales-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached some impressive sales milestones</a>, and the four-player PvP offerings have sucked plenty in for the grind.</p>



<p>If you’re ready to dive back into Ranked in pursuit of the next batch of rewards in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Earn the right. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Season 2 of Ranked in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A begins on November 4, immediately following the conclusion of Season 1 Ranked.</strong></p>



<p>It may seem like it has come around swiftly, with it only being a few weeks since the release of Legends: Z-A, but it appears, at least initially, that Ranked seasons in the title will transition rather quickly.</p>



<p>Based on the information we have from Season 1, each season in Ranked will last for around four weeks. However, this may be extended later in the game’s lifespan, depending on what else Game Freak have cooking.</p>







<p><strong>Although not officially announced, we expect Season 2 of Ranked in <strong>Pokémon</strong></strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A to begin at 6 AM UTC on November 4—the same time that Season 1 began.</strong></p>



<p>The table below shows a breakdown of when you can expect Season 2 of Ranked in Legends: Z-A to begin in your time zone.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Season 2 Ranked Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – Nov. 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">1 AM – Nov. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">2 AM – Nov. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">6 AM – Nov. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4 PM – Nov. 4</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p><strong>The biggest reward available in Legends: Z-A’s Season 2 of Ranked is Delphoxite, which is required to unlock Mega Delphox in the game.</strong></p>



<p>Just like Greninjite in Season 1, Delphoxite is exclusively available in Ranked play during Season 2, meaning you’ll have to delve into online play against players around the world to unlock the reward.</p>



<p>It’s yet to be confirmed, but we expect the requirements to be the same as earning Greninjite in Season 1, meaning you’ll have to reach at least Rank K to obtain the item.</p>



<p>Other rewards include Rare Candies, EXP. Candies, and items will also be distributed as rewards for reaching the various levels of ranked, but full details will be shared upon release.</p>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Evil Empire [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/evil-empire">Evil Empire</a> has released its first update for <em><a title="Games > Brotato [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/brotato">Brotato</a></em> since <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/brotato-post-launch-development-moved-to-evil-empire">taking over</a> the game’s post-launch development. Titled “New Dawn,” the update is available now for <a title="Platforms > PC [24,646 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>, with consoles and mobile versions to follow in approximately one month. <span id="more-1002814"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via Evil Empire:</p><blockquote><p>The “New Dawn” update is the first new content update for <em>Brotato</em> since late 2024 and focuses on extensive quality of life changes—including an all-new ban system. Though, in true Evil Empire fashion, players will also find new items and a new weapon in there, too.</p><ul><li><strong>New Items</strong> – Leading the update are six new items which include Fresh Meat, Fruit Basket, Candy Bag, Ghost Outfit, Will-o’-Wisp and Hourglass—all of which provide various benefits to players skillsets and strengths while they take on wave after wave of gross little aliens.</li><li><strong>New Weapon</strong> – Also joining the fray is a new weapon fans can wield if they so choose, the Vorpal Sword, which alternates between thrusting and sweeping attacks and grants players the ability to one-shot an enemy for the first time.</li><li><strong>Ban System</strong> – Additional extras in today’s update includes the Ban system, a much-requested community feature that will allow players to ban up to eight items during a run. Win a run in Danger 3 or more to unlock the Ban system. Note: the Ban system does not include weapons.</li><li><strong>New Saves</strong> – The New Dawn update also introduces three new save slots which gives players the option to copy progress onto another profile (or reset the save). Unlocking every item, character, weapon and Danger level on a save will deactivate the earning of achievements, so use with caution as you will still have to earn them the hard way.</li><li><strong>Codex</strong> – The Codex introduces a new wiki-esque feature to the game, with information about Items, Weapons and Enemies (for example: How many times you killed a specific alien, etc.). Evil Empire plans to continue to build this feature out based on player feedback.</li></ul></blockquote><p>A longer and fully detailed list of updates can be found <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1942280/eventcomments/600792156684433940/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>Next month's PlayStation Plus games for November 2025 are expected to be revealed on October 29, but it looks like one of them may have leaked early. <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-on-connait-le-titre-phare-des-jeux-mensuels-de-novembre-2025-60690" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to Dealabs' billbil-kun</a>, PS Plus subscribers who missed out on grabbing Stray the last time it was available through the subscription service will have a new chance to do so from next week.</p><p>The Annapurna Interactive-published game was a day-one release for PS Plus Extra in July 2022, and it was removed from the PS Plus library one year later.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>You can turn any genre into a roguelike these days, and Ball x Pit is the latest exciting example. This fantasy block-breaker has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ballxpit.com/post/3m3v7hizftk2q">already sold 400,000 copies since its release on October 15</a>, which includes sales on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC, but not Switch 2. Nintendo's recently released console would get the game at a later date, but it turns out it wasn't that much later – the upgrade will be available tomorrow, October 28.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ballxpit.com/post/3m46m3rnkvs2x">According to the Ball x Pit social media accounts</a>, the Switch 2 version will have enhanced resolution and an improved frame rate. More specifically, it will run "1080p and 60 fps (or more) in handheld mode." Owners of the Switch 1 version can upgrade to the Switch 2 version as well, so there's no need to buy the game a second time. In fact, the announcement also asserts that the Switch 2 upgrade will be free for people who own the game on Switch, so it should be as simple as opening up the eShop to download the newer version.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/18pHUtXzF2w"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/18pHUtXzF2w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Inspired by classic block-breaking game Arkanoid, Ball x Pit has players bounce various powered balls against armies of block-shaped fantasy enemies. We greatly enjoyed it, with our editor-in-chief Matt Miller <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/ball-x-pit/breathtaking-brick-breaking">scoring it an 8.75</a> and saying, "It’s one of those surprise successes of a game that is easy to recommend to almost anyone for some simple fun, following in the footsteps of titles like Vampire Survivors to present a perfect zone-out and focus-in experience."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/27/ball-x-pit-breaks-out-a-free-switch-2-update-tomorrow-october-28]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-m4-macbook-pro-is-being-pushed-onto-the-sales-rack-go-grab-one-now-2000639133</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s new-product drops are huge events, and understandably so. The debut of a new Apple device like the M5 laptop sends thousands and perhaps millions of people to stores to be the first to have it. But the more economical reaction is to start watching the price of the device it’s replacing: in this case, the M4 line of laptops. Sure enough, those prices are coming down — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5023/">Amazon is now selling the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro for just $1,600</a>.</p>
<p>It’s not like the M4 MacBook Pro is some kind of dated or outmoded device — it debuted exactly one year ago, with all the bells, whistles, and accompanying hype we’re now seeing for the M5 models. And that hype has been totally justified — the average Amazon review of the M4 MacBook Pro is a stellar 4.8 out of 5 stars.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5023/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Thing of Beauty</h2>
<p>Apple products in general and MacBooks in particular have made their bones for years thanks in no small part to their exceptional design. Frankly, they’re just really good-looking machines. That of course would wear off quickly if they didn’t have anything going for them under the hood, but that’s never been the case with the MacBooks.</p>
<p>The display is where the true beauty lies with the M4 MacBook Pro, because it’s a 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR screen with up to 1600 nits of peak brightness that is simply stunning. Creative work like photo and video editing will never look better, nor will your streaming or video calls. There’s also never any worry about lag or glitching out, because the M4 chip and its integrated graphics driver are designed to deliver peak visuals.</p>



<h2>(Almost) the Latest</h2>
<p>Everything else in and about the M4 MacBook Pro is either Apple’s very latest tech and features, or close enough to it to still be about the best laptops on the market. First and foremost is Apple Intelligence, the advanced artificial intelligence assistant that is the perfect combination of power, speed, and security — not even Apple can see your searches or search history. When you start exploring Apple Intelligence, you won’t want to stop, and with the M4 MacBook Pro’s battery life extending almost 24 hours on a single charge, you won’t have to.</p>
<p>There’s no shame in your game if you’re a one-generation-ago shopper, especially when that previous-gen tech is only a year old and possessing nearly all of the features of its successor model. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5023/">That’s the deal that presents itself with the M4 MacBook Pro, because it’s worth every penny of its newly reduced $1,600 Amazon price.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Xbox players will be able to access PlayStation exclusives like God of War and Insomniac’s Spider-Man series on the next console, the latest reports state.</p>



<p>The next-gen era for Microsoft and Sony is on the horizon, despite the fact that many developers continue to support last-gen consoles like the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and there looks to be a titanic shift in terms of exclusive titles.</p>



<p>Xbox has already manoeuvred away from first-party exclusives, bringing the likes of Starfield, Forza Horizon 5, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo to PlayStation</a>, while Sony has eased slightly, as indicated by the release of Helldivers 2 on Xbox earlier this year.</p>



<p>There are still some big exceptions, notably on PlayStation’s side with the likes of God of War, Insomniac’s Spider-Man, and Ghost of Tsushima, but that’s set to change in the new era.</p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-exclusives-coming-to-xbox-in-new-era">PlayStation Exclusives Coming to Xbox in New Era</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming to Xbox? Image via Sony</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows Central’s Jez Cordon</a>, Microsoft’s plans for the next era of Xbox will bring the console more in line with PC, including the addition of various storefronts onto the console. Here’s what he wrote on the matter:</p>



<p>“You will be able to run PlayStation’s PC titles like God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, and Spider-Man on the next Xbox, purchased via Steam or Epic Games. You will be able to play&nbsp;World of Warcraft&nbsp;on the next Xbox, via Battle.net. You’ll also be able to install practically any game that runs on Windows, giving you access to decades upon decades of content all on a single device.”</p>



<p>Some steps toward that goal have already been taken with the ROG Ally X, which includes support for the likes of Steam and Epic Games Store, and the next Xbox console will have similar support.</p>



<p>With the addition of Steam and Epic storefronts onto the console, the door will be opened for titles that were previously PlayStation console exclusives, like God of War and Spider-Man, onto the Xbox platform—even though it won’t be a direct release and will lack established Xbox features, like Gamerscore and Achievements, for example.</p>



<p>The blurring of the waters in regards to exclusives has been difficult for players to get their head around, with the term exclusive now being looser than ever, but, in general, it’s good news for consumers.</p>

            <p>All this news about a new, next-gen PlayStation handheld just won't go away will it? We first started hearing reports about all this about a year ago, when Sony reportedly began prepping <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-prepping-playstation-5-portable-plans-to-battle-nintendos-handheld-dominance">a PlayStation 5 portable</a>, amid rumours that the company planned to battle Nintendo's handheld dominance.</p>
<p>Then, back in June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-the-first-plausible-sony-handheld-specs-leaks-emerge-but-how-capable-can-it-be">plausible technical specifications for Sony's next-gen handheld came to light</a> via KeplerL2, kicking off some serious chatter about how realistic an idea a new PS handheld would be.</p>
<p>Then, in a recent firmware update, Sony added a new Power Saver mode to the PS5 - the latest actual contribution to Sony's long-term eco-friendly initiative that we've seen evidence of in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-new-ps5-model-uses-less-power-during-games">various PS5 models</a> to date, with each iteration <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-adding-way-to-save-power-when-charging-controllers-but-only-for-latest-ps5-model">adding new ways</a> to conserve power.

<p>But this Power Saving mode is a bit different: it's something supported across the whole PS5 family, and targets specific games - such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, Demon's Souls and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> Remastered - to reduce the power draw the console demands whilst playing. Social media was abuzz last week that this Power Saving mode was a suggestion that Sony is demoing something for the PS6, or related next-gen handheld, but a new video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTcgIGLXpQg">Digital Foundry</a> pours water on that idea.</p><p>"This eco-friendly mode is part of Sony's drive to reduce greenhouse emissions first and foremost, and involves each developer custom-tuning each game to run at a lower power profile - often chopping power usage by 50% as a result," says DF. "However, curiously, this mode's throttled CPU, GPU and memory bandwidth puts PS5 in a similar state - spec-wise - to some aspects of the rumoured upcoming PlayStation handheld."</p>
<p>Per the friends of Eurogamer at DF, the Power Saver profile does, indeed, reduce energy draw by as much as 50% or more for some games, the team outlines that the resultant ~100W being used by the machine is still far too high for any handheld running on suspected specs (below). In order to actually get within a tolerable range for handheld power draw, the machine would actually need to be somewhere around the 15W range to work with the majority of handheld batteries. That's still pretty impressive, though: Days Gone Remastered manages to run at a fraction of the power it was running at before - both in performance and quality profiles - and achieves that with not too much impact to the final experience. Demon's Souls, notably, has to be reduced from 60fps to 30fps.</p>
<p>What does that mean, in simple terms? That any potential portable device or power profile would require something else entirely - that this Power Saver profile is not enough, in and of itself, to make PS5 games suitable for handheld play. This profile, Rich Leadbetter of DF suggests, is a means by which developers "can get to grips with the key limitations of what this handheld will require". Maybe this is a staging ground for the rumoured tech, but, at this moment, nothing more.</p>
<p>Last week, when approached about the idea that Sony may be working on a theorised handheld device, former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida noted that the idea of such a device <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-ps6-sony-cannot-do-the-same-thing-they-have-been-doing-says-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida">"may be very attractive to all these people who have libraries of games on PS4 and PS5"</a>. Indeed. </p>

<p>But it's not just handhelds in Sony's future, it would seem. There's been a fair amount of chatter about the future of PlayStation lately, with PS5 system architect Mark Cerny and AMD senior vice president Jack Huynh presenting a video (above) on new technology, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-2025-new-playstation-6-tech-all-but-confirmed-by-sony-and-amd">all but confirming what we can expect from the PlayStation 6</a>.</p>
<p>In the same interview referenced above, Shuhei Yoshida also noted that Sony cannot simply "do the same thing [it has] been doing "to find success with the new hardware.</p>
<p>PlayStation and Sony have yet to share anything official about either the PS6 or a next-gen handheld device.</p>
