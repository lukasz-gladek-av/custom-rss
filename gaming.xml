                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornoby</a> has enjoyed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review-in-the-zone/1900-6418320/">generally positive overall reception</a>, despite launching with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-fix-is-coming-for-stalker-2s-weird-xbox-controller-issue/1100-6527998/">a few issues</a>. But Stalker 2 released to near-unanimous praise from players in Ukraine, the country in which the game is set and the homeland of its developers. In fact, Ukrainian players were so eager to get their hands on GSC Game World's latest entry in the Stalker series that the game's launch quite literally broke the internet.</p><p dir="ltr">Ukrainian players flocked to the game as soon as it launched, resulting in nationwide internet outages in the hours after its release, GSC creative director and executive producer Mariia Grygorovych said in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delaying-stalker-2-again-not-an-option-studio-says-team-worked-until-it-was-broken-by-marathon-development" rel="nofollow ">a recent interview</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a bad thing because the Internet is important, but at the same time it's like, 'Whoa!'" Grygorovych said of Ukrainian players' enthusiasm for the game. "It touched everyone in the country."</p><p dir="ltr">Grygorovych and the rest of the development team at GSC dealt with some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-another-stalker-2-delay-was-never-an-option-for-its-ukrainian-developer/1100-6528237/">truly harrowing experiences</a> during the creation of Stalker 2, including a fire at GSC's studio caused by Russian shelling, and <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1607427168207880193" rel="nofollow ">the death of colleague Volodymyr Yezhov</a>, who lost his life fighting Russian forces. Russia's invasion of Ukraine added an enormous amount of strain on the studio and its developers, some of whom ultimately made the difficult choice to leave their home country to continue working on the game in safety. Currently, GSC Game World's staff is split between two locations: an office in Prague, and one in Kiev.</p><p dir="ltr">The complicated (and often heartbreaking) story of Stalker 2's development is detailed in a documentary created by its developers. Entitled <a href="https://youtu.be/28CITqxwNz0?si=RE4PKuM3PZwi8kjd" rel="nofollow ">War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a>, the film documents the immense hurdles GSC devs faced as they fought to finish the sequel to the iconic Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl. But Stalker 2 was a labor of love, and Grygorovych says the sacrifices were worth it.</p><p dir="ltr">"For us and our team, what's most important is [that] for some people in Ukraine, they feel a little bit happier [now] than they were before [Stalker 2's] release," Grygorovych said of the game's significance in Ukraine. "We did something for our home country, something good for them."</p>

		<p>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault has been revealed by Digital Sun, as a sequel to the 2018 game Moonlighter. In Moonlighter 2, players will once again step into Will’s shoes to explore, collect treasure, and run a shop to make some money. Will will be joined by companions to rebuild the village of Tresna, along with his shop, to make it a thriving place again. Will is also working towards getting back home too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZW8MwekNHk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“The original Moonlighter was a pivotal moment for us, marking the growth of Digital Sun as a team. Five years on, Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault showcases everything we’ve learned along the way. We’re channeling all our craftsmanship into creating a game that’s not just better, but brimming with even more charm in every detail”</em>, said Javier Gimenez, Digital Sun CEO.</p>
<p>Will will venture into vaults which become more dangerous the deeper he delves. He will have various gear and weapons available to him, that can be used to ward off enemies and secure treasures. The treasures he sells will fund the growth of Tresna as he supports other businesses. As they grow, Will will get access to more items.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/28/moonlighter-review/">Moonlighter Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Moonlighter review, Jason said, <em>“Moonlighter is an incredibly enjoyable jaunt through some interesting ideas and some fun fights. While the combat gets a little easy as you progress, the fun of watching money pour in as you play is immensely satisfying. It would be nice if there was more reason to play after completion as is normally the case with roguelites, but equally having an actual conclusion is a breath of fresh air for the genre. It is a lot of fun and one that will keep you entertained for a fair while if you want to sink your time into it.”</em></p>

<p>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault will be available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

			<p>Eternal Strands got an official announcement date today during the PC Gaming Show. Yellow Brick Games announced that this title will be launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491410/Eternal_Strands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a> on January 28, 2025. The game will also be available via Game Pass. During this announcement, the developer also revealed that the game will be in collaboration with Square Enix's Creative Studio III, which is the developer of Final Fantasy XIV Online and Final Fantasy XVI. They will be collaborating to design original content for the game after the launch. The first post-launch update has been confirmed to be free, and we will be adding a new Epic creature, as well as new weapons and armor for players to experiment with and utilize. These will be designed in collaboration with Creative Studio III's lead artist, Yusuke Mogi, who is the artist behind Final Fantasy XIV.</p>
<p>Along with this announcement, Yellow Brick Games released a trailer that shows what the aerial Epic will look like, and the collaboration will be used to push the boundaries of the existing combat system in Eternal Strands while having that reminiscent feeling of content created by Creative Studio III. This title is being developed on<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-struggles-rtx-4080/"> Unreal Engine 5</a>, which has the potential to have stunning graphics, but so far, games that have been released using this engine have suffered from a lot of optimization and stuttering issues, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Eternal Strands - Release Date Trailer | Yellow Brick Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhMT5IWrTlk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those who are hearing about this game for the first time, it's the debut title from Dragon Age veteran Mike Laidlaw at the new gaming studio Yellow Brick Games. Laidlaw was the Lead Director and Designer of Origins, Dragon Age 2, and Inquisition.</p>
<p>Also announced along with the release date of the game is the voice cast of the main characters that you'll see in Eternal Strands, which includes iconic voice actors such as Amelia Tyler, who will be the voice of the Surgeborn. The game is shaping up to have a lot of fun features, as you will be able to climb nearly everything in the game while exploring the vast world that experiences extreme weather with a dynamic day and night cycle. You'll also get to forge bonds with your Weaver Band, which are the companions that will support you on your expedition.</p>
<p>You'll also get to experiment with fun elemental systems, such as Frost, Flame, and Kinetic magic, which will allow you to burn or freeze your enemies while getting to use fun physics play to throw stuff at your enemies.</p>
<p>Make sure to check out the trailer for Eternal Strands above.</p>

            <p>I think It’s safe to say that Trigger Happy Interactive’s upcoming survival<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games"> horror</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-chaos">Total Chaos</a> is a bit of a palette change from their last offering - the frenetic, neon-drenched, chainsaw-legged <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/turbo-overkill">Turbo Overkill</a>. Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/condemned-criminal-origins">Condemned: Criminal Origins</a> has my attention.</p>
<p>Total Chaos started life as a popular <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/total-chaos/images/revolver-coming-to-the-directors-cut">Doom 2 mod</a>, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.</p>

<p>The survival horror comes into play in that you’ll have to scavenge your own makeshift weapons to deal with a selection of horrible things, including big spiders and dudes wearing skull masks - the telltale sign of only the baddest dudes. Maybe that’s their real faces, actually. I’m not up on the deep dude lore just yet. Here are some features, via the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2208350/Total_Chaos/">Steam page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Immersive Atmosphere: Explore the nightmarish ruins of Fort Oasis across nine harrowing chapters, each plunging you deeper into its oppressive, decaying world.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Environmental Storytelling: Uncover the island’s darkest secrets and confront your own fractured past through cryptic notes, haunting visuals, and unsettling encounters.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Crafting for Survival: Build and upgrade weapons using scavenged materials to stand a chance against the relentless terrors stalking you.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Face Nightmarish Foes: Engage in desperate battles against horrific creatures, each with their own deadly behaviors and strategies.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Resource Management: Navigate a deep inventory system where every item matters—your survival hinges on careful choices and quick thinking.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The Steam page also features the word ‘Terrormare’ which, ugh, I won’t hold it against them. Total Chaos is “Coming soon”. I’d say “not soon enough!” but I don’t know how soon they mean, so that’d be like, possibly a lie. I’m not sure. I’m not risking it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Project Breach introduces Amelia, the game's fourth major boss enemy, with a backstory quite unlike the others. Amelia joins the game's threesome of earlier monsters: the gory Mother Gooseberry, infantilized mafioso Franco Barbi, and would-be Stanford Prison Experiment all-star Sergeant Coyle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgB3XaGRjO0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WgB3XaGRjO0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Amelia was once a victim trapped in the same titular trials as player characters find themselves in, but she escaped. Now, she's back to have her revenge, though she doesn't seem too discerning about who she kills when she gets there.</p><p>The newest map is called Downtown and is highlighted by its central Trial, or main mission, called Pleasure The Prosecutor. Along with that main mission, which is designed to take a group of four roughly 45 minutes on normal difficulty, two new side missions will also be set in the Downtown map. For players looking for new gear, the game's sixth class/cooldown ability comes with Project Breach, too. It's called The Jammer, though the team at Red Barrels hasn't yet disclosed how this one works.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410061-theoutlasttrials_redbarrels_screenshot03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410061" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410061-theoutlasttrials_redbarrels_screenshot03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410061"></a><figcaption>Amelia isn't noticeably as unhinged as Mother Gooseberry, but her backstory paints a darker picture.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410061-theoutlasttrials_redbarrels_screenshot03.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410062-tot_projectbreach_custo_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410063-tot_projectbreach_downtown01_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410064-tot_projectbreach_winterkills_custo02_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410065-tot_projectbreach.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410062,1300-4410063,1300-4410064,1300-4410065" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4410062-tot_projectbreach_custo_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4410063-tot_projectbreach_downtown01_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4410064-tot_projectbreach_winterkills_custo02_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4410065-tot_projectbreach.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410062-tot_projectbreach_custo_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410063-tot_projectbreach_downtown01_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410064-tot_projectbreach_winterkills_custo02_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410065-tot_projectbreach.jpg"></figure><p>Alongside Project Breach, a new limited-time event kicks off on December 10, too. Winter Kills will give players a series of holiday challenges to complete and a host of new cosmetics to earn for their character and Sleep Room. You can even wear your very own Christmas jammies while running for your life down bloodied, tetanus-friendly halls. Even in the Murkoff Facility, it's the most wonderful time of the year, I suppose.</p><p>All of this begins on December 10 on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation platforms.</p>

            <p>If you fancy a spot of 'try before you buy' dungeon building shenanigans, the team behind 2021's animal-splicing tycoon game Let's Build a Zoo has you covered.</p>
<p>During this evening's PC Gaming Show, developer Springloaded announced a demo for its upcoming "multi-layered" management sim Let's Build a Dungeon. Want to know more? Well, I am so glad you asked.</p>
<p>Those who give Let's Build a Dungeon a play will take on the role of both a game designer and company CEO, with the challenge to "develop the greatest MMORPG the world has ever seen". This will mean getting to terms with hiring and firing staff, dealing with investors, and then - of course - designing some all important dungeons.</p>

<p>"The new demo for Let’s Build a Dungeon provides a taste of what to expect from the full release, with player choice being at the forefront of the gameplay," the developer explained. "Players are tasked with building a fantasy world filled with quests to share with virtual beta testers, with branching paths and multiple quest options to choose from.</p>
<p>"The demo also marks a historic moment for your in-game studio, inspired by the iconic real-life events from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ultima-online">Ultima Online</a>'s development involving Lord British's assassination."</p>
<p>The Let's Build a Dungeon demo is available via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2365790/Lets_Build_a_Dungeon/">Steam</a> now, and can be played in either English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Korean, Thai and Brazilian Portuguese.</p>

		<p>Following on from its appearance at the PC Gaming Show, 11 Bit Studios has confirmed that a demo for its survival game The Alters is now available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Back in October, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/04/the-alters-has-been-delayed-to-q1-2025/">The Alters was delayed to Q1 2025</a>, and at the moment it seems the game is on track to meet that release window. To mark the demo release a new trailer has been released for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Alters - PC Gaming Show Most Wanted 2025 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IiDOlqALAN4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

</ul>
<p>In The Alters you are Jan, a space builder stranded on a distant alien planet who simply wants to try and survive and find a way home on his weird ring ship filled with habitable shipping container type things. To do this, he has to create ‘Alters’, essentially clones, of himself. They’re not quite clones as is each able to have distinct character skills and traits. They also have their own personalities. It’s from this that elements of psychological horror and an underlying mystery unfold. This is brought to the player through binary decisions, bringing up the fundamental question “what if?” as you head down deeper and darker paths. Even though biologically, they are all the same, each Alter has their own wants and needs, as well as motivations. Fail to meet their wants and needs, and they will turn on each other making the survival situation more desperate.</p>

<p>11 Bit Studios are experienced in the survival genre, having developed both Frostpunk and Frostpunk 2, as well as This War of Mine.</p>

			<p>At the PC Gaming Show Most Wanted 2025, 11 bit studios announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-is-a-mysterious-new-sci-fi-game-from-11-bit-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Alters</a> will be released sometime in 2025 for PCs and consoles, launching on Game Pass from day one. Meanwhile, the developers have also just released a free demo that lets gamers check out the intriguing sci-fi survival game right now.</p>
<p>While the basic premise of crash-landing on a hostile world is not at all new, the rest of it is. In The Alters, as suggested by the title, protagonist Jan manufactures alternate versions of himself that originate from decisions he made in the past. These Alters help him repair the mobile base towards the ultimate goal of getting the hell out of that blasted planet, but dealing with them isn't always easy, as they have their own personalities and needs.</p>
<p>In an interview with Wccftech from last May, Lead Designer Rafał Włosek <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-qa-creating-a-game-about-the-roads-not-taken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> the inspiration for The Alters:</p>
<p><em>There was a lot of brainstorming in general, but we always had this idea about creating a game about how our lives could go if we made different decisions. This was slowly getting more and more concrete when we were talking about it and finally figured out that we wanted to have a game where the player could actually experience meeting a different version of himself who&nbsp;made this different decision.</em></p>
<p><em>Then we thought it would work great in a sci-fi environment, where you could use many different sci-fi technologies to achieve&nbsp;effects that are not so easily achieved in real life, for example. And then, well, there was also this idea about making copies of your own self and interacting with them.</em></p>

<p>Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got to play it</a> and became a lot more interested in the game following the hands-on session.</p>
<p><em>All in all, I'm interested. I started my time at 11 Bit studios with nothing. No knowledge, hype, or excitement for The Alters. I left with a game that I am looking forward to and fully intend to play, either reviewing it or purchasing it upon release. If that isn't a sign of something, nothing is.</em></p>

			<p>The French studio Hawkswell has announced the Celtic-inspired CRPG Legends of Awen: Rise of the Fianna during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/five-games-you-should-check-out-from-the-pc-gaming-show-2020/">PC Gaming Show</a>. This title is their first title, and was revealed using a presentation trailer that mixed in some pre0alpha in-engine footage alongside some in-game sequences to show audiences what they can expect from the game. To be able to develop this game and finish it off, the studio is seeking support from players via a crowdfunding campaign that will take place in Q1 2025, which will lead to an expansion of the content already in Legends of Awen: Rise of the Fianna. The plan is to use the funding to be able to expand on the planned number of player choices made in the game, and the impact that their choices will have on the player and other characters in the game.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSrI3-p1CCg</p>
<p>In Legends of Awen: Rise of the Fianna, you play as Finn, an orphan child who has otherworldly powers. They are the newest recruit for Fianna, and Finn will work their way up to rise and become their leader. This game takes place in the kingdom of Tara, which deals with internal struggles as well as an ancient dark force that lies beneath their land. Players will have to take control of their Fianna warband and lead them through tactical battles while also managing relationships with five unique Companions while working to unlock the power of legendary weapons that are tied to ancient heroes.</p>
<p>In this game, players will be able to choose to participate in turn-based combat. Alternatively, if you prefer to be a pacifist, you can try and use negotiation, charm or intimidation to get through otherwise difficult battles. As with many CRPGs, Legends of Awen: Rise of the Fianna will have a lot of replayability, which will allow the player to choose to do multiple playthroughs to make different choices and get new endings.</p>
<p>If this game sounds like something you're interested in, you are able to add Legends of Awen: Rise of the Fianna to your <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2718100/Legends_of_Awen_Rise_of_The_Fianna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam wishlist</a> now, where you'll be able to see some more in-depth details about the upcoming Celtic-inspired CRPG and what is in store for you if you decide to play it.</p>

<p>Due to hit PC and consoles in 2025,&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter 2&nbsp;</em>will adopt a new 3D art style, but it'll once again see protagonist Will delving into dangerous dungeons to gather loot that he can then sell in his shop, just like in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/moonlighter" rel="nofollow">the first game</a>.</p>

<p>Stranded in "a mysterious dimension in the village of Tresna", Will spots an opportunity to return home via a "curious relic collector", and he seizes that opportunity while also aiming to restore his village (and his shop) to its former glory.</p>

<p>Once you've returned from a dungeon, you can then sell the stuff you've gathered to villagers, and you'll have to make sure you're pricing it right or else you risk either being ripped off or ripping off your customers.</p>

<p>As you make money from your haggling, you'll be able to afford upgrades for both the town and yourself, helping you to explore dungeons more efficiently and turn around more loot. It's all connected!</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em>, which shows off the game's new art style and some of its gameplay mechanics, right here.</p>




<p>As well as all of the aforementioned features,&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter 2&nbsp;</em>will also boast a soundtrack composed by&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>'s Chris Larkin, so you can listen to that to tide you over during the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed" rel="nofollow">eternal and painful wait for&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S sometime next year.

If you missed the show live — which also included some news updates, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313965/pubg-brendan-playerunknown-greene-new-games-krafton">like PlayerUnknown’s ambitious plans for the future</a> — here’s a curated list of some of the best stuff that was on display.</p><p><h3><em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em></h3></p><p>The original <em>Moonlighter</em> mixed action RPG gameplay with the mundanity of running a shop, and the sequel looks like much of the same: only this time, players are transported to another dimension they need to escape. <em>The Endless Vault</em> launches in 2025 on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.</p><p><h3><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em></h3></p><p>One of the biggest surprises was<em> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em>, from indie studio Strange Scaffold. It’s billed as a turn-based take on the turtles, which is billed as an experience designed in part for “quick-play sessions that feel meaningful.” It takes place in a timeline without icons Shredder and Splinter. Given the studio’s history — see <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3011440%2FCLICKOLDING%2F"><em>Clickolding</em></a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1246250%2FAn_Airport_for_Aliens_Currently_Run_by_Dogs%2F%3Fcurator_clanid%3D41064705"><em>An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs</em></a> — it will hopefully also be weird in a good way. <em>Tactical Takedown </em>launches on PC in 2025.</p><p><h3><em>Cairn</em></h3></p><div><p>This rock-climbing adventure / survival game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171651/day-of-the-devs-showcase-summer-game-fest-2024-best">has been looking good for a while now</a>, and you can finally check it out for yourself: <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1588550%2FCairn%2F"><em>Cairn</em> just got a free demo on Steam</a>.</p></div><p><h3><em>Sol Mates</em></h3></p><p>There can never be enough co-op games. This release from Daruma Games supports local and online co-op for up to four players, who are tasked with surviving in the great expanse of space by doing “odd jobs through the galaxy.” It’s also pretty darn cute. <em>Sol Mates</em> launches in early access next year.</p><p><h3><em>The Legend of Baboo</em></h3></p><p>Billed as a “heartfelt nod to Middle Eastern fables,” this game looks like a potentially great mix of adventure, action, and puzzle solving, with a great big fluffy dog to ride on. In fact, you play as both the boy and the dog, who form a bond over the course of the game. Let’s hope it has a happier ending than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/5/13837896/the-last-guardian-review-ps4"><em>The Last Guardian</em></a>. <em>The Legend of Baboo</em> is launching in 2025 on both PC and Xbox.</p><p><h3><em>Abyssus</em></h3></p><p>Thanks to this game, I’ve learned of a fictional genre called “brinepunk,” where tech is powered by sea brine. It sounds weird, but this co-op shooter does take place in the fascinating underwater ruins of a long-gone civilization. Developer DoubleMoose says <em>Abyssus</em> will go into alpha on December 6th, with a full release next year.</p><p><h3><em>MainFrames</em></h3></p><p>All you really need to know is that this is a platformer where you’re jumping across a desktop PC interface, rearranging icons to solve puzzles, and fighting bosses controlled by the OS. It launches on both PC and the Nintendo Switch on March 6th.</p><p><h3><em>Deepest Fear</em></h3></p><p>Developed by Variable State, the indie studio behind games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2016/9/22/13001942/virginia-game-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"><em>Virginia</em></a> and <em>Last Stop</em>, <em>Deepest Fear</em> is an immersive sci-fi horror title with distinct shades of <em>Alien</em> and <em>The Thing</em>. The developers say that it “combines Metroidvania level design in the context of a classic FPS immersive sim, where the game’s setting is a puzzle to unravel and where creativity and improvisation are your greatest assets.” There’s no release date yet, but <em>Deepest Fear</em> will (obviously) be launching on PC whenever it’s ready.</p><p><h3><em>Blue Prince</em></h3></p><p>It looks a bit like a more colorful take on <em>Myst</em>, and <em>Blue Prince</em> is described as a game that “combines compelling mystery, strategy, and puzzle elements to create an unpredictable journey through Mt. Holly, a peculiar manor with ever-changing rooms.” It doesn’t have a release date yet, but according to the new trailer, it’s due out next spring.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Horsemen of the Apocalypse are War, Famine, Death and Pestilence. The Drivers of the Apocalypse are Grappling Hooks, Vehicle Swapping, Boss Battles and Upgrades. You'll get to meet all four of the latter in the video game of the same name, a combat racer from Dinosaurs Are Better (citation needed) and their publishers Bonus Stage.

If you're not savvy to scripture, or you don't read comics inspired by scripture, that intro might have confused you. Let me frame it another way: this is a game about the convoy battles from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mad-max">Mad Max</a> movies but with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a>'s grappling line and wingsuit combo, which allows you to steal enemy roadsters in the event that yours starts to look a bit bullet-holed and explodey. (Dutiful aside: Just Cause developers Avalanche have, in fact made a Mad Max game, though it's relatively ground-based.) The upgrades appear to include a choice of flying drones: these you may grapple from, in the absence of any large overhanging rock formations.
</p>
<p>
"The game features a series of epic boss encounters, challenging you to make quick decisions and master your driving skills as you take on the toughest road warriors in the wasteland," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3260240/Drivers_of_the_Apocalypse/">the Steam page</a>. This makes it sound like a bossrush format, which I approve of. Mad Max-inspired games should be all crescendo. I don't want to death-race against a bunch of low-level mooks on barbed-wire tricycles. 
</p><p>
There's a plot, unbelievably. "You step into the shoes of Artemis, a junior mercenary working for Thunder Strike Force. Your mission? Stop deadly convoys, defeat powerful bosses, and survive." That's not much of a narrative arc, lads. Give Artemis a surname at least. 
</p>
<p>
Drivers of the Apocalypse is out... at some point. My snarking aside, I think it looks enjoyable. I'm only snarking for the sake of wordcount, really. I hope I can get properly aerial, take shortcuts over mountains and land on cars as they come careening around the bend. Silly wastelanders! That'll teach you to leave the sun roof down.

We are using our own proprietary Intellectual Camera System—designed to find the most cinematic angles for the action on screen without interrupting gameplay—as well as embracing bold camera choices, including the use of pre-set cameras in certain scenes. Many of these decisions are inspired by iconic moments from classic action films. Players may spot some homages to scenes from <em>John Wick Chapter 4</em> and <em>Old Boy</em> in today’s teaser.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Nekki:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>SPINE</em> is a single-player, story-rich action game where the player takes on the role of rebellious street artist Redline, accompanied by her sentient combat implant, Spine.

                <p>From the PC Gaming Show, the team behind the Twin Peaksy adventure game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/virginia/" data-ref-id="5000-457375">Virginia</a> and Annapurna's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/last-stop-2021/" data-ref-id="5000-504770">Last Stop</a> has revealed Deepest Fear, a first-person horror-action game that blends an intriguing list of influences.</p><p>Citing movies like The Thing, The Abyss, and The Fly, Deepest Fear hopes to capture some of the subversive body-horror and creature-feature elements of the 1980s horror scene while pairing it with gameplay influences that are similarly beloved. Variable State calls the game a metroidvania immersive sim, and looked back on games like Metroid Prime, System Shock 2, and Dead Space to piece together its world.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw5hRbtd7A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zsw5hRbtd7A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Set seven miles deep in the ocean, Deepest Fear casts players as Danni Carroll, a survivor aboard a facility called Neptune, where she must fend off inhuman enemies that emerge from the water. Unfortunately for players, Neptune is taking on water, leaving many opportunities for monsters to threaten her and others she encounters during her survival story. Using a "real-time fluid simulation," monsters can appear from any water source as it sloshes around the doomed facility, making enemy encounters unpredictable while inviting creative problem-solving in the vein of System Shock 2.</p><p>The project may sound like a far cry from what the team has made before--those being narrative-adventure games--but Variable State says the game is designed to keep intact the team's tradition of "confrontational storytelling." Besides, it's arguably not even the most surprising game the team has in the works. In 2025, Variable State is also self-publishing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/polaris/" data-ref-id="5000-631974">Polaris</a>, a co-op shooter with a cel-shaded style.</p><p>Deepest Fear will arrive first on PC, but the team suggested future platforms will be announced later.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/caves-of-qud-leaves-early-access-after-15-years-announced-at-pc-gaming-show/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As you can guess by the title, Caves of Qud isn't a new game in the slightest. In fact, the game has been available for people to play for about 15 years now, as it's been sat in Early Access since it was announced. This game is well-loved by those who enjoy a roguelike, and Freehold Games announced today during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-revealed-at-pc-gaming-show/">PC Gaming Show</a> that Caves of Qud has finally experienced a 1.0 launch and is now available for sale on Steam, Itch.io, and GOG.</p>
<p>Caves of Qud is a bit of an outlier in the roguelike category, making it a little bit difficult to put it into one box fully. The game is massive and generates a world full of challenging biomes, including ruins, settlements, and jungles set out to kill you. The game is advertised as a "Science fantasy roguelike epic" as well as a "Deep simulation," which is pretty accurate, as players have free reign in the game. This includes arguing with NPCs and getting into brawls with the most unlikely enemies.</p>
<p>With the release of the 1.0 update, Caves of Qud finally receives a tutorial, which explains the basics of the game to newcomers and to those who want to dip their toes back into the game but may have forgotten how it all works. That's not all, as there is a new final quest in the main questline that initiates the end of the game, along with new music, items, and 40 new achievements for those who enjoy achievement hunting and collecting absolutely everything in the game.</p>
<p>Alongside the 1.0 launch of the game comes the Dromade Deluxe Edition of the game, which includes an enhanced soundtrack and the Pets of Harvest Dawn DLC pack that can unlock some in-game pets right at the start of the game.</p>
<p>One unfortunate note that the development team at Freehold Games has made is that save files prior to 1.0 won't be compatible with the full version of the game. However, if players find that they want to continue with their old saves, they will be able to switch over to the legacy branch in the Betas menu <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>For those wanting to purchase the game, it will cost you $30, but there is currently a 15% discount until December 12. Although it's now fully launched, Freehold Games has said that they have planned more content to add to the game and will share details of that at a later date.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-thing-remastered-review-macready-to-rumble.1053228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/thing-remastered-review-macready-to-rumble<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I love checking out <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/nightdive-studios/news" rel="nofollow">Nightdive </a>titles, so I needed to do research on their next game, the then upcoming remaster of 2002's <em>The Thing</em>. The bare minimum I could do is watch the movie, so I finally girded my loins and dove headfirst into this film on a slow Saturday evening.</p>

<p>This was over a month ago now, and I'm still thinking about this damn movie. To hear that the film was received poorly on release seemed inconceivable. The narrative absolutely gripped me, and don't get me started on the cliffhanger ending. Needless to say, I was very excited to see how a sequel could be made out of<em> The Thing</em>.</p>

<p>The result is a pretty fun third-person shooter with ambitious gameplay design that it couldn't quite nail, likely due to the technological restrictions of the time. The story, on the other hand, well... With the movie fresh on my mind, the video game version of <em>The Thing</em> somewhat ruins the intrigue and mystery of the movie.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-thing-couch.jpg?itok=qhdZuEMI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-thing-couch.jpg?itok=ElDLQBCa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many iconic scenes happened here. Now it's a ghost town.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong><em>The Thing: Remastered </em></strong>is a<strong><em> </em></strong>Quality Port from Nightdive</h2>

<p>First thing first, though: What makes this worthy of being called <em>The Thing: Remastered?</em> It's safe to say Nightdive never fails to disappoint. This studio makes sure its remasters are accessible and configured to play on different control formats and consoles from the modern day, all the while keeping the game authentic, faithful, and altered only where it needs to be, well, altered.</p>

<p>We're met with a visually exceptional remaster, with greater visual clarity, support for higher frame rates, and much more. Shadows play a big part in <em>The Thing: Remastered</em>, and the lighting looks exceptional. Seeing a dark room brighten from the flamethrower scorching some enemy, it's pretty neat.</p>

<p>I can't say for certain if this is the case for all of Nightdive's remasters and ports, but I know they like to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/killing-time-resurrected-review-mansion-madness" rel="nofollow">remake assets by hand</a>. Since I didn't play <em>The Thing</em> back in the day, I can at least say textures, models, and everything else comprising its graphics looks authentic to the area but have a wonderfully polished look.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-thing-snow.jpg?itok=q5O1WxA1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-thing-snow.jpg?itok=p5xmBoZb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Follow the handrails, and you'll be fine. You still might freeze to death, because that <em>is</em> a thing in this game.</figcaption></figure><p>The end result is a <em>mostly</em> bulletproof port, with a few exceptions. It's very likely that these will be addressed by the time <em>The Thing: Remastered </em>is in players' hands, but I did encounter a few visual bugs that didn't impact the gameplay. My head, for example, disappeared when I got gooped by a Thing parasite.</p>

<p>Other than that, there were some issues with the d-pad that led to cycling to certain weapons when it shouldn't have. Speaking of control schemes, I used both mouse and keyboard, as well as an Xbox controller. Both work well, whatever you decide to use.</p>

<p>Aiming with a controller or mouse makes the reticle lock onto enemies, sort of like <em>GoldenEye 007, </em>so it's basically impossible to miss. I would, however, suggest the controller since it seemed like a more seamless experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-thing-squad.jpg?itok=RfNoFt3- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-thing-squad.jpg?itok=4jC65ZtF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It could be any one of ya!</figcaption></figure><h2>It's Among Us in <em>The Thing: Remastered</em></h2>

<p>From a gameplay perspective, <em>The Thing</em> is a squad-based third-person shooter. AI companions play a huge part in <em>The Thing: Remastered</em>. What is <em>The Thing</em> without mistrust and the constant fear of the parasite being "among us?"</p>

<p>Managing the stress and trust of your squad is an important component here. Equip them with weapons and their trust goes up, but that doesn't stop them from freaking out at the sign of gore and just going batshit insane. That can amplify the stakes of the whole situation.</p>

<p>Squaddies are as useful as they are annoying. They're great at blasting away aliens and can do it better than the player, really, but they're an awkward bunch. Other than having to deal with their stress, getting them to follow you is sometimes finicky.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-thing-commands.jpg?itok=Ze3T219z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-thing-commands.jpg?itok=tGq5VKpG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can give guns and ammo to squaddies, and give them rudimentary commands.</figcaption></figure><p>There are ways to deal with their stress, like giving them an adrenaline injection or having them move away from scenes of carnage, but it didn't feel all that necessary most of the time since it happens off and on so frequently. I have to commend the original developers for creating such a system, as it was surely ambitious back in the day. Nowadays, it's fun to engage with for a bit but perhaps outstays its welcome.</p>

<p>Squad members are also very disposable. <em>The Thing: Remastered</em> will transition to a new level and just have them inexplicably gone, like they didn't even matter. And that's true for the most part -- squad members have different roles, but the only ones that are important are engineers. They can repair control panels to open doors, which serve as a way to block progress.</p>

<p>Either way, most squad members can and will die. Heck, some might turn into a Thing and attack. As far as I could tell, when they inevitably turn, those are scripted events. Sometimes during combat, if squad members are attacked, they can turn earlier than their scripted time, which adds just a bit of tension. Ultimately, since allies are ditched so fast, it's hard to see the full potential of the fear/trust system</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-thing-flamethrower.jpg?itok=JggOaoJ4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-thing-flamethrower.jpg?itok=u73Leowi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When it doubt, bring out the flames.</figcaption></figure><p>A squad member turning isn't all that big of a deal, since <em>The Thing: Remastered</em> pumps you with ammo and weapons. Firing a bunch of bullets into one of the monsters will soften it up, then you set it on fire with a flame-based weapon and they're done for. It's a fun little encounter when bigger monsters show up, since who doesn't love using a flamethrower?</p>

<p>Add a few boss battles in there for variation, and there you have it. Exploring all the environments, managing your squad, and using that flamethrower make <em>The Thing: Remastered</em> entertaining. It's short enough that it doesn't outstay its welcome, and that's just about all you could ask for in a licensed game such as this. Now if only the story was up to snuff.</p>

<p>Oh boy, here we go: <em>The Thing: Remastered</em>'s narrative. Apparently, this game is a canonical sequel to the 1982 movie. It was around the halfway point of the story I made a mental note telling myself this is <em>not </em>canonical. This game absolutely ruins the mystery of <em>The Thing</em>. It resolves the movie's ending cliffhanger in the first hour, so that's already a bummer when it concluded in such a strong way.</p>

<p>The narrative morphs this unknowable cosmic horror into something much more tangible, resembling any other typical alien parasite from media. We're also led to see there are sprawling research stations in Antarctica experimenting on the Thing.</p>

<p>Were these institutions here all along, or did they crop up after the mishap at U.S. Outpost 31? I could be wrong, but I was led to believe the Norwegians uncovered the alien parasite, and from there it eliminated their research station and made its way to R.J. MacReady and the crew.</p>

Cutscenes are really brief, and barely give any exposition to help players along. I really don't think it's a matter of <em>The Thing</em> being an old game. It just comes across as <em>The Thing</em> fan fiction.</p>

<p>You're eventually fighting against other soldiers and it turns into some sort of generic action shooter, at least from a narrative perspective. It's just downright silly, yet I can't get too mad at it because the game's dialogue is so cheesy. You can tell from this dialogue that it really is a product of its time, and so I do feel some nostalgia and entertainment from that.</p>

<p>It's worth reiterating that Nightdive made another outstanding port. The improvements to visuals, controls, and overall feel are sure to satisfy those who played <em>The Thing</em> over two decades ago. If it's your first time, and you're a fan of <em>The Thing</em>, it's also going to be a fun experience, even if the story doesn't serve as a good follow-up to the 1982 movie. Shooting a Thing in the face, though? Now that's some good stuff.</p>

            <p>The demimimise of Mimimi means I'm now on the lookout for my next opportunity to crouch behind a hedge, distract a man with a stone or coin, and then choke him unconscious. (And in the game.) Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream looks like a worthy candidate. Announced last year, there's now a new trailer showing the isometric (isometrish?) narrative stealth in action.

<p>The story sounds a bit Plague Tale-like: Hanna has awoken after a long illness when her brother Herman promptly goes missing. Hanna sets off to find him, with two other playable protagonists, Alva and Sebastian, helping on the journey. That seems to be where the similarities end, mind. The camera is positioned on high, giving you a birds-eye view of your sneaking, for a start. 
</p>
<p>Eriksholm is also a fictional city, albeit inspired by Nordic-inspired cities of the 1900s. It looks like there's considerable unrest in the city, with the invention fo steam-driven machines, an authoritarian force hunting you for some reason, and something called the 'Heartpox' glimpsed in trailers. Maybe a bit of Dunwall-style worldbuilding, with yer Plague Tale family dynamics and Mimimi body-hiding? A canny mixture.
</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to us getting a chance to play this. Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream is aiming for release in 2025 via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2377280/Eriksholm_The_Stolen_Dream/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream-c90ad9">Epic</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Dogubomb’s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blue-prince">Blue Prince</a> boasts <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blue-prince-is-already-the-very-best-shapeshifting-videogame-house">my favourite shapeshifting house in a video game</a>, which admittedly isn’t setting a very high bar. Perhaps surprisingly, most video game houses do not shapeshift. Despite being made out of pure imagination and carbon emissions, they remain nostalgically shackled to the limitations of brick, mortar and Euclidean geometry. Blue Prince’s abode is different. It is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bounty-of-gaming-news-discovered-in-isolated-scottish-cabin">house made of house</a>. You’ll actually design the layout yourself every time you wander through it, picking from a selection of mismatched room types whenever you open a door.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Each room harbours secrets, and it’s your job to join those secrets up and discover the mysterious 46th room - which, strictly speaking, won’t fit into the floorplan. The only constraint placed upon the house’s werehousian tendencies is your character’s fatigue, which confines you to a certain number of steps each in-game day. You can bend that constraint, however, by means of various room properties and collectible objects. Sound fun? I bring good news, then - Blue Prince is now pegged to release in spring 2025. Here’s a trailer to celebrate.</p>

<p>And here are some piping hot press release bullet points, for people who couldn’t be bothered to click on my preview link, above.</p>
<blockquote><p>- Draft your journey - Every door can reveal new and exciting chambers that contain their own unique challenges and secrets, as well as offering or taking resources. But choose carefully, for each day the manor’s floor plan resets and the rooms one sees today may not be the same rooms one sees tomorrow.</p>
<p>- Every step counts - Progress each day is shaped by the rooms selected to draft and the tools found within them. Yet, tread wisely – when the floor plan resets at the end of the day, all but the permanent upgrades to the estate blueprint will be lost.</p>
<p>- History in the making - Investigate a past woven with the threads of blackmail, political intrigue, and the mysterious disappearance of a local children’s book author. The deeper one ventures, the more one realizes that the past is closer than it appears.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can find a Blue Prince demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/">Steam</a>. Got you in the mood to read about bizarre virtual domiciles?

While essential for keeping the base functional, crafting tools, and mining resources, their distinct personalities can spark tension. Despite their differences, they share a common goal: survive, escape, and rely only on themselves.</p><p>The game explores the timeless question: “What if I had chosen differently?” This core theme fuels a deeply personal and thought-provoking narrative as players navigate Jan’s struggle for survival.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
