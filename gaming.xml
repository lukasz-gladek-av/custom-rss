            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/lord-of-rings-trick-taking-game-previewed-at-gen-con-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in August, Gen Con 2024 came and went. The tabletop convention held many delights, including a chance to get the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-2024-player-handbook-will-be-sold-early-at-gen-con" rel="noopener" target="_blank">newest <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Player Handbook</a> early. In addition, it played host to several early previews, including <em>The Lord of the Rings Trick-Taking Game</em>.</p>

<p><em>The Lord of the Rings Trick-Taking Game</em> was previewed by game designer and Board Game Geek co-editor W Eric Martin in <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/165540/can-you-deal-with-the-challenges-of-middle-earth-i">an official post</a> on the website.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lord-of-the-rings-trick-taking-game-card-artwork.jpg?itok=SaPazB5w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lord-of-the-rings-trick-taking-game-card-artwork.jpg?itok=VLxMRTal 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>According to Martin, the game was designed by Bryan Bommueller. Bommueller is also the Creative Sourcing Manager for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-saddled-with-eu900-million-debt-by-embracer-group" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Asmodee Group</a> studio Office Dog. It's a co-op game for 2-4 players and broken up into 18 chapters. Those chapters are themed after story beats from <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em>.</p>
<p>In each chapter, you lay out the four starting characters and shuffle the deck, then place one card at random face up under the chapter card, then deal cards to each player. Each deck contains 37 cards broken up into four suits numbered 1-8 and one suit numbered 1-5. The four suits of 1-8 are Forest, Hill, Mountain, and Shadow. The 1-5 suit is the Ring.</p>
<p>From there, players claim a starting character. Each character has a unique challenge alongside set-up details. For example, whoever has Frodo must also have The One Ring card.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lord-of-the-rings-trick-taking-game-chapter-boxes.jpg?itok=Mk9pDJhU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lord-of-the-rings-trick-taking-game-chapter-boxes.jpg?itok=fdxrJVDS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Once this set up is handled, <em>The Lord of the Rings Trick-Taking Game</em> should be familiar. Frodo leads the first trick. Players must play a card in the same suit when possible. Highest card in the suit ends. Ring cards cannot be played until someone plays a ring off-suit in a trick. Once all players meet their goals, the next chapter begins.</p>
<p>A small twist comes in the implementation of The One Ring card. The owner can choose whether or not the card trumps or not.</p>
<p>Martin's preview of <em>The Lord of the Rings Trick-Taking Game</em> is from an outsider perspective. He admits he's not a Lord of the Rings fan but enjoyed his time with the game, experiencing the game's first five chapters and praising the stained glass card artwork by Elaine Ryan and Samuel Shimota.</p>
<p>At time of writing, there is no release date for <em>The Lord of the Rings Trick-Taking Game</em>.</p>

The union organization, consisting of over 160,000 members, also filed an unfair labor complaint against Formosa Interactive, one of the support studios that worked on the game.</p></div><p>SAG-AFTRA members are now no longer allowed to work on or promote <em>League of Legends</em>. If Riot Games employs SAG-AFTRA talent for its esports productions, the strike could potentially impact the 2024 Worlds tournament that is set to begin tomorrow. Additionally, promotion of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22763818/netflix-league-of-legends-arcane-review"><em>League of Legends</em>’ spinoff show <em>Arcane</em></a> might also be affected as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24236186/netflix-arcane-season-2-premiere-date-trailer">the show’s second season premieres in November</a>.</p><p><a href="https://formosagroup.com/interactive/">Formosa Interactive</a> is a support studio that offers assistance to other game developers in a range of disciplines, including art, production, sound design, voiceover, and more. According to SAG-AFTRA, the studio attempted to cancel one of its games after the strike began in July. When that was unsuccessful, SAG-AFTRA claims that Formosa then secretly transferred the game to what the union described as a shell company and subsequently put out casting calls exclusively for non-union talent. </p><p>In response, SAG-AFTRA has filed an unfair labor complaint with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against Formosa Interactive and added the studio’s highest profile game — <em>League of Legends</em> — to the union’s struck games list. </p><p>“To commit illegal unfair labor practices is beyond the pale and won’t be tolerated by SAG-AFTRA members,” said&nbsp;Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA’s national executive director and chief negotiator. “Formosa will be held accountable, starting with an immediate strike of <em>League of Legends</em>.”</p><p>The video game strike began on July 26th after SAG-AFTRA and a bargaining committee of video game publishers — of which Formosa Interactive is a member — failed to reach an agreement for a new interactive media contract. According to SAG-AFTRA, the bargaining committee refused to extend AI protections to voice and motion performers, while the publishers argued that the terms they offered were fair.</p><p><em>The Verge</em> has reached out to both Riot Games and Formosa Interactive for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The new set, which is set to arrive next month, contains a series of small Lego minifig characters, including R2-2D, Jabba the Hutt, and Bib Fortuna. But it’s the new “Slave Leia” minifig in the set that has sparked some odd discussion online. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Over the years we’ve received a few Lego versions of the Leia seen in 1983's <em>Star Wars: Return of The Jedi.</em> You know, the Leia that is wearing a small, revealing metal bikini and loincloth/skirt. This Leia is often referred to by fans as “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dancing-girl_costume&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dancing-girl_costume" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slave Leia”</a></span> and has become popular in the fan community. But it’s also an outfit that has led to a lot of debate among fans and critics. And when Disney bought <em>Star Wars</em> in 2012, we indeed saw a decrease in how often “Slave Leia” appeared in merchandise and media. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?M=sw0485&amp;name=Princess%20Leia%20-%20Slave%20Outfit&amp;category=%5BStar%20Wars%5D%5BStar%20Wars%20Episode%204/5/6%5D#T=S&amp;O={%22iconly%22:0}&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?M=sw0485&amp;name=Princess%20Leia%20-%20Slave%20Outfit&amp;category=%5BStar%20Wars%5D%5BStar%20Wars%20Episode%204/5/6%5D#T=S&amp;O={%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Since Disney bought <em>Star Wars</em>, only one new Lego set</a></span> has been released that includes a version of the metal bikini. And now a new version is finally here, but she’s showing less plastic skin.</p><p>On September 21, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/brickset/status/1837475806202769595?t=8VbUpB_z9MIJffzRxRQdcw&amp;s=19&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/brickset/status/1837475806202769595?t=8VbUpB_z9MIJffzRxRQdcw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Lego news and fansite <em>Brickset</em> tweeted out</a></span> two images comparing the 2013 Leia to the new 2024 Leia that will be included in the Barge set. The images showed that the new Leia is mostly the same, but now has a larger skirt that covers her entire upper legs. No more side thighs or oddly nude behind. </p><p>The reaction has been strange and hard to parse. There are people mocking or parodying folks being upset that they can’t “jerk it” to a plastic toy figure. There are also people jokingly blaming the nebulous concept of “woke” for the figure’s covered thighs. However, mixed in with these jokes and confused posts are folks who do seem <em>actually</em> upset about this new minifig. Some seem to suggest this is Disney trying to erase history. Others are shouting about censorship.  At least one Lego outlet described the new Legie figure as “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.brickfanatics.com/lego-star-wars-princess-leia-two-step-back/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.brickfanatics.com/lego-star-wars-princess-leia-two-step-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one step forward, two steps back</a></span>.”</p><p>How many of these are real and how many are people just “joking around” is hard to tell. In 2024, I can easily see some people being mad about a less sexy Lego minifig. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2022/01/22/tucker-carlson-widely-mocked-after-criticizing-less-sexy-mms/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2022/01/22/tucker-carlson-widely-mocked-after-criticizing-less-sexy-mms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">People got angry about the green M&amp;M not being sexy</a></span>. Every week it seems a group of online personalities yell about “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JimSterling/status/1838119106471424275&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JimSterling/status/1838119106471424275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DEI Chins</a></span>” on<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sweet-baby-inc-consulting-games-alan-wake-2-dei-1851312428&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sweet-baby-inc-consulting-games-alan-wake-2-dei-1851312428"> fictional women</a></span>. We have long crossed the Rubicon when it comes to what certain weirdos online will scream about that I genuinely can’t tell if a joke is a joke or a desperate soul angrily sharing his real, honest thoughts on Leia’s unexposed plastic ass. </p><p>Anyway, I think the new Leia looks fine. It was always weird that her skirt didn’t cover her rear, as it does in the film, and while the new skirt might not be accurate, it looks better than the old figure which <em>also </em>didn’t have a perfectly accurate loin cloth design either. I’m now going to stop writing about this and try to enjoy my life. Try to feel something again. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s apparently old enough for <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2024/0924_02.html">Nintendo to announce</a> that the Japanese versions of the consoles — the Nintendo Classic Mini Family Computer and the Nintendo Classic Mini Super Famicom — will no longer be eligible for repair once Nintendo Japan’s current stock of parts runs out.</p><p>That doesn’t mean that if you wake up tomorrow morning with a mini Famicom that won’t boot you’re out of luck. Nintendo Japan will continue to accept repairs but is warning users that it doesn’t have a definitive timeline for how long that will be the case. Nintendo Japan <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2023/0523.html">announced its plan to end repairs</a> of the 12-year-old Wii U in May of 2023 but didn’t actually run out of parts and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/4/24192163/nintendo-japan-will-no-longer-repair-the-wii-u">stop accepting units for repair</a> until July of 2024.</p><p>The timeline could be shorter for these consoles. Although the relatively unpopular Wii U sold even fewer units than the GameCube, Nintendo still managed to make and move over 13 million of them. However, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/13/15293270/nintendo-nes-classic-mini-discontinued">company limited the availability</a> of its Classic Edition consoles,  and although they frequently sold out, there were fewer of them manufactured, which could result in a much smaller stockpile of spare parts.</p><p>The Classic Edition consoles were miniature replicas of the NES and SNES that played a collection of retro games from each original system through software emulation. They opened the floodgates for other retro mini consoles, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20861085/sega-genesis-console-retro-mini-review-launch-games">superior Sega Genesis Mini</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221906/turbografx-16-mini-review-classics-games-consoles-price">TurboGrafx-16 Mini</a>.</p><p>Nintendo of America’s <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/products/detail/p/966">support pages</a> don’t say that it plans to discontinue repair services for the NES or SNES Classic Edition consoles, but we have reached out to Nintendo to confirm and will update this post if it does.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Maybe tons of it is funny to the millions of players outside of myself, but most of it misses the mark for me. Instead, I often find humor in the random conversations me and my friends have when we play games together, or the shenanigans we sometimes get up to. Recently though, there’s been an uptick in games taking a more tactful approach to comedy; rather than a shotgun spread of zingers and Whedonisms—which have their place but have unfortunately oversaturated the market—there are some games now dialing into particular niches and styles of humor that go underappreciated or unrepresented in games, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tactical-breach-wizards-impressions-strategy-steam-1851626007&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tactical-breach-wizards-impressions-strategy-steam-1851626007"><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></a></span><em> </em>or even AAA heavy-hitters like the <em>Like A Dragon </em>series. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-guide-walkthrough-1851633756&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-guide-walkthrough-1851633756"><em><strong>Thank Goodness You’re Here</strong></em></a></span><strong>, which is currently going for $16 on </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366980/Thank_Goodness_Youre_Here/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366980/Thank_Goodness_Youre_Here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Steam</strong></a></span><strong>, is one of those games, and thank goodness for it, because it’s utterly ridiculous in the best way possible.</strong></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196918" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why You'll Fall In Love With This Indie Horror Romance Mashup" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="196918,197260,197209" data-current="196918"><div><p>Why You'll Fall In Love With This Indie Horror Romance Mashup</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22475.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here </em>could be loosely defined as a platformer, but feels more like an adventure game whose central mechanic is slapping. Dubbed a “slapformer” by the developers, it places you in the shoes of the littlest guy imaginable, a salesman who’s sent to what appears to be a mild-mannered Northern English town called Barnsworth where all hell proceeds to break loose. The town greets your diminutive protagonist with open arms, proceeding to continually ask the world of you in order to solve its increasingly bizarre and surreal problems, which range from the mundane fixing of a deep fryer to the more unexpected corralling of a flock of gulls that serve a man with no underpants, and eventually taking you to a nightmare meat dimension. Yeah, you heard me right, and no, I can’t properly explain it all. </p><p><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here </em>knows exactly what it is, and never falters in that regard. It opens by testing your understanding of a phrase in the local dialect, which decides whether its subtitles and menu will be translated or not. When you pause, the game drops the game’s comic art style (like a funny newspaper comic, not cel-shaded) for a still of 1980s archival footage showing a small town’s brick-laden houses and street. It’s a game ostensibly about meat pies and all the absurdity and lewdness beneath the surface of the English idea of polite society, all the while bouncing you between delightful little comedy sketches all the way to its grand finale.<br></p><p>Here are just some highlights from my sleep-deprived hours-long run of the entirety of <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here:</em></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>In the game, you constantly cycle through the same few locations in Barnsworth, steadily unlocking more and more of the town on every successive loop. Since there’s only a single path forward, you have to complete the cycle in order to get back to any one place. One of those locations is the home of a character named Roy, and you enter his home via his fireplace, which you are brusquely shoved down by a crude <em>Oliver Twist</em>-like chimney sweep. Every time you spill into his living room, you bring a fresh wave of soot and ash that covers it. At first, he takes it in stride, but with every next encounter, he grows increasingly frustrated and even traumatized at having to clean up yet another mess. Your visits start whimsical enough, but eventually the dude just quietly cries to himself, helpless to the cycle of violence you continuously perpetuate.</li><li>Some of the transitions between two zones involve you jumping into a pipe and maneuvering it all snake-like, either underground or at times in the walls of apartment buildings. One of these skits involves a hilarious meeting between a pair of parents and their daughter’s new boyfriend, and it predictably goes sideways, but for the most inane reasons. My favorite, though, is the continual disruption of a decorative plate featuring Lady Di on someone’s cabinet as you root around in the pipework underneath it. </li><li>There’s a man with a food truck who you can disturb by leaping into his vehicle and then proceeding to spank him. He’ll repeatedly put up a sign lamenting the beating his “bum bum” receives, but he also keeps curiously opening up his shop.</li><li>I will never look at a cow the same way after the bit of <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here </em>that takes place on a farm. Never.</li></ul><p>I’ve got to admit, I got <em>a lot </em>out of slapping everything and everyone in <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here. </em>It is just a silly way to interact with the wacky world of Barnsworth, but feels appropriate given the townspeople’s lunacy. After all, this is a place where bottles of “White Shite” sit all over the place, and where there’s a lady who dry humps vegetation. Maybe they need some sense smacked into the whole lot of them.<br></p><p>Best of all, though, is that <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here </em>is remarkably quick-witted <em>and </em>over before it could possibly overstay its welcome. Great comedies know when to wrap things up, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-how-long-guide-1851616299&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-how-long-guide-1851616299"><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here </em>can be completed in a single sitting</a></span>. It took me about two to three hours, but if you just put your foot on the gas, you could maybe even wrap it up quicker. Take in the sights though, smell the flowers, and maybe even smack a few. There are numerous little gags tucked away behind simply interacting with elements in the world, like trash cans or piles of dirt, or revisiting locales you’ve already exhausted of meaningful objectives.<br></p><p>Look, it’s really simple, <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here </em>is the most particular game of the year, and it’s also the most hilarious. It respects your time and rewards that investment with some of the sharpest and most succinct comedy writing you’ll find in a game. It is so remarkably silly and crude without being disgusting or crass, which is a tough balancing act in games. I cannot possibly endorse it more, especially considering that it’s already affordable without a sale, and is now discounted even further. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s also, like any convention, an exhausting long weekend full of bad food, blisters, and booze.<br></p><p>This was my first year attending TwitchCon, here’s how it went.</p><h2 id="h5703"><a id=""></a><strong>TwitchCon 2024 Day One: Getting there</strong></h2><p>At 5 a.m. I’m in a car on the way to the airport for a flight that doesn’t leave until half past 8. I wait too long in line for a mediocre iced latte. I worry that someone is going to get angry about my trucker hat that reads “men made me what I am today: a bitch.” I get a few dirty looks as I tramp through JFK, but one Delta flight attendant openly laughs at it as I board, so I’m safe. I’ve no idea what the weekend has in store for me, and just a few minutes into my flight I realize that many of us here are going to TwitchCon. A Ubisoft person sits behind me next to a Twitch employee, they chat for a few minutes as they take their seats. I don’t have a window in my row and the internet isn’t working, so I fall asleep for a few fitful hours.<br></p><p>Soon enough, I’m boots on the ground in San Diego, and it’s clear from the airport outfits (Twitch-themed tees from older conventions, anime sweatshirts, plushies) that there are thousands of people here for the convention. Thankfully, the San Diego Convention Center and my hotel are right next to each other, and they’re both not far from the airport—before I know it I’m whizzing past SDCC, which is draped in the spring-time purples and pinks of TwitchCon 2024. Throngs of people mill about, wearing pastel lanyards and holding gimbals so they can stream while they walk.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="b43b0312232909c560cb3922c50ad585" data-recommend-id="image://b43b0312232909c560cb3922c50ad585" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A cloud inflatable floats over TwitchCon.

I check in, quickly change, and run over to the convention center to pick up my badge. The space is fairly empty, but there are dozens of staffers directing people to the proper counters. I’m in and out fast, which is good—I still need to be editing pieces from <em>Kotaku</em> staff back in New York.<br></p><p>That night, I attend a media happy hour, then go to an after party for a company called Blerp, which bills itself as “sound memes for streams.” The nightclub is full of streamers, many of whom seem unaware of typical party etiquette—there’s a lot of drink spilling and accidental hip checks. A guy wearing a baby sling with a Scooby Doo stuffed animal holding a mini solo cup strapped into it demands people try and sink a pong ball into the cup. A sticky-sweet-voiced Southern woman shouts above the music to tell me about her cooking streams. I don’t have it in me to stay there much longer, so I head back to the hotel, wash my face and pass out.<br></p><h2 id="h5704"><a id=""></a><strong>TwitchCon 2024 Day Two: Stream starting soon</strong></h2><p>I wake up with a start at around 4 in the morning—jet lag, my mortal enemy. I drift in and out of sleep for about three hours before giving up and getting ready for the day. I make the mistake of getting an iced latte from the retro-themed diner in the Hard Rock hotel—it’s bland and way too milky and now I’m cranky. My mood worsens as I walk across the train tracks to the convention center and see several people in army fatigues wearing rubber duck masks handing out squeaky ducks to everyone walking by. My entire trek to the convention entrance is then punctuated by shrill squeaks as an army of neurodivergent people squeeze the ever-loving shit out of the ducks. (For the rest of the weekend, the scream of rubber duckies haunts me.)<br></p><p>The convention center is massive, and though TwitchCon boasts a few tens of thousands of attendees, the show floor is sparse compared to PAX East or New York Comic Con, which are always incredibly crowded. It’s refreshing, actually, having a bit of personal space and a reprieve from body odor.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="d423ed6a7dac135f0f0ea604a32b6360" data-recommend-id="image://d423ed6a7dac135f0f0ea604a32b6360" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Peloton installation at TwitchCon.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unaware of the media lounge and its free (but bad) food, I buy a cheeseburger that tastes like the wood shavings I used to use to line my gerbil’s cage. I wash it down with my shit coffee and run to find the meeting rooms for my first interview: Rachel Delphin, chief marketing officer. We chat about inclusivity at Twitch, about their efforts to make the platform more welcoming for women, people of color, and queer folks with their new Unity Guilds, and how Twitch isn’t a platform for free speech.</p><p>Then, I chat with <em>Minecraft</em> streamer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/hannahxxrose&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/hannahxxrose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HannahxxRose</a></span>, whose face is plastered all over the convention. A few years back, she left college to pursue streaming full time, and now her entire family is here to support her. “[My growth as a streamer] just kind of happened over time and I’m so grateful that it did…I really wasn’t enjoying what I was doing in school. I was very unhappy,” she tells me, before excitedly talking about all the countries she’s visited thanks to her Twitch partnership. “I never had any dreams to travel and do things like that—I never thought I would.” Her agent, who can’t be more than 21 years old, hands me a few Differin acne patches. “She’s sponsored,” they chirp happily.<br></p><p>After that, I’m taken on a media tour of the convention, which starts with the Peloton installation. The exercise company has partnered with charity speedrunning organization Games Done Quick to raise money for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ablegamers.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ablegamers.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AbleGamers</a></span> through walking on their treadmills or pedaling their bikes. I duck out of the tour early to ensure I can catch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/hasanabi&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/hasanabi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hasan “Hasanabi” Piker</a></span>’s <em>DebateLords</em> live show in the Twitch Rivals arena, a first for the massively popular political streamer. Half an hour before it’s set to kick off, we’ve been warned that the space is filling up, so myself and a few other journalists rush down there to catch it. The mock debate stars several other high-profile streamers, some from his unofficial crew (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/willneff&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/willneff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Neff</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/austinshow&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/austinshow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Austin Show</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/carolinekwan&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/carolinekwan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caroline Kwan</a></span>) and others from his wider circle (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/bbnogames&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/bbnogames" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bbno$</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/cyr&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/cyr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyr</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/jasontheween&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/jasontheween" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jasontheween</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/nmplol&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/nmplol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nmplol</a></span>). It’s quite funny, if a little rough around the edges, and Piker flexes for the crowd several times to keep everyone plugged in—though Kwan steals the show by leaning into a “libbed out” girlboss character.<br></p><p>But I have to catch the TwitchCon Drag Showcase, so I run across the convention center to the absolute ass-other-end of the building, through the impressively large Artist’s Alley, and into the hall to catch the queens. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/twitchcon-2024-drag-queens-showcase-queer-inclusive-1851655276&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/twitchcon-2024-drag-queens-showcase-queer-inclusive-1851655276">You can read more about that experience here</a></span>.</p><p>After the showcase, I rush out into the street to speedwalk to my hotel and get changed for a Capcom happy hour at the Coin Op Arcade. As I’m waiting to cross the road between the convention center and the Gaslamp Quarter, someone pokes me on the shoulder. I tense up, half-expecting it to be a Very Angry Gamer ready to make good on all those threats I’ve been getting since March, but instead it’s a guy I went to elementary school with—on Long Island. “What the fuck are you doing here?” we ask in unison. His company has a booth at TwitchCon; it’s his first time at the show. We snap a picture and go our separate ways.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="cdf43d231e796f4a944b8f4c70c3256f" data-recommend-id="image://cdf43d231e796f4a944b8f4c70c3256f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3024" data-height="4032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Twitch streamer Cyr speaks while a mime hangs out behind him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Twitch streamer Cyr speaks while a mime hangs out behind him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Alyssa Mercante / Twitch</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cdf43d231e796f4a944b8f4c70c3256f" data-recommend-id="image://cdf43d231e796f4a944b8f4c70c3256f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3024" data-height="4032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Twitch streamer Cyr speaks while a mime hangs out behind him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I quick-change in my hotel room, throwing on a strappy red dress and motorcycle boots in an homage to Milla Jovovich’s outfit in <em>Resident Evil</em>, only to be immediately upstaged at the party by a Leon Kennedy cosplayer and a drag queen whose wildly teased hair is touching the bar’s ceiling. I play some arcade games (<em>The Addams Family</em> pinball, skeeball, <em>Time Crisis II</em>, and beer pong, of course), talk to a few content creators, then head back to the hotel, jet lag once again threatening my sanity.<br></p><p>When I get back to my room, I realize that I’ve left the balcony doors open. I can hear the San Diego Padres’ stadium from the moment I walk in. The crowd roars and moans and groans and cheers and it’s like I’m right there, even with the music floating up from the Hard Rock’s 207 Bar. It’s Ashlee Simpson. I wonder if she knows she plays at the Hard Rock Hotel.<br></p><p>The Padres win, and the crowd roars so loud I can feel it in my chest. Then, fireworks start exploding around the stadium—I Google it and see it’s Hispanic Heritage Night, and they’re doing a fireworks show set to music by J.Balvin and Bad Bunny. I watch it from the balcony, a grin stretching from ear-to-ear. After the smoke clears, I drift asleep to the dulcet tones of The Weather Channel meteorologists. Right before I lose consciousness, I hear a rubber duck squeak echo up from the street below.<br></p><h2 id="h5705"><a id=""></a><strong>TwitchCon 2024 Day Three: Mods!</strong></h2><p>Another 4 a.m. wake up, but this time I just stare at the ceiling until my body can get out of bed and down to the gym. A few Twitch employees are working out together, employing a deck of cards to determine what exercises they do when. I do a quick lift, shower, get ready and go out of my way to get a good cup of coffee: Achilles Coffee Roasters, you will always be famous. On the schedule today are six different interviews, and several shows I want to check out—I need a god damn good cup of coffee.<br></p><p>I chat with a few more execs about businessy stuff and bans. “You want streamers to feel comfortable and safe. There have been instances in the past where streamers or even viewers haven’t felt safe on the platform. And Twitch has heard that and built tools to kind of solve for that,” says Sakina Arishwala, the VP of community health, trust, and safety. I request some clarification regarding the platform’s tendency to let repeat, intentional offenders return to streaming.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="70fb57d1c13129e7dc9aea175ff36475" data-recommend-id="image://70fb57d1c13129e7dc9aea175ff36475" data-format="jpg" data-width="588" data-height="588" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Me on Hasan's stream for two seconds.

He gives me a bottle of his hot sauce (TSA took it), and we talk about his pivot from making content for a media company that didn’t value him to making it for himself (expect a story on that soon).</p><p>For a brief moment, it appears I’ve convinced Twitch PR to get me the coveted Hasan Piker interview, but he’s running behind and changes plans at the last minute. I manage to say hi while he’s on stream, however, and am immediately bombarded with texts from my friends saying they spotted me.<br></p><p>I head back to the hotel and change to grab a drink and a chat with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/denims&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/denims" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DenimsTV</a></span>, a top political streamer. As I’m leaving our drinks, I run smack into Will Neff again, who is wearing a massive, shoulder-padded, leopard print coat. “Try it on!” he urges me. It fits. </p><p>I stop by the TwitchCon block party, where attendees are playing big versions of party games like Jenga and cornhole, and we each get three free drinks. It’s too crowded for me though, so I duck out and meet my friend <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/wisalallen&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/wisalallen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Wallen</a></span>, streamer and comedian, for espresso martinis in a hotel bar. They can’t keep me awake though, and I head back to my hotel at a reasonable hour and pass out, yet again, to The Weather Channel. </p><h2 id="h5706"><a id=""></a><strong>TwitchCon 2024 Day Four: Chat, am I alive?</strong></h2><p>I awake with a start at, you guessed it, 4 a.m., my body doggedly refusing to adjust to West Coast time. I drift in and out of sleep for hours, then get ready to head back across the street for the last day. No flat iron today, my hair is more tired than I am. I get a larger latte from Achilles, this one boasts four shots of espresso in a cup that’s bigger than my head. The duck game people are back, handing out ducks as we cross the monorail tracks—I loudly protest, but several immediately begin squeaking the free rubber birds. It’s going to be a long day. I have a few minutes before my interviews, so I wander through Artist’s Alley, running into my elementary school classmate yet again. I buy some smutty <em>Mass Effect</em> stickers from an artist called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/malivethart/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/malivethart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maliveth</a></span>.<br></p><p>Then, two interviews: Pontus Eskilsson, the VP of global partnerships, who excitedly tells me about how many more scientists are streaming on Twitch. Like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/paleontologizing&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/paleontologizing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paleontologizing</a></span>, a paleontologist who uses the money he makes streaming to fund his dino digs.<br></p><p>During a brief break, I run to see the Trixie-Cosmetics-branded Power Up room, where attendees can freshen up and get some free makeup. A young girl, no more than nine, is there with her dad, getting some make-up tips from an official rep. I snap a picture in the photo booth and get a free blush palette, then run back to the meeting rooms to chat with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/deere&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/deere" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deere</a></span>, who tells me how she adopted Twitch streaming long before the pandemic, as a means to show off her artistry in different, more unique ways.</p><figure id="" data-id="59f7eb853bce4e3d7dcc5592ecdab661" data-recommend-id="image://59f7eb853bce4e3d7dcc5592ecdab661" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The TransLifeline board at TwitchCon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The TransLifeline board at TwitchCon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Alyssa Mercante / Twitch</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="59f7eb853bce4e3d7dcc5592ecdab661" data-recommend-id="image://59f7eb853bce4e3d7dcc5592ecdab661" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The TransLifeline board at TwitchCon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I get a last-minute offer to interview Caroline Kwan, who regularly streams award shows and other pop culture events with a political lean. She is, by far, the most engaging and fascinating interview of the weekend—we talk at length about the role of women in such a male-dominated space, the importance of connecting pop culture and politics, and, of course, our outfits. Expect a long piece about my chat with her soon.<br></p><p>After Kwan and I part ways, I run down the hall to meet with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/central_committee&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/central_committee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Central Committee</a></span> and Denims to chat for a piece I’m working on about the importance of political streamers in an election year. About 40 minutes into our chat, which we have outside in the designated smoking area, the familiar notes of Chappell Roan’s “Pink Pony Club” float up from the Kappa Cabana, where live bands have been playing on and off all weekend. Someone says that it’s actually Roan, and we speedwalk through Artist’s Alley and out to the cabana, just to discover we were duped. </p><p>“There’s only 30 minutes of con left,” someone utters, half-sad, half-relieved. Tired, a little dejected, and thoroughly over discussing chuds, we separate and head back to our respective hotel rooms. Walking back through the convention center, I hear a rubber duck squeal out, a final goodbye to me and the con, and am stricken with a bout of hysterical laughter.</p><p>We did it. TwitchCon 2024 is in the books. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">SAG-AFTRA is striking <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/league-of-legends/">League of Legends</a>, claiming that Formosa Inc.--the studio from which Riot Games sources its voiced content--is guilty of committing "a flagrant violation of labor law." The union has responded by filing an unfair labor practice charge against Formosa. The strike is especially unique because previously, League Of Legends was declared exempt from the strike, allowing its guild-associated voice and motion-capture performers to continue their work on the game.</p><p dir="ltr">So what did Formosa do to upset the guild this much? SAG-AFTRA's latest press release alleges that Formosa tried to cancel one of its struck games. (Currently, struck projects cannot proceed with voice acting or motion-capture work until the strike ends.) Formosa was allegedly told that canceling the game couldn't be done, and--according to SAG-AFTRA--got around this obstacle by quietly transferring the game to a shell company before proceeding to send out casting notices, which were specifically seeking non-union talent.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/sagaftra/status/1838646003840487906" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">SAG-AFTRA called a strike today against popular online game League of Legends, after a company that produces the game tried to subvert the video game strike. (1/2) <a href="https://t.co/jzdOICRyno" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/jzdOICRyno</a></p>  — SAG-AFTRA (@sagaftra) <a href="https://twitter.com/sagaftra/status/1838646003840487906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">"The unilateral and surreptitious transfer of union work to a 'non-union' shell company is an impermissible and appalling attempt to evade a strike action and destroy performers' rights under labor law," the guild said via a statement released on <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-strikes-league-legends" rel="nofollow ">its website</a>. "In light of Formosa's unfair labor practices, SAG-AFTRA's National Executive Director, with the advice and consent of the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee, has called a strike of League of Legends, one of the company's most high-profile games. SAG-AFTRA members must immediately cease providing covered services to League of Legends and the game will be updated on the union's search function as a struck game."</p><p dir="ltr">Members of the guild who work in the games industry--primarily voice actors and motion-capture performers--are currently striking over AI-related concerns, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/">named Formosa Interactive as one of 10 major gaming companies</a> it was negotiating with when the strike began in late July. Known as the collective bargaining group, other companies at the bargaining table include Activision Productions Inc., Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions, Insomniac Games Inc., Take 2 Productions, WB Games Inc., and more.</p><p dir="ltr">"League of Legends is a game of champions," SAG-AFTRA interactive media agreement negotiating committee chair Sarah Elmaleh said. "Instead of championing the union performers who bring their immense talent and experience to beloved characters, decision-makers at Formosa have chosen to try to evade and abandon them. Such double-dealing is very disappointing from a longtime committed union signatory. And such regrettable choices are unnecessary when our union committee and staff are as collaborative and excited to create protected work as our performers love to collaborate with game makers, and love this work."</p><p dir="ltr">At the time of writing, neither a spokesperson representing the collective bargaining group nor Riot Games/Formosa Inc. have responded or made any official statement regarding SAG-AFTRA's latest move, though GameSpot has reached out to Riot for comment. SAG-AFTRA, however, has followed up its official statement with <a href="https://x.com/sagaftra/status/1838656151933850093" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a tweet</a> that simply reads, "We're not LOLing about LoL."</p>

Purgatory isn't your typical Warzone experience, but it's a fun sandbox-style mode that feels like the perfect send-off for this final season of Modern Warfare 3. It's also a refreshingly chill mode that should stick around long-term.</p><p dir="ltr">Purgatory is played with 10 squads of four battling on Season 6's Hellspawn variant of Rebirth Island. The map's hellish makeover includes an eerie sky, blood-red water, zombified NPC creatures, and flesh-covered walls, providing enough atmospheric changes here to get you in the Halloween spirit.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - The Haunting Season 6 Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">At first glance, it's unclear what you're supposed to do with your time in Purgatory. This is a sandbox mode with custom loadouts and infinite respawns, so there's no real objective dictating how you play. This makes the mode great to play with friends while just chatting and completing challenges. Purgatory is perfect for finishing up your camo grind, completing daily or weekly challenges, or knocking out the seasonal Warzone Rewards objectives.</p><p dir="ltr">Purgatory also introduces some weird mechanics to Warzone that sound completely outlandish, but they all add to the unique character of the mode. There are mystical ball-shaped portals that you can use to teleport around the map, and giant killer balls called "Terriballs" that bounce around and you can shoot at enemies, causing the ball to smash into opponents and down them.</p><p dir="ltr">The Shipment multiplayer map floats as an island above Purgatory, and you can not only land on the island and fight opponents, but you can also drive the island. Yes, you literally pilot the Shipment map around the sky like a helicopter. This is as silly as it sounds, but it's a lot of fun to take control of the island and cruise around looking for fights. Plus, it's hilarious to see someone making Shipment do loop-de-loops in the sky.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4372044-purgatoryflyingshipment.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372044" data-ratio="0.56237218813906" data-width="2445" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4372044-purgatoryflyingshipment.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372044"></a><figcaption>Purgatory's flying Shipment</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4372044-purgatoryflyingshipment.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This mishmash of new mechanics makes for a lot of quirky fun , like the awkward moment when you realize both you and an enemy are chasing after the same Terriball. It becomes a panicked scramble to make sure you're not the one knocked out by the bouncing Terriball. Of course, some matches of Purgatory are still sweaty, with a lobby of players just hunting you down for kills, but others feature welcomed comradery as some players use the in-game chat feature to team up and help each other complete challenges. You can quietly and casually play much of a match without too much heat on you, but you also have the option to play more aggressively and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-warzone-purgatory-island-event-challenges-all-rewards-and-how-to-complete/2900-5788/">build up a high Torment level</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Torment level is shown below the minimap as a meter with five skulls, and the more kills you rack up, the higher the meter goes with a rating of 1-5 skulls. You earn more XP as your Torment level increases, but it also elevates the match difficulty. For example, reaching Torment Level 5 marks you on the map for all your opponents, and it sends an attack chopper to hunt you down. You can also lose your entire Torment level by dying or entering a safe zone, so this can be an intentional or unintentional loss of heat on the map. Again, just another welcomed mechanic that can shake things up and allow you to go for extra XP, but there's no pressure to do so.</p><p dir="ltr">The hardest part of Purgatory might just be convincing your friends to play a full match. One of my biggest gripes about the mode is Purgatory's two-hour match timer. This makes it longer than a Zombies or DMZ match, yet you don't have a way to exfil and bow out early. On the positive side, leaving early doesn't seem to tax you with any penalties. There's usually a warning for attempting to leave a standard Call of Duty match early, reminding you that you'll sacrifice the match XP if you exit early. I didn't get that warning when I needed to leave a match of Purgatory, which is nice because two hours is a lot of time to commit to one match of Call of Duty.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4372045-purgatoryterriballs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372045" data-ratio="0.562574970012" data-width="2501" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4372045-purgatoryterriballs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372045"></a><figcaption>Purgatory's Terriballs</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4372045-purgatoryterriballs.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The mode would feel more satisfying if you could exfil early or have an optional game-ending objective. If you stay the full time, the map just gets nuked and there are no winners declared or additional rewards offered. It just ends.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it's worth noting that players are reporting some games are ending with a nuke animation before the match timer ends. I've not experienced this in any of my matches, and there doesn't seem to be any hidden nuke challenge discovered.</p><p dir="ltr">Another minor complaint is that all of the contracts on the map are just the standard Warzone variety. It would've been nice to see something Halloween-themed or outside of the normal contracts added in like zombie-killing contracts or something of a spooky nature. Even a special bounty contract similar to the HVT contracts in Zombies mode, which require you to take out a special zombie type. It feels like a missed opportunity not to have Mangler, Mimics, and Disciple enemies from Zombies appear in Warzone. Even Zombies' giant Abomination enemy would be cool to see lurking around on Rebirth Island.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of the flaws, I've spent a great deal of time racking up XP in Purgatory since Season 6 launched, and it makes me think a sandbox mode would be great to stick around, or at the very least, exist as a recurring mode. Call of Duty features an abundance of events and challenges that aren't always easy to grind in Warzone, especially in the normal sweaty playlists with limited respawns, and this would serve as a great option for those who don't own the yearly Call of Duty releases. It doesn't even have to remain on the spooky Hellspawn variant of Rebirth Island--Warzone's larger Urzikstan map would also be great to host a larger sandbox-style experience and seasonal events.</p><p dir="ltr">The Haunting event runs until October 16, and I highly recommend this mode for anyone looking for a spooky, fun way to level up and finish up any challenges before Season 6 ends. And while there's no real winning in Purgatory, you do have several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-warzone-purgatory-island-event-challenges-all-rewards-and-how-to-complete/2900-5788/#1">Purgatory Island event themed rewards to earn</a> in the process, including some really sweet-looking animated weapon camos.</p><p>This is the final season of Modern Warfare 3 as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> arrives on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blasphemous-2">Blasphemous 2</a> - developer The Game Kitchen's acclaimed Souls-like action-platformer sequel - is delving further into the mythology of The Penitent One on 31st October, when its paid Mea Culpa expansion and an accompanying free update arrives for all platforms.
</p>
<p>
Mea Culpa tells the story of the eponymous lost sword, wielded by The Penitent One in The Game Kitchen's first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a> game. It promises two new zones featuring "harsh winds", "towering heights", and two new bosses. That's alongside four new quests - in which players piece together their sword - as well as new NPCs, prayers, rosary beads, Argent board figures, and an alternate ending. It also includes a "new (yet familiar) weapon and ability" - no prizes for guessing what'll be - plus new achievements.
</p>
<p>
Blasphemous 2's Mea Culpa expansion launches for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2879370/Blasphemous_2__Mea_Culpa/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/blasphemous_2_mea_culpa">GOG</a>, and the Epic Games Store) on 31st October. It'll cost £11.99/€11.99/$11.99 USD, but there's a 20 percent discount if you pick it up in its first two weeks of release.

<p>
Mea Culpa arrives alongside a big free Blasphemous 2 content update for all players that The Game Kitchen is calling True Torment. There's a lot going on here, starting with expanded versions of existing zones. Choir of Thorns, Sunken Cathedral, and Basilica of Ancient Faces have all been "reforged" with new challenges, and the developer is introducing new connecting zones for quicker traversal between key areas.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, True Torment adds a new Labyrinth of Tides challenge, new enemies, a New Game+ mode (including "totally adjustable difficulty options"), as well as new Penitent One upgrades, quality of life improvements, and achievements. So to recap: all that arrives for free on 31st October, alongside Blasphemous 2's paid Mea Culpa expansion.
</p>
<p>
And if you're wondering what else is on the horizon, The Game Kitchen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blasphemous-studio-unveils-goya-inspired-stealth-tactics-adventure-the-stone-of-madness">unveiled</a> its Goya-inspired stealth-tactics adventure The Stone of Madness back in August, and it's currently set to launch for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic early next year.

            <title><![CDATA[Treyarch Reveals Black Ops 6 Multiplayer Updates Following Beta Feedback]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-multiplayer-updates-beta-feedback/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/treyarch-reveals-black-ops-6-multiplayer-updates-following-beta-feedback.990576/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-multiplayer-updates-beta-feedback/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Activision and Treyarch were paying attention to everyone’s feedback during the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer beta, jotting down fixes for multiplayer maps, spawns, performance, weapons, movement, and more on the road to the game’s launch. Here’s an overview of everything they intend to improve upon for the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer following beta feedback!</p>



<p>In preparation for next month’s release, Treyarch’s <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-mp-road-to-launch#more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest blog post</a> unveils how they’re improving the core multiplayer experience for competitive players.</p>



<h3 id="h-maps">Maps</h3>



<p>You likely noticed that the multiplayer beta only featured a small handful of small-size maps, which made for chaotic matches. In the full launch, most of the maps will be slightly bigger—medium size—and include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Vault</li>



<li>Protocol</li>



<li>Lowtown</li>



<li>Red Card</li>



<li>Vorkuta</li>



<li>Subsonic</li>



<li>Payback</li>



<li>Warhead</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-spawns">Spawns</h3>



<p>After spending tens of hours playing the multiplayer beta apiece, one of our biggest complaints was the spawn mechanics. They were too chaotic, too close. According to Treyarch, a core reason for the beta was to delve into the spawn system and gather data, which helped. They found that spawn logic required improvements and implemented changes to make it better.</p>



<h3 id="h-game-performance">Game Performance</h3>



<p>The whole point of a beta is to uncover bugs and performance issues. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 featured a few, and Treyarch found and squashed them. These include script errors, user interface issues, asset streaming glitches, and “hitching,” all of which they fixed for launch day.</p>







<h3 id="h-weapons">Weapons</h3>



<p>Regarding the game’s weapons, which felt impactful on day one of the beta, Treyarch is fixing a few key areas:</p>



<ul>
<li>Headshot damage is significantly improving, with location multipliers playing a pivotal role in time to kill.</li>



<li>Bullet penetration will improve before release, reducing the damage bullets deal after passing through surfaces.</li>



<li>Improvements to sniper DS</li>



<li>Better fluidity when swapping weapons</li>



<li>Reduced weapon motion during crouch animations</li>



<li>Target adjustments to shotguns and SMGs.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-movement">Movement</h3>



<p>Activision and Treyarch touted the reimagined movement system as a highlight of Black Ops 6’s multiplayer gameplay, and while it felt fluid and frantic, it left something to be desired. Before launch, they intend to touch upon:</p>



<ul>
<li>Animation fluidity and fidelity</li>



<li>Adjustments to slide mechanics</li>



<li>Intelligent Movement updates</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-other-notable-changes-to-black-ops-6-multiplayer">Other Notable Changes to Black Ops 6 Multiplayer</h3>



<p>While those key areas will see significant updates before launch day, that’s not the only way Treyarch intends to improve the core experience!</p>



<ul>
<li>Shortened time in the Winner’s Circle</li>



<li>Kill Counter added to the HUD</li>



<li>Reducing camera motion while sprinting and sliding</li>



<li>Improvements to the Kill Order game mode</li>



<li>Equipment and Perk tweaks</li>
</ul>

But while you’ve typically had to buy specific keyboards (or <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D9edtQJaISko">set up null binds</a>) to get this functionality, Razer has <a href="https://press.razer.com/product-news/snap-tap-available-on-razer-blade-more-keyboards/">just brought it</a> to <em>years</em> of keyboards and laptops as well.</p><p>Every Razer keyboard and Blade laptop that works with the company’s Synapse 4 desktop software — <a href="https://mysupport.razer.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/6120/~/razer-synapse-4-supported-devices?_ga=2.55002408.2006252788.1727199777-367611044.1727199777">here’s the full list</a>, including laptops that go back to 2018 — can now update Synapse and toggle on Razer’s Snap Tap feature. (Other manufacturers call it “Snappy Tappy” or “Speed Tap,” and Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions, or SOCD, is the generic term.)</p><p>Razer notes that Snap Tap may not be as effective with <em>just any</em> Razer laptop or desktop keyboard. It’s best in combination with magnetic Hall effect switches that can actuate rapidly to begin with, or other Rapid Trigger-style ones, instead of switches that wait to detect a full physical press. </p><div><p>So, should you do this? Your answer depends on whether you’re willing to risk getting banned from games for what many consider cheating — including Valve, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224261/valve-counter-strike-2-razer-snap-tap-wooting-socd-ban-kick">which is preventing players who use these features from playing <em>Counter-Strike 2</em></a>. You also might want to ask whether you’re <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-cheated-not-only-the-game-but-yourself">cheating not only the game but yourself</a>.</p></div><p>Personally, I will keep it off.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Considering the first movie was the kind of film that college-age (male) cinephiles tout as one of their faves, and that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/joker_folie_a_deux&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/joker_folie_a_deux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviews for the sequel (which is also a musical) have been less-than-stellar</a></span>, I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that Gaga’s upcoming album, titled <em>Harlequin</em>, will be the best thing to come out of this movie. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Lady Gaga had been teasing <em>something </em>on social media over the last few days, sharing text-based images on her Instagram account that read “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DAJe0NkS4_m/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAJe0NkS4_m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I’m ready for my interview</a></span>,” and “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DAMfBA2zjqj/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAMfBA2zjqj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Don’t tell me what to wear</a></span>” in scribbly font. The cryptic posts sent the Little Monsters into a frenzy, especially since they’ve known the Oscar- and Grammy-winning performer recently said LG7 (or “Lady Gaga 7,” referring to her seventh studio album) wouldn’t be out until next year. </p><p>Today, September 24, she announed <em>Harlequin</em>, her seventh studio album (but likely <em>not</em> the one she was hinting will drop in 2025), which she’s calling a “companion album” to <em>Joker: Folie à Deux. </em>You can pre-order a digital copy or the very nice-looking vinyl <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://shop.ladygaga.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://shop.ladygaga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span>. </p><p>From the tracklist, it appears the album will be a mix of covers and original music. Check it out below:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>1. Good Morning</p><p>2. Get Happy</p><p>3. Oh, When The Saints</p><p>4. World On A String</p><p>5. If My Friends Could See Me Now</p><p>6. That’s Entertainment</p><p>7. Smile</p><p>8. The Joker</p><p>9. Folie à Deux</p><p>10. Gonna Build A Mountain</p><p>11. Close To You</p><p>12. Happy Mistake</p><p>13. That’s Life</p></blockquote><p>For example, “World On A String” and “That’s Life” are references to/the exact names of iconic Frank Sinatra songs, “Oh When The Saints” is a shortening of the title of a Louis Armstrong tune, and “That’s Entertainment” is the name of a track written for the 1952 musical <em>The Band Wagon</em>. I have a feeling a lot of these songs are going to sound like showtunes, based on the trailers we’ve seen for the upcoming film, and Gaga’s penchant for old-school Hollywood songs and jazz (she’s done two albums of covers with icon Tony Bennet). </p><p>I could listen to Lady Gaga sing the damn phone book, and combine that with the really cool album art, which shows her standing in a shower, makeup running down her face, wearing a life vest, consider me sat. I don’t even need to see the movie, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@yahooentertainment/video/7029040588079058223?lang=en&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yahooentertainment/video/7029040588079058223?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I believe in the empowerment of women</a></span>, and I will be buying this album.

It's in development for PC. Check out the first trailer above and the first screenshots in the gallery below.</p><p>Relay describes how they're aiming to set their game apart: "Gravity Forge offers the player an extra degree of freedom in both movement and combat. The environment becomes a weapon. You can walk on walls, create gravity wells, change properties of the environment (gravity, size, mass), and discover new ways to interact with the world. This is a spatial shooter, spatial imagination is your best weapon."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Gravity Forge - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Here's how they describe what they're going for with combat: "Imagine the Prince of Persia with a machine gun. Or Doomguy with a katana and the fluid fast movement of a Warframe. Combine that with the cinematic flair of bullet-time action from Max Payne and you will get an idea of how Gravity Forge plays."</p><p>Gravity Forge is set in the dieselpunk city of Gaston City, where you play as Elsa, a treasure-hunter whose big heist goes bad, leaving her to deal with the consequences of the "Living Magnet" technology she's unleashed. </p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2848760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wishlist</a> Gravity Forge on Steam if you're interested in following its progress.</p><p><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.
