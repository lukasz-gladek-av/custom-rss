			<p>Today, on the <a href="https://x.com/LittleBigPlanet/status/1843652568389480651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1843652568389480651%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LittleBigPlanet X account</a>, an announcement was posted regarding the future of <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/littlebigplanet-3-review-sackboy-friends-create-wonderful-memory/">LittleBigPlanet 3</a> and LittleBigPlanet DLC on the PlayStation Store.&nbsp; Created by Media Molecule, LittleBigPlanet was developed by Media Molecule, with the first game being released in 2008 on the PlayStation 3. In total, there have been six games in the franchise, with the latest main installment being titled Sackboy: A Big Adventure. However, with this announcement being posted on X, it seems that LittleBigPlanet may be no more. This post explains that this is the last chance for people to purchase LittleBigPlanet 3 and the DLC from the PlayStation Store. LittleBigPlanet 3 has been available for ten years, and now it seems that it is time for the game and all LBP DLC to be removed from the PlayStation Store as of October 31, 2024.</p>
<p>While the game is being delisted as of October 31, those who own the game as a physical or digital copy will still be able to access the content of the game. The announcement was listed so that those who haven't obtained the game yet are still able to access the game, with this as a final reminder. Whether this means that the servers will still be up is uncertain at the moment, but considering the servers for most previous games in the franchise have been closed down over the years, it seems likely that LittleBigPlanet 3 will follow suit.</p>
<p>As it stands, none of the LittleBigPlanet games are available to purchase digitally anymore, as they have all been delisted from the PlayStation Store, with LittleBigPlanet 3 being the last to go. Fans are in uproar about this, as it feels as if "years of DLC and community are getting erased," as <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/reminder-little-big-planet-3-all-dlc-will-be-delisted-on-oct-31st-2024.1003713/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one person comments</a> in response to a thread on Resetera.</p>
<p>Although the statement is worded in such a way by saying "friendly reminder" to purchase the game before it's gone forever, this is the only reminder that those who are fans of the franchise have been given, and it's less than a month's notice for people to purchase the game. It's likely that people who want it would be able to buy it cheaper as a physical copy from retailers still selling it or in thrift stores, but those who are using a digital-only console will be out of luck.</p>
<p>Additionally, October is a very stacked month for games, and in a time of financial crisis across the globe, it's going to be hard for people to decide whether they will choose to purchase a game before it's gone forever or choose to buy a game that has come out recently so that they can be in line with others.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/learning-how-to-emote-in-diablo-4-could-reward-you/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Several quests across Sanctuary, including one in Kyovashad, task you with utilizing an emote in Diablo 4 to cheer on guardsmen, interact with chests, or summon spirits at an altar. On top of the quest-specific goals, the emote wheel also allows you to connect with other players, chanting a class-specific greeting or challenging them to PvP. Here’s how to use the emote wheel in Diablo 4!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-emotes-in-diablo-4">How to Use Emotes in Diablo 4</h2>



<p>To use the emote wheel in Diablo 4, press either ‘<strong>Up</strong>‘ on the d-pad of your controller or ‘<strong>E</strong>‘ on the keyboard to access the wheel. From there, you can sort through three separate tabs of the wheel, with each holding eight total emotes. There are some you cannot swap out, however. For example, you’ll want to ensure you have Zoom, Leave Dungeon, Invite to Party, and Invite to Trade readily available on the wheel’s first tab so they’re easily accessible. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can customize the available emotes by opening the wheel and selecting “Customize” using the prompt below the emote wheel on the right-hand side. From there, it will open a new menu in which all your available emotes appear in a scrolling menu, which you may then add to the wheel.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-new-emotes-in-diablo-4">How to Unlock New Emotes in Diablo 4</h2>



<p>As you progress through the various questlines and seasonal objectives in Diablo 4, you will inevitably unlock new emotes. The best way to earn new emotes is to complete the game’s season. The battle pass contains a handful of unique, sometimes class-specific, emotes that unlock once you level up far enough. However, many will only become available once you buy the premium pass, which costs real-world money to unlock.</p>



<p>Furthermore, some of the game’s quests and content will unlock emotes as rewards, so don’t forget to play through everything available!</p>



<p>How are you enjoying the brand-new season of Diablo 4 and its first expansion, Vessel of Hatred? Let us know in the comments below, or visit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forums</a> to start the discussion!</p>



<hr>



<p>Can you believe <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-has-made-over-1-billion-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo 4 has made over $1 billion dollars in revenue</a> already? It’s all thanks to that cosmetic in-game shop and its egregious pricing, but I’m guilty of decking out my Barbarian in unique cosmetics, too.</p>

                <p>The Last of Us has a reputation as being one of the best video game series of all time for many reasons. You have to do a lot of different things right to earn that sort of lasting acclaim--there's no "one weird trick" to success. But one of the key factors is certainly the original score by Gustavo Santaolalla, who won consecutive Oscars in 2006 and 2007 for his compositions for Brokeback Mountain and Babel. During <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days sales event</a>, you can save big on this huge vinyl box set of Santaolalla's music from both The Last of Us games.</p><div title="The Last of Us 10th Anniversary Vinyl Box Set" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2727" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="The Last of Us 10th Anniversary Vinyl Box Set" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Last-10th-Anniversary-Vinyl-Box/dp/B0CWHF232B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Last-10th-Anniversary-Vinyl-Box\/dp\/B0CWHF232B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Last-10th-Anniversary-Vinyl-Box/dp/B0CWHF232B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">The Last of Us 10th Anniversary Vinyl Box Set</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Last-10th-Anniversary-Vinyl-Box/dp/B0CWHF232B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Last-10th-Anniversary-Vinyl-Box\/dp\/B0CWHF232B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Last-10th-Anniversary-Vinyl-Box/dp/B0CWHF232B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">$76 (was $110)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>This expansive set includes eight discs of music from both the original game and its sequel, The Last of Us Part II, by composer Gustavo Santaolalla, with packaging and sleeves adorned with very striking art by Ashraf Omar.

It worked so well, in fact, that Santaolalla also composed the music for the HBO series.</p><p>Speaking of which, the 4K Blu-ray for Season 1 of HBO's The Last of Us, starring Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsay, is also on sale for Prime Big Deal Days for just $21, down from its list price of $45--pretty good for eight hours of TV.</p><p>There are many, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>many</em> other deals to peruse during Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days event</a>, though you'll need to be an Amazon Prime member to participate. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sign up here</a>.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/goat-simulator-3">Goat Simulator 3</a> is heading to PS4 and Xbox One on 24th October, following its launch in 2022 across current consoles and PC.</p>
<p>The release will include the base game, all free content updates, and the Multiverse of Nonsense DLC.</p>
<p>What's more, it has cross-ownership integration meaning existing owners on current consoles can play on the equivalent previous console. However, only Xbox has cross-save integration too.</p>

<p>Goat Simulator 3 will also feature local two-player splitscreen, and two-player online multiplayer (on the same platform).</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to be able to give PS4 and Xbox One players access to our baa-rilliant game," said Santiago Ferrero, creative director at Coffee Stain North. "With 8th generation consoles joining the party, Goat Simulator 3 will now be available on 8 different platforms… As the kids would say, we really 'ate' with this announcement – they do still say that, right?"</p>
<p>In more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/goat-simulator">Goat Simulator</a> news, the remaster of the first game will be released on 7th November.</p>
<p>Goat Simulator: Remastered will launch across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S over a decade after the original release. It will come with improved graphics, a re-worked mutator menu, and all DLC.</p>
<p>"You've waited 10 years, now we ask that you wait just one more month," said Joel Rydholm, producer at Coffee Stain Publishing in yet another tongue in cheek comment. "Goat Simulator: Remastered is going to knock your socks (hooves?) off, and we promise it'll probably be worth the wait. We're so excited to see what our fans think!"</p>
<p>Goat Simulator 3 was notable for its announcement trailer that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-takes-down-goat-simulator-3-ad-that-used-leaked-gta-6-footage">incorporated leaked footage from GTA 6</a> - publisher Take-Two soon issued a take-down notice.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fortnite is about to get quite villainous. According to a new leak, Fortnite is set to receive three new Disney villains relatively soon.</p>



<p>HypeX, who is known to post various Fortnite leaks, <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1843659867053343017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted Tuesday</a> that Captain Hook, Cruella de Vil, and Maleficent will be available when the next update drops.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The additions come as part of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/disney-buys-1-5-billion-stake-in-epic-games-will-create-expansive-universe-within-fortnite/">crossover deal</a> between Disney and Epic Games. As far as in what way they’ll be added to the game hasn’t been confirmed. One thing Disney has made known is that not every character added to Fortnite will be able to use guns, which would limit their ability to be used in the classic Fortnite Battle Royale. </p>



<p>“Not every outfit will be able to do everything,” Epic EVP Saxs Persson told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a> last week. “A [Lego] minifig doesn’t hold a gun. Brands should be able to enforce the brand guidelines to the degree that they’re comfortable with that brand being associated with particular ratings.”</p>







<p>Disney and Fortnite’s collaboration will continue to grow aside from the additions of characters to the game. Epic Games and Disney are also working on new games as well as a full Disney universe within Fortnite.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Disney villains coming to Fortnite? Let us know in the comments.</p>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J9XDMQ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">11-inch 512GB model is $1,049</a>, and if you need a bigger screen, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-13-Inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J7ZX58?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">13-inch model is $1,349</a>. You'll need to click the coupons on the respective pages to get these discounts.</p><p>If you're looking to get an iPad for more general use, there are also some deals on older models. For general browsing and bedtime Netflix, there's the 2021 base iPad for $258, while the sixth-generation iPad Mini with 64GB of storage capacity will cost you $350. In the Macbook department, Amazon is offering the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-15-inch-Laptop/dp/B0CX23GFMJ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2024 MacBook Air for $1,044</a>. This is a pretty powerful laptop, as it has a 15-inch liquid retina display, a powerful M3 chip, and 256GB of storage capacity, making it a solid workhorse to lug around. For something a bit more compact, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0CX23V2ZK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">there's a 13-inch version for $849</a>.</p><p>Pairing these with headsets is also a good idea, especially if you're sticking with Apple so that you can take advantage of extra features. The standout deal here are the AirPods Pro 2 wireless earbuds for $168 (was $250), as these little titans provide exceptional active noise-canceling, dynamic sound, and a USB-C connection for fast-charging. You can also check out the premium AirPods Max for a deluxe experience, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJC52FP?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as the USB-C model is $499 for Prime Day</a>. If you don't mind a Lightning connection, you can save even more <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">and get a set of these elegant cans for $395</a>.</p><p>Artists can also benefit from Prime Day, as the Apple Pencils are on sale. You'll want to check the compatibility of each model before you decide on a price, but if you're looking to explore the world of digital art, these are game-changers. You'll be amazed at what you can create on an iPad with an app like Procreate or Adobe Fresco, and these stylus devices feel very comfortable to use. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Pencil-1st-Generation-Adapter/dp/B0BJLG69QR?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">first-generation Apple Pencil</a> is a little dated but can still work just fine on older iPads, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MU8F2AM-A-Pencil-Generation/dp/B07K1WWBJK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">second-generation model</a> is ergonomically superb to use.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Pencil-Pro-Pixel-Perfect-Industry-Leading/dp/B0D3J71RM7?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple Pencil Pro</a> is the best of the bunch, as it offers an impressive number of gesture-based controls and haptic feedback features. Finally, you can pick up an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Studio-Display-Nano-Texture-Height-Adjustable/dp/B09V3HR5DJ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple Studio Display for $2,000</a>. Admittedly this is <em>very </em>expensive, but this is a pretty big price drop and these displays are popular with creative professionals due to their high-quality design and rich selection of colors.

Most of these are led by Colin Farrell, who is unrecognizable in his role as Oz Cobb aka The Penguin, and they add the briefest moments of levity to an otherwise heavy crime drama.<br></p><p>The most recent episode begins with a tragedy: The flooding of Gotham by the Riddler, first seen in 2022’s <em>The Batman</em>. We see how it affects Oz’s reluctant new henchman, Vic (Rhenzy Feliz), who over the course of the episode slowly settles into his role, discovering he might actually like being so flush with cash he can pay off cops. It’s also the start of Oz’s partnership with the deliciously unhinged Sofia Falcone (Cristin Milioti), who seems to be perpetually on the precipice of killing someone in her line of sight, like a coiled cobra in the grass. But despite all the tension simmering through episode three, I couldn’t stop laughing.</p><p>At one point, Sofia brings Oz to the factory where her team is hard at work on a new psychoactive drug that she smuggled out of Arkham. As an eccentric chemist explains the drug, cultivated from some freaky-looking mushrooms, in increasingly more scientific ways, he throws a few Latin words out there. Oz immediately snaps, “what the fuck you say to me?” like Tony Soprano with his hand on the butt of a gun. I guffawed.</p><p>Moments before that, Sofia shows up at Oz’s apartment, where a terrified Vic is forced to play the gracious host. She moves around the room, clearly disgusted by Oz’s interior decorating choices, picking up a remote like it’s covered in toxic waste. Vic goes to tell her what it’s for, but before he can finish, she clicks it and a huge electric fireplace kicks on. “Tacky,” she mumbles.<br></p><p>She’s not here to hang out though, they have an errand to run. Oz instructs Vic to remain in his apartment instead of tagging along. “Stay put,” he says, closing the door behind him. He opens it again immediately after and hisses, “If you do anything stupid, I’ll sense it.” It’s a master class, guys.<br></p><p>Though the rest of the episode is pretty high-stakes, there are consistent dashes of humor sprinkled throughout that consistently startle a peal of laughter out of me: Oz responding to a rival gang leader asking if they’re staring a coup with “What are you, reading books or somethin’?”, Vic splitting a gunman nearly in half with Oz’s plum-colored Maserati (it’s not purple, as he reminds us in episode one) just when you think our Penguin is done for, and Oz responding “fuck it, leave her,” when Vic asks what they should do about Sofia, who was also in the line of fire. They speed away in the destroyed Maserati while “Me And The Devil” plays.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-hbo-series-episode-1-review-recap-batman-1851652226?_gl=1*cd1doq*_ga*MjA4NjU1MDY4Ni4xNzE0NjU5MDky*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyODQwODAyOC45NS4xLjE3Mjg0MTAwMjYuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-hbo-series-episode-1-review-recap-batman-1851652226?_gl=1*cd1doq*_ga*MjA4NjU1MDY4Ni4xNzE0NjU5MDky*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyODQwODAyOC45NS4xLjE3Mjg0MTAwMjYuNjAuMC4w">Every single episode of <em>The Penguin</em> thus far has been like this</a></span>—terribly tense mobster moments that Oz gets out of by the skin of his one gold tooth, punctuated by surprisingly riotous riffs. It’s the best show on TV right now, and surprisingly one of the funniest. The fourth episode of <em>The Penguin</em> airs on Max on Sunday, October 13.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Polish developer The Farm 51 <a href="https://wccftech.com/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-open-world-sequel-announced-for-2025-pc-requirements-already-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone, the sequel to 2021's first-person shooter survival horror <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/chernobylite-babysit-your-friends-and-venture-into-the-exclusion-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game</a>, just before Gamescom 2024.</p>
<p>While there, I had the chance to speak with Wojciech Pazdur, Development Director at The Farm 51, who discussed the big changes of this sequel, which is moving to the third-person open world role-playing game genre (albeit with an optional first-person view for exploration) and shooting for a much bigger game in terms of explorable area and playtime, not to mention optional support for cooperative multiplayer.</p>
<p>We also learned that the studio is tentatively targeting a Fall 2025 release window, that it would rather not follow the early access path used for the original game, and that a Nintendo Switch port of the first Chernobylite is on the way.</p>
<p><iframe title="CHERNOBYLITE 2: EXCLUSION ZONE - GAMEPLAY TRAILER [2025 ON PC &amp; CONSOLES]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T6mEtQRWC2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>When did you begin working on Chernobylite 2?</strong></p>
<p>We started working on it as soon as we launched the first game. However, Chernobylite 1 was never fully finished because we just released the last DLCs, the last expansion packs, a bit over a month ago. This is actually the end of our journey with Chernobylite 1. A port is coming for Nintendo Switch, but we are not developing the game ourselves.</p>
<p>We first started working on concepts and prototypes for Chernobylite 2 in the second half of 2021, so it's been almost three years today. The pre-production took us one year and a half, and we've been in production for over a year. We still have one year until the game is finished. Today, we are close to the Alpha stage, meaning you can play almost all the game. We actually wanted to wait to announce Chernobylite 2 up to the day when the first one was completely done from our aspect.</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to do early access again?</strong></p>
<p>We are considering early access. However, because of the scale of the project, we would prefer not to. We know that early access is very helpful. But if we went with early access, then probably the release date for the final game would be postponed, because early access gives you a lot of extra work. So today, we would prefer not to go for early access, but we will see how our playtest goes and how our talks with investors and the publisher regarding the distribution model go.</p>
<p>Ultimately, early access gave us an enormous amount of value-added feedback for the first game, helping us make a better game. Looking just from this perspective, early access is a good tool. But for a game of this scale, supporting and managing early access would be heavy for us because the game is many times bigger than the original.</p>
<p><strong>What are the main improvements you're planning for Chernobylite 2?</strong></p>
<p>We originally didn't even think of it as a sequel. We simply wanted to make the game we envisioned from the beginning. Chernobylite had a tiny budget, team, and schedule, as well as many technological limitations.</p>
<p>For instance, we always wanted to make it an open world game, but with Unreal Engine 4, it was too hard for us to keep this level of visual quality and make it open world. We had to make a game with very limited locations, a very small amount of characters, gadgets, weapons, and mechanics. Everything was very restricted from the beginning because of our team size, our technology expertise in Unreal Engine 4, and our budget, of course.</p>
<p>With Chernobylite 2, we knew we had a strong design foundation and a proven world setting. Actually, we had an internal joke: we codenamed the second game ChernobyFull. That speaks to how much we wanted this game to be the full,&nbsp;top-of-the-line experience that we wanted to create from scratch.</p>
<p>Meaning, first of all, an open world RPG. We wanted more characters, more character interactions, and more things to do regarding the different stories. We have also been adding a lot of content, like weapons, gadgets, mechanics, enemies, and so on, but it was not just our vision. We talked with Chernobylite 1 players; we have been constantly asking players, including very detailed surveys, to give insight on the best and worst elements of Chernobylite 1. Most of the players said yes, exploration, an open world, and then more characters, more gadgets, and more ways of progressing through the story. We agreed that, yes, this is also what we would like to do. So we simply made this world 20 times bigger world, and the playtime two to three times longer.</p>
<p>We have more characters, and these characters have faces and talk to you. In the original game, everybody wore gas masks because we couldn't afford to make facial animations. We also have factions. In the original game, there were only a few characters in the whole zone, but here, the zone is divided into areas run by factions, and each faction has its representatives. If you cooperate with them, you gain their respect, and you can also unlock training that will provide special abilities. These are somehow related to what this faction is doing. We have mutants, scientists, and mercenaries.</p>
<p>Since it is an open world, you can walk around Pripyat City and then get back to the power plant, or you can use the quick travel option, which in our game happens through teleport-like devices. Besides that, the skill and attribute systems are more like in RPG games. We have six main attributes now. You can also ask your companions to help with managing the base, becoming&nbsp;your quartermaster or gunsmith or workshop manager, let's say.</p>

We wanted more characters, more character interactions, and more things to do regarding the different stories. So we simply made this world 20 times bigger world, and the playtime two to three times longer.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do you still send them on missions like in the previous game?</strong></p>
<p>We are not sending them in missions any longer. In the sequel, you are the one going on missions. But some of the missions are related to the characters that you have encountered, too, so sometimes they will appear in those missions.</p>
<p>The game still has an optional first-person view for exploration to let you enjoy the visuals. We've got much more detail. There is multilayered foliage all over the terrain. We have improved the density and quality of all models. Even with open world, it's much more detailed than it was than it was before. We also have full body awareness, so you see the body of your character when using first person view.</p>
<p>The biggest change is that the main mode is third-person view, mostly to give it an RPG feel. We didn't want to be compared too much with games like S. T. A. L. K. E. R. or METRO. It was an issue trying to do that because it was too often compared to S. T. A. L. K. E. R., which was not actually a reference to our game. Also, since we are doing an RPG, we have expanded melee combat. We see today that this combat system simply works better.</p>
<p>With Chernobylite, we were proud of everything except the fact that the players said our combat was just average. There is not much room for story-driven first-person shooters if they are cheap. Not having a triple-A budget, we decided we would not continue pursuing first-person shooters. We are going our own way. We believe in going toward RPG.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any other unique feature in Chernobylite 2?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. It is called Planewalking. At almost any time in the game, you can summon another version of yourself from another dimension. It may have different weapons, it may have different abilities, and it may be suited well for different playstyles. This allows you to change your character on the fly into different builds. For example, this scientist doesn't have a typical shooting weapon, but he has some special ability, which is not actually magic; it's physical-based stuff, but he can throw fireballs.</p>
<p><strong>Are you worried that some players will be disappointed with this change of perspective?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, actually, we know it's an issue. This is why we are keeping a big part of the game, which is exploration, in first person. We hope the players will forgive us because we had this tested by both existing fans and new fans. Even existing fans said this new system plays much better. Shooting in first person in Chernobylite was simply average. That's what we knew and that's what we heard. Third-person combat actually works better in our game.</p>
<p><strong>I remember from the official announcement that you're also adding coop mode, right?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, although I cannot show it to you right now. This was one of the things that players really demanded. Still, Chernobylite 2 is more like a single-player narrative RPG with the ability to play coop. For some missions, it is better to bring somebody along.</p>
<p>Whenever you're in the base, you can use the radio. In the first game, you could only use it to receive some messages from other characters. Now, though, you can use it to connect with other people and meet them to explore another dimension and tackle the greatest challenges. But if you want to play the game just on your own, it's also possible.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'With Planewalking, at almost any time in the game, you can summon another version of yourself from another dimension. It may have different weapons, it may have different abilities, and it may be suited well for different playstyles.

<p><strong>Do you plan to create dungeon-like content for co-op players where you have to fight a big boss or something like that?</strong></p>
<p>I don't want to spoil too much, but yes, for instance, some of the bosses would be better dedicated to be fought with the help of friends. Also, there are special locations. I didn't show it much to you right now, but we also have dungeons and even huge towers. So, in general, you will not just be walking over the surface of the game, but you will, at some point, see many more different structures and different locations than just a huge flat area covered with forest and some ruins. We definitely have more of different locations over and under the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a day/night cycle in Chernobylite 2?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we got it.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any change to the enemies during nighttime?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, there are many aspects of the game that change when you play at different moments of the day cycle and in different weather. This actually affects the behavior and perception of the enemies.</p>
<p><strong>The game is made with Unreal Engine 5, right?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it's all done in Unreal Engine 5. We have moved most of the content from the original game here, but because we are using Unreal Engine 5 and we've got Nanite, this content is heavily upgraded over the original Chernobylite. We have been using the 3D scans of the real Chernobyl exclusion zone.</p>
<p>The source materials already have millions of polygons, but we optimized them in Chernobylite 1 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, so they couldn't be as detailed as they are now with Nanite. Even the same source data that we captured five years ago can now be displayed in much higher resolution. It didn't make sense for us to rescan Chernobyl again because we would end up with the same source data. We just reprocessed it to give it much more detail and polygons. And, of course, textures are also higher resolution, so right now, the game is more detailed, including things like the foliage. It's also using the advantages of Nanite technology.</p>
<p><strong>I imagine you're also using Lumen, right?</strong></p>
<p>Of course, yes. Actually, it has brought us a lot of optimization issues so far, and we are, let's say, in the stage of optimizing that today.</p>
<p><strong>It was announced at some point that Chernobylite would add support for NVIDIA DLSS 3, but I don't think it was actually released. Is it going to be in this one?</strong></p>
<p>For Chernobylite 1, the issue was that it appeared when most of the games were switching from the old generation to the next generation. So Chernobylite 1 was optimized to support the widest range of hardware systems, such as old and new consoles. The lowest graphic cards that we have been supporting, and I personally optimized the game for, were GeForce GTX 660.</p>
<p>Today, because we're using Unreal 5 and going only for newer consoles, like PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X, we'll also increase the minimum requirements, as it doesn't make sense to support those old GPUs today.</p>
<p>We will definitely put much more effort into everything to make games work well and smoothly with the more recent generation of cards. With Chernobylite 1, we really wanted to do more, but there was simply not enough manpower to provide support for both low-end, high-end, middle-end, and so on. We'll see about DLSS because we also need to support FSR.</p>
<p>Actually, I have a meeting today with NVIDIA where we are discussing what could be the best way of utilizing their different technologies within the game, both the ones that are available today and the ones that will be available in one year when the game will be released in the final stage.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Generally, our goal is to be ready to release the final version of the game one year from now. I'm saying one year because it's probably going to be August or maybe September next year. We'll see. Generally, right now, we are announcing only the date 2025 because it depends on many different things. For instance, if we are doing a simultaneous launch on PC and consoles, if there maybe would be early access, if there will be physical distribution or digital only, and so on.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>So you are planning to launch Chernobylite 2 in Fall 2025?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Generally, our goal is to be ready to release the final version of the game one year from now. I'm saying one year because it's probably going to be August or maybe September next year. We'll see. Generally, right now, we are announcing only the date 2025 because it depends on many different things. For instance, if we are doing a simultaneous launch on PC and consoles, if there maybe would be early access, if there will be physical distribution or digital only, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Would the game launch later on consoles?</strong></p>
<p>We are discussing right now with potential partners because we would need extra support to make it a sim launch on consoles alongside PC, and we need to check if it's worth doing that. Definitely, we want to be on PC and consoles because Chernobylite 1 was quite successful on both PC and consoles.</p>
<p><strong>Now you are launching the first game on Switch, correct?</strong></p>
<p>Chernobylite 1 will be launched on the Nintendo Switch console, hopefully late this year. We are just supporting the development of this version, which is mainly handled by an external company, a Polish developer with whom we are very friendly, and the project is already progressing well. I'm somehow supervising it and keeping up with their efforts, and so far, I'm playing Chernobylite 1 mostly on Switch.</p>
<p><strong>The Switch 2 is coming. Will Chernobylite 2 launch on the new Nintendo consoIe?</strong></p>
<p>I cannot say anything, but for sure, we won't launch Chernobylite 2 on the old generation of any consoles because this game will be too heavy and too big and Unreal 5 won't support it in a, let's say, reasonable time frame or amount of work. But what we can say for sure, we are today definitely confirming that we are targeting PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X, and for the other platforms that may appear in the meantime, all the discussions right now are quite secret.</p>
<p><strong>Fair enough. Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

From the sounds of it, the newest <em>DBZ </em>title, which returns to the long-dormant <em>Budokai Tenkaichi </em>sub-series of arena fighters, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-previews-roundup-goku-1851652746&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-previews-roundup-goku-1851652746">is a (ki-)blast</a></span>.

However, many players seem to be having trouble overcoming one of <em>Sparking Zero</em>’s comically huge hurdles, and the game’s deeply funny community is already making light of the whole affair.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195697" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="170" data-playlist="195697,195502,195624" data-current="195697"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21194.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In <em>Sparking Zero</em>’s story mode, dubbed Episode Battles here, you can relive some of the most famous fights from the renowned shonen and follow the stories of certain key characters. Of course, <em>Dragon Ball</em>’s longtime protagonist Goku is featured prominently in this mode, and his story is both one of the longest and most demanding of the bunch. Nowhere has that been more clear than in the showdown against Great Ape Vegeta, who is the first real boss you encounter in Goku’s story and has become the bane of many a player’s existence.</p><p>This trial has been absolutely kicking people’s asses since <em>Sparking Zero </em>became available to play, and it is downright hilarious seeing people react to its intense difficulty. From the clips that I’ve seen, Great Ape Vegeta’s well-earned reputation for giving players a hard time has to do with just how damn unrelenting he can be. He can evidently spam his beam attack (which also does splash damage as an extra bit of dirt in the wound) with relatively little charging in between—that or he charges his techniques much quicker than the player—and he has an utterly brutal command grab.</p><p>To make matters worse, it appears that Great Ape Vegeta can literally pull out either move to start a fight, and as you might expect, his attacks do <em>heavy </em>damage. Hilariously, there are clips of players immediately restarting the fight in the hope of getting optimal openings, which Great Ape Vegeta doesn’t seem prone to give often.</p><p>To complement his massive damage-dealing abilities, Great Ape Vegeta also dwarfs Goku in this fight, and shrugs off basic attacks like he’s swatting a fly thanks to his super armor. The whole thing seems like the funniest callback to Great Ape Vegeta’s appearance in the original <em>Budokai Tenkaichi</em>, which was a pretty brutal fight as well. All I know is this monkey is being a motherfucker, and I’m <em>living </em>for the reactions to it.</p><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SwagFish03/status/1843496836906237968&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SwagFish03/status/1843496836906237968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fight isn’t impossible</a></span>, but it’s pretty damn brutal until you learn to sidestep the blasts and spam your own Kamehameha back at Great Ape Vegeta. For the folks who haven’t learned yet, Great Ape Vegeta has been ridiculously difficult, and some are already invoking comparisons to similarly tough boss battles in other games, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346"><em>Elden Ring</em>’s Radahn encounter</a></span>. Word on the street is that Great Ape Vegeta might not even be the toughest fight, either. All I’m saying is don’t let the Ginyu Force catch y’all outside.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ubisoft has lifted the lid on the location for 2025’s prestigious Six Invitational, and it looks like we’re all shipping up to Boston! While we knew for months that the Six Invitational 2025 would land in North America, we didn’t know <strong>exactly </strong>where, but thanks to a recent announcement from Ubisoft, we can all start booking our flights and hotels.</p>



<p>This is the first Six Invitational to take place in the continental United States, with all previous events unfolding in Canada, Europe, or Brazil.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-boston-bound">Boston Bound</h2>



<p>Ubisoft has confirmed that the Six Invitational – the most ambitious and lucrative esports event in the Rainbow Six Siege scene – will land in Boston, Massachusetts in February 2025. You’d best wrap up warm – it won’t be as nice weather-wise as Sao Paolo, which is where the Six Invitational 2024 took place.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Teams are already starting to secure their spots at the Six Invitational in Boston, and more will be locked in as the BLAST R6 Major Montreal wraps up in the coming days.</p>



<p>Thus far, the likes of Cloud9 Beastcoast, Team BDS, DarkZero Esports, FaZe Clan, Team Secret, and Team Liquid have all qualified.</p>



<p>It’s almost the tenth anniversary of the Six Invitational, which is a staggering tournament that boasts a prize pool worth $3 million – one of the largest single pools in the esports industry. The 2025 edition will be the ninth event in Rainbow Six Siege’s history, and if 2024’s tournament is anything to go by, it’ll be nothing short of electrifying.</p>



<p>Tickets are available to purchase <strong>now</strong> if you’re interested. It’s taking place from February 14 – 16 at the MGM Music Hall at Fenway, right in the heart of the city.</p>



<p>Are you heading to Boston for the Six Invitational? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
