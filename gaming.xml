            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>With the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> on the Switch 2, Digital Foundry has once again delivered its technical review of the port, detailing how it stands up next to the PS4 and, perhaps more importantly, the PS5.</p>
<p>The good news is that, as detailed in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">our review</a>, FF7 Remake is a technical triumph on the Switch 2. We won't go into <em>too</em> much detail here, as it's worth checking out the full rundown over on <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/features/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-a-ps5ps4-hybrid-boosted-with-dlss">Digital Foundry</a>, but this is a port that's essentially described as a hybrid of PS4 and PS5, beating out the former in multiple ways.</p>
<p>So for example, environmental textures are a lot closer to that of the PS5, with things like the infamous doors in the Sector 7 Slums looking a lot more detailed when compared to the game's original release on PS4. Ground textures are similarly improved, and sign readability is a lot better. It's not a total match everywhere though, with some textures leaning closer to PS4.</p>
<p>This is the same for shadows and character pop-in too, which are noted to be much closer to the PS4 than the PS5. In terms of lighting, however, Square Enix strived to emulate the PS5 Intergrade release, and it makes for an incredibly handsome game on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Performance is solid in docked and handheld modes, with very minor dips in handheld mode when panning the camera around areas such as Aerith's house. Otherwise, you're looking at a stable 30fps throughout. Resolution is 1080p in docked mode, though its noted that clarity is, again, a step up from the PS4.</p>
<p>Pretty good then, huh? We reckon the real test will come with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, since it's a pretty vast, open-world game. Given that it runs reasonably well on the Steam Deck, however, we're expecting similar results with the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Now go ahead and announce the release date, Square Enix.</p>

            <guid>1412152</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Your <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arm-to-establish-a-semiconductor-design-school-in-south-korea-to-train-1400-world-class-chip-design-professionals/">ARM-based</a></strong> Windows 11 device is now an <strong>Xbox</strong> too, as the Xbox App is now live on all Windows 11 ARM-based devices, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2026/01/21/play-more-xbox-app-is-now-available-on-arm-based-windows-11-pcs/"><strong>Microsoft</strong> announced today</a>. It's Microsoft's latest push to make every screen, no matter how big or small, an 'Xbox' - even if the device can't actually fulfill the definition of what we've known an Xbox to be for the last 20+ years.</p>



<p>Those with an ARM-based device can download the Xbox PC app and play most of their Game Pass library, with Microsoft confirming that "<em><strong>more than 85% of the Game Pass catalog is compatible with these PCs</strong></em>," and that it is working to add support for more games, so you don't have an issue playing any of your titles locally. </p>



<p>That said, for what you can't play locally, Microsoft is quick to add that there's always the Cloud Gaming option, a choice that is growing in popularity, according to Microsoft, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-expands-more-countries-is-increasingly-popular-game-pass-users/">which recently added the service to more regions</a>. A result that's no doubt helped by the fact that Cloud Gaming is <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">now available at <strong>every tier</strong> of a Game Pass subscription</a>, instead of being locked behind the most expensive Ultimate subscription, as it was for years.</p>



<p>"<em>Windows and Xbox continue to collaborate across the gaming community, OEMs, silicon innovators and game studios to expand catalog compatibility and deliver a consistently great Windows gaming experience—whether you’re on a powerful desktop, a purpose‑built handheld, or an ARM‑based Windows 11 laptop</em>," writes the principal program manager for Windows silicon and system integration, <strong>Brynnan Fink</strong> and senior director of Xbox Next Generation, <strong>Nicole Allen</strong>, in a blog post.</p>



<p>"<em>Our focus remains on improving compatibility, enhancing performance and delivering experiences that make it easy to jump in and play.</em> <em>We’re grateful to be building this with you. Every update we deliver and every title we bring to ARM-based Windows 11 PCs is shaped by what we hear from players. We’re excited about what’s ahead and look forward to bringing even more improvements, features and games to players everywhere in the coming year</em>."</p>

            <p>Following a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods">mod</a> which provides VR support for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-flatlines-after-cd-projekt-file-dmca-strike-and-request-its-creator-drop-their-paywall">hit with a takedown request by CD Projekt</a>, its creator has now said that they've not ruled out the possibility of releasing it for free. However, they've painted that as an unlikely road to go down, arguing that it's "kind of become a moot point" due to piracy of their work following the strike.</p>
<p>The fact Luke Ross' R.E.A.L VR mod for Cyberpunk, which is one arm of a wider VR support framework for a wide range of games, was behind a paywall appeared to be the crux of CD Projekt's decision to strike it. The studio's business development vice president Jan Rosner claimed in a post that they offered Ross the option of making it free and switching the paywall for optional donations, in line with their <a href="https://www.cdprojektred.com/en/fan-content">guidelines for fan-made content</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-dmcad-cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-says-people-are-now-pirating-it-to-punish-him-for-breaking-cd-projekts-terms-of-service">IGN</a>, Ross has now offered a bit more of their side of the story. According to the modder, they had "absolutely no say" in pulling the Cyberpunk VR mod from Patreon, instead claiming the platform yanked it down automatically in response to the strike being filed. Ross said he reached out to CD Projekt to try and "negotiate" with the studio about the takedown, to which he alleges CD Projekt simply replied telling him he needed to comply with their terms of service.</p>
<p>There was "no negotiation, no comments on my proposals, no interest for instance in knowing how many of their users would be affected by the sudden removal," according to the modder. Interestingly, Ross also claims to have reached out to CD Projekt back in 2022 to ask if the Cyberpunk developers would be interested in turning the mod into an official VR port for the game, an offer the studio declined according to the modder.</p>
<p>I've reached out to CD Projekt for comment.</p>
<p>As for the situation as it stands, Ross told IGN he's not ruled out releasing the mod for free, but "it would take time, because my software supports 40+ games and various completely different engines, which makes creating a version that specifically supports only Cyberpunk 2077 a non-trivial task". The modder also cited the potential for such a move not being popular with people who've already paid to support their work on the R.E.A.L VR framework.</p><p>"Anyway, it's kind of become a moot point," Ross continued. "Because following to the unexpected DMCA strike, after the mod was forcibly removed from my Patreon, people afraid of losing VR support for their favorite games have started pirating and illegally exchanging the mod all over the Internet, brazenly saying that since I was not complying with CDPR's terms of service, my work is now fair game and I should be punished by having it stolen."</p>
<p>For now, it seems Ross' Cyberpunk VR mod is set to remain taken down, and we'll have to see whether in the wake of alleged piracy and a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/another-one-dust-148437771">visible number of negative comments</a> directed at the modder, they decide to change that further down the line.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mio: Memories In Orbit: The Kotaku Review]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mio-memories-in-orbit-review-metroidvania-ps5-switch-2000661850</link>
            <guid>1412137</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Mio: Memories in Orbit</span></i><span> is a reminder that games can be all killer, no filler, for better or worse. A stylish side-scrolling Metroidvania, </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>marches to a familiar beat and wraps things up well before it could potentially grow tiresome. Its world is alluringly illustrated, and its gallery of rogues and weird little robots have their charms. Despite that, I do wish there was a bit more going on in its composition. I wish it felt denser and more layered. I’d have appreciated a bit more variety in instrumentation. I wish its lyricism hooked me more. And in the absence of these things, I found I kind of missed the filler, the noise that could have been constructed around that central, thrumming beat.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The first thing one is likely to clock about </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>is how gorgeous it is. It’s </span><i><span>very </span></i><span>easy to stop and stare at the landscapes in the background of nearly every one of its scenes. The Vessel, the spaceship on which </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>takes place, recalls the hostile and beautiful alien world of </span><i><span>Scavengers Reign</span></i><span>. It’s (almost) never as trippy, but it does often feel as dangerous. One second you’ll be in a lush, vegetative, and deadly jungle with strong purple hues and the next you’ll be in an azure metropolis that appears to have frozen over. Regardless of where you are, though, </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>is a stunner to look at, and its visuals are half the reason I explored the Vessel as deeply as I could.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><em>Mio</em>‘s movement: Solid fundamentals, not enough evolution</h2> <p><span>The other reason to play </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>is because it feels really damn good. Metroidvanias emphasize exploration, but it’d be no fun to move and fight through them if the game felt sluggish and if the combat were so-so. Luckily, </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>nails the fundamentals out of the gate. It’s got all the tricks one might hope for up its sleeve: a double jump that looks more like an elegant mid-air pirouette, a hookshot used for both platforming and shooting yourself across arenas in combat, an instantaneous dodge move that feels almost as satisfying as a </span><i><span>Sekiro </span></i><span>parry, a reliably weighty (and expressively animated) combo string, and more.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This mixture of silky-smooth movement and combat abilities most prominently figures into </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>‘s solid boss battles. Though none of the ones I ran into ever ran away with the show–there are plenty of hidden encounters along the game’s periphery, as well as the route to the game’s secret ending–I still had plenty of fun with each of them. Whether they were a drill-nosed mole creature burrowing into the arena or a mechanical murder doll complete with a saber and laser gun, each was stylistically distinct and demanded that I learn how to best use </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>‘s movement tech to navigate their numerous hazards long enough to see and capitalize on an attack window.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000661853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661853"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661853">©Douze Dixièmes</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I did, at times, find myself wishing that some of these encounters and arenas stood apart more. While the bosses never tread the same ground aesthetically, most of the stages themselves felt pretty same-y and the fights hit a lot of the same notes. At the end of the day, most of the arenas were square rooms with a few grapple points (save for one notable exception that breaks from this rhythm of boss fights) and most of these fights were one-on-one duels. Very few of the boss fights I did see featured environmental hazards and traps that could complicate matters and present interesting new wrinkles, and I would’ve preferred more of that variation throughout.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Maybe I’m just a masochist who really likes punishing games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review-hornet-team-cherry-2000639568"><i><span>Silksong</span></i></a> <span>and its ilk, but one thing those games I love get </span><i><span>really </span></i><span>right is their variety and breadth of enemies and encounters, and that sort of spice is sadly missing from </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>. Considering the lengths that </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>goes to in order to feel adjacent to the </span><i><span>Souls </span></i><span>lineage–there are bonfire-like checkpoints here,</span> <span>and more than enough enigmatic worldbuilding to go around–it’s a bit of a shame it doesn’t go that step further, especially on the game’s most obvious and critical path.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking of a lack of variety, I was disappointed in how little </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>‘s combat ever grows. There are modifications you can make that alter certain attributes, like one upgrade that allows Mio to do a heavy attack immediately after landing a hookshot, but besides that, you never earn new techniques or weapons. There is no additional</span> <span>combo to learn by traveling off the beaten path. There is no projectile with which to occasionally pepper an enemy from afar.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Samus has missiles to complement her pea shooter. </span><i><span>Castlevania</span></i><span>‘s numerous protagonists can begin the game with a great variety of weapons, like axes, swords, or whips. Mega Man absorbs the powers of the robot masters he defeats. Juan of </span><i><span>Guacamelee </span></i><span>gains entirely new wrestling techniques and Ori regularly picks up stunning new magical powers. The Knight of </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> can use charge attacks as well as a highly-effective magic blast and a dive move with a massive area-of-effect, and Hornet gains new traps, tools, and crests that fundamentally alter her moveset.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>By comparison, </span><span>Mio </span><span>is stuck with their same little saber and three-attack combo for the entirety of the game. The lack of imagination here doesn’t significantly take away from the game, but I did find myself less enthused with the prospect of combat in </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>‘s late stretches, in large part because it had plateaued so early.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>A mystery without mystique</h2> <p><span>And while I’m speaking of aspects of the game that regrettably fall flat, I really wish </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>’s narrative went…anywhere. The Vessel is an ark ship meant to ferry a colony and their robots (who look a </span><i><span>lot </span></i><span>like Pascal from </span><i><span>Nier: Automata</span></i><span> and fill the ranks of the game’s cast) across the stars in search of a new world. Partway through the journey though, the Voices—AI that served as deities and guides to the robots and are named after body parts like the Spine and the Hand—cease function, allowing the Vessel and its inhabitants to fall into disrepair as the ship drifts. The great mystery of the game is figuring out what exactly happened to cause the AIs to stop and go quiet.</span></p>

 <p><span>Despite its early promise, though,</span><i><span> Mio</span></i><span>‘s writing just didn’t hook me. The game’s story is largely explained in lore tomes found through exploration and following the game’s main story path, but even these missives fail to inject the proceedings with a sense of urgency or dramatic tension. Normally, I’d fear that I just don’t get the story, but in the case of </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>, I do, save for whatever revelations the game’s out-of-the way “true” ending might hold. However, the morsels of story that </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>delivered never quite lived up to the mystique that it spent so long building up, and I found myself quite disappointed in the answers and resolutions afforded to the conflicts and characters by the tale’s end.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“Lo-fi beats to Metroid to.”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>developer:</p>                 <p>Douze Dixièmes</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>type of game:</p>                 <p>Metroidvania</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Arresting visual style, fluid combat and movement, really fun boss battles.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Story fails to build any momentum, lack of variety in combat.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p> PC (played on), PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch.  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date: </p>                 <p>January 20, 2026</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Rolled credits at about 17 hours, but spent about 20+ hours working towards the secret ending before moving on.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>Its characters, what little there are in settings like Metropolis and the Haven, feel like one-note bit players in the game’s grander machinations.

Despite my initial efforts to see as much of the game as possible and give it the chance to change my mind, I simply could not feign any more interest in securing a more hopeful resolution to the ills of a cast that felt so amorphous and under-developed.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Suffice it to say, </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>doesn’t quite tick off all the boxes of what I’m looking for in a Metroidvania.

But as the journey comes to a close, the sameness of its encounters and simplistic combat closes out the story on a bit of a whimper where a bang might’ve felt more appropriate.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>is stylish and elegant to boot, but that and a decent grasp of the fundamentals are not enough to deepen my appreciation of what’s ultimately a pretty by-the-numbers Metroidvania. It’s an adherent to the form, but I rarely like the tune it sings, and don’t quite love it despite my efforts to.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Esports World Cup is shaping up to be a memorable event in 2026. In recent days, the Esports World Cup Foundation has unveiled an enormous $75 million prize pool and a roster of twenty-four games that promise unparalleled levels of competitive gaming entertainment.</p>



<p>This is the latest evolution of the biggest event in esports, but it doesn’t end here. During a recent press conference, the team at the Esports World Cup revealed that they’d love to expand their lineup further going forward and would especially appreciate hosting more women’s tournaments in Saudi Arabia.</p>







<h2 id="h-more-women-s-representation-in-riyadh">More Women’s Representation in Riyadh</h2>



<p>During a recent press conference, the Esports World Cup Foundation’s COO, Mike McCabe, and Chief Games Officer, Fabian Scheurmann, spoke about LGBTQ+ and women’s representation. In a straightforward statement, McCabe suggested outright what they want to see in the future:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Everybody is welcome. Everyone who competes at EWC is welcome to the Kingdom. What Saudi Arabia is trying to do to shift the culture is to support competitive play.</p>



<p>As for the tournaments we have, we would love to have more competitive tournaments for women in EWC.</p>



<p>What we need to do is work with publishers to build the circuits and pathways for those competitions to get onto the big stage. We hope that we have more and more women’s competitions in the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(<em>thanks to <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2026/01/esports-world-cup-more-womens-events-interview">Esports Insider</a> for the quote</em>)</p>



<p>In 2024, the CEO of the EWCF, Ralf Reichert, went on record saying that ‘everyone is welcome’ in Riyadh for the Esports World Cup.</p>



<p>He reiterated that statement when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-ralf-reichert-esports-world-cup/">Insider Gaming sat down with him</a> later that year:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Everyone is welcome at the Esports World Cup, and we’ve worked hard to create an inclusive environment where gaming fans from all over the world can congregate and share their passion.</p>



<p>It’s exactly the kind of celebratory atmosphere we wanted for such a massive event, and I encourage everyone who is interested in gaming and esports to make the trip, attend a tournament, enjoy one of the many concerts, check out the festival and take in the atmosphere. I believe people’s perception will change once they’ve experienced this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Women’s esports have been coming up in recent years, with some organizers standing up tournament circuits specifically for females and LGBTQ+ competitors. The likes of VALORANT’s Game Changers scene have blossomed immeasurably of late.</p>

Specifically, IGN can exclusively reveal that action man Jason Statham - star of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Hobbs and Shaw and The Meg - is coming to Fortnite today. He lent his chiselled jawline and voice to the game to promote his new movie Shelter as part of a new in-game experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Stath appears as his character from Shelter, Michael Mason. In the movie Mason is a former assassin who is forced to dust off his guns (aren't they always?) to protect himself and a girl - Jessie -  that he rescued from the sea surrounding the remote Scottish island he calls home. Players can fight alongside him on a new custom map inspired by the movie, taking on waves of enemies in order to protect Jessie. If that wasn't enough, a huge storm is on the way, which is actually pretty accurate for the Scottish highlands. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The custom map comes with some additional game features to heighten the roguelike experience the creators are going for, with a combination of permanent upgrades, random weapon loadouts and a 'Rebirth system' that will give you permanent buffs for resetting your progress. It's vital to mention that the weaponry is given out by a dog. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There'll also be a community tournament featuring top streamers that will let viewers vote on the specific conditions for the matches, like weapon restrictions or inverted controls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The experience was created by Sawhorse and Chartis Interactive, with contributions to the design of the map from Fortnite creators like Jayth, the guy behind Fortnite's Zombie Escape Tag. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s been exciting to combine the roguelike genre—one of Fortnite’s most popular modes—with a unique film like Shelter, especially with Jason Statham involved," he said. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Shelter experience is available in Fortnite now. <em>"Become the #shelter. survive the storm. play the official 'shelter' fortnite experience now! island code: 2883-8391-6703. see @jasonstatham in shelter. only in theaters january 30. get tickets now"</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Head of Editorial Development at IGN and an elder millennial. She's been a professional nerd since 2006 when she got her start on Official PlayStation Magazine in the UK, and has since worked for GamesIndustry.Biz, Rolling Stone and GamesRadar. She loves horror, horror movies, horror games, Red Dead Redemption 2, and her Love and Deepspace boyfriends. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-gets-a-new-roguelike-map-and-a-visit-from-jason-statham]]></content:encoded>

That’s across PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and Mac.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Pearl Abyss described going gold as a “major development milestone” for the open-world action-adventure game. It thanked fans for their continued support, acknowledging what it called “strong anticipation” that has built up over the course of the last year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb on Crimson Desert:</p><blockquote>Set in the vast continent of Pywel, Crimson Desert is an open-world action-adventure game that follows the journey of protagonist Kliff and his Greymane companions. The title has been praised for its realistic, high-fidelity graphics, dynamic combat, and the freedom and interactivity of its open world, delivering a heightened sense of immersion and intensity.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-deserts-open-world-is-at-least-twice-as-big-as-skyrims-and-larger-than-the-red-dead-redemption-2-map">Pearl Abyss called Crimson Desert’s open world “absolutely massive,”</a> bigger even than that of Bethesda’s Skyrim and Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on <a href="https://youtu.be/aEX6hjTSlOk?si=Ei_PQfEUiBEH5A6F" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the Gaming Interviews YouTube channel</u></a>, Pearl Abyss’ Will Powers said that describing the size of Crimson Desert’s world in terms of numbers doesn’t do it justice, because doing so fails to capture the scope and scale of the game. But he did go as far as to compare it to two of the biggest open world games around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think numbers really do it justice because, how big is that in terms of scope and scale?” he said. “But what we can say is that the world's at least twice as big as the open world, the playable area, of Skyrim.

            <p>2XKO is out properly on PC and consoles, bringing with it a slew of new features and Caitlyn as its 12th fighter. However, inquisitive players quickly found a fun easter egg tied to Caitlyn that significantly changes the character's appearance in game.</p>
<p>By holding down both special buttons during the loading screen before a match, players who have chosen Caitlyn as one of their two fighters will be able to remove the hat present on her default costume. With that, her iconic top hate is gone, replaced with absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>This is not the first time such an easter egg has been included in 2XKO. When the season 0 Arcane skins were added to the game last year, players discovered that very specific button combinations prior to a match could remove the mask from Ekko's Arcane skin, pull down Jinx's hood, or remove Vi's jacket.</p>

<p>This is a style of secret with a rich history in fighting games, with games including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-v">Street Fighter V</a> offering similar easter eggs on specific costumes. What's great about Caitlyn's secret costume alteration is that, unlike the Arcane skins, you don't need to spend a dime to use it yourself.</p><p>If you're curious about 2XKO and want to learn more about it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2xko-review">why not read Eurogamer's 2XKO review</a>! In it, the game is described as: "2XKO is a tag fighter like no other, with a bold aesthetic and superbly crafted core gameplay experience. Beloved <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> characters are revitalised in a new light in a truly stunning free-to-play experience."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>No matter whether it’s a book, movie or video game, there’s a special, deep-seated satisfaction to returning to a world that you know and love. Pandora is such a world. Home to the Na’vi, and bursting with neon flora and fauna, incredible creatures and the iconic floating islands, James Cameron’s fictional planet remains amongst the most vibrantly-realised sci-fi settings of the modern era. From the Ashes takes us back to this place, a new expansion for Ubisoft’s excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Frontiers of Pandora</a>, while tying in with Avatar: Fire and Ash, the brand-new cinematic outing for the franchise. It’s a return that’s well worth making.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes: LAUNCH TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xe30wUKlV8o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This time out, you play as So’lek, the Na’vi warrior who you fought alongside in the first game. Your original character is here as well – initially referred to as simply ‘The Sarentu’ – but So’lek makes for an interesting new central character that is brusque and thoughtful in equal measure. Set two weeks after the events of Avatar: Fire and Ash, you come face-to-face with the Mangkwan, the new Na’vi clan of brutal, vicious warriors who’ve aligned themselves with the RDA, here led by Major Bukowski, against the peace-loving groups we’ve come to know.</p>



<p>I held off working on the later portion of my review so that I could see the movie without ruining it, but I really didn’t have to. There’s nothing in From the Ashes that you can’t parse from watching one of the trailers for Fire and Ash, and the events here happen within their own pocket of Pandora, just as in the original game, the narrative fitting within and alongside that of Jake Sully and his extended family.</p>

<p>The world is on fire. The beauty of Pandora has been marred by flame, smoke and ash, and it makes for a striking point of difference from the main game. It still looks incredible, the beautiful landscapes punctuated by destruction making for an evocative and painful change to the setting, and it still stands as a huge technical achievement.</p>

<p>From The Ashes is also the perfect chance to check out the technical improvements that have been made to the game since its release. There’s the addition of both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/21/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-third-person-patch-is-coming-in-december/">a third-person mode and a 40fps graphical option on console</a>, for use with 120Hz supporting screens and TVs, which strikes a midpoint between the previous quality and performance settings. Both of these improvements serve to give players a greater variety of ways to experience both Frontiers of Pandora and its new expansion.</p>
<p>As someone who played across PC and PS5, the 40fps option definitely lifts the console experience, bringing an improved level of fidelity over the performance mode, while still giving players a smoother and more fluid feeling experience over 30fps play. It’s not quite perfect – there were definitely occasional hiccups here and there – but overall, I found it a major improvement, and it became my preferred way to play through From The Ashes.</p>

<p>The third-person view, however, isn’t as successful. Having played the game in first person, shifting to third person actively reduces one of the game’s greatest strengths: its visuals. You lose the immediacy, and the wider field of view when in third-person, and while it does serve to cement your place as a Na’vi, it’s not a strong enough payoff when compared to first person play. Still, having the option is ideal, and you can switch at any point if there are sections that you think would be easier or better from a particular viewpoint, just as the game already did when you hopped on your flying companion to get around.</p>
<p>All of the overt strengths of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora are here too, from the exceptional visuals to the enjoyable traversal and high-octane flight. From the Ashes is a bit less open-ended, though that affords for some tense and well-paced narrative moments. For all that, you can still wander off into the jungle and lose yourself to hunting and exploration for as long as you like. For returning players, though, it’s all going to be about the continuing story.</p>

<p>And that story is a real success. The tighter, more personal focus is arguably even better than the one from the main game. You begin exploring through areas that you previously experienced, marred by both the unstoppable power of Pandora’s flora and fauna, and the arrival of the Mangkwan, before settling into exploring and fighting your way through the smoking forest. It gives you more context and understanding of the new faction, and the villainous RDA, and frankly, it makes them even more imposing, with some great encounters and narrative moments across the DLC’s significant 20-hour runtime.</p>

			<p><strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> will launch its eleventh <strong>World of Warcraft</strong> expansion pack, <strong>World of Warcraft: Midnight</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-officially-launching-march-2-2026/">this coming <strong>March 2, 2026</strong></a>. To prepare for that expansion, the studio has pushed a <strong>pre-expansion update</strong> live, which will feature access to some of the features coming in Midnight ahead of its full release. </p>



<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/">housing was added in an earlier update last month</a>, this update introduces a couple of additions to housing, including <strong>Endeavours</strong>, a new optional neighbourhood activity for players to engage in to unlock more décor for the homes they're building and some extra housing experience points.</p>



<p>There's also a new class specialization in the <strong>Devourer Demon Hunter</strong>, a new mid-range caster specialization that uses the power of the Void to fight the Void's own champions that threaten Azeroth. You get all the mobility of Demon Hunters while also gaining a new Annihilator hero talent tree, shared between Vengeance and Devourer Demon Hunters.</p>

<p>The update also introduces an overhaul to the Transmorgification system, letting players change appearance to gear slots instead of individual items, so you can keep your transmogs even when swapping gear. You're also now able to establish set outfits, with every player starting with two free outfits, though you can purchase additional outfit slots with gold.</p>



<p>You can even set your outfit to change based on specific scenarios now with the new '<strong>Situations</strong>' system, if you want to have specific looks for dungeon running, exploration, or just chilling at home.</p>



<p>Beyond the housing updates and the new class specialization, the pre-expansion update also adds several key UI changes, with new 'Boss Warnings' and 'Damage Meter' changes. You can see the highlighted changes in the images below.</p>

<p>There are several more changes, tweaks, and, of course, bug fixes in the pre-expansion update as Blizzard prepares for the full weight of the Midnight expansion when it arrives this coming March. There's a full, expansive list of everything in <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24244455/midnight-pre-expansion-content-update-notes">a new blog post from Blizzard</a> that goes through all of the details.</p>



<p>So far, Midnight is looking like it'll be the biggest expansion in World of Warcraft's long history, a history that, for now, remains entirely PC-based, as it's one of the most popular games ever to not come to consoles. The last word on a potential console port from Blizzard was that <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-director-denies-console-rumors-wed-just-say-it/">if it was happening, the team "<em>would just say it</em>" was happening</a>. So, for now, take any rumours on an imminent console launch with a grain of salt. Once the team is working on bringing it to consoles, it'll let us know.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>“Hell is empty and all the devils are here.” That quote from Shakespeare’s <em>The Tempest</em> is how the debut trailer for hack-and-slash adventure game <em>Fallen</em> begins. It was accurate if you count among those devils <a href="https://kotaku.com/hooded-horse-gen-ai-art-ban-4x-strategy-steam-2000658179">the scourge of AI slop</a>. The trailer, an<em> IGN</em> exclusive, was flamed on social media for appearing to showcase gen AI work, and the developer of the game later confirmed it.</p> <p>The <em>Fallen</em> trailer <a href="https://x.com/IGN/status/2013061346544205904">appeared on X on Monday</a> where it immediately made a splash far beyond what you might have expected from its otherwise generic-looking, demon-slaying gameplay. “Introducing <em>Fallen</em>, a new Xbox 360-era inspired character action game where you play as Astra, a fallen angel who must battle through Hell and its demonic forces. It’s in development for console and PC,” read the marketing copy.</p>

 <p>But what stood out to people immediately was the now familiar whiff of slick but lifeless gen AI-produced art that was peppered throughout the trailer. “It looks nauseatingly bad, genAI isn’t just walking back gaming hardware, it’s trying to make the games themselves awful too,” <a href="https://x.com/kitty_bit_games/status/2013287905272148309">wrote</a> cosplayer Kitty Bit. “This is the most AI ass AI video game I ever did see lmao,” <a href="https://x.com/Ms5000Watts/status/2013103413656248810">wrote</a> Twitch streamer Ms5000watts. “<span dir="auto" role="text">Looks like a weird amalgamation of AI and jank,” read one of the top YouTube comments.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">They aren't even trying to hide it brah😭😭AI slop content is off the charts now <a href="https://t.co/uWFQdopCy8">https://t.co/uWFQdopCy8</a> <a href="https://t.co/b0B9Jnm8aq">pic.twitter.com/b0B9Jnm8aq</a></p> <p>— Oshbard (@Ludvicus) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ludvicus/status/2013329329246105904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Was this another example of people being paranoid about gen AI and jumping the gun with the accusations of slop? Nope! Superboo Studios founder, director, producer, and writer Brooke Burgess admitted as much after the backlash, but claimed the gameplay was real and in-engine UE5.4 work. Burgess blamed “context” collapse for the controversy.</p>

 <p>“What ended up being shared as an ‘official trailer’ was actually our early dev ‘tone pitch’, i.e., a work-in-progress UE5 teaser designed for funding discussions,” he <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallen-gen-ai-real-in-engine-ue54-work/">told <em>TheGamer</em></a>. “There are [AI-Generated] placeholders in there, specifically some 2D test assets used to explore mood and presentation (for example, how ‘lost souls’ and fallen angels in the game might react when spoken to and judged, along w/ WIP HUD elements). That material was never intended as final content, nor as a statement on how the shipped game would be made.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000661842" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661842"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661842">YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p>To go back to referencing Shakespeare for a moment, Burgess seems to be suggesting that “the fault, dear Brutus, is not in our ‘tone pitch AI placeholders,’ but in ourselves.” He makes it sound like <em>IGN</em> posted the wrong trailer, or jumped the gun. In actuality, Burgess has had <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAGjCTo9iLU/7_O1MHOJhcdacvds06knLg/edit">no qualms about using AI slop</a> to pitch the game to potential investors.</p> <p>In fact, he recently complained about just how hard it is to raise money for making a game right now. Burgess said every publisher he’s spoken to is asking how he’ll us AI to streamline development. He’s open to using it for QA and localization, but claims he’s not “waving the flag of AI by any stretch.” but claims he’s not “waving the flag of AI by any stretch.”</p>

 <p>“I’m not going to sell my soul and be like, ‘Yeah, I’ll do it by myself, let me prompt this whole game into existence,'” he recently told <em><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fallen-creator-brooke-burgess-on-the-struggle-to-get-game-funding-above-1-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GamesIndustry.Biz</a></em>. “No, I want to work with really talented people and make something cool. But if integrating it in a way that doesn’t affect creativity, but helps to save a little bit of money and gets the game out there to people, and gives us a chance to make something cool and memorable, and then make something else after that–it’s something I have to factor in.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finally-brings-back-two-classic-pieces-of-the-franchise-2000661833</link>
            <guid>1412047</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-series-season-two-reviews-prime-video-2000653876"><em>Fallout</em> season two</a>‘s latest episode provided one of the coolest reveals in the show’s run and was also a great moment for fans of “Pointing at the TV and going ‘Oh crap!'” in front of their friends and then getting to explain why they were so excited.</p> <p>But wait. Before we go any further, we’re about to completely spoil that cool moment (and only that moment) from season two, episode six of Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> show that brings back not one, but two classic elements from the old <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-76-easter-egg-pokes-fun-at-lore-inconsistencies-1830500018"><em>Fallout</em></a> games. So if you want to avoid that, this is the part where you turn around and never look back. Everyone else, keep scrolling.</p>

  <p>After being super-punched through a window at the end of the last episode and left for dead by Lucy, the Ghoul is saved from his spikey predicament by a large, strange-looking figure. That figure is revealed to be a Super Mutant. Yup, the <em>Fallout</em> show has finally brought these big ol’ bastards into the series, and I’m happy to see they aren’t the brutish-looking monsters so frequently depicted in Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> games. Instead, this Super Mutant looks and sounds a lot like the kind seen in the older <em>Fallout</em> CRPGs and<em> New Vegas.</em></p> <p>Technically, <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Super_mutant_(TV_series)?file=The_Target_-_Mutant_corpse.png">a dead Super Mutant appeared in season one in an Enclave base</a>, though we only saw its large green hand sticking out from underneath a sheet. But this is the first time we’ve seen a living Super Mutant in the show. That alone would be cool enough, but there’s more to this moment. The actor behind the Super Mutant makeup is Ron Perlman, a man who has a long history with the <em>Fallout</em> franchise.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">SUPER MUTANT have arrived in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fallout?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Fallout</a> and he wanted o join Ghoul in his kind <a href="https://t.co/30PD4PpZ0p">pic.twitter.com/30PD4PpZ0p</a></p> <p>— sanmeyo (@oyemnassxo) <a href="https://twitter.com/oyemnassxo/status/2013911587736916414?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The movie and TV actor has acted as a narrator in most of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-3-new-vegas-remake-remaster-mods-2000661284"><em>Fallout</em> games</a>, including the original ones back in the ’90s. He’s the guy who famously says, “War. War never changes,” at the start of so many <em>Fallout</em> adventures, and who also often provides a recap of your choices and their outcomes at the end. He also appears in <em>Fallout 4</em> as a TV newscaster you can hear in the background during the game’s intro.&nbsp; And now he’s here for the <em>Fallout</em> TV show, and I’m very happy about it.</p>

 <p>It’s good to have you back, Perlman. <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-ron-perlman-s3-intro-sandwhich-war-2000660136">Hopefully, you got paid more than $40 and a sandwich for this role.&nbsp;</a></p> <p>Perlman’s Super Mutant character, after saving the Ghoul, mentions that the ones to blame for all of this are the Enclave, a mysterious group of fascists that planned to take over the United States before the bombs fell. The group later claimed to be the inheritors of the United States’ power and authority after the world ended. And it seems they are going to play a big role in the final episodes of <em>Fallout</em> season two.</p>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-steam-how-to-buy-price/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Steam is the go-to for most PC gamers. It has almost every game in existence, but some are conspicuously absent, and questions have been asked about Arknights: Endfield. That query will be quashed with a definitive answer, and you’ll also get insight into the game’s price and where to buy it.</p>



<p>Whether you have a gaming laptop or a class PC rig with enough RGB to light up a dark basement, Steam is traditionally the place everyone goes to buy PC games. The odd game deviates from this model. Let’s check if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield</a> follows in the footsteps of other games—like Hytale—by not launching on Steam right away.</p>

<p><strong>For some reason, Arknights: Endfield is not available to purchase through Steam and needs to be bought via different means on PC.</strong></p>



<p>The closest thing you’ll find to Arknights: Endfield on Steam is the rudimentary-looking, fan-made ‘Ark: Release.’ You’ll find nothing about Endfield on Steam, nor any traces related to it.</p>



<p>If you want to buy Arknights: Endfield, you need to be whisked away elsewhere.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-buy-arknight-endfield-on-pc">How To Buy Arknight: Endfield On PC</h2>



<p><strong>You can download and buy Arknights: Endfield through the Windows App and the Epic Games Store on PC.</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has covered the purchase process extensively in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-preload-guide-file-sizes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield Pre-Download guide</a>. However, it really is as simple as going to the applicable storefronts, purchasing it, downloading the game’s launcher, and installing the game, ready to play.</p>



<p>It remains unclear if a Steam version will ever become available. If it does, this guide’s content will be updated to reflect the new information.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-arknights-endfield-price-explained">How Much Is Arknights: Endfield? Price Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Arknights: Endfield is a free-to-play action-adventure game, which means you can tie up those purse strings and keep your wallet shut, ready to splurge on future games.</strong></p>



<p>There might be some confusion over the game’s cost if you check out the PS5 store listing, for example. Make no mistake, Arknights: Endfield is F2P. But you can buy a special edition for $9.99 or £7.99, and it comes with the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Basic HH Permit ×5.</li>



<li>T-Creds ×50000.</li>



<li>Intermediate Combat Record ×10.</li>



<li>Arms Inspector ×10.</li>



<li>Fortifying Infusion ×10.</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a free-to-play title, but there’s a huge emphasis on its gacha elements and microtransactions. If you get sucked into Arknights: Endfield, it could be a worryingly expensive rabbit hole you get yourself stuck in.</p>



<p>For a game of this size and substance, it’s a good package. Although it’s totally understandable if you think this should be F2P. Let IG know your thoughts on the game, its price, and more through the free-to-join and ever-growing <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <p>The sixth episode of Fallout season two has just aired on Prime, and with it given viewers and fans a fun cameo to look out for.</p>

<p>Just a week or so on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-veteran-ron-perlman-says-he-was-paid-40-dollars-and-a-sandwich-for-his-voiceover-work-in-the-original-game">Ron Perlman's revelation that he was paid "$40 and a sandwich" for his first Fallout gig in the 90s</a> - which saw him narrating the RPG complete with his iconic "War. War never changes" line - the actor has now popped up in the TV series, decades later.</p>
<p>Perlman plays the part of a Fallout Super Mutant in the show, who liberates Walton Goggins' Ghoul from that pole he was impaled on at the end of last week's episode (I am still wincing from that scene).</p>
<p>In the show's Fallout, Perlman's Super Mutant again mentions "war", telling the Ghoul there is one coming, and so "we need you healthy". He then helps sort out that whopping great hole in the Ghoul's abdomen.</p>
<p>"They call us abominations, but they created our kind," Perlman's character tells the Ghoul as he heals. 'They', of course, refers to Fallout's nefarious Enclave, which seems to have its fingers in the Vault-Tec pie. "Ghouls, mutants, we're kin," Perlman's Super Mutant continues, "and we should unite against our common enemy."</p><p>Perlman's Super Mutant is putting together an army against the "people who set all this in motion", but what that could actually mean for the rest of Fallout season two remains to be seen, as no sooner than we get a glimpse of Perlman's mutilated face, he bops the Ghoul over the head to keep his location a secret. Hmmm, curious!</p>

<p>There are still two more episodes of Fallout season two left to go, and things are heating up in the wasteland. Along with returning faces like Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-goes-full-new-vegas-with-a-new-trailer-showing-a-deathclaw-the-kings-and-macaulay-culkin">Macaulay Culkin and Kumail Nanjiani have also joined the show for season two</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, filming for the third season of Fallout <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">is expected to begin this May</a>. Don't expect to see a similar Perlman cameo from Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a>, though. "They've offered me a whole bunch, even in season one," Howard said last month, explaining he was "going to be in the sort of Dr. Strangelove Vault-Tec room, where they're talking [about] all the experiments, and some other things."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>However, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallouts-todd-howard-has-no-interest-in-becoming-bethesdas-version-of-marvel-cameo-king-stan-lee">studio head thinks he is best placed "behind the camera" rather than in front of it</a>.</p>

            <p>Much has been written over the years on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-ii">Dark Souls 2</a>'s quality and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/souls-week-dark-souls-2-is-the-best-dark-souls-game-that-isnt-dark-souls-or-dark-souls-3">whether it reached the heights of its relatives</a>. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter, as the sequel has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/335300/charts/#max">consistently attracted players over the years</a> and with two different versions of the same gruelling action-RPG adventure.</p>
<p>Those who really enjoyed FromSoftware's Miyazaki-less entry have also tried to celebrate it with yearly 'Return to Drangleic' community events, and now we know when 2026's is going to happen thanks to Reddit's most active Dark Souls communities.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/1qgmvjq/return_to_drangleic_2026/">r/darksouls</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/1q6ueqo/return_to_drangleic_2026/">r/DarkSouls2</a>, different users started to promote the two weeks-ish period starting on 26th February and ending on 13th March. Some say it's starting a day later, but it's all agreed upon otherwise. Chances are the servers across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC will be seeing an uptick before then, as the game has never gone inactive. Still, you should expect to see more jolly cooperation (and heinous invasions) happening around that time.</p>
<p>As explained by the vets on the relevant subreddits, the 'Return to Drangleic' events are the perfect opportunities for newcomers to jump in too, as getting through Dark Souls 2's worst areas is far easier with seasoned adventurers by your side. The second instalment is often described as the trilogy's most brutal and unforgiving, with enemy placement being troll-y at times and key mechanics like its take on humanity and max HP being a bit annoying. Most players agree it's the entry with the most interesting approach to covenants and PvP on the other hand.</p><p>As a reminder, the original PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of Dark Souls 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-2-ps3-xbox-360-servers-to-shut-down">went offline a few years ago</a>, so you'll need to own the Scholar of the First Sin edition to join the fun; same story on PC. We know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-video-games-2026-releases#section-2">February</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-video-games-2026-releases#section-3">March</a> are looking stacked when it comes to all-new game releases, but it's never a bad time to mess around in the Dark Souls games.</p>
<p>By the way, 2026 will mark <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>'s 10th anniversary, and the rumour mill has been saying for a while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dark-souls-3-remaster-is-in-development-its-claimed/">a remaster could be happening</a> to celebrate the occasion. The ride never ends.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-fire-tv-soundbar-plus-is-already-getting-its-second-price-cut-this-year-hitting-another-record-low-2000661451</link>
            <guid>1412005</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most modern TVs deliver impressive visuals, but the built-in sound quality usually doesn’t keep up. Not being able to hear the dialogue and music properly can be frustrating, but you don’t have to put up with that.</p>
<p>This is where a dedicated soundbar can help, and today is an excellent time to invest in one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">Amazon just knocked a solid 30% off the latest Fire TV Soundbar Plus, bringing its price down to $175</a>. You’re saving a nice $75 on a solution that’s going to make your favorite TV shows and movies a lot more enjoyable by delivering an immersive experience. Just note that deals this good don’t tend to stick around. It’s worth acting sooner rather than later to grab it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Superior Sound</h2>
<p>This minimal soundbar features an elegant, no-fuss design. You can place it on your console or mount it on the wall for an even cleaner setup; whichever you prefer. Sound-wise, it covers more than just the basics. There are three full-range speakers, three tweeters, and two woofers, all of which come together to push sound in every direction, instead of just blasting it from the front. Clear audio with deep bass surrounds you from all sides with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support, making it feel like you’re right in the middle of the action.</p>
<p>Dialogs get better, too. That’s thanks to the dedicated center dialogue channel that sharpens conversations to help you catch every mumble and whisper. You won’t have to constantly rewind to hear what was said or rely on subtitles to understand the context. Basically, whether you’re watching something action-packed or winding down with a slow, romantic Korean show, you’ll enjoy each sound and every tune just how the creator intended. This 3D setup is also great for watch parties at home, as it ensures everyone enjoys clear, immersive sound no matter where they’re seated in the room.</p>



<p>You can also choose between multiple sound modes, which automatically optimize audio based on what you’re watching. These include Movie, Music, Sports, and Night modes. For instance, the movie mode offers better dialog clarity, while the music mode pumps up the bass. The night mode, on the other hand, reduces the overall volume so you don’t wake the rest of the house. What’s more, the soundbar can double as a speaker, as it lets you wirelessly connect devices like your smartphone and tablet via Bluetooth easily. Use it to catch up on the latest episode of your favorite podcast, or vibe to some music while finishing up chores around the house!</p>
<p>Getting started is straightforward. All you need to do is connect the included HDMI cable to your TV’s HDMI eARC/ARC port. Once the TV recognizes the soundbar, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup process. Compatibility-wise, the soundbar plays nicely with a range of smart TVs and TVs connected to streaming media players. You can also control it using the same remote you already use for your TV.</p>
<p>Everything considered, it’s a great option to invest in if you want to enjoy better sound for all your content. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">It’s now down to $175 after a 30% discount, but the offer won’t be around for long. It’s best to grab it fast to avoid paying the full price later.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Arknights: Endfield Have Multiplayer? Co-op & Multiplayer, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-arknights-endfield-have-multiplayer-co-op-multiplayer-explained/</link>
            <guid>1411999</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re looking for a new gacha-RPG, then Arknights: Enfield might be for you. But we all know gaming is better with friends, so there’s one question on everyone’s mind—does <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-preload-guide-file-sizes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield</a> have multiplayer?</p>



<p>The game will expand the Arknights universe, which was founded with the original Arknights back in May 2019. Instead of the former tower-defence gameplay, you can expect a fusion between combat and factory-building. </p>







<p>If that’s enough to get you to jump into Arknights: Endfield, then Insider Gaming can let you know whether you can expect multiplayer or co-op during your time on Talos-II.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-arknights-endfield-have-multiplayer">Does Arknights: Endfield Have Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One of the many characters. Image by Hypergryph.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Arknights: Endfield does feature multiplayer features, but not in the traditional sense. </strong></p>



<p>You won’t find yourself stumbling across other players in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-platforms-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield</a>, as it’s primarily a single-player experience. However, there are some nifty multiplayer features that you can engage in with your friends, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Visiting a friend’s reception room</li>



<li>Seeing someone’s team composition</li>



<li>Sharing Blueprints and Facilities</li>



<li>Helping friends with their OMV Dijiang</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-does-arknights-endfield-have-co-op">Does Arknights: Endfield Have Co-op?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Arknights: Endfield does not have co-op, but there is a chance it could be added at a later date.</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, you’ll have to stick it out alone in Arknights: Endfield, as there won’t be any co-op at launch. That means you won’t be able to join a friend’s world, but there’s a chance that could change in the future.</p>







<p>Most games of a similar genre tend to have some form of co-op, such as Genshin Impact. Considering over 35 million people have signed up to play, it’d be a real missed opportunity if Hypergryph don’t add co-op in the future. As things stand, though, it remains a pipe dream.</p>

<p>The release of Crimson Desert is coming fast. On Wednesday morning, developer Pearl Abyss announced that the game has officially gone gold.</p>



<p>The “gone gold” announcement comes nearly two months before the game’s planned March 19 release date. </p>







<p><strong>“We’re thrilled to announce that Crimson Desert has gone gold,”</strong> they said on <a href="https://x.com/crimsondesert_/status/2013974920120987867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>. <strong>“On behalf of the team at Pearl Abyss, thank you to our fans around the world for your support and for reaching this milestone with us. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“Stay tuned for more news, and see you in Pywel on March 19!” </strong></p>



<p>With the game going gold, that means, apart from something catastrophic, the game will hit its planned release date. Crimson Desert will be available for $69.99. A Deluxe Edition is also available for $79.99. The Deluxe Edition of the game comes with a Kairos Plate Set, a Balgran Shield, and Exclaire Horse Tack Set. </p>







<p>When it launches in March, Crimson Desert will be available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. </p>
