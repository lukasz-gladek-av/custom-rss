<figure><a title="Miyamoto - Super Nintendo World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ca4def15ef96e/miyamoto-super-nintendo-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>During Nintendo's latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">shareholder Q&amp;A meeting</a>, Shigeru Miyamoto stressed the importance for developers to "work for the consumer, not your boss", ensuring that teams can produce games that will satisfy players.</p>
<p>Afterwards, ex-Nintendo developer Takaya Imamura added his own two cents to the conversation and stated that Miyamoto has always viewed games as "products", not "works of art", and believes that his background studying industrial art helped shaped this viewpoint (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/shigeru-miyamotos-background-in-industrial-design-explains-his-pragmatic-product-not-art-approach-to-making-games-nintendo-veteran-says/">Automaton</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Mr. Miyamoto studied industrial design at an art university, and he views games as ‘products,’ not ‘works of art.’ I think this perspective is what leads to game development that’s more aligned with the user.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it's not clear from the quote, Imamura doesn't believe Miyamoto's view of games to be a negative one. Instead, it helps to ensure that game development is done in service of the player, ensuring that the final product is one of exceptional high quality.</p>
<p>The discussion over whether game development can be viewed as an art form has been ongoing for many years, and we believe that yes, it absolutely <em>is</em> an art form. But it's one that customers are ultimately paying good money to experience, and we don't necessarily believe it's wrong, therefore, to also view them as products.</p>
<p>Hey, if it helps make sure they're consistently great, then we're all for it.</p>

We’re incredibly sorry that this happened and we want to acknowledge that this should have been handled better. We’ve changed our internal processes as a result of this and will be better in the future."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Funcom noted that it will be working to "reimburse vehicles and items (to the best of our ability) to players who were impacted by this," and that those affected can find reimbursed items in the in-game "Claim Rewards" tab by the end of the week.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also outlined some of its other goals for future updates, which includes removing "all identified exploits (third party cheat engines, client hacks, or in-game exploitation of game mechanics)," as well as adding in more quality of life features, and fixing numerous ongoing gameplay issues. It also noted how it's fixed things like account/permission spoofing, vehicle ownership takeover, durability repair, and building dismantle item duplication.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who have been affected by item and vehicle loss due to bugs, as opposed to the recent update, Funcom asked for your patience as it currently has a long backlog of customer support requests. It's aiming to deal with these as quickly as it can, including for closed tickets from players who weren't reimbursed properly when the developer wasn't able to around launch. Funcom also said the game has an entire team dedicated to mitigating vehicle and item loss on server crashes, disconnects, server mesh transfers, and travelling between maps.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're curious about trying the game out for yourself despite its teething issues, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dune-awakening-review/1900-6418381/" data-ref-id="1900-6418381">Dune Awakening review</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> team has released a new patch, with those who are part of the Steam Beta getting first dibs.</p>
<p>This patch, known as update 1.2, addresses a number of fixes for areas such as quests, gameplay, and performance. It also adds the ability to customise your difficulty settings even further than before.</p>
<p>"Players can now select from Novice, Apprentice, Adept, Journeyman, Expert, and Master options in the Gameplay menu," the Oblivion Remastered team explained. "We hope the Journeyman setting, specifically, will act as a better bridge between Adept and Expert for players."</p>

<p>In addition to these changes, Oblivion Remastered players who are part of the Steam Beta will also see that map markers should no longer disappear, while those NPCs that started floating about after being knocked down during the Priory of the Nine quest should have stopped doing that now. They really weren't meant to.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, helmets should no longer clip into the player character's head, and Snak gra-Bura should no longer be missing those all important facial animations.</p>
<p>Bethesda and co have also addressed a sizable number of other fixes and changes as well as the above. You can check out the <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1942948713220932042">full patch notes for The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered update 1.2 here</a>.</p>

<p>Like I have said, the above update will be in the game's Steam Beta. The Oblivion team has laid out how to be a part of the Beta, which you can see below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your Steam Library and navigate to The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</li>
<li>Right click on "The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered" and select "Properties"</li>
<li>In the new properties pop-up window, select "Betas"</li>
<li>In the beta drop down to opt into, select "[beta]"</li>
<li>Wait for app to download new build and launch</li>
</ol>

			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/09/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-july-cyberpunk-2077-abiotic-factor-banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-and-more/">announced</a> the games added to the PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium game catalogs for July 2025, with Cyberpunk 2077 being the big title for the month, alongside Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, Risk of Rain 2, New World: Aeternum and more. </p>



<p>If you're a PlayStation Plus Premium subscriber, then you'll have nine new games to dive into beginning July 15, which is when all of this month's games, save for one, will be available. Abiotic Factor is the one title you'll have to wait for, since it is launching into the service on July 22, 2025. </p>



<p>PlayStation Plus Extra subscribers will only be missing out on the two Classic Catalog games, which are Twisted Metal 3 and Twisted Metal 4, just in time for the new season of the Twisted Metal TV show, which premieres on July 31, 2025.</p>

<div><p>Cyberpunk 2077, however, is available right now for PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, though it's just the standard version of the game and does not include the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">Phantom Liberty expansion</a>. That you'll still have to purchase separately, but at least it's available at a 30% discount for PlayStation Plus subscribers until July 23. </p><p>Here's the full list of games being added to the PS Plus Extra and Premium game catalogs for July 2025:</p></div>



<ul>
<li>Cyberpunk 2077 (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden (PS5)</li>



<li>Planet Zoo (PS5)</li>



<li>Abiotic Factor (PS5)</li>



<li>Bluey: The Videogame (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Risk of Rain 2 (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Tropico 6 (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>New World: Aeternum (PS5)</li>



<li>Twisted Metal 3 (PS5, PS4) - <strong>PS Plus Premium subscribers only</strong></li>



<li>Twisted Metal 4 (PS5, PS4) - <strong>PS Plus Premium subscribers only</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>PlayStation Plus is celebrating its 15-year anniversary this month, which partly explains why bigger titles like Cyberpunk 2077 are part of the catalog additions for PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, and why all PS Plus subscribers got <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-celebrates-ps-plus-15-year-anniversary-reveals-july-2025-ps-plus-essential-games-including-diablo-iv-and-jusant/">Diablo IV earlier this month</a> as part of the three free games for Essential-tier subscribers.</p>



<p>According to PlayStation, there's still more to come as part of the anniversary celebrations. Hopefully we'll get to see what else there is soon. Perhaps a few more games for subscribers, as a cherry on top for the occasion? We'll see.</p>

            <p>The second of two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> updates Bethesda told us all they had up their buggy sleeves arrives in Steam Beta later today, July 9th. This one's update 1.2, and it's headlined by the sorts of performance improvements folks have been begging for, plus some difficulty setting tweaks.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, The Elder Scrolls 4.something's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-has-two-bug-fixing-updates-coming-sudden-glitchy-vampire-baldness">last update</a> did many things, but by fair the most noteworthy was stopping a vampire from succumbing to the urge all men get. That being the urge to become bald so you can save like £10 a year by no longer buying shampoo.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Taking a gander at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2623190/view/536603447519088660?l=english">patch notes</a> for update 1.2, which you can check out in full via the Tweet embedded below, Bethesda's kicked off by outlining how it's switched up the settings that control how hard you get Mehrunes Donkgoned by enemies and how much damage you inflict by donking them back.</p>
<p>"Players can now select from Novice, Apprentice, Adept, Journeyman, Expert, and Master options in the Gameplay menu," they wrote. "We hope the Journeyman setting, specifically, will act as a better bridge between Adept and Expert for players." I personally preferred yanking the slider on a bar that provides next to no info as to what exact difficulty you're at, but hopefully this helps folks out.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Beyond that, here are the much-requested tweaks the update makes to Oblivion Remastered's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-settings-pc-performance">not always so hot performance</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed frame rate drop in Deepscorn Hollow</li>
<li>Fixed frame rate drops in Black Rock Caverns</li>
<li>Fixed frame rate drop between Skingrad and Skingrad Castle</li>
<li>Fixed frame rate drop south of Bravil Castle courtyard</li>
<li>Reduced the frequency of hitches in the open world.</li>
<li>General improvements to frame time in many locations.</li>
<li>Optimise updating of character attachments.</li>
<li>Optimise rendering of water volumes in the open world.</li>
<li>Optimise light/shadow updates in several lairs.</li>
<li>Optimise waterfall particle FX and rendering.</li>
<li>Optimise the weather system.</li>
<li>Optimise character animation system.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, hopefully all of that means you get more of the fun jank, and less of the jank that is the equivalent of a stranger taking a big poo on your living room carpet. Unless, of course that is your definition of fun. To each their own.</p>
<p>The update's out via Steam Beta first, with a full release on PC and those other platforms to follow at some point down the line.</p>

            <p>Back in June, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests of alleged undocumented migrants in Los Angeles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2025_Los_Angeles_protests">provoked a wave of protests</a>. The Trump administration attempted to make hay from the situation, dispatching federal military troops to the city in a show of toughness, against the objections of California's own governor. Despite this cynical cultivation of a pressure-cooker atmosphere, the majority of protesters were peaceful, albeit justifiably loud and angry at having their neighbours seized and imprisoned by random thugs at the behest of a dime store Palpatine.</p> <!--more-->
<p>I was in Los Angeles at the time covering Summer Game Fest, and saw a few of the protest marches up close while walking across the city. Aftermath has <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-los-angeles-protests-ice-immigration-police">a good, longer report</a> on the unearthliness and angst of attending a game expo right in the middle of such events, including comments from other journalists and developers.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles protests and the Trump administration's wider policies on immigration have provoked additional demonstrations across the USA. They've also inspired an Itch.io charity bundle, <a href="https://itch.io/b/3110/no-ice-in-california">"No ICE in California"</a>, which spans 560 video games, physical games, game asset packs and other items from 268 developers for $10. Hosted by jesthehuman, the bundle has raised $26,712.19 as of the time of writing, with proceeds going to the <a href="https://www.immdef.org/">Immigrant Defenders Law Center</a>, a Los Angeles law firm who specialise in defending immigrant communities, and <a href="https://raicestexas.org/about">RAÍCES</a>, a Texas-based immigrant advocacy and support organisation.</p>
<p>As is RPS tradition, I've picked out a few bundle highlights. <a href="https://linker.itch.io/eleflipside">Elephantasy Flipside</a> (pictured) is a glorious isometric single-screen puzzler, the kind of thing I'd have had kittens over if I'd found it on a MacWorld shareware disc, back in the 90s. <a href="https://knifedemon.itch.io/brush-burial">Brush Burial</a> is a crushed and grimy immersive sim in which you are a knife-wielding cockroach. <a href="https://shiftbacktick.itch.io/periphery-synthetic-ep">Periphery Synthetic EP</a> is a set of reactive, musical solar systems that can apparently be explored using echolocation and terrain sonification, if you're too cool for screens. And <a href="https://devonwiersma.itch.io/centauri-dark">Centauri Dark</a> is a gut-emptying rainbow of a bullet hell FPS.</p>
<p>Got highlights of your own? Please share. Beware that if you've bought other Itch.io charity bundles, you may own some of these games already.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-charity-game-bundle-raises-funds-to-defend-us-immigrants-against-ice]]></content:encoded>

Developer Funcom recently nerfed the endgame area’s PVP potential, turning almost half of it into PVE-only territory. That has unintentionally now resulted in the land covered in a bunch of giant boxes. Here’s why. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197525" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="142" data-playlist="197525,196790,196345" data-current="197525"><div><p>Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23056.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em>, which has continued attracting lots of players on PC despite <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-survival-mmo-funcom-advanced-access-1851783808&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-survival-mmo-funcom-advanced-access-1851783808">a minor fall-off from its peak at launch</a></span>, is a survival crafting game. The natural progression system is harvesting stuff to build stuff to harvest more stuff to build bigger stuff. Eventually, that requires players to venture out into the largely PVP-centric Deep Desert in order to access the rarest Tier 6 materials. Early on, that meant getting preyed upon by roving bands of veterans who could easily outgun their weaker opponents (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-ornithopters-reddit-1851784501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-ornithopters-reddit-1851784501">or drop entire ships on them</a></span>). </p><p>So Funcom did the sensible thing and made the PVP <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-0-5-patch-notes/#11017&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-0-5-patch-notes/#11017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">section of the map smaller</a></span> with further plans to iterate on PVP mechanics and make it feel more engaging and fair. The studio also greatly increased the number of T6 resource nodes available in PVE areas. That patch went live <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1ltph12/11150_patch_notes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1ltph12/11150_patch_notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">earlier this week</a></span>. The Deep Desert also wipes every week, deleting all players structures to keep things fresh and interesting.

Some fans have suggested making resource nodes no-build zones, while others wonder if there is a way to simply have the resources spawn outside of the structure. Others have called for the spawn points to be randomized each wipe, giving non-griefers a fighting chance to get some resources before the dust settles. Then there are those who think resources like  Titanium and Stravidium should just spawn back in Hagga Basin, <em>Dune: Awakening</em>’s newb-friendly starting area. </p><p>In the meantime, PVE and PVP players are facing another stalemate in the Deep Desert and even some griefers are getting bored. “We found and downed another guy, landed by him and he tells us that it was his 4th lost Thopter today, he didn’t know how to pocket or something,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lv7tve/today_i_did_some_ethical_griefing_to_find_out/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lv7tve/today_i_did_some_ethical_griefing_to_find_out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> a PVP raider on the subreddit. “We gave him a ride back, gave him more melange than his small refinery could dream of making in a day’s worth of grinding and our old mk5 assault. After that, we realised that we aren’t built for Funcom’s creative vision of the endgame.” </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-t6-resource-node-base-patch-notes-1851785897]]></content:encoded>

                <p>GSC Game World has announced that Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl will be coming to PS5, ending its console exclusivity on Xbox. An release date has not been announced, but it will be out in late 2025, and you can <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014084" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist</a> it now.</p><p dir="ltr">In a rather meta announcement trailer, rendered in-engine, soldiers are shown huddled around the colonel, who has his feet up while playing what appears to be Stalker 2 on the TV with a controller.

It will also include "technical enhancements" for the PS5 Pro, although there are no further details.</p><p dir="ltr">While we await more information and its release date, you can watch our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-gamespots-stalker-2-documentary-about-how-russian-war-impacted-the-studio/1100-6529929/" data-ref-id="1100-6529929">Stalker 2 documentary</a> about how developers were affected first-hand by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p dir="ltr">Stalker 2 launched last November as an Xbox console exclusive, although leaked documents alleged that it was only going to be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reportedly-only-has-three-month-exclusivity-on-stalker-2/1100-6490905/">timed exclusive for three months</a>. The longer wait could be related to the buggy state that the game launched in, with issues plaguing the post-apocalyptic shooter following a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-gets-day-one-patch-improvements-but-problems-remain-across-pc-and-xbox/1100-6527951/">day-one patch</a>, while its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2s-first-major-patch-has-more-than-1800-bug-fixes/1100-6528561/">first major patch</a> fixed more than 1,800 bugs.</p><p>This follows other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-confirms-four-first-party-games-are-coming-to-playstation-and-nintendo-switch/1100-6521128/">first-party Xbox exclusives making the leap to other platforms</a>, when early last year Microsoft's Phil Spencer confirmed four first-party Xbox titles would be coming to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch. This has continued in 2025 with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launches-in-april-on-ps5/1100-6530308/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> following its original launch last December, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-coming-this-august-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc/1100-6531314/">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> will release day-and-date on Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC in August.</p>

The PC-only shooter released in early April but never seemed to find an audience, having only reached a concurrent player peak of 4,479 shortly after launch, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1691340/charts/#1m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>.

"We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear and we genuinely share in your disappointment."</p><p dir="ltr">However, players have the next 90 days to still play the game, during which Wargaming will unlock all of the game's unique Hunters (including new Hunters that were presumably still in development), as well as introduce the ability to host custom games. A final "farewell" tournament is also being planned, with Wargaming stating it will share more details in the game's official Discord server soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Steel Hunters sees players pilot massive mechs called Hunters. Some mechs are humanoid in appearance, while others are massive mechanical animals reminiscent of the mechs from the anime series Zoids. Each mech can be customized and modified with various weapons, mods, and abilities. The game was an extraction shooter, one where players would drop in, acquire loot from battling NPC enemies, and attempt to escape, all the while avoiding or battling other player-controlled Hunter squads.</p><p dir="ltr">"From the very first days of the Alpha you've shaped Steel Hunters with your energy, creativity, and dedication, and we're honored to have had you on this journey," Wargaming's shutdown notice reads. "We couldn't have wished for a better community and we'll miss you all dearly."</p><p dir="ltr">Wargaming may be shutting down Steel Hunters, but it still operates several live-service titles. One of those games is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-tanks/" data-ref-id="5000-69356">World of Tanks</a>, which recently announced it is introducing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/these-two-90s-gaming-icons-are-coming-to-world-of-tanks/1100-6533014/" data-ref-id="1100-6533014">tank versions of two '90s gaming icons</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Steel Hunters isn't the first live-service game to be gone too soon, and it likely won't be the last.

<figure><a title="Popplio" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3c2867edeea91/popplio.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's not every day that you get to meet The Pope, but one Pokémon fan decided to make the most of his recent trip to The Vatican on 5th July.</p>
<p>Reddit user ReptileCake took two Pokémon cards with him when meeting Pope Leo (real name Robert Francis Prevost): one to get blessed, and one to get signed. But why? Why Pokémon cards, specifically? Well, the Pokémon in question is Popplio!</p>
<p>Get it..? Popplio. Pope Leo. Guffaw!</p>
<p>In speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fan-meets-pope-leo-gets-him-to-sign-a-popplio-pokemon-trading-card-and-it-looks-like-the-pontiff-got-the-joke?utm_source=campaigner&amp;utm_campaign=NL_FIX_July_08_2025&amp;cmp=1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;Ictg=45858995214">IGN</a>, ReptileCake said that Pope Leo took the whole thing in his stride and clearly understood the reference, happily signing the card in question:</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fkzywlv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It was pretty chill. We were herded through security and then seated, then the pope arrived nonchalantly, gave a great speech about hope, and then invited everyone up for a meet and greet [for] people to get some items blessed or give gifts.</p>
<p>"I went up, gave him a Reverse Holo Popplio and then asked him to sign a copy for me, in which he complied with a laugh. He felt really nice to be around."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the card immediately gaining a significant amount of worth, ReptileCake says that he has no intention of selling it on, stating that Pope Leo agreeing to sign the card is "worth more than any monetary value can satisfy", and that it is now "a personal artefact that I will cherish for eternity".</p>

<p>So there you have it! Quite a wholesome little incident, all told. Though we imagine this will kickstart a rather concerning trend in which fans flock to the Vatican to get their own Pokémon cards signed.</p>
<p>It's a whole new ball game for scalpers, huh?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Circana executive director and analyst Mat Piscatella has published the sales charts for US video game sales in May 2025, showing a similarity to <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">Newzoo's global report</a> in that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> was one of the month's best-selling games, and in the US specifically, it was the best-selling game. </p>



<p>Elden Ring: Nightreign topped the US sales charts for premium games across all platforms, followed by DOOM: The Dark Ages in second place and Forza Horizon 5 in third, driven by Forza Horizon 5's launch on PS5. Bethesda's Oblivion Remastered was pushed into fourth place after being the top-selling game in the US for April 2025,  while Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 stayed at fifth place. </p>



<p>The other notable entry in the top 20 best-selling premium games for May 2025 in the US, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/">Star Wars: Battlefront 2</a>, which jumped all the way from 135th on the monthly charts, to the number 12 spot, just behind Assassin's Creed Shadows in 11 and just in front of Split Fiction at number 13.</p>







<p>Elden Ring: Nightreign's surge to the top spot for May 2025 also made it one of the best-selling games in the US for 2025 so far, though it wasn't enough for it to crack the top 10, since it only made the list at number 11. DOOM: The Dark Ages was even further behind at number 16. The most significant change in the top-selling games in the US in 2025 so far was The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered jumping ahead of Assassin's Creed Shadows to take second place, while Shadows now sits in third. Monster Hunter Wilds is still the best-selling game of 2025 so far in the US.</p>



<p>On the hardware side of things, the PlayStation 5 was still the best-selling hardware of the month, though spending on video game hardware was down 13% compared to May 2024. It'll be interesting to see how different those numbers are when the report for June 2025 is live, and we see how much of an impact the Nintendo Switch 2 launch had on hardware spending in the US.</p>



<p>Overall, it was a month of growth for the video game industry in the US compared to May 2024, with spending on video games up 1% compared to last year. Which is a good sign for the industry, though we'll see if that growth is able to last into next year, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">Piscatella recently warned that tariffs and rising costs of essential items</a> are leading a significant portion of US consumers to spend less on video games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The video games industry is facing a "fundamental realignment", having effectively moved on from the "content" past to a "network" present that has deeply changed the forces that kept the whole industry together, according to Square Enix former Director of Business.</p>



<p>In a lengthy thread posted on <a href="https://x.com/JNavok">X</a>, Jacob Navok, who, as Director of Business, worked closely with Square Enix's CEO in the past, offered a very interesting in-depth analysis of the current state of the video games industry, highlighting the now mature shift from a content phase to a network phase and how this could evolve further in the future. For years, the vast majority of bigger publishers like Square Enix focused on producing content, which was the focus of the business. In 2004, however, something started to change, as former Square Enix CEO Yoichi Wada began writing about the network in his annual letters to shareholders, highlighting how that was the future, rather than content. Many believed he was referring to MMOs, but as time passed, it became clear he was referring to what is dominating the video games industry: the "social networks" of games, or rather platforms via which players access games.</p>



<p>For a very long time, the industry was defined by scarcity of content. Players would complete a game and move onto the next, and this held true even as the industry started moving towards richer mediums and MMOs. Creating good content and marketing the content appropriately would lead to profitable income. This is why release dates were set in the Fall towards the Holiday season, generally avoiding launching on the same date as other big hitters. A portion of the industry still works this way, but it is crumbling. Speaking about the Final Fantasy series, the former Square Enix employee highlights that the problem isn't increasing costs, but the inability to generate the revenue needed. The audiences expected to play the game did not come, and were not willing to pay to spend their time.</p>



<p>What players, especially the younger generation, are willing to spend their time on nowadays are platform titles like Roblox and Fortnite, and a few other dominant forever games which are acting closer to platforms. Add in a social network like TikTok, which scratches the same itches of casual games, and it's evident how players have less and less time to spend on traditional games, which continue to function as content and no longer enjoy the success of the past. Even in the network era of the video games industry, however, not every forever game that also acts as a platform can succeed, as few games can achieve the same level of success of Fortnite, a situation that mirrors social networks well, as only TikTok, has grown to a prominence that can rival Facebook and Instagram.</p>



<p>This doesn't mean that video games are going away, Jacob Navok continues, but it's a clear indication of how the video games industry has to change in its fight for time against social networks and platform, forever games. This is the problem Microsoft is facing today, and a situation that has changed a lot since the acquisition of Activision Blizzard and greenlighting the games that were canceled last week, like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark</a> reboot. Concord is a clear example of an industry that has radically changed in the past few years, as a $400m investement and eight years of work with zero revenue generated would have never happened in the past, alongside some of the June 2025 happenings, which the former Square Enix Director of Business thinks to have been a critical month for the industry. Nearly $1bn has been invested by the video games industry in games like MindsEye, Splitgate 2, Marathon and FBC: Firebreak, and none of the launches and betas have gone as planned. Promises have been made to fix the games, but it's unlikely the market can sustain all of them. One may argue that cutting costs could improve the situation, but that doesn't address the real issue: the lack of players.</p>



<p>With the traditional video games industry facing these challenges, Microsoft's recent actions are better explained. AI is a one-in-a-generation change in the entire digital order, and a dollar spent on AI may net back one hundred times as much, while a dollar invested in Xbox would either get burned or earn too little. With the market being what it is today, the decision to cancel games like the Perfect Dark reboot makes total sense, as it was very unlikely these would have take players away from dominating games.</p>



<p>This is something that Sony is also facing, to an extent. as Roblox, UEFN will continue to stay and represent the future of the video games industry. Jacob Navok makes the example of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which barely sold more than Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 did in just three days. As things stand, a dollar spent on a game like this is better spent on trying to make a Fortnite, which is what Sony will keep trying to. The Japanese company needs a forever platform, or it will still be a company in the content business during the network business era. Nintendo may manage to continue being a content business company, but Sony may not.</p>



<p>AI is also going to play a prominent role in this new era of the video games industry, empowering Roblox-like experiences that will give players the ability to create interactive worlds in five to ten years. In this sense, Take-Two, which has shown no concerns for the cost required to make Grand Theft Auto VI, seeing it as a function to achieve a dominant position in the current landscape, Epic and Roblox will compete with OpenAI, xAI and so on, as big tech companies are already making interactive world models that will compete with games. "<em>Games, AI, and tech are really part of the same network effect. Metcalfe’s law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users. In other words, the platforms with the most creators and players generate the most value,"</em> the former Square Enix Director of Business concluded, highlighting how Wada-san's observation on networks transforming the video games industry was ultimately about the network of players.</p>



<p>Although this isn't the first time we have heard from people who work, or worked in the video games industry how one of the current challenges is to convince players to spend time on new games, the analysis by Square Enix's former Director of Business has painted a more complex picture that highlights well how traditional games will have a harder time finding success in the future. The industry, however, is unpredictable, so it will be very interesting to see if these predictions will end up being correct in the coming years.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/may-gaming-sales-data-puts-elden-ring-nightreign-on-top.1239381/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sales analysis firm Circana has released its gaming industry sales data for May 2025, and FromSoftware and Bandai Namco will have cause to celebrate this month.</p>

<p>According to Circana's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ltjuov7li22j" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mat Piscatella</a>,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>was the best-selling game across all formats in May, and it topped the individual PlayStation and Xbox charts as well. As a reminder, I <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fort-night" rel="nofollow">awarded the game an 8 out of 10 score</a>, so I'm pretty pleased it managed to sell as well as it did.</p>

<p>Of course, given that sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales" rel="nofollow">topped 3.5 million</a> just a few days after the game was released, it's not surprising that&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>performed as well as it did. Still, since the game is an experiment on FromSoftware and Bandai Namco's behalf, it will no doubt come as a pleasant surprise for both studios.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-circana-may-2025-chests.jpg?itok=9TmyQHFq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-circana-may-2025-chests.jpg?itok=x_eQNXOs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>topped sales charts for May 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>May's second best-selling game across all formats was&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, which, considering that the game was released on Game Pass on day one, is pretty impressive. As a reminder, Bethesda <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bethesda.net/post/3lpmvjo7noz2c" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> shortly after launch that&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>had hit three million players, although since that number includes Game Pass players, it's perhaps not quite as valuable as the studio thinks.</p>

<p>Neither of these games have managed to topple&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>as the best-selling games of 2025 year-to-date. Incidentally,&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em>is in third place, largely because of its release on PS5 in late April.</p>

<p>As ever, Nintendo's chart is off in its own little world, since many of the aforementioned games weren't released for the Switch. That platform's best-selling game for May was&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8</em>, because of course it was, followed by&nbsp;<em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Like UFOs, ball lightning and bigfoot, one of the great mysteries of our time is that Superman is apparently Kryptonite to good videogames. There's yet to be a truly great Kal-El game in the vein of Batman: Arkham Asylum or Spider-Man, but as you can see from the list below, many have tried. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest developer to try is Epic Games, as the Man of Steel has landed as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/superman-arrives-in-fortnite-battle-royale-during-star-wars-live-event-as-death-star-detonates-and-destruction-rains-down">Fortnite X Superman</a>, the latest crossover event for one of the world's biggest games. But what does his inclusion in Fortnite involve? Our list takes a look at that, as well as taking you through a history of Superman in pixels. Discover where you can find Superman as a hero, a playable guest character or just a cheeky Easter Egg in the words below. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Official Superman Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">These are "true" and "proper" Superman games, experiences where you embody the Man of Steel himself. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman (1978)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-1978-1752064304232.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This Atari 2600 release marks Superman's debut to gamers, all four kilobytes of him. It might not seem much to look at today, but won positive reviews for its action and graphics back in ye olde 1970s. In the role of Superman, players have to rebuild a bridge at the Metropolis waterfront damaged by Lex Luthor, capture your evil nemesis, and return to the Daily Planet as quickly as possible. Complicating things are the fact that Lois Lane has been kidnapped, Luthor has released Krytonite satellites that can deactivate your powers, and there are henchmen waiting to take you down. Using your powers, you can see beyond the area you're in with X-ray vision and then fly in to grab and drop Lex and his goons into jail. Just remember to use phone booths to change back into your Clark Kent clothes before stopping by the Daily Planet. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman (1987)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-1987-1752064384942.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Jump forward almost a decade and our favorite alien adoptee found his way to the NES, and got a cute 8-bit makeover in the process. For this outing Superman gets a bunch of abilities including super hearing, x-ray vision, heat vision, super spin, and not one but two types of super breath. He needs them to take on not just Lex Luthor but also Kryptonian bad guys Ursa, Non and General Zod. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman (1988)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-1988-1752064802318.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A year later, Superman leveled up for the Taito arcade game. Notable for having its own original villain Emperor Zaas, this time around Kal-El also got to use his fists, his feet and a Sonic Blast ability. A mix of sidescroller, action adventure and fighting game, it had a mixed reception, but snapping up one of these arcade machines today will set you back around $4,000. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman: The Man of Steel (1989)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-the-man-of-steel-1752064919125.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Released in 1989 on both the ZX Spectrum and Amiga, Superman: The Man of Steel was split into flying levels, a side scrolling beat ‘em up, and a vertical scrolling battle in battle in space. The story that linked those levels was told with cute comic book page panels. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Death and Return of Superman</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-death-and-return-1752065289255.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1994, a pre-Warcraft Blizzard Entertainment released The Death and Return of Superman, a beat ‘em up featuring five playable flavors of the Man of Steel; the vanilla original, Superboy, Steel, Cyborg Superman, the Eradicator. Doomsday is the opening act’s big bad, and bio-genetically engineered monster Clawster also makes an appearance. The action was focused on melee combat and airborne projectile attacks. Fun fact: one of the game’s artists and producers, Samwise Didier - who just retired in 2023 - was later responsible for the addition of the Pandaren race to World of Warcraft in 2010.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman 64</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-64-1752065562597.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Also known as Superman: The New Superman Adventure, this Nintendo 64 Supes game is infamous among retro gamers for its terrible execution. Created as a spin off from Superman: The Animated Series, it was the first time our blue boy scout has appeared in a 3D game, though he probably should have skipped the opportunity. It was called out for visual flaws like its Kryptonite fog (which crudely disguised a very short draw distance), terrible controls and a bizarre race mode.  IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/06/03/superman-2">reviewed it</a> in 1999, and we weren't fans. "With horrible control, unforgivable framerates and more bugs than can be counted, [developer] Titus should be absolutely ashamed of this awful game, and the company should be doubly ashamed for pissing all over such a beloved license," said our reviewer. "Do not buy this piece of garbage."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman: Shadow of Apokolips</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-countdown-to-apokolips-1752065647548.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Luckily Superman 64 wasn’t the end of the road for Kal-El’s adventures in video games, and the PlayStation 2/GameCube third person action game Shadow of Apokolips was better received than its predecessor. Its story saw Lex Luthor team up with Darkseid and the Intergang crime syndicate, and featured voice acting from Malcolm McDowell, Michael York and Lori Petty. "It's a thrill to finally play a Superman game that's handled with this much care and keen observation, with regard to control and special abilities," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/09/26/superman-shadow-of-apokolips-ps2-review">said our reviewer</a>, before branding it a "a slightly better-than-decent action game."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman: The Man of Steel</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-the-man-of-steel-1752065722366.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on the events of Superman: Y2K and featuring Brainiac 13, Xbox’s alternative to Shadow of Apokalips, released in the same year, was another disappointment for Superman fans. "Superman: The Man of Steel is, at the very best, a weekend rental. It'll take about 10 hours to complete, mainly because it's so impossible to beat the missions thanks to the controls," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/08/superman-the-man-of-steel-review">wrote IGN's reviewer</a>. "Someday someone is going to get Superman right and make a killer game. But not today."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman Returns</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-returns-1752065805859.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">2006 was the last time Superman got to star in his very own game, but unfortunately it was a game where the final boss was a tornado, rather than an exciting supervillain. Very loosely based on the Bryan Singer movie, star Brandon Routh actually leant his voice to the game, although he "sounds about as interested in saving Metropolis as he is in deciding on a ripe melon at the market," according to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/28/superman-returns-review-2">IGN review</a>. "Punching out bad guys becomes about as fun as taking out the garbage, and the “epic” battle between Superman and the forces of evil is as simple and dull as a day of chores."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Super Playable Characters</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">These games are not <em>about</em> Superman, but they do <em>feature</em> Superman... and you can play as him, too. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Justice League Task Force</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/justice-league-task-force-1752065910131.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It's 1995. You've fired up your SNES, eaten your Honey Frosted Wheaties and your best friend is coming over to play your new fighting game. Justice League Task Force, developed by Blizzard Entertainment (wow, these guys sure loved DC before they got into orcs and elves) featured Superman alongside characters like The Flash, Wonder Woman, and Green Arrow battling mechanical clones of the DC heroes. Despite rocky reviews, the Justice League fighting series would get another three games, and Superman is a playable fighter in them all. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/mk-vs-dc-1752066011837.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In a world where Leatherface is a guest character in the Mortal Kombat series, a mash up between MK and a comic book universe looks positively tame. This 2008 crossing of the streams is the result of not just a canny guy in the licensing department at DC, but because Raiden and Superman accidentally create big bad Dark Kahn, who threatens both their universes. Superman has moves like Soaring Knockout, Ice Breath, and the Heroic Brutality finishers where he hammers his opponent into the ground like a rusty nail, or freezes them before shattering their bodies to pieces. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lego Batman 2: DC Superheroes</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/lego-batman-2-1752066181998.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman gets a mention in the first Lego Batman game, but in Lego Batman 2, Lego Batman 3 and Lego DC Super-Villains he's a playable character. You get most brawn for your buck in the second Lego Batman game, where he's a big part of the story (and comes complete with his signature theme tune, taken from the classic Christopher Reeves films). He rescues the Dark Knight and Robin, takes on a large Joker robot, and helps his Bat Buddy defend Wayne Tower. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Injustice: Gods Among Us</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/injustice-1752066301942.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman appears on the roster of NetherRealm’s fighting game, Injustice, but as it's set in Earth-49 he's the spicy bad version, driven mad by the death of Lois Lane, and so gets to be a villain. He brings all the tricks you'd expect to the 1v1 matches; heat vision, Ground Tremor, and freezing Super Breath. His Super Move - the Kryptonian Smash - is brutal, he literally punches his opponent into space before punching them back down to Earth. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Injustice 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/injustice-2-1752066325552.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And Super(bad)man came back for the sequel, with a new Final Flight Super Move that again sees him punching his opponent upwards, this time giving them a few wallops in the sky before slamming them into the ground. You can also add Meteor Drop to that too, where you introduce your opponent to the wonders of geology at close quarters. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lego Dimensions</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/lego-dimensions-superman-1752066392988.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2015 game that used a Skylanders-style mix of real world figures and in-game content added the “Superman starring DC Comics fun pack” in 2016. By grabbing the Superman minifigure, players could get access to his Hoverpod and the DC Comics World in-game, opening up the glittering city of Metropolis. Admittedly, it’s a version of Metropolis that The Lord of the Rings villain Sauron has installed one of his creepy sky eyes into, but that’s about on par with the many other evils the city has had to contend with over the years.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MultiVersus</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/multiversus-superman-1752066523612.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. free to play fighting game MultiVersus was shut down just this year, but while it lived it was a fever dream where an eclectic mix of WB franchise characters faced off in platform-based, Super Smash-like combat. Superman was there along with his DC compadres Black Adam and Wonder Woman, but then so was Velma from Scooby-Doo, Gizmo from Gremlins, Arya Stark from Game of Thrones, Jake The Dog from Adventure Time, and Looney Tunes pin-up Lola Bunny. Oh, and you could dress them in skins, so Ugly Sweater Superman was a real thing that existed in the world for a short, beautiful time. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This category is for the games where there's the barest whiff of Superman spandex. Little details hidden in the game world, special skins, or if you're lucky, an evil cameo. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/scribblenauts-unmasked-superman-1752066652770.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This super cute 2013 spin off has you help Superman with a Lex Luthor problem and lets you summon him to help you in other battles, too. Using the right words you can call on a bunch of different Kal-El variants, from Cyborg Superman to Kingdom Come Superman, and you can even borrow a Superman costume to grant main character Maxwell heat vision and ice breath attacks. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">DC Universe Online</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/dc-universe-online-1752066785472.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The DC Comics MMO lets players create their own personalized brand of superhero (or supervillain) but Superman makes an appearance as a mentor for new superhero players, taking them through tutorial missions. He can also be found in the in-game Metropolis and appears as an ally to support players with his skillset. If you choose to be a villain you'll need to battle him as you level up. You can also try out a Superman avatar in the game's PvP mode, Legends. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Batman Arkham Knight </h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/arkham-knight-1752066855218.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While you won't catch a glimpse of the hench hero in Rocksteady’s fantastic Batman Arkham series, there are multiple references to him in the third game's world. There are posters for flights to Metropolis, a few LexCorp buildings dotted around Gotham City, and the NPC thugs seem to enjoy gossiping about Superman on the regular. They call him "that freak from Metropolis," and "the other guy in the cape" and speculate on his alter ego. ""Next thing you know, someone's gonna tell me Superman's really a janitor. Or no, a journalist." Oh, if they only knew.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/ss-superman-1752066974221.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Evil Superman makes a dramatic entrance in Rocksteady’s ill-fated 2024 follow up for the Arkham series, appearing just in time to grab a nuke, laugh maniacally, and take on the Suicide Squad in a boss fight. He delivers some pretty weak sauce villain banter until you can bring him down to Earth with Gold Kryptonite assisted violence. The poor guy doesn't even get to play the top boss in the game; that role is taken in the finale by one of many Brianiacs. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">LittleBigPlanet 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/lbp-superman-1752067193664.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A tiny Sackboy Superman skin and outfit based on the iconic hero, complete with adorable Superman forehead curl?

Previously, players could add some super to their world with the Superheroes Unlimited mod, which was first released in 2012. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fortnite</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/fortnite-superman-1752067417284.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Fortnite X Superman event, launched to coincide with the new James Gunn movie, adds a Kal-El themed battle pass that culminates in a skin based on David Corenswet’s version of the iconic superhero. There’s also an in-game item that will unlock Supes’ heroic abilities, allowing you to wipe the floor in a battle royale match. While this is the most prominent use of Superman in Fortnite to date, it’s not actually his first appearance: back in 2021, Chapter 2, Season 7 featured a Superman skin that had two styles; one featuring the suit and cape, and another that transformed you into the more civilian-looking Clark Kent, complete with glasses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blitz Royale, Fortnite's biggest new mode in years, just got a four-week extension — as speculation mounts over whether Epic Games will make its faster-paced battle royale offering a permanent addition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to a just-posted in-game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> news update, as seen by IGN, developer Epic Games has confirmed "4 More Weeks of Blitz," beginning next week on July 15.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was the date that the mode's current month-long roster of content had been set to end. Already, fans are celebrating that the mode isn't going anywhere — at least, not for few weeks. But will Blitz now become permanent? While no confirmation has yet been given, there are some promising signs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-has-a-hit-new-mode-and-for-once-the-games-main-battle-royale-option-is-no-longer-the-most-popular">Blitz Royale launched last month as a quickfire take on battle royale</a>, with matches designed to last just five minutes. Initially aimed at Fortnite's smartphone audience, the mode instead quickly found popularity across all platforms, and has since become the game's most-played experience — consistently beating even the main Battle Royale and Zero Build playlists in publicly-viewable player numbers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To a large degree, Blitz Royale has been a huge success for Epic Games, after a string of previously-released new modes that haven't captured the same audience as the game's core battle royale offerings. Surely, you would then think, Blitz Royale becoming permanent is a safe bet. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/ff315cfe-e252-4ae9-8ce5-2f8a0bbfd703-1752073265972.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite confirms more Blitz Royale is on the way. Image credit: Epic Games/IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are likely to be other considerations here — a need to keep the mode updated with content regularly enough that it never becomes stale, a need to balance development time with work on other modes, and, perhaps, a sense that the mode becoming permanent risks robbing it of some of its novelty. Consider the millions who originally tuned in when Fortnite ran its time-limited OG throwback season, compared to the (mere!) tens of thousands who play it today in its guise as a permanent mode. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In typically teasing fashion, Epic Games held a social media poll last week asking fans what they would most like to see within Blitz in the future. "We've seen a lot of 'make Blitz permanent'," Epic wrote, "but what should we change?" Options included new POIs, more collab items, new boons and powers, and "more Megalo Don plz," referencing the villain of Fortnite Chapter 5, and his Nitro fuel that enables Blitz players to run faster.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">We've seen a lot of "make Blitz permanent", but what should we change?</p>— Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/1940848241895203051?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The past three weeks have seen Blitz Royale revive classic weaponry and gameplay-changing modifiers from past Battle Royale seasons, and even previous collaboration items — such as the airbending powers of Avatar — across week-long sprints. Currently, the (now no longer final) Blitz week features items from the game's previous Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles crossover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no word yet on what Blitz will focus on for its second month in the game — but at least now players know it is sticking around a while longer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/primal-planet-lets-you-hug-your-dinosaur-%E2%80%93-oh-and-it%E2%80%99s-an-excellent-metroidvania-too.1239363/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve been playing video games since about 1982, and Primal Planet stands out among the most charming I’ve ever encountered. While there’s not a lot about it that’s especially new, the components are so lovingly tuned and crafted that I could barely bring myself to stop playing. The designer injected Primal Planet with an inexhaustible reservoir of creativity, color, motion, and wonder, and the combination delivers an absolutely captivating play experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its charm starts with the hugs. I’ve been in love with superfluous embraces in games since the WayForward remake of A Boy and His Blob deployed a deeply rewarding hug button. With a tap, you could reach out as the Boy and squeeze your best friend the Blob to your heart’s content. The sweetness of the animation and sound design compelled me to hug my little extraterrestrial friend whenever he succeeded, and often to comfort him when he failed. Primal Planet operates from the same emotional playbook. It doesn’t give you much manual control over displays of affection, but works in plenty of opportunities to warmly embrace and interact with your wife, daughter, and the adorable Sino the Dino. It’s deeply committed to integrating utterly unnecessary but deeply rewarding moments of humanity, where your little pixel people feel truly human. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Primal Planet - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The caveman protagonist has a family of bot buddies accompanying him on his journey, and thankfully these AI companions are genuinely helpful. They follow you without getting lost and contribute meaningfully to combat. You can opt to carry your daughter or put her down for support, and your wife is a menace to enemies with her bow and arrow. They’re also deeply emotive characters, enough so that you get attached to them... an emotional hook that Primal Planet finds plenty of opportunities to exploit.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Yes, you can hug the dinosaur.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of all my friends and family, I bonded most with Sino the Dino, a baby dinosaur that acted as a sort of friendly attack dog fighting alongside me. Some of that attachment is that Sino really is useful, and part of it is that the poor little guy is an orphan and I feel a bit responsible for him. I also love that unlike my caveman, Sino can eat small enemies to restore his health on the fly, making him remarkably durable. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The day and night cycles dynamically alter the visibility and danger in the sprawling world. Locales that at dawn are gorgeous vistas transform after dark into menacing hunting grounds. The backgrounds are absolutely crammed with visual splendor. Almost every pixel has a sense of motion to it, from blades of tall grass blowing in the wind to the gentle breathing of immense, sleeping dinosaurs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of the dinosaurs: they’re undeniably awesome. Look, dinosaurs are simply the coolest creatures to ever walk this earth, and Primal Planet knows that, presenting these astronomical ancient avians with a Jurassic Park-like level of enthusiasm. The dinos are diverse in appearance and behavior, deeply colorful and behaviorally distinct. Compys scurry about like the little scavengers they are, raptors attack in packs and from hiding, and the big fellas are genuinely terrifying. The pixel art style and careful color choices richly infuse these colossal beasts with grandeur, beauty, and terror.    </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mechanically, Primal Planet is rock solid. It’s a side-scrolling Metroidvania that gets platforming, combat, and exploration right. The levels are artistically lush but also cunningly designed to hide (and tease) secrets, alternate paths, and environmental puzzles. Curiosity is always rewarded, sometimes with jarring (but terrific) surprises. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a world of quick death and constant twists and turns, but it doesn’t feel brutal or unfair, instead merely challenging. You’ve got a potent dodgeroll to keep you out of harm’s way, and your little dude is delightfully agile. Whether you’re battling dinos, rival tribes, or space aliens, encounters feel thoughtfully designed and balanced.   </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Primal Planet includes well-designed progression and crafting systems. XP gathered through battle and exploration fuels Skill Points, which in turn can be used to unlock double jumps, weapon proficiencies, and more. You share your Skill Point pool and XP with Sino, and can considerably upgrade his mobility and combat abilities as the game goes on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resources found can be crafted at bonfires into weapons, tools, and medicine. The resources are neither too abundant nor too scarce... distribution feels just right. And some items double as equipment. Craft a spear from flint and wood and you’ve got a decent melee and ranged weapon, but you can also toss it against walls and use it as a climbing platform, or dip it in a fire to create a torch useful for clearing thorns that block your path. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As the campaign continues, you meet new allies that help you unlock more crafting abilities, allowing you to create potent traps and weapons to scale with the ever-escalating threats. Resource gathering never felt like a chore, but rather as a reward for exploring and following hunches to hidden areas where rare items and components waited to be found. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I feel like Primal Planet was designed especially for me. It combines several of my favorite reagents in gaming into one glorious magic potion. When I boot up Primal Planet I arrive at an intersection of prehistoric beasts, science fiction, excellent exploratory platforming, incredible art, a light progression system, and a dash of the feels. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The beating heart of Primal Planet is the incredible attention to detail and environmental storytelling.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The beating heart of Primal Planet is the incredible attention to detail and environmental storytelling. Show-don’t-tell is the name of the game in Primal Planet, and it’s splendidly executed. Whether it's UFOs beaming up dinosaurs in the background or your family stopping to create a cave painting together after a major story beat, Primal Planet just keeps intriguing and surprising. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though Primal Planet doesn’t really do anything revolutionary, I have rarely enjoyed a game more. Its creator seems to have surveyed the spectrum of components that make up a compelling video game adventure, and fine-tuned them into a deeply rewarding experience that evokes great Metroidvanias while feeling new and distinct. I absolutely cannot wait for the full release. Don’t sleep on Primal Planet. </p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p><em>Jared Petty really, really, really likes dinosaurs.
