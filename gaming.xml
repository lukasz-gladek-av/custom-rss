            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Two years ago, on September 21, 2023, Starbreeze Entertainment released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/payday-3-bringing-the-big-buck/">Payday 3</a>, a game that might've pushed the series forward in terms of its approach to stealth gameplay and its visuals, but was an abysmal mess with <a href="https://wccftech.com/payday-3-peaked-at-1-3-million-daily-users-starbreeze-apologizes-for-server-issues/">server issues</a>, no offline mode, and a massive lack of content compared to Payday 2. </p>



<p>Two years later, Starbreeze is <a href="https://x.com/PAYDAYGame/status/1970046991779434606">celebrating the 14th anniversary of the Payday series</a>, though it's a muted celebration, as it's most recent release is far less popular than the game it made before. Looking at Steam concurrent numbers alone, Payday 2 <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/">still has thousands of players</a> going on heists and enjoying the wealth of content available with its many DLCs. Payday 3, on the other hand, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/">struggles to hit 1k players</a> with any kind of consistency.</p>



<p>That's probably why, as part of today's anniversary celebrations, Starbreeze has introduced two noteworthy bits of news for Payday fans. Firstly, Payday 3 is getting an <a href="https://www.paydaythegame.com/news/payday3/2025/09/new-skill-system-preview/">overhauled skill system</a> as Starbreeze continues to try to shape Payday 3 into a game that Payday fans want to play more than Payday 2.</p>



<p>Second, while everyone who still wants to play a Payday game is playing Payday 2, Starbreeze has introduced a new subscription for (almost) all the 65+ DLCs available for the heist shooter. It's not every DLC that's been released for Payday 2, because it doesn't include any DLC content that's been retired or removed.</p>



<p>It's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3847540/PAYDAY_2_Subscription/">$5/month subscription</a> to access the many DLCs available for Payday 2, which Starbreeze says it has introduced because, "<em>Payday 2 has had a lot of DLCs released, and for many players, especially new ones, it can be difficult to know what DLC content you may be interested in. So we’ve introduced the Subscription to give an easy way to access all DLC content at a low monthly price.</em>"</p>



<p>That might seem sensible and like a good deal on face value, even when considering that you will need to buy Payday 2 separately to access any of the content in the subscription. But that's before you realize that Payday 2's DLCs routinely go on sale, with the <a href="https://steamdb.info/bundle/3756/">Legacy Collection</a> and the <a href="https://steamdb.info/bundle/34119/#prices">Infamous Collection</a>, the latter of which includes every DLC ever released for Payday 2, going on sale a few times a year for anywhere between 20% and 30% off.</p>



<p>In fairness to Starbreeze, it's not the only studio trying something like this. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/">Cities: Skylines</a> offers a similar service, as do <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1538960/Crusader_Kings_II__Expansion_Subscription/">Crusader Kings II</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/24010/Train_Simulator_Classic_2024/">Train Simulator</a>, to name a few. But whether it'll actually help Starbreeze keep the lights on while it tries to fix Payday 3 is another question, and so far it doesn't seem to have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/1nnssb4/wait_what_payday_2_subscription/">gone over too well with the Payday community</a>. </p>



<p>Not everything has to be a subscription you pay for monthly, and if you're really someone who wants to get into Payday, then you're much better off doing a bit of research as to which DLCs you'd maybe want to try, and waiting for everything to go on sale, because it will go on sale and ultimately be cheaper than having $5 chipped off your bank account for months on end.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/department-of-homeland-security-pokemon-video-post</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/department-of-homeland-security-posts-bizarre-pokemon-themed-ice-raid-video.1305453/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The US Department of Homeland Security has posted a bizarre and, frankly, rather tasteless video that splices footage of ICE immigrant raids with clips from the iconic intro to the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>anime.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kotaku</a>, the video was uploaded to the official DHS X account yesterday. It shows various enforcement officers, including ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), police officers, and the military breaking into properties and arresting people.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it also shows clips from the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>anime, as well as using the anime's theme song to soundtrack the upsetting montage. What's more, the words "Department of Homeland Security" appear at the beginning of the video, rendered in the very recognizable&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>font.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/us-department-of-homeland-security-pokemon-video-card.jpg?itok=z-WB1I4s 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/us-department-of-homeland-security-pokemon-video-card.jpg?itok=rPssa17V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The DHS' new video also features various "criminal aliens" rendered in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>card format.</figcaption></figure><p>As if all of that wasn't enough, the video also shows various "criminal aliens" arrested by ICE, but rendered in a sort of parody&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>card format. Their weakness is even listed as the Ice type, which feels particularly tasteless.</p>

<p>I've got to wonder exactly whose idea this was and why they thought it was okay, but of course, it's possible that this video did indeed travel its way up the chain and met with approval at every turn, which is perhaps even more demoralizing than this being one person's maverick whim.</p>

<p>One body whose approval this video almost certainly did not obtain is, of course, Nintendo, the company that holds the IP rights to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>. If you're familiar with Nintendo, you'll also know that the Japanese gaming giant is, to put it mildly, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">fond</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-garrys-mod-takedowns" rel="nofollow">litigation</a> in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-genki-switch-2-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">certain circumstances</a>.</p>

<p>I'm no legal expert, but I suspect that if Nintendo wanted to, it could probably challenge DHS over its (presumably) unlicensed use of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>&nbsp;assets in this video. I don't imagine the parody defense would get the department too far in that instance, but again, not an expert.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-flying-nintendo-lawsuit-dhs.jpg?itok=intyg7fW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-flying-nintendo-lawsuit-dhs.jpg?itok=wJv0UZJt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Perhaps the DHS should ask&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>studio Pocketpair how Nintendo feels about the perceived unlicensed use of its IP.</figcaption></figure><p>Regardless of your political leanings, I think it's fair to say this DHS video is in pretty poor taste. Let's hope sanity and wisdom prevail and the video is taken down, and whoever's responsible for it has a long, hard think about what they've done.</p>

              <p>If you’re sitting at your desk, do me a favor and look around for a moment. What’s your setup look like? Do you have a good keyboard? How are your speakers? How big is your monitor? Is there more than one? When it comes to PC gaming, there’s so may areas you can upgrade, and we didn’t even cover the stuff under the hood like your GPU and CPU. with all the shiny, new products you can buy level up your space, it’s easy to overlook something small but important—the mouse.</p>
<p>Your mouse is 50% off how you’re interacting with the games you play, assuming you use mouse and keyboard.&nbsp;It’s time to ditch that ten dollar mouse you picked up in the checkout lane of Staples, and get something solid. The Logitech G Pro X SuperLight 2 wireless gaming mouse right now goes for $180. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4251/">However, an Amazon limited time deal is currently bringing it down to just $130. That 28% discount saves you $50.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4251/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p><strong>This Logitech gaming mouse is compatible with both Mac and PC and you have your choice of either black or white</strong>. There is a sleek magenta option as well, but that one is unfortunately not part of the sale. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4251/">So long as you go black or white, you’ll get the mouse for a cool $50 discount.</a> That brings the price down for as limited time from $180 to just $130.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After three days of competition, Q9 has emerged victorious at the 2025 Delta Force Invitational. The inaugural event, held at the Hangzhou Esports Center in China, brought together twelve of the world’s best Delta Force teams. But it was Q9 who ultimately stood above the rest and took home the lion’s share of the $500,000 prize pool. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Delta Force Invitational featured twelve teams that each qualified through region-specific qualifiers, each bringing their own playstyle and strategies. The teams competing included AKA, FL, FN, GS, Q9, STS, ESG, INK, ISG, LEG, MBA, and MG. Throughout the weekend, fans witnessed everything from carefully executed stealth operations to explosive final pushes. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/23/unnamed-1758628304548.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The tournament began with the Group Stage, where each team competed for a spot in either the Upper or Lower Bracket. FN, Q9, GS, MBA, ESG, and INK secured strong performances that placed them in the Upper Bracket, while FL, AKA, STS, LEG, MG, and ISG found themselves in the Lower Bracket, facing elimination pressure early on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the Bracket Stage, the competition intensified. During Upper Bracket Turn 1, Q9 and MBA were the first teams to advance to the Grand Final, while ESG, GS, INK, and FN were pushed down into Upper Bracket Turn 2. Meanwhile, in Lower Bracket Turn 1, FL and LEG were eliminated, while STS and MG headed to the Upper Bracket Turn 2, and ISG and AKA earned one last chance by moving forward into Lower Bracket Turn 2. This set up high-stakes clashes as the brackets narrowed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During Upper Bracket Turn 2, ESG and FN succeeded in advancing to the Grand Final, while GS, STS, INK, and MG dropped down into Lower Bracket Turn 2 for one last shot at victory. In Lower Bracket Turn 2, the tension peaked. INK and MG battled their way into the Grand Final, while AKA, STS, ISG and GS were eliminated after a hard-fought run.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/23/unnamed-1-1758628343653.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of the Grand Final, fans in the Hangzhou Esports Center were treated to a spectacular opening show that brought the game to life. The stage came alive with characters, tanks and battle scenes inspired by Delta Force, immersing the audience in the action before culminating in a performance of the iconic song Dawn, sung by Lithium Done. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Q9 set the tone in Round 1 of the Grand Final with a commanding performance, led by GuoR, who earned MVP honours with 2 kills, 2 assists, and 205 damage. But the competition quickly heated up in Round 2, when INK surged ahead by outpacing everyone in decoding a Mandelbrick. Kilzal was the star of the round, securing 6 kills and carrying his team to victory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Momentum shifted yet again in Round 3 as Q9 reclaimed dominance, with K1De stepping into the spotlight as MVP. In Round 4, ESG broke through with a show-stopping display, turning the match in their favour. DT proved unstoppable, racking up 5 kills to claim MVP. Round 5 saw Q9 refuse to back down, they seized the last Mandelbrick, with K1De earning his second MVP of the series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Heading into Round 6, it was all to play for. Q9 secured a prime position early and began decoding the Mandelbrick, forcing the other teams to scramble for an opening. None could break through, and with Q9 completing the decode, they locked in the invitational victory. But the map clock was still ticking, leaving room for a shake-up in the standings, and it was INK who endured the longest, gathering crucial assets to secure second place. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/23/unnamed-2-1758628378846.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Delta Force Invitational has proved just how much momentum the game’s competitive scene is building. With their victory, Q9 have laid claim to the top prize in Delta Force esports, but the question is, who will rise next to seize their own moment. The Delta Force Global League Season 3 is set to start next month. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/q9-crowned-winners-at-the-2025-delta-force-invitational]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Over six years after its initial announcement, and nearly four years since Riot Games shared a first look at gameplay, 2XKO, the League of Legends fighting game, will soon be available to all. Riot has announced that the current 2XKO closed beta will end on October 7, and early access will begin the same day.</p><p dir="ltr">2XKO's early-access period will include a "Season 0," which will function as the game's first seasonal event and include special in-game events and progression rewards. Season 0 will also mark the debut of a new champion to bring the playable roster to 10--though Riot has not confirmed who that champion will be.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4573219-2xko_gameplay_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573219" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4573219-2xko_gameplay_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573219"></a><figcaption>2XKO</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4573219-2xko_gameplay_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Riot also revealed that 2026 will include five seasons, each of which will also add events, rewards, and a playable champion. All progress made in the closed beta will carry over to the early-access period, and all progress made in early access will also carry over to subsequent seasons.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with the early-access announcement, Riot Games also unveiled the First Impact competitive program, which will feature 22 community-led tournaments around the world through the end of 2025. Each tournament will receive a pot bonus from Riot for prizes, and if a duo wins a tournament, a special Duo Bounty will be rewarded on top of the first-place prize. The program's first event is the 2 NICE KO tournament at Evo France, which runs October 10-12.</p><p dir="ltr">2XKO will be available in early access for PC beginning October 7.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>Google's latest update to Google Play is a big one. The tech giant is bringing its multiplatform play out of beta and expanding its availability, allowing players to access Google Play games across both mobile and PC. It is also making a big push to further personalize the Google Play experience, which includes deeper integration with its AI products.</p><p>As detailed in <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-play/curation-update-september-2025/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a blog post</a>, Google is focusing on efforts designed to unify gaming experiences across platforms. The update marks the full launch of Google Play Games on PC, which had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/google-play-games-for-pc-beta-now-available-in-the-us-and-canada/1100-6508845/" data-ref-id="1100-6508845">been in beta for almost three years</a>. This system allows people to play a subset of Google Play games across both mobile and PC, and progress and rewards are shared between platforms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb7hm7ha6EE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eb7hm7ha6EE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Alongside this launch, Google is also deepening integration throughout its gaming ecosystem. Google Play Points, which players can earn through gameplay and participation in events to redeem for in-game items and Google Store purchases, are now shared across mobile and PC.</p><p>The company's big emphasis throughout the announcement post, though, is on its efforts to boost personalization and AI integration. The Google Play app is receiving new features to provide users recommendations, many of which are housed in a new "You Tab," which is meant to be a curated hub for a user's activity. Additionally, Game Detail Pages are getting overhauled to better surface user reviews, developer updates, and other information about specific games. Apparently, users will soon also be able to ask questions (presumably via AI integration) about a game directly from its Detail Page.</p><p>Google is also expanding how Google Play interfaces with in-game experiences, too. Users can now access Sidekick, an overlay that includes information about achievements, rewards, and other information about a game. Over time, this will receive Gemini integration, with the company intending Sidekick to evolve into an AI-powered assistant that can guide people without needing to leave a game.</p><p>Google Play Games on PC is now available to the general public, and many of the core updates to the app are rolling out right now. Google states that the AI-powered features will come in the next few months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a new PlayStation State of Play showcase, which will bring over half an hour of new info about upcoming PlayStation titles.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/23/state-of-play-returns-this-wednesday-september-24/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, the next State of Play will air tomorrow at 5pm Eastern (that's 2pm Pacific and around 10pm GMT). Sony is promising "more than 35 minutes of reveals and news from developers around the world".</p>

<p>In particular, Sony says the State of Play will spotlight Housemarque's mysterious&nbsp;<em>Saros</em>, which was first revealed during a State of Play event <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-recap-february-2025" rel="nofollow">back in February</a>. Sony is promising an "extended look" at&nbsp;<em>Saros</em>, including "nearly five minutes of gameplay".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/state-of-play-september-2025-saros.jpg?itok=JseT5F5Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/state-of-play-september-2025-saros.jpg?itok=hVLyLvF1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We'll hopefully learn what the heck is going on in this shot during tomorrow's State of Play.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony is remaining tight-lipped about what else we can expect from the State of Play tomorrow, but if I were a betting man, I'd put my money on <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvels-wolverine" rel="nofollow">Insomniac's&nbsp;<em>Wolverine</em>&nbsp;game</a>, from which we have not heard in many a year.</p>

<p>The game was originally announced back in 2021, but since then, Insomniac and Sony have been very quiet about it, save for confirming that it'll be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insomniacs-wolverine-confirmed-to-be-set-in-same-earth-1048-universe-as-marvels-spider" rel="nofollow">set in the same universe</a> as&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>&nbsp;(the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvels-spider-man-2" rel="nofollow">more recent one</a>, not the PS2 classic).</p>

<p>Of course, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insomniac-games-ransomware-attack-report" rel="nofollow">major cyberattack</a> back in December 2023 probably didn't help Insomniac's development process, although the studio did <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insomniac-games-officially-reacts-to-criminal-cyberattack-marvels-wolverine-will" rel="nofollow">subsequently reveal</a> that its game will "greatly evolve" from the development build that was leaked during that attack.</p>

<p>As for what else we might see from the State of Play show, we may well get a new&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>release date following that game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">delay back in June</a>, and Naughty Dog might reveal more about its upcoming title&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em>, although I wouldn't hold my breath for that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After some </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-showcase-state-play-tgs-2025-ff7-remake-part-3-2000626000"><span>rumors and speculation</span></a><span> suggesting we’d be getting one ahead of Tokyo Game Show, Sony has </span><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/23/state-of-play-returns-this-wednesday-september-24/"><span>announced a new State of Play presentation</span></a><span> for tomorrow, September 24. The showcase will include 35 minutes of new games, both from third-party developers and Sony’s PlayStation Studios.</span></p> <p><span>The only game we know will be in the show right now is </span><i><span>Saros</span></i><span>, the new game from Returnal developer Housemarque. The action game was first revealed </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-state-play-2025-everything-we-saw-sop-1851761893"><span>back in February</span></a><span> and features </span><i><span>iZombie</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Fall of the House of Usher</span></i><span> actor Rahul Kohli as the lead actor. It’s set to come to PlayStation 5 next year. I’d be shocked if we got a release date tomorrow, but we will see at least five minutes of gameplay.</span></p> <p><span>The show will begin tomorrow at 2 p.m. Pacific / 5 p.m. Eastern, and will be streaming on PlayStation’s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playstation"><span>YouTube</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation"><span>Twitch</span></a><span> accounts. After so many long showcases this summer, it’s nice to get something that’s only 35 minutes long. Thank you, Sony, for your mercy, especially because this is taking place after typical working hours for those of us on the East Coast.</span></p>

 <p><span>Beyond </span><i><span>Faros</span></i><span>, it’s unclear what games might make an appearance. </span><i><span>Ghost of Yōtei </span></i><span>is a little over a week away, so it would make sense for Sony to spend a little time promoting the game and reminding people that the samurai sequel is imminent. I’m sure someone at Sony thinks it could use some positive buzz after the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478"><span>past couple of weeks of controversy</span></a><span>. I’d be surprised if they spent too much time on it, though, considering it’s about to get another wave of chatter when reviews go live later this week.</span></p> <p><span>Thoughts and prayers to the </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts </span></i><span>fans who are no doubt hoping we’ll hear more about </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts IV </span></i><span>tomorrow. I am on your side, but I cannot bring myself to actually feel hope.</span></p>

<p>ARC Raiders is a PvPvE sandbox shooter from the studio behind The Finals, which merges extraction and survival gameplay.</p>
<p>The full game will be released on 30th October.</p>
<p>"We're excited to welcome Raiders to the Server Slam - this is where we'll really put ARC Raiders through its paces ahead of full launch," said executive producer Aleksander Grøndal. "Our goal is simple: make sure that on October 30, when the servers go live, every player experiences the game exactly as we've intended - polished, balanced, and ready for action. Thanks for joining us - let's prepare to go topside."</p>

			<p>If I were to ask you to imagine a well-groomed, moustachioed gentleman from Belgium who constantly comments on his “little grey cells”, you wouldn’t have to be an Agatha Christie super-fan for the famously meticulous detective, Hercule Poirot, to come to mind. Of all Christie’s characters, Poirot still proves to be incredibly popular today, with the Kenneth Branagh movie series, the new Poirot mystery novels written in the Christie style by author Sophie Hannah or, of course, the continuation of the Microids video game mysteries. The latest instalment, Agatha Christie – Death on the Nile, offers a twist on the Christie classic.</p>
<p><iframe title="Agatha Christie – Death on the Nile – Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6M4S0H1NL0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This new take on the well-known story is set against the lively backdrop of the 1970’s. Christie fans may find the 4-decade time jump a little jarring. The luxury and opulence of the late 1930’s are swept away and replaced with, well, brown. When one visualises the style of the 1970’s, you might imagine bold patterns and prints in vibrant golds, mahogany browns, avocado greens, rich reds and burnt oranges. Unfortunately, in Death on the Nile, the 70’s eclectic mix of earthy hues translates as a muddy sepia mush of yellowish browns. The visuals, that at times should be very striking, get lost in a mix of flat, bland tones.</p>



<p>Poirot himself seems to sit a little out of place against the 70’s setting, as well. In the opening scene alone, Poirot visits a trendy nightclub where he meets the main characters featured in the upcoming mystery. Setting Christie’s dignified and meticulously groomed detective in a disco-era club with flashing lights and mirror balls is a bold and risky choice – one that doesn’t really pay off. You’re exposed to Poirot in bellbottoms and a neck scarf. This is accompanied by an awkward shot panning up past Hercule’s bottom that makes you feel like you’re eyeing up your grandad. There was one terrifying moment, walking onto the dance floor, where I thought I might be forced to watch Hercule Poirot break out into the YMCA. #notmyPoirot!</p>

<p>However, the 70’s setting does allow for the introduction of an interesting new aspect to the story with the original character, Jane Royce. In Death on the Nile, the gameplay is split between old-school detective Hercule Poirot and his admirer-come-private-investigator, Jane. The joint protagonist feature adds a fresh perspective to the crime and spruces up the all-too-familiar storyline. The plot promises an additional finale act that introduces something novel to the narrative. Where Poirot’s investigative play-sections feel like going over old ground for Christie fans, Jane Royce’s segments bring the excitement of exploring new territory.</p>

<p>When it comes to solving the mystery itself, the gameplay mechanics utilised here are inventive and well-thought out. The mind-map allows you to do more than just follow hints on who to interview next. It prompts you to make links between clues and draw your own conclusions. It keeps track of your discoveries and helps you decide where to look next. Cleverly, the game also comes with several helpful difficulty settings, from a fully guided mystery through to “throw you in at the deep end”, so gamers can choose their own path. This combination of techniques really immerses you in the mystery and urges you to properly don your detective baker boy hat.</p>
<p>As you near the end of each individual mystery, you’re treated to a run-through of events. First, the game prompts you to scroll through the timeline, placing characters in different locations performing different activities. Along with being enlightening, this activity is immensely satisfying. Particularly when you finally manage to get everyone in place to make the crime make sense. The game then runs through the case step by step and you get to watch the scene play out. Mystery solved. This leaves your investigative urges fully quenched and your face doing that smug expression it does when you feel you’ve just achieved something awesome.</p>

<p>There’s a lot to like about this game, from its immersive mystery-solving tools to its updated plot add-ons. However, it would have needed a more traditional 30’s setting and conventional Poirot character for it to truly spark my little grey cells.</p>

			<p>Right before the beginning of this year's Tokyo Game Show, PlayStation State of Play returns tomorrow with over 30 minutes of updates on announced games and brand new reveals.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/23/state-of-play-returns-this-wednesday-september-24/">confirmed on the Official PlayStation Blog</a>, the presentation will air tomorrow, September 24, at 2 pm PT / 5 pm ET / 11 pm CEST on &nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playstation">YouTube</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation">Twitch</a>. During its 35 minutes of duration, the presentation will provide updates and reveals from developers around the world with new looks at anticipated third-party titles, indie titles. The presentation will also feature updates from some PlayStation Studios' developers, including an extended look at Saros, <a href="https://wccftech.com/saros-will-be-the-ultimate-evolution-of-housemarques-gameplay-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5/">the new game from Housemarque launching next year</a>.</p>



<p>In the past few years, a PlayStation Showcase or State of Play presentation <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-play-confirmed-to-air-tomorrow-showing-20-games/">took place right before the beginning of the annual Tokyo Game Show</a>, and with <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-september-2025/">rumors suggesting that 2025 wouldn't have been different</a>, today's announcement doesn't come as a surprise. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/">June 2025 PlayStation State of Play presentation was filled with a lot of great reveals</a>, such as Romeo is A Dead Man, the next game from Suda51 and Grasshopper Manufacture which is setting out to be another great action game with some peculiar vibes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-gamescom-hands-on-preview-subspace-emissary/">judging from the time I spent with the game during Gamescom</a>, FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles, whose new features such quality-of-life enhancements and voice acting will <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-gamescom-hands-on-preview-definitive-edition-in-the-making/">elevate an already great tactical role-playing game</a>, and MARVEL TOKON: Fighting Souls, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-soul-is-a-new-4-vs-4-fighting-game-by-arc-system-works-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5-and-pc/">a new fighting game starring Marvel Comics characters from genre masters Arc System Works</a>, so there's a very good chance the new presentation will feature some nice surprise reveals alongside the announced new look at Saros and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-play-insomniac-worlverine-playstation-rumor/">rumored proper first look at Insomianc's Wolverine.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hoyoverse-reveals-first-teaser-for-mysterious-new-game-petit-planet.1305354/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>developer HoYoverse has revealed a teaser for another new game, and this one looks to have a decidedly more cozy bent to it than the studio's previous efforts.</p>

<p>Just a few weeks after unveiling <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-honkai-nexus-anima" rel="nofollow">creature-collecting autochess game&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em></a>, HoYoverse has updated the <a href="https://x.com/petitplanetgame" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media account</a> for something by the name of&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>, and while details are sparse, the art style and general vibe feels very&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>-esque.</p>

<p>For one thing, the new artwork depicts two extremely cuddly-looking creatures with massive smiles on their faces, which means <i>Petit Planet&nbsp;</i>is probably either a cozy game or a deeply disturbing horror experience masquerading as cozy. My money's on the former, but my heart hopes for the latter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hoyoverse-petit-planet-critter.jpg?itok=zmBv3wvb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hoyoverse-petit-planet-critter.jpg?itok=fy4VIS_g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This little guy heralds the announcement of&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>In the new teaser trailer, we can see the cute little fluffball from the new&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>artwork hopping around a grove that looks extremely reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>, complete with rounded trees and a tiered waterfall.</p>

<p>Honestly, that's pretty much all there is right now, but it's likely that HoYoverse is gearing up for a big&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>announcement, so perhaps we'll get more info about the game in the coming weeks. We can certainly hope so.</p>

<p>If&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>is indeed a cozy life sim-style game, then it will mark a further branching out from HoYoverse's typical RPG slant; its three main exports, namely&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-esque&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact" rel="nofollow"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a>, turn-based battler&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail" rel="nofollow"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a>, and character action extravaganza&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zenless-zone-zero" rel="nofollow"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a>, are all various flavors of gacha RPG.</p>

<p>Of course, there's nothing to say&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>won't have gacha mechanics as well, and if I know HoYoverse, it almost certainly will. Still, it looks like it'll offer a completely different gameplay style to prior studio titles, so that's something to look forward to.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hoyoverse-petit-planet-genshin-impact.jpg?itok=Xjhk9ijo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hoyoverse-petit-planet-genshin-impact.jpg?itok=0HR981aE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>could mark a big departure from HoYoverse's usual style.</figcaption></figure><p>We'll have to wait a little while to learn more about&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>, but for now, it looks like it's safe to get excited if you were hoping for a HoYoverse cozy game. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p>Given the endless waterfall of garbage that arrives on Steam, it might seem like you can upload and sell absolutely anything on the storefront. However, there <em>are</em> meant to be some verification checks in place to prevent the most egregious examples of nefarious content from reaching the platform—it’s just it doesn’t always work. Hence <em>BlockBlasters</em>, a Trojan-Horse 2D platformer that released as an innocent game, before being updated such that it could start draining players’ crypto wallets. And tragically, this was discovered during a livestream fundraiser for a streamer with stage-4 cancer.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/verified-steam-game-steals-streamers-cancer-treatment-donations/">reported by&nbsp;<em>Bleeping Computer</em></a>, <em>BlockBlasters</em> went on sale on July 30 as yet another 2D platformer on Valve’s industry-dominating PC store. But a month later, on August 30, <a href="https://steamdb.info/patchnotes/19799326/">the game was updated with a couple of zip files</a>, which appear to have contained malware that allowed the game to empty players’ crypto wallets.</p> <p>The “game” was obviously released as free, to tempt as many people into taking a look as possible. However, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3872350/charts/">according to SteamDB</a> it seems&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters</em> only managed to attract a very small number of players. Estimates show it as having had under 7,000 downloads, while concurrent player counts never exceeded a desultory eight. That would have sucked if you’d poured your heart into a platformer, but clearly that wasn’t the plan here from first-time (and presumably last-time) developers Genesis Interactive.</p>

 <p>It was only when streamer Raivo Plavnieks (RastalandTV) was <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/57p5a-help-me-beat-stage-4-cancer">running a fundraiser</a> to help raise money to treat his stage-4 sarcoma that the cruel nature of the malware became apparent. Someone tuned in and encouraged crypto enthusiast Plavnieks to download <em>BlockBlasters</em>, when the extremely sick man watched $32,000 drain from his funds. “My life was saved for whole 24 hours,” the streamer <a href="https://x.com/rastalandTV/status/1969629808788181258">wrote on X</a>, “untill someone tuned in my stream and got me to download verified game on @Steam.” (Please be warned that the video clip embedded in the post is particularly upsetting.)</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">For anybody wondering what is going on with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CANCER&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$CANCER</a> live stream… my life was saved for whole 24 hours untill someone tuned in my stream and got me to download verified game on <a href="https://twitter.com/Steam?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Steam</a> <br>After this I was drained for over 32,000$ USD of my creator fees earned on <a href="https://twitter.com/pumpdotfun?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@pumpdotfun</a> and… <a href="https://t.co/8YH4njd46E">pic.twitter.com/8YH4njd46E</a></p> <p>— rastaland.TV (@rastalandTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/rastalandTV/status/1969629808788181258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“I can’t breathe, I can’t think,” the Latvian gamer added. “im completely lost on what is going to happen next, can’t shake the feeling that it is my fault that I might end up on street again or not have anything to eat in few days.”</p>

 <p>However, according to&nbsp;<em>Bleeping Computer</em>, what happened next is a rallying from other crypto types, with crypto influencer Alex Becker posting to X to say he’d sent Plavnieks $32,500 to cover the losses.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have sent $32,500 to cover this to your new safe wallet.   Best of luck to you my friend. &lt;3.<a href="https://twitter.com/rastalandTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@rastalandTV</a> </p> <p>Receipt below.</p> <p>— Alex Becker 🍊🏆🥇 (@ZssBecker) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZssBecker/status/1969774353211695441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>BlockBlasters</em> was removed from Steam on September 21, the same day as the stream, presumably after a flood of resulting reports. However, it shows serious weaknesses in Valve’s store that malware can so easily be added to games. Earlier this year a web3 “game” called&nbsp;<a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/security/156674/did-you-download-this-steam-game-sorry-its-windows-malware"><em>PirateFi&nbsp;</em>was stealing Steam accounts</a>, and it’s just another of many examples.</p> <p>As a rule, the safest option is to take no part in the entire crypto scam in the first place. Put your money in a bank, or hide it under your mattress, but not in the criminal underworld that is cryptocurrency. And if anything is marked as “web3,” avoid it like the plague it is.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Hideo Kojima's studio, Kojima Productions, has released a new teaser trailer for its in-development horror game, OD. It features Sophia Lillis (<em>It, Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em>) lighting some strange, seemingly ritualistic candles while an ominous knock sound echoes throughout the mostly empty apartment.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/hideo-kojima-is-making-a-new-game-called-od-with-jordan-peele">Kojima first revealed OD way back in 2023</a> by bringing out acclaimed <em>Get Out</em>, <em>Us</em>, and <em>Nope </em>director Jordan Peele on stage during The Game Awards that year. The two indicated that they were working on a cloud-based horror project called OD for Xbox Game Studios, which would feature Lillis and Hunter Schafer (<em>Euphoria</em>). However, this game, which Kojima has confirmed is called OD – Knock, might differ from whatever Peele is working on.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out the OD – Knock teaser trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHCqxLtwy5g"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHCqxLtwy5g" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, OD – Knock appears to be the game teased during The Game Awards in 2023 as both feature Lillis. However, during today's <a href="https://youtu.be/P6CaAu3T7l0?si=ToMsuM-lUa86Xjp-">Kojima Productions: Beyond The Strand event</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-reveals-first-trailer-for-xbox-game-studios-title-od"><em>IGN</em></a>, Kojima said, "There is a different kind of fear [Peele] will do.
