			<p>NEOWIZ and Wolfeye Studios have partnered up to bring players a brand new Retro Sci-fi First-Person Action RPG. NEOWIZ will be responsible for publishing this title and supporting Wolfeye Studios through the development process. So far, the game has yet to be named, but what we do know is that the game will be set in a retrofuturistic setting with a branching narrative, with the game then going on to be distributed globally by NEOWIZ when the time comes.</p>
<p>As a celebration of the partnership news, Wolfeye Studios has released some of their concept art for the upcoming title. There are three images to showcase the world that players will get to explore, from dusty desert towns to built-up elegant interiors. The images chosen are being used to show how diverse the world will be, combining rugged environments with futuristic style to create a unique experience for the audience.</p>

<p>The team leaders of Wolfeye Studios are Raf Colantonio and Julien Roby, who have worked on Dishonored and Prey. They are also joined by industry veterans who worked with them on those two titles, as well as some of the developers working on Dark Messiah, Pentiment, and Assassin's Creed.</p>
<p>Wolfeye Studios is now working hard to create this RPG title, with it set to be released on PC and console. <a href="https://wolfeye-studios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The team</a> at Wolfeye Studios works from more than 10 different cities around the world, working across seven different time zones on four different continents. In 2022, Wolfeye Studios released its first game, "Weird West," which went on to be nominated for BEST RPG of the Year at the annual D.I.C.E. Awards.</p>
<p>"We have a burning passion for making a very specific type of game that blends RPG, action and simulation. These games can only be successful when the publisher shares that same passion," says Raf Colantonio, Creative Director and President of Wolfeye Studios.</p>
<p>NEOWIZ has helped publish some very well-known titles over the years, with the most recent being the award-winning title <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-to-launch-in-q1-2025-neowiz-now-working-on-a-sci-fi-survival-horror-game/">Lies of P</a>. Lies of P is set to get a DLC sometime this year. This company has most recently announced a partnership with ZAKAZANE, a studio that consists of CD Projekt Red and 11 Bit Studios alumni.</p>
<p>While the details about the developer's upcoming title are slim, you can check out the concept art above for a glimpse into what you can expect in the future.</p>

But overall the patch notes didn’t contain anything big or out of the ordinary. When players loaded <em>Helldivers 2</em> up post-update, however, they started to discover these shovels during their latest galactic war expeditions.

Can squads now dig out trenches to create makeshift fortifications wherever they are? And why stop at just holes? Maybe shovels are just the start of a wild new era of <em>Helldivers 2</em> that updates the tried-and-true shooter formula with new <em>Minecraft</em>-style survival crafting elements. </p><p>While players are still testing the limits of what these new tools make possible, it feels like Arrowhead Game Studios has fundamentally blown the top off what <em>Helldivers 2</em> could evolve into someday. Of course, shovels haven’t completely come out of nowhere.

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is an enormous game in both scope and scale and from the maps you explore to the missions you complete, you’ll need to invest <strong>many hours </strong>in the game to conquer everything. That’s all well and good saying that, but what do the numbers look like? How long is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll introduce you to the size of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, breaking down just how long KCD2 is and how many hours it’ll take you to finish it.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">How Many Hours is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</h2>



<p><strong>It took me 65.5 hours to complete the main story and a lot of side content in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</strong>.</p>



<p>That includes many restarts and reloads following deaths and failed objectives. In those 65.5 hours, I managed to get to level 22, acquired some of the best weapons and armour in the game, and unlocked 50% of all the game’s achievements.</p>



<p>I <strong>didn’t </strong>unlock the achievement to ‘finish most of the game’s content’. </p>



<p>I also know that in those 65.5 hours, I left a lot of side missions untouched in my eagerness to get the game finished for a full review. However, you can go back and finish up skipped content once you’ve completed the game, so that’s my goal.</p>



<p>I believe that I left behind (or didn’t discover) enough content to push Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 to around<strong> 100 hours</strong>.</p>



<p>From mastering skills to uncovering secrets and from taking part in side activities to conquering secondary and tertiary quests, there is still so much for me to finish. I haven’t unfogged the entire map, I’ve not knocked all the nests out of the trees, and I haven’t visited every point of interest marked on my map.</p>



<p>If I speak frankly, I’d say that <strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is around 100 hours long </strong>for the average player. If you’re just rushing the story and not participating in side missions, you can probably complete the whole thing in around <strong>20 – 30 hours</strong> without making any mistakes.</p>

			<p>During our recent trip to Oslo to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-hands-on-preview-before-the-spice-can-flow-one-must-build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play Funcom's Dune Awakening</a> game, the developer also organized a roundtable Q&amp;A where the press could ask a few questions directly to Game Director Joel Bylos. You can find the full transcript of the conversation on the game's features and mechanics below. As a reminder, Dune Awakening is still <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-to-be-released-in-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated for a Q1 launch on PC</a> (where it will support <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a> on day one) and later on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p><strong>From what I've seen, the PVP seems mostly going to be world PVP. But is there going to be any kind of game mode where you are instanced for some kind of ranked mode where you can compete and maybe rank up?</strong></p>
<p>No, the plan is to keep it to world PvP.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned before having the limitation of portraying the Fremen in the game. Were there any other instances of things that you could or could not do because of the movies? How did that impact your take on the game?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, sure, plenty of things. For example, they're working on the third movie now and I thought, oh, they're gonna be loosened up a little after the second movie's out and it has been such a huge success that they're not gonna be as worried about what we're portraying in Dune Awakening.</p>
<p>And then they announced the third movie and they came to us and said, oh, by the way, all these things from the second book, you can't use them. And I'm like, guys, the game is half built around those things already because we've been working on it for X years and then we had a long conversation and it's kind of okay. But there were things that, yeah, they didn't want us to show.</p>
<p>I don't want to go into too many specifics because it kind of spoils the game and the third movie. But there are things that, because I knew we couldn't rely on the first book, I took a lot of the stuff from the second book and put it in the game because I was like, well, the first book, I know they're making two movies out of that one, and I didn't know they were going to make a third movie.</p>
<p>About eight months ago, I found out they were doing that, and I had a conversation with Legendary. They're great partners to work with. I've heard horror stories about working with, say, Star Wars, and it's nothing like that. These guys are great at sharing with us, they're great at keeping us in the loop. But they also want to make sure that when Denis does his vision for certain things in the world, we haven't already put out something that sort of would change that or conflict with that. I can give an example, a very specific one: the trailer we saw with the old history.</p>
<p>Originally, that trailer showed Paul in the future, sitting on his throne, talking about the past, talking about this other universe he sees, but they were very clear that he can't be sitting on a throne. We can't imply that Paul is in any way a king or an emperor. So, we changed it to him standing up in front of a stone mural, and that was because, which is kind of flattering, they said, look, the visuals for this are so nice, it could be something that Denis did, and we don't want people to make that mistake.</p>
<p>We were like, okay. They were worried that it might actually be taken as a trailer for the third movie or something, so that's actually a bit flattering, but it's also a restriction that comes back to us. In general, it's been great to work with them. We got to go to Budapest and walk around the sets of the films and things like that, so we've been very involved with working tightly with them.</p>
<p>But yeah, there's always constraints and like I said, I think that actually drives us to more creativity. It forces us to think around corners, and I think that it puts us in a place to make the game super interesting for people who already know the story of Dune and want to see what this alternate take looks like.</p>
<p><strong>When creating Dune Awakening, which existing games do you see it appealing the most?</strong></p>
<p>It's a tough one. I'll just say survival games first and foremost, I think there's a huge number of people who play survival games. I think we've seen massive successes in that space. We made Conan Exiles, so we know that crowd.</p>
<p>Also, anybody who likes to play with their friends and muck around a bit, I think it's a pretty good experience for that. And just people who are into detailed, interesting worlds, and of course, that includes people who are into Dune, but also kind of just people who like to play around in a nice cool open world and see what's there.</p>
<p><strong>The example of the gameplay given here today obviously is to show off the combat in one of the dungeons of Dune Awakening. Going a little bit further with that, obviously players want to feel rewarded for the content that they do. In the instance of doing a dungeon, for example, how is the looting in that case? Is it like, throughout the dungeon, you pick stuff up on the side, or is there just one main end goal at the end of it?</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the stylization of the progression of the location, it is mostly towards the end, but there can be tidbits throughout the way. We have to see exactly how players respond to how we're distributing rewards. Right now, we have a reward for everybody - as long as you get to the end boss, everyone gets a version of the reward. We're going to see how that works for the economy to see if we need to adjust anything there, but that's the current approach. There are other things along the way, but by grouping together, you will not be penalised for playing with your friends.</p>
<p>There are types of resources that only exist in ecology labs. There are types of resources that only exist in fallen shipwrecks. In particular, it's tied to the type of item it is. Vehicles and vehicle parts can only be mostly found in ecology labs, and suspenser tech and Holtzman shield technology can only be found in these ecology labs where it's been locked away for 10,000 years.</p>
<p>Things like modern weapons and armors, a lot of those are locked away in shipwrecks that have fallen, so you need to go to those locations to get those components. We have an instanced looting system, which means that everybody gets their own version of what the chest has, so everyone rolls on the chest and gets their own thing. There's no loot stealing from other people in a sense. But all the dungeons are open, so it is quite possible for you to come across a dungeon where someone's just run it and there's no enemy inside because they've just killed them all for you. You run in and get your own loot. It's your lucky day, you've got a jackpot and you didn't have to do much work. But it's spread out enough that that doesn't happen that often.</p>
<p>Finally, the other thing I was going to mention is we have a unique schematic system in Dune Awakening, which I think is maybe somewhat interesting for people who play survival games. In the technology tree, you unlock schematics that you can craft infinitely, but in the world, you find unique schematics that you can only craft one or two or three of, and this is what drives our economic system in the game. You might find a special type of Lasgun, and you can only craft one of them. You'd have to run that dungeon many times to get more of that particular gun. Also, they can be repaired a certain number of times before the durability goes to zero, and then you will be like, I need to go back and run that dungeon because I really like that gun or that armour.</p>
<p>In the deep desert, because we're wiping it every week, you can have stuff like a really cool gun that only shows up once every six months. Maybe your guild wants to get as many of those schematics in that week as possible, so you're the only people on the server who can craft that gun. It's a real driver of this rarity and uniqueness of items. That's the loot philosophy in the game right now.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DA_Slowblade-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>WCCFTECH: I was curious if there are any plans to enable privately hosted servers for the roleplaying communities in Dune Awakening.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, so it's an ongoing discussion. We have the ability to do it. What we don't want to do is release our server code to people because it's slightly different than how it's been in the past.</p>
<p>There's a discussion going on about whether we can host servers for people, kind of like Fallout 76 allows people to host, they pay Bethesda but they get their server. We're thinking about how to do this in the best possible way. We haven't made any clear decisions on it yet because it's a complicated thing, especially because the game is made of multiple maps, and one server is usually one map. Essentially, you'd be renting four maps, because you'd have to rent the main map and then all of the social hubs, and then the deep desert is nine maps using <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-qa-creative-director-clarifies-mmo-size-hints-at-beyond-arrakis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">server meshing</a>.</p>
<p>They're all tied together, so it becomes very complicated. In order to rent a private world, you would have to pay the cost of 15 servers, and that is not something we want to put on players, so then we need to figure out the best configuration. Maybe people just want to rent the main map and that's fine, and then we can allow people to do things like speed up progression and change variables on that map, but that's why it's complicated. We're still under discussion. I don't know if we'll have it sorted out for launch, but it's definitely not off the table, and it's something we're discussing.</p>
<p><strong>Are there trade auction houses, that sort of thing?</strong></p>
<p>We have a place called the Exchange in the major cities. You can go there and put things on the Exchange for sale, buy and sell orders, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>In terms of player trade, when you meet a player in the world, you can just click on them, choose trade, and exchange items with each other. You can also do the classic survival thing and just dump it on the ground and someone can pick it up. But I'm not sure we have the permission set up so that you could pick up someone else's loot bag.</p>
<p>Follow-up question about PVP. If there's not gonna be any instanced PvP, but will it be possible to duel someone, to challenge someone to a one-on-one duel? In the movies, we saw some of this.</p>
<p>I want to do that in the future, but it's not gonna be there for launch. I'm sorry about that, but yeah, I just couldn't fit it in the time scale for the game.</p>
<p><strong>When you die in Dune Awakening, how much do you lose of what you collected?</strong></p>
<p>I'm not gonna dare to try and remember the percentages, but you don't drop any of your items, you lose resources. If you're carrying scrap metal, stone, spice, I think you drop all of your spice, 100% of whatever spice you're carrying, 100% of the coins you're carrying, the money you're carrying, but there's a banking system so you can bank money to avoid losing it. And then I think it's 30%ish of the resources you're carrying that are lost upon death. Of course, you can run back to pick it up from your corpse. People cannot loot your corpse in PvE areas of the game, but there are PvP areas of the game where they can.</p>
<p><strong>I really like the ability customization that you guys have. I was kind of wondering, is there a possibility to save builds of abilities so somebody can hotkey to them really quickly to switch?</strong></p>
<p>No. That's a great quality of life suggestion that we should have. We need to figure out how we handle cooldowns and swapping out abilities when they're on cooldown and off cooldown. Yes, we want it. We need to figure out the best way to do it. But yeah, it's definitely one of those quality of life things we'd like to have.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wired-productions-to-publish-camel-101s-lovecraftian-fps-beneath/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-in-a-trilogy-of-trailers-released-for-karma-the-dark-world-paying-homage-to-david-lynch/">Wired Productions</a> will be collaborating with Camel 101 once again to publish their upcoming Lovecraftian horror FPS Beneath. This game draws inspiration from F.E.A.R and Resident Evil and will see players head into the darkest of the depths as a deep-sea diver. While there, you'll have to fight off eldritch horrors that are lurking below. For those who are interested in Beneath, a<a href="https://mailchi.mp/wiredproductions/omniumtrials" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> closed beta playtest</a> is currently available for sign-up, where you may get the chance to explore the game early and help the developers by providing feedback.</p>
<p>Below is the trailer for Beneath, where you can see what to expect from the upcoming title developed by Camel 101, the minds behind Those Who Remain and Syndrome.</p>
<p><iframe title="Beneath | Publishing Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSa-rGiKdh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You play as a seasoned deep-sea diver named Noah Quinn, and you end up on an expedition that begins to go incredibly wrong, causing you to end up trapped in the depths of the ocean. There, you'll begin to uncover the ancient evil that lurks in the waters, and you'll have to start confronting them yourself if you want to have any chance of survival.</p>
<p>Much like titles like Resident Evil and Half-Life, the ammo you have access to is limited, meaning you have to make do with the scarce amount of supplies you have. All the while, you have to maintain your sanity levels in the depths to avoid being overwhelmed by the eldritch horrors. There are more than just eldritch atrocities to deal with, as you'll also have to fight off soldiers. In Beneath, you aren't confined to just your rig, as you will also be able to utilize your deep-sea dive suit and navigate the ocean.</p>
<p>"It's a pleasure to work with Bruno and Ricardo again," said Leo Zullo, Managing Director at Wired Productions. "They are a passionate and talented team, and as brothers, their bond resonates deeply with Wired. Long-term relationships are important to us and we will put our hearts and souls into Beneath and them."</p>
<p>Thus far, it's been confirmed that Beneath will be coming to PC. It has not been stated as of yet whether this game will be available on other platforms in the future.</p>
<p>"We couldn't be more excited about teaming up with Wired! Our previous partnership on Those Who Remain was a success, so we already know the value they bring to the table. Beneath is our most ambitious project to date, and we're sure that their passion and expertise will be invaluable in helping us bring the game to its full potential," said Ricardo Cesteiro, Co-Founder and Managing Director at Camel 101.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date-scheduled-for-march.1099785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>THQ Nordic and Bugbear have announced the Early Access release date for destruction derby racer&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2</em>, so get ready to engage in what the two studios describe as "absolute vehicular mayhem".</p>

<p><em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>officially arrives on PC via Steam Early Access on March 20th. The game will also eventually come to consoles, although it doesn't look like the Early Access release is making it onto PS5 or Xbox Series X|S, sadly.</p>

<p>When it launches,&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>will pack in three gameplay modes: Racing, Derby, and Multiplayer. They're fairly self-explanatory, and as Early Access progresses, Bugbear says it'll also add "a completely revamped career mode that adapts to your individual playstyle".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date-crash.jpg?itok=Fej_bZWq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date-crash.jpg?itok=v8MCyrFL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>promises glorious destruction derby action in March.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the career mode, Bugbear is also promising to add new tracks and vehicles throughout&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2</em>'s Early Access development, and new special challenges in which you race vehicles that "were definitely never supposed to end up on a racetrack" will be introduced.</p>

<p>Various other features, like tournaments and mod support, are also on the cards for Early Access. Rest assured that it does sound like&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>has a solid core in place if you do decide to pick it up before these features have been implemented, though.</p>

<p>That experience involves what Bugbear and THQ Nordic describe as "full-contact racing action with no rules, just jaw-dropping moments of chaos and destruction". The sequel will sport an improved physics engine compared to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wreckfest" rel="nofollow">the original</a>, too.</p>

<p>You can check out the Early Access release date announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It should give you a good idea of what kind of destructive action to expect from the game.</p>




<p><em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203190/Wreckfest_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on March 20th. There's no word yet on when the game is coming to consoles, although it has been slated for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S as well. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond-to-bring-portable-hellbomb-and-more.1099782/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Arrowhead Game Studios have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, and if you've ever wanted the destructive power of a Hellbomb strapped to your back, this is the Warbond for you.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-chemical-agents-warbond" rel="nofollow">Warbonds</a>, Servants of Freedom brings a bunch of new gear for you to try out, foremost among which is the B-100 Portable Hellbomb Stratagem. Like the regular Hellbomb, make sure you're nowhere near this one when it goes off.</p>

<p>Of course, new weapons are also coming as part of this Warbond, including the LAS-17 Double-Edge Sickle, which powers up the regular Sickle and allows it to overheat, potentially damaging both you and "everything in its path".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond-hellbomb.jpg?itok=dpfGsSCh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond-hellbomb.jpg?itok=y7p1VvWv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new Warbond gives you your very own portable Hellbomb.</figcaption></figure><p>The secondary slot, meanwhile, gets a new GP-20 Ultimatum grenade pistol, which is "designed for closer-range use". That, given&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s penchant for randomly murdering you in hilarious ways, sounds like a recipe for disaster to me.</p>

<p>Servants of Freedom also brings a new throwable weapon in the G-50 Seeker, a drone that follows along behind you and explodes near enemies when it detects them. It can also target enemies you ping.</p>

<p>Two new armor sets have been added, both medium sets: the IE-3 Martyr and the IE-12 Righteous. Both sets come complete with rather terrifying masked helms that will make you look like Doctor Doom, but if he fought on the side of justice, truth, and democracy (ahem).</p>

<p>Naturally, the Warbond comes complete with new capes, a new player title, and a new cheer as well, all of which should help you express yourself when you're taking the fight to those dastardly Terminids (or bots, or Illuminate, of course).</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>news, chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt announced last week that he's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical" rel="nofollow">intending to take a sabbatical from work</a>, and that when he returns, he'll begin work on a new Arrowhead game. Exciting!</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and the Servants of Freedom Warbond arrives on February 6th.

But fans had wondered whether the patch had more to it than Arrowhead let on, given it weighed in at over 5GB. Perhaps the terrain deformation / dig system now in the game was a big part of that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are now digging into the detail of this new shovel, trying to work out how deep they can go and whether it has any other use. Can it be used to dig under doors, for example? Can players work together to create trenches? The community is having fun working this out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Arrowhead announced Helldivers 2’s next premium warbond, dubbed Servants of Freedom. The battle pass due out February 6 adds a portable Hellbomb stratagem and new armor that come with the Integrated Explosives passive, which means that upon death, your corpse will detonate and take out the enemies around you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Combined with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-president-says-semiconductor-shortage-is-affecting-switch-already/1100-6491172/" data-ref-id="1100-6491172">global semiconductor shortage</a> at the time, the Switch became a sought-after item at the start of 2020, with resellers using the opportunity to buy up available stock and make a profit.</p><p>Scalpers were a major issue for Microsoft and Sony as well, as the late-2020 launch of the Xbox Series X|S and PS5 consoles <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/scalpers-continue-to-snatch-up-ps5-orders-retailer-investigating/1100-6486443/" data-ref-id="1100-6486443">saw chronic shortages thanks to resellers</a> using bots to grab all of the consoles whenever a resupply came in through online marketplaces.</p><p>Furukawa had previously mentioned that Nintendo's strategy for dealing with scalpers revolves around a healthy supply of Switch 2 consoles for its official launch this year. "As a countermeasure against resale, we believe that the most important thing is to produce a sufficient number to meet customer demand, and this idea has not changed since last year," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-has-a-simple-but-effective-plan-to-stop-switch-2-scalpers/1100-6524605/">Furukawa said in 2024</a>.</p><p>More details on the Switch 2 will be revealed in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/">Nintendo Direct scheduled for April</a>, and for anyone looking to go hands-on with the device, you can do so at the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-to-try-the-switch-2-before-its-released/1100-6528849/">Nintendo Switch 2 Experience</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-5m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>sales have hit another big milestone, further cementing the latest&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>fighter's popularity and success.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1886686193535848650" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the studio reveals that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>has hit five million sales, a figure it's managed to reach in around four months.</p>

<p>We already knew the game was successful; it launched to the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>series' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-series-best-steam-debut" rel="nofollow">best Steam debut ever</a>&nbsp;and went on to top three million sales in its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">first day on release</a>, meaning that it's picked up another two million for itself in the intervening months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-dlc.jpg?itok=f9xMvhw5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-dlc.jpg?itok=d6-c2rLE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>has hit another big sales milestone just a few months after its release.</figcaption></figure><p>That figure almost certainly includes both physical shipments and digital sales, and it'll take into account all three platforms on which the game is available as well. Still, five million since October is no mean feat!</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is, it's a fighting game that lets you do battle as one of over 180&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>characters, including fan favorites like Goku, Vegeta, and Trunks (and variations thereof).</p>

<p>The game features characters from media like&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball Z</em>,&nbsp;<em>GT</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Super</em>, as well as "selected&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>movies", and it'll also let you relive some of the series' most iconic moments "from the perspectives of eight characters".</p>

<p>After its release,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>received updates adding features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-splitscreen" rel="nofollow">splitscreen play across all of its stages</a>, a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-limited-time-mode" rel="nofollow">limited-time game mode</a>, and plenty of gameplay tweaks and improvements.</p>




<p>Last month, the Hero of Justice DLC pack was released, bringing an additional eleven playable fighters to&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, as well as a new costume and three bonus battles.</p>

<p>The DLC has not, however, met with a particularly positive reception, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3310650/DRAGON_BALL_Sparking_ZERO_HERO_OF_JUSTICE_Pack/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">at least on Steam</a>, where fans are complaining about the lack of variety between playable characters and the price of the pack.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1790600/DRAGON_BALL_Sparking_ZERO/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dragon-ball-sparking-zero/9n7xmjjhnfc3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/final-destination-bloodlines-movie-trailer-1851754613<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In case you’re worried—as I was—that the <em>Final Destination</em> franchise has been continuing on for years without your noticing, rest assured: <em>Final Destination Bloodlines</em>, due out May 16, is the first new entry in the series in 14 years. The first five movies ran from 2000 to 2011, meaning it’s been gone for longer than it was ever around. Until now! And, you know what? The trailer is fantastic.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>For the uninitiated—and hold onto your pensions, but anyone under the age of 25 wasn’t born when the first movie came out—<em>Final Destination</em> was a tale of the repercussions of escaping death. A group of teenagers, boarding an airplane for a school trip, leave the plane after one of their number realizes he’s had a psychic premonition of the flight’s imminent explosion. And some concept of death appears to be most perturbed by this turn of events. They start dying, one by one, in increasingly ludicrous circumstances.</p><p>While it’s not yet known which event the cast of <em>Bloodlines</em> has escaped, one such ludicrous circumstance makes up the splendid trailer for the new movie. Be warned, it’s going to make you yell out loud:</p><p>Oh my oh my. Admittedly, there was a part of me that was hoping for the alternative gag, where despite all those events he then dies because he gets shot through the window or something. But still, that did the job.</p><p>Part of what made 2000's <em>Final Destination</em> so great was the way it framed itself as one of the self-aware slasher flicks that emerged post-<em>Scream</em>, but without the masked killer. Removing the audience’s requirement to put their energies into solving a murder mystery and determining the identity of the villain, it offered a freeing viewing experience, one where the only obligations incumbent on viewers were pondering which elaborate confluence of events would lead to the next character’s grisly death. And then leaned in hard.</p><p>And it still holds up! Admittedly, the film’s most effective moment—the bus—has since been copied so much as to have been entirely neutered, to a degree where such moments are now woefully predictable. But there’s so much more besides, and it’s all delivered with a wink and a bucket of glee. It’s not a masterpiece, but it’s a really good time.</p><p>This was largely thanks to the writing team behind the movie: Glen Morgan and James Wong. Any fan of <em>X-Files</em> would immediately recognize those names, the ones you’d sit up in delight at seeing appear during the opening moments of an episode, because it meant it’d be an absolute gem. Despite all this, via what I contend was a snobbery that was rampant at the turn of the millennium, the movie was grimly reviewed, still sitting at a horrible 39 on Metacritic and 36 percent on Rotten Tomatoes.</p><p>This makes <em>Final Destination</em> one of the strangest horror franchises, as its review scores have <em>climbed</em> with each subsequent movie (other than the fourth, a 3D movie which was universally condemned, including by viewers), despite each generally being worse than the last. As the 11 years went on, perhaps critics became less performatively weary of <em>Scream</em>-likes, and just acknowledged they were being offered a silly good time.</p><p>It’ll be interesting to see whether this sixth film will be met with that sense of pre-ordained exhaustion that too often accompanies a revived franchise, or if it’ll just be dreadful all on its own. Or—and this is actually possible—if it can be a genuinely good movie that’s back for a reason! </p><figure id="" data-id="0edc75cad02361320333c2defc9987c3" data-recommend-id="image://0edc75cad02361320333c2defc9987c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1504" data-height="846" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The nodding head of death." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The nodding head of death." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0edc75cad02361320333c2defc9987c3" data-recommend-id="image://0edc75cad02361320333c2defc9987c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1504" data-height="846" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The nodding head of death." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’m intrigued by who’s making it, and sadly that doesn’t include Wong or Morgan. But it’s co-directed by Zach Lipovsky, whose track record is, well, it’s improving! He was behind 2014's <em>Leprechaun: Origins</em>, which has the ignominious achievement of holding a 0 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes, but then found more success with 2018's <em>Freaks </em>where he partnered up with Adam Stein who co-directs here, and with whom he earned well-deserved acclaim for directorial work on the 2022 revival of <em>Fraggle Rock</em>! So, honestly, who knows there. </p><p>Writing comes courtesy of recent <em>Scream</em> franchise penner Guy Busick and Jon Watts...yes, <em>that</em> Jon Watts, the director of the last three <em>Spider-Man</em> movies! Wow!</p><p><em>Bloodlines </em>will also be the wonderful Tony Todd’s final film, after his death last year. He reprises his character, William Bludworth, who appeared in four of the previous films in the series, giving this revival an extra sense of validity in my mind.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>THQ Nordic and Bugbear Entertainment have confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wreckfest-2/" data-ref-id="5000-638027">Wreckfest 2</a>, a sequel to their wildly destructive racing game, will finally enter early access on March 20. We also have a solid idea of what Wreckfest 2 will feature when it enters early access and what will be added over time.</p><p>The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wreckfest/" data-ref-id="5000-171651">Wreckfest</a> was one of the first early-access success stories. It stood out due to its penchant for destruction with impressive damage models that let its vehicles get significantly more busted and bruised than your typical racer. Now, over a decade after Wreckfest's early access release, Bugbear and THQ Nordic are going through the same process with its sequel, which ups the ante with a rebuilt physics engine that makes the damage simulation for its cars even more detailed.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Wreckfest 2 | Early Access Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The early-access trailer demonstrates the destructive nature of Wreckfest 2's gameplay, as we see racers bump and crash into each other while speeding through a junkyard. This is presumably from one of the three modes that will be available in Wreckfest 2 at release: Racing, Derby, and Multiplayer. Bugbear Entertainment has teased what it plans to add to its racer over time, and it goes beyond just adding more tracks and car-customization options.</p><p>During early access, Wreckfest 2 will receive a reworked career mode that will tailor itself to how you play Wreckfest 2. The game will also get Challenges, smaller high-score scenarios where players will take control of "unconventional vehicles," and Tournaments. Mod support, skill-based matchmaking, server queues, and the ability to share vehicle designs with other players will also come to Wreckfest 2 during its early-access phase.</p><p>Wreckfest 2 launches on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203190/Wreckfest_2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam Early Access</a> on March 20; eventually, it will be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S as well.</p>
