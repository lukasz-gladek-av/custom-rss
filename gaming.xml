<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/780e82d554eac/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Trails Beyond the Horizon</a> has secured a firm release date on Switch 1 and 2, and with the latter console being more powerful, fans should be excited for what will hopefully be a smoother, more-polished release for the latest entry in the Trails series.</p>
<p>However, ever since the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/trails-beyond-the-horizon-slips-to-early-2026-but-its-also-coming-to-switch-2">Switch 2 version's announcement back in June</a>, there's been controversy surrounding it as publisher NIS America confirmed it would be a Game-Key Card release.</p>
<p>So, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/never-in-my-wildest-dreams-would-i-have-expected-this-falcom-president-talks-20-years-of-trails-in-our-big-interview">after our interview with Falcom President Toshihiro Kondo</a> — where representatives of NIS America were present — we asked about why the publisher decided to go with a Game-Key Card release, rather than a full physical version.</p>
<p>In a follow-up email, a representative from NIS America responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We decided to release this title as a Game-Key Card on the Nintendo Switch 2 as we believed it was the most beneficial option for our customers."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We want to clarify that, as far as we can tell, a Japanese Switch 2 release hasn't been confirmed for the game yet. As such, this 'physical' version is only confirmed for the West. Another Falcom game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> — which is currently <em>only</em> confirmed for Japan — is also a Game-Key Card release on Switch 2, though that is being handled by Clouded Leopard Entertainment</p>
<p>Regardless, the above response isn't the answer anyone was looking for, and many have taken to social media to criticise. Especially when the <a href="https://store.nisamerica.com/products/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon?variant=42117184127024">special edition of the Switch 2 release is $10 more expensive than any other version</a>, including the PS5 release.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon Switch 2 Special Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7e119d950bc95/trails-beyond-the-horizon-switch-2-special-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Game-Key Card releases have gone down like a lead balloon in general, with many refusing to buy them as they're not true physical games — as Nintendo puts it, the cartridge in the box is <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68415/~/nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2-game-key-card-overview">"your "key" to downloading the full game to your system via the internet".</a></p>
<p>You only need to connect to the internet the first time you boot up the game, but you will need to pop the Game-Key Card into the Switch 2 to play the game, despite the fact the game isn't on the cartridge.</p>
<p>The Switch 1 version is a full physical, but we have no details on whether there will be the ability to transfer save data between the Switch 1 and 2 versions, <em>or</em> whether there will be an upgrade path for those who want to buy the physical Switch 1 version.</p>
<p>Some publishers, such as Marvelous and CD Projekt Red, have stuck to full physical releases, but many third-party Switch 2 games — like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default</a>, and even future releases such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD Remake</a> — are all Game-Key Cards.</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of NIS's decision to make Trails Beyond the Horizon a Game-Key Card release in the comments</em>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-wish-the-d-d-dragon-delves-adventure-anthology-delved-deeper-into-dragons.1252629/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who has loved dragons for longer than I can remember, including rocking dragon button-up shirts in high school as my “style” and theming my son’s bedroom around the scaled creatures, I was happy as a wyrm and his hoard when Wizards revealed they were releasing Dragon Delves: Adventure Anthology for Dungeons &amp; Dragons. This collection puts front and center one of the namesakes of the TTRPG, featuring 10 adventures, while also highlighting the legacy of the creatures in this long-running franchise. After peeling back the pages and seeing what it has to offer, I find this book to be a fine addition to my shelf, but I wish it went further to really give these mythical creatures the celebration they deserve.</p><div catalogid="95c08acb-b2b8-42d6-9e49-69e7fa2c79c4" id="225650"><div id="225650" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dragon Delves (D&amp;D Adventure Anthology)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Delves is a collection of 10 short adventures, each one focused around chromatic (Green, Red, Blue, White, Black) or Metallic (Gold, Silver, Brass, Bronze, Copper) dragons that can be dropped into your existing campaigns or played back-to-back in a campaign that takes players from novice level 1 heroes up to level 12. It would have been nice if the designers offered some manner or tips, or recommendations for GMs to adjust the included quests for higher levels, but worst case, you could always just choose higher level enemies of a similar style, young dragons instead of wyrmlings, for example, to raise the challenge.  There is a good variety of quests in this anthology, from solving mysteries behind corruption, sentient bags of holding, or uncovering forgotten verses of a song, but all of them will, at some point, have you and your party cross paths with a dragon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All but one really hit for me. The one that didn't is the Gold Dragon’s adventure, “Baker’s Doesn't,” which involves a golden dragon named Briochebane that bakes bread, and has the party dealing with animated candy creations and visiting places like Candied Apple Orchards and Taffy Factories. Outlandish and silly in TTRPGs isn’t an automatic turn-off for me. Hell, in my own homebrew campaign, the party encountered an island of sentient vegetables and took a cauliflower puppy back with them. But in the scheme of Dragon Delves, this quest just doesn’t feel like it belongs among quests like “Death at Sunset” or “Shivering Death”. That said, its whimsical nature could be perfect for a little jaunt in the Feywild or to add a bit of levity to your campaign after an emotionally-packed couple of sessions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This book's real strength is how easy it makes it to drop the adventures into a campaign. Each of the 10 stories has been designed to last only one or two sessions, with the first page of each one providing simple and clear directions on where these can be dropped in, the level of characters it is for, the general plot points, how to prepare, and what state blocks you will need.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This book's real strength is how easy it makes it to drop the adventures into a campaign.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, the Silver Dragon’s “The Will of Orcus” adventure states, “It can take place anywhere there are mountains and settlements,” and is for level 4 characters. All of those important bits of information you need can be gleaned from just a quick glance. As a GM, the faster I can get the info, the better, and I think the layout and design are wonderfully done here in Dragon Delves (and honestly, all of the updated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-dungeons-and-dragons-books">2025 5th edition books</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing of note, while this anthology contains the details of the adventures, it does <em>not</em> have any stat blocks for the creatures, so whoever is running these will also need the Monster Manual (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QObWlM?object_uuid=450dc3bd-3d44-47f6-b69a-cf14e99c5ce7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Amazon</a>) – either 5th Edition book will suffice. The fact that this book doesn’t contain any unique stat blocks is a bit of a bummer. I would have loved to have blocks for each of the 10 dragons that are the focus of each one, which would give them something slightly unique or tweaked from their stock counterparts in the Monster Manual. Also, where are my updated gem dragons at, Wizards?!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the quests, this book also showcases how the visuals and designs of each dragon have evolved over the course of Dungeons &amp; Dragons' nearly five-decade-long lifespan. I appreciate the two-page spread of artwork, but when I heard that this book would also showcase the history of the dragon types, I expected more. I would have loved to see blurbs from Wizards’ designers on how, if any, the approach and gameplay design of the various types have shifted or changed over the years. How has Wizards approached its stat blocks, or despite “dragons” being in the franchise's name, why is the team as reserved in showcasing or highlighting them? Much of this art I could obtain simply by searching Google; give me the information or material that has been hoarded away in the Wizards’ vaults. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether they are spewing acid, lightning, or breathing the more traditional fire, dragons have been, and always will be, really, really cool. There is a reason that these scaled creatures have become so closely ingrained and intertwined with the fantasy genre. Dragon Delves: Adventure Anthology gives players some relatively quick outings to enjoy and drop into their story whenever parties have a hankering for some dragon goodness. That said, this book never reached the heights of excitement I had imagined when I first heard about it. The fact that it relies solely on the basic stat blocks from the Monster Manual and there aren’t any fun adventures for higher-level parties is a bit disappointing. The fact that Tiamat, arguably the most recognizable dragon in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, is absent is also a strange omission.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Devles comes off more as a great introductory package for dragons, and for newer or younger players just <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-dungeons-and-dragons">learning how to play D&amp;D</a>, it's a fun collection of quick stories. But for more experienced players, or those hoping for setups for big confrontations with some ancient dragons, you may want to look elsewhere. Personally, I was hoping for and expecting more, but hopefully this anthology just marks the beginning of more dragon-centric books and campaigns to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Unfortunately, it also soft locks your game.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has been out for a week now, and speedrunners are already figuring out incredibly fast ways to beat the game in as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcjkdLofDYg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">little as an hour and a half</a>. While they're sure to find ways to cut that time down even more in the coming weeks and months, one really interesting trick has been discovered with a strange side effect: it skips getting Pauline as DK's companion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning! </strong></em><em>Spoilers for the ending of Donkey Kong Bananza's Lagoon Layer follow. Read on at your own risk!</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a normal playthrough, Pauline bursts out of Odd Rock near the end of the Lagoon Layer when she and DK play music together and activate DK's Kong Bananza transformation. It's a critical story moment both in that it actually introduces Pauline into the story proper, but also because the cutscene is required to get Kong Elder to open the door to the next layer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, speedrunners have found a trick that lets them skip the whole thing. The drop to the next layer is hidden in a building that DK can actually clip into under the right circumstances. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIvPjCDwvLU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This video</a> shows the trick in action, but it essentially involves hanging from a pipe close to a barred window into the building, and rapidly entering and exiting Photo Mode to get DK to clip through the bars and into the room with the hole. This works regardless of whether DK has Pauline or not, which means DK and Odd Rock can journey to the next layer together without progressing the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately for Odd Rock lovers out there, you can't actually progress the game much farther this way. The next sublayer is a boss fight arena, and while you can collect a few Banandium Gems in there with Odd Rock's support, the boss won't actually spawn if you don't have Pauline with you. Weirdly, you will hear a bit of Pauline's (not Odd Rock's) dialogue as you approach the arena, but with no boss to fight there's also no way to manifest the big hole in the ground that leads to the next main layer. So you're soft locked until you go back and properly get Pauline.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, knowing how fast speedrunners work at breaking these things, I wouldn't be surprised if we hear about them solving this new problem sometime soon and doing something that results in some crazy no-Pauline tricks, or maybe even ways to skip Odd Rock entirely. After all, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom runners <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-speedrunner-finds-a-way-to-play-as-link">figured out how to play as Link instead of Zelda</a>. Video games are just wacky like that sometimes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza is out now, and we love it, having <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">given the game a 10/10 in our review</a>. As our reviewer said, "Donkey Kong Bananza is a truly groundbreaking 3D platformer, with satisfying movement, powerful abilities, impressive destructible environments, and clever challenges that all come together in complete harmony to create Nintendo’s first Switch 2 masterpiece."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you, like us, can't get enough of Bananza, we have plenty of walkthroughs to aid your journey underground, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/donkey-kong-bananza/Banandium_Gems_(Banana_Locations)">Banandium Gem locations</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/donkey-kong-bananza/Essential_Tips_to_Get_Started">starter tips and tricks</a>, and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/donkey-kong-bananza/Walkthrough">full walkthrough</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Tsukuda shared more about the game’s horseback traversal, <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [557 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a>, open world, enemies, overhauled skill system, game length, and more. <span id="more-979773"></span></p><p>Get the full interview below.</p><p><strong>Horseback traversal is a new feature. How has this impacted mission design overall? Will there be combat tied to horseback movement, or is it mainly a tool for exploration?</strong></p><p><strong>Kenichiro Tsukuda, Series Producer:</strong> “Yes, you can engage in combat on horseback. Traveling in your arsenal consumes energy, but you don’t consume energy when riding a horse or other using other vehicles. It’s also fun to travel around with friends, whether that’s by flying or by utilizing vehicles. I believe horses do not detract from the sci-fi or mech genres in any way, as they have long-existed in sci-fi novels, and I believe they are actually necessary to pay respect to the novelists who pioneered this genre.”</p><p><strong>With <a title="Genres > Co-Op [305 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">co-op</a> confirmed for the main campaign, can the full story be played through with three players? Or are there limitations to which missions support multiplayer?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsukuda:</strong> “There are no restrictions at all. Everything is playable in co-op. However, while players at a higher levels can sync to those at a lower level, lower-leveled players will not be able to join the games of higher-leveled players. This is because most players prefer to avoid spoilers and don’t want to jump ahead in the story.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Asynchronous multiplayer is also new to the series. Can you elaborate on how it functions? Will players encounter shared events, custom challenges, or ongoing threats?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsukuda:</strong> “The entire story can be enjoyed in co-op, so you can face all enemy threats and in-game events with other players. Through asynchronous multiplayer, players can create bases in the open world that other players can interact with. You can access the same functions at these bases out in the field as you would be able to at your own home base. Additionally, if you find another player’s wreckage out in the world, you can obtain items or equipment from them. The player who fell in battle doesn’t lose these items if another player takes them. This means that even if you die in the game, you’ll still be helping someone out, which makes for a more carefree and enjoyable experience. There are other features as well, but we’ll discuss those at another time.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Daemon-X-Machina-Interview_07-24-25_SS01.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>The game is described as featuring a “vast” open world. How does this approach contrast with the mission-based structure of the original? Are there dynamic encounters like world bosses, faction-controlled zones, or other random objectives? And how do you ensure the world feels alive, avoiding the emptiness seen in parts of the first game?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsukuda:</strong> “Players can look forward to encountering random missions and events in the open world, and it’s great to explore as well. We designed it more like an <a title="Genres > RPG [17,434 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>, really. Even weak enemies often drop new items, so there’s always excitement in finding new enemies. As a game centered around combat, <em>Titanic Scion</em> always has something in store that makes you want to keep progressing.</p><p>“And exploration is more than just seeing what’s around the next corner. You can do things with other players like share secret maps with each other that I hope will lead to more players wanting to play co-op with their friends.”</p><p><strong>You’ve mentioned the addition of organic enemies. Are these a completely new class of enemy? How do they differ from mechanical enemies in terms of strategy, behavior, or vulnerabilities?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsukuda:</strong> “They are indeed a new type of enemy. However, they are not entirely organic. They are the result of mechanical entities repeatedly fusing with biological organisms. Enemy behavior and weaknesses are individually set for each enemy, so rather than saying organic enemies are different from mechanical enemies, it’s more accurate to say that each enemy is unique. However, as a general rule, mechanical enemies are weak against energy-based weapons like lasers, while biological enemies are weak against projectile-based weapons.”</p><p><strong>Can players expect any new customization features that go beyond what was possible in the original? Are there any new systems added to the mech building?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsukuda:</strong> “One addition is that you can now create your own emblems, which opens up new ways to play. For example, you can create a ‘team’ emblem with friends in the new and improved online mode. Additionally, while not necessarily a customization feature, you can now carry items that boost attack power and healing, making the game more accessible for beginners in a group. In terms of customization for your Arsenal, there are now more weapons available to equip, along with changes to equipment slots, new weapon types, and additional functionalities based on different weapons. These all add more depth to customization.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Daemon-X-Machina-Interview_07-24-25_SS02.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>The visual style seems to be more realistic this time around, compared to the more heavily cel-shaded look of the original. Was this shift primarily to support a darker narrative tone, or were there other design / technical factors at play?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsukuda:</strong> “I thought a lot about our visual aesthetic. While the first <em>Daemon X Machina</em> had an anime-style aesthetic, this one adopts techniques closer to Japanese manga, specifically Gekiga, with some photorealism influence as well. The characters are more manga-inspired, while the mecha designs lean toward photorealism. Because we are releasing on multiple platforms, we aimed to appeal to a wide audience, including anime and manga fans, and fans of the first game.”</p><p><strong>The Axiom are introduced as new antagonists. While avoiding any major spoilers, how do they compare to the Immortals in terms of goals, combat style, or threat level?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsukuda:</strong> “Compared to regular small enemies, Axiom Soldiers often appear in groups and can be quite challenging until you’re properly equipped. Additionally, bosses like the Neun use special skills that are far more advanced than the mercenaries from the first <em>Daemon X Machina</em>, so be careful when challenging them. Of course, defeating them allows you to obtain the powerful skills they use.”</p><p><strong>Are skills a brand-new progression layer—such as a dedicated skill tree—or do they build on the existing augment system from the original?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsukuda:</strong> “We completely overhauled the skill system. Instead of a skill tree, you acquire and equip skills through factors and genetic patterns obtained by defeating enemies. These skills are divided into two types. Active skills are used during combat and function similarly to spells or special moves in an RPG, while passive skills enhance your physical prowess. Of course, the augmentation system for armor and weapons is still present as well.”</p><p><strong>In terms of narrative length, how does this entry compare to the roughly 15-hour runtime of the original game?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsukuda:</strong> “For all but the most hardcore players who may be able to speed through the story, playing the entire game will require acquiring proper equipment. The process of gearing up and becoming stronger is a core fun element of this game, after all, so it should take players longer to play through this game than the first <em>Daemon X Machina</em>.”</p><p><strong>Is there a final message you would like to share with the Gematsu audience before you sign off from this interview?</strong></p><p><strong>Tsukuda:</strong> “Even within the sci-fi genre, the mech subgenre can be viewed as quite niche. However, to those who may not have considered mech games before, <em>Titanic Scion</em> offers appealing characters, a helpful community through online co-op, and an RPG-inspired design that allows players to overcome challenges not just through action alone, but by exploring the world and upgrading their equipment. My goal for <em>Titanic Scion</em> was to create a mech game that even beginners would enjoy. This game will release on multiple platforms, so please give it a try!”</p><p><em>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,952 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,567 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [256 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,726 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1342490/Daemon_X_Machina_Titanic_Scion/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on September 5 worldwide.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-interview-with-producer-kenichiro-tsukuda-open-world-multiplayer-enemies-skill-system-and-more]]></content:encoded>

      The brief message has replaced many adult games previously available on itch.io.

<p><a href="https://itch.io/takedowns/2687311">Linked takedown notices</a> on some of those pages outline the specific types of content that are being targeted in itch.io's new crackdown:</p>
<blockquote><p>We don't allow hosting content that includes sexualized images or videos of real-life humans. Fictional, illustrated, and rendered content is generally fine, assuming it's legal. AI-generated imagery that is designed to resemble photographic content of real people is not allowed. Content glorifying sexual violence is not permitted. Depictions of minors, minor-presenting, or suggested minors in a sexual context are not allowed and will result in account suspension.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those notices also link to applicable "Acceptable Use Policies" from <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/acceptableuse-full">PayPal</a>, <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses">Stripe</a>, and <a href="https://www.payoneer.com/legal/restricted-businesses/">Payoneer</a> that itch.io says must be followed "if you plan to collect money for your content."</p>
<p>On <a href="https://itch.io/docs/creators/faq#is-adult-content-allowed">its creator FAQ page</a>, itch.io adds that "it’s almost impossible to come up with an exhaustive list of unacceptable products to sell, so often we have to take content reviews one at a time." The platform also notes that "violations that result in administrative action are permanent with no chance of appeal. Any funds on the account will not be eligible for payout. There is no second chance."</p>
<h2>What it means to be “deindexed”</h2>
<p>As the audit continues, tens of thousands of adult games that are technically available on the platform (for now) exist in the limited visibility limbo of "deindexing." While these games can still be accessed, purchased, and downloaded by those who follow a direct link to their itch.io pages, they will no longer appear in searches or individual user recommendations on the platform, vastly limiting their reach.</p>

    <div id="caption-2108051"><p>
              There were a lot more than 48 "adult" tagged games on itch.io until quite recently.

<p>That deindexing effect can be seen by simply browsing through many once-popular adult content tags on itch.io. Browsing the "Adult" tag that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250724091512/https://itch.io/games/tag-adult">included nearly 17,000 games last week</a>, for instance, now shows <a href="https://itch.io/games/tag-adult">just 48 titles as of this writing</a> (extremely NSFW links, obviously). Other itch.io tags that have seen their previously robust browsable content severely limited include "Erotic," "Hentai," "Incest," "NSFW," "Porn," "Rape," "Sex," and "Sexy."</p>
<p>It isn't just sexualized games that have been caught up in this deindexing dragnet, though. Indie developer Robert Boyd <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zeboydgames.bsky.social/post/3luolxe6tqs2f">notes on Bluesky</a> that <em>Consume Me</em>—an <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/consume-me-wins-grand-prize-nuovo-award-at-the-2025-igf-awards">award-winning game</a> about eating disorders—will no longer show up in search results on itch.io, even if you <a href="https://itch.io/search?q=consume+me">seek it out by name directly</a> (it can still be found <a href="https://q_dork.itch.io/consume-me">using this direct URL</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=consume+me+site%3Aitch.io">outside search engines like Google</a>).</p>

Most content creators are trying to get viral soundbites in their interviews, but streamer and YouTuber Loserfruit had a much better idea and asked Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Joseph Quinn to try out their respective heroes in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span>.

Pascal played as Mister Fantastic, Kirby controlled Invisible Woman, Moss-Bachrach did some clobbering as the Thing, and Quinn ignited the skies as Human Torch. Before they get started, Kirby says she loves playing games, and Pascal mentions she’s big on <em>The Sims</em>. The rest of the crew says they have pretty limited gaming experience. Quinn played <em>FIFA</em> as a kid and Pascal says he never played anything past the original NES. So by and large, it sounds like the actors are about to enter uncharted territory playing NetEase’s hero shooter.</p><p>Loserfruit shows the cast some of the cosmetics in the game, including Invisible Woman’s wildly popular Malice skin depicting her villainous alter ego, which was a real crowd-pleaser. It seems like a missed opportunity to not have the actors play with the skins <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fantastic-4-first-steps-pedro-pascal-mr-fantastic-reed-1851786015&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fantastic-4-first-steps-pedro-pascal-mr-fantastic-reed-1851786015">based on their movie appearances</a></span>, but those unfortunately aren’t live until tomorrow, July 25, so the default skins will have to do.</p><p>The actors all face a bit of a learning curve, and Pascal even jokes about needing “console classes” to learn how to play. After some time in the practice range, the group entered a real online game, but Loserfruit asked the other players to “pls be nice” to the actors in chat. The cast passed the controller around during a match, and it wasn’t until Pascal played that any of them managed to get a kill on the enemy Venom. Well, an assist, but let’s not get technical.</p><p>Check out the full video below:</p><p>All four actors are pretty busy right now, so it’s not like they have time to become pro gamers in the midst of promoting <em>First Steps </em>and shooting their upcoming MCU appearances in <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>.

<p dir="ltr">While the number of approved foreign games has increased in recent years due to the approval process now occurring monthly instead of every two months, there was a period from July 2021 to March 2022 when no new games were approved for release. Last month, China approved a record 158 new games for release--a multi-year high according to Chinese news outlet <a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/china-approves-158-new-game-licenses-in-june" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yicai Global</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a big win for Blizzard, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-pc-titles-will-return-to-china-under-new-deal-with-netease/1100-6522533/" data-ref-id="1100-6522533">re-partnered with Chinese gaming giant NetEase in 2024</a> to re-release games like World of Warcraft and Overwatch 2 in China following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-and-netease-breakup-came-after-bobby-kotick-felt-threatened/1100-6512792/" data-ref-id="1100-6512792">licensing disagreements</a> that saw many Blizzard's titles, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chinese-wow-servers-shut-down-after-14-years-following-expiration-of-netease-agreement/1100-6510829/" data-ref-id="1100-6510829">including WoW</a>, go offline in the region for most of 2023 and some of 2024. It was during this period when many Blizzard games were unplayable in China that Diablo 4 released globally in June 2023.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard and NetEase have not yet announced an official release date for Diablo 4 in China, but when it does arrive, it will likely include a number of changes from the version the rest of the world plays. Previous Blizzard games in China have operated on their own separate, region-locked clients and servers and often receive region-exclusive events and cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">The Chinese versions of Blizzard games often bring various content changes in order to conform to Chinese government regulations. In the case of Diablo 4, that will likely mean less gore, fewer skeletons, and the removal of certain religious references. One thing is for certain, the Diablo 4 Necromancer and their skeletal minions will almost certainly look different in the Chinese version.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Diablo 4 news, Blizzard seems poised to bring big changes to its flagship ARPG, as content creators were recently treated to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">secret glimpse of the game's future</a>.

                <p>Following Microsoft's latest mass layoffs that affected around 9,000 people--including dramatic cuts at Xbox--CEO Satya Nadella sent a memo to staff that was shared on <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft's blog.</a> In the memo to staff, Nadella addressed what he called the "why, what, and how" of the decision to cut so many jobs.</p><p>Nadella said the decisions that led to the layoffs were "among the most difficult we have to make."</p><p>"I want to express my sincere gratitude to those who have left. Their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today. And for that, I am deeply grateful," he said.</p><p>Nadella also addressed what he called the "seeming incongruence" of how Microsoft made these dramatic cuts at a time when business is booming. Nadella said Microsoft is "thriving" by "every objective measure," but he chalked the layoffs up to "the enigma of success."</p><p>"Progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding. But it's also a new opportunity for us to shape, lead through, and have greater impact than ever before," he said.</p><p>Also in the memo, Nadella said when Bill Gates founded Microsoft decades ago, he did so with the belief that Microsoft could become a "software factory" that was "unconstrained by any single product or category." That idea is "no longer enough," Nadella said, adding that Microsoft needs to "reimagine" what its mission is. Microsoft is betting on AI, as it's investing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">$80 billion</a> into building out the technology and planning to bake AI into every product it makes, including Xbox.</p><p>"Just imagine if all 8 billion people could summon a researcher, an analyst, or a coding agent at their fingertips, not just to get information but use their expertise to get things done that benefit them. And consider how organizations, empowered with AI, could unlock entirely new levels of agility and innovation by transforming decision-making, streamlining operations, and enabling every team to achieve more together than ever before," Nadella said in his pitch for AI.</p><p>Going forward, Nadella said Microsoft will focus on three main areas: security, quality, and "AI transformation." For AI, Nadella said Microsoft will "reimagine every layer of the tech stack," including the infrastructure, app platform, apps, and AI "agents."</p><p>"Our differentiation will come from how we bring these layers together to deliver end-to-end experiences and products, with the core ethos of a platform company that fosters ecosystem opportunity broadly. Getting both the product and platform right for the AI wave is our North Star," Nadella said.</p><p>Regarding company culture, Nadella said team structures are changing, and things could get messy. "It might feel messy at times, but transformation always is. Teams are reorganizing. Scopes are expanding. New opportunities are everywhere," he said.</p><p>The cuts at Xbox included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">layoffs, game cancellations, and the closure of at least one studio. </a>It was later reported that developers at the Microsoft-owned Candy Crush studio King said they were <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">set to be replaced by the tools they helped build.</a> For its part, Microsoft has said it expects the rise of AI to lead to job losses in the near term, but that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">the opportunities that AI presents outweigh the challenges.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>11 Bit Studios has announced the console launch date for Frostpunk 2, which will arrive on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles on <strong>September 18, 2025</strong>. </p>



<p>While the release date was announced with a new trailer for the console's launch, it seems like the news has accidentally gone live early, since the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whxlgvwTZIk"> trailer published to YouTube is now set to private</a>. That doesn't mean you can't see the trailer elsewhere, since it was still downloaded and published by others before it was private.</p>



<p>And to match the fact that Frostpunk 2 is available in Xbox Game Pass for PC, it'll be available in Xbox Game Pass for console players when it launches in September.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Frostpunk 2 | Console Date Reveal Trailer</p><p>Coming to Day One on Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 on September 18th, 2025 <a href="https://t.co/oOaop5H5ow">pic.twitter.com/oOaop5H5ow</a></p></div>— VGT Gaming News (@GAMERNEWSonX) <a href="https://twitter.com/GAMERNEWSonX/status/1948392802900979880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Along with the console launch, there are still <a href="https://wccftech.com/11-bit-studios-reveals-revised-roadmap-for-frostpunk-2-console-ports-arriving-in-summer/">two more DLC expansions </a>currently scheduled to arrive before the end of this year as part of a previously revealed roadmap for the game, and a third, unnamed DLC set to arrive in 2026.</p>



<p>It's unfortunate for 11 Bit Studios that an announcement which seemingly wasn't meant to go live today has done so, but exciting for console players who have been eagerly awaiting its arrival on PS5 and Xbox Series devices since the game first launched on PC last September to strong reviews. </p>



<p>Wccftech's Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/frostpunk-2-day-after-tomorrow/">adored it when he reviewed it last year</a>, writing, "<em>Frostpunk is an excellent looking, excellent sounding, and great playing organic growth and succession from the original. Spreading further along the wasteland, you have to balance more as you deal with politics, resources, factions, and ever more challenges, often including settling and building in new areas. Still a challenge, but more approachable, this is yet another city builder that will shine out amongst others."</em></p>

                <p>One battle royale after another. After prolific <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-cel-shaded-superman-looks-incredible/1100-6532550/" data-ref-id="1100-6532550">crossovers with Superman</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fantastic-four-nikes-are-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6533214/" data-ref-id="1100-6533214">The Fantastic Four: First Steps</a>, Fortnite appears to be gearing up for a collaboration with the film One Battle After Another. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the upcoming thriller, slated for a September 26 theatrical release, isn't what anyone would consider fodder for Fortnite, making this crossover all the more intriguing.</p><p>The official Instagram account for the film put out a brief teaser, recreating a scene from the movie in which DiCaprio's character (replaced by Fortnite protagonist Jonesy in this teaser video) answers a covert call at a phone booth. "There are no hands on the clock. #OneBattleAfterAnother x Fortnite coming soon," the video's caption reads.</p><p>It's unclear what kind of content will come out of this collaboration, including whether it will take the form of skins based on the movie's characters or any missions given by NPCs on the battle royale map. Perhaps it'll be a Fortnite Creative experience with the purpose of promoting the film, but it's hard to imagine what that would look like.</p><p>One Battle After Another follows DiCaprio's character, an ex-revolutionary, reuniting with other fellow activists after an old enemy of theirs reemerges. The film also stars Sean Penn as the film's antagonist and Benicio del Toro, Regina Hall, and Teyana Taylor in supporting roles.</p><p>The possibility of playing as Leonardo DiCaprio or Sean Penn in Fortnite is pretty hysterical.

<figure><a title="dk speedrunners" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7df75ab55e798/dk-speedrunners.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've been absolutely addicted to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> over the past week or so and various members of the team are, as expected, at different points along the way in the adventure. Some, like this writer, are still fairly early on in DK's latest outing, whilst others, such as our very own Liam Doolan, are already done with the thing. No messing around there!</p>
<p>Now, very mild spoilers ahead, but by way of some of the old 'water-cooler' banter (proving once and for all that such a thing can even exist betwixt online colleagues), Liam shared with us that he'd actually managed to complete the game without unlocking one of Donkey Kong's transformations.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4rnumkp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Further to this, he hasn't even completed one of the layers. He skipped the entire frozen area of the game. All that lovely snow!</p>
<p>After a quick look online, and it seems Nintendo Life's crack squad of pro gamers aren't the only ones finding lots of new ways to beat the game and/or skip things in the name of speedrunning. On <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1m2ud1r/you_can_completely_skip_freezer_layer_and_zebra/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">r/DonkeyKong</a>, people are already sharing Liam's trick, along with a whole bunch of other ways to beat the game quickly.</p>

<p>Some of these techniques can be a little spoilery, so take care.</p>
<p>The video below, meanwhile, gives an indication of the sorts of things gamers are already doing in terms of mechanics, rather than simply skipping things.</p>
<p>There's some real potential here, as this post exclaims, as the Bananza transformations can be freely switched between once engaged. As seen in the vid, entire areas can be avoided if you use the right moves at the right time.</p>

<p>Another post on the forum claims to have only unlocked two of the five total Bananza transformations in the game, so we can only imagine that there's plenty more shenanigans ahead in the coming weeks and months.</p>

<p>We're genuinely feeling quite tired just considering trying some of this stuff. Whatever happened to just taking your sweet time, y'know?</p>

			<p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/6ogkWkxq1HusqpqGtQvCpn/assassins-creed-shadows-summer-roadmap-update">announced</a> its summer update for the Assassin's Creed Shadows roadmap, including the reveal that new game plus is getting added to the game next week, the player level cap is getting an increase, and the Claws of Awaji DLC is launching on <strong>September 16, 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>As far as what's coming next week, on July 29, 2025, Ubisoft is pushing an update for Assassin's Creed Shadows that will add new game plus, a level cap increase from 60 to 80, and some new Animus-related collectibles, and the arrival of Project 3. For new game plus, it'll be available once you've played through the final story mission and seen the credits roll, and all your gear, hideout progression, skill points, and character level will stay the same when starting a new game plus run. Discovered location, objective, and storyboard progression will all be reset. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Later in the summer in August, Ubisoft will push another update that adds a few quality of life updates players have been asking for, like being able to unfog the entire map by synchronizing every viewpoint in the game, and for PC players, Ubisoft is uncapping the framerate in cutscenes, so the game won't be swapping back and forth between a capped and uncapped framerate. Ubisoft is also giving players the chance to voice their concerns and feedback directly to the development team, with a Reddit AMA set for August 12, 2025.</p>



<p>The last highlight of today's announcement is the Claws of Awaji release date, set for September 16, 2025. This is also when a few more quality of life updates will go live, like being able to swap the time of day on the fly, and plenty of new gear rarities and equipment that'll come alongside the DLC.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Ubisoft celebrated Assassin's Creed Shadows <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-5-million-players-ubisoft-lower-performance/">hitting 5 million players</a> since launch, amid one of the company's other major franchises, Rainbow Six Siege, performing below expectations.</p>

That movie was independently produced and then picked up by Disney, and went on to become a big hit, spawning 14 sequels and spin-offs. Yes. That’s not a typo. There have been 14 follow-ups to a movie about a dog that plays basketball. Weirdly, most of them have nothing to do with basketball. </p><p><em>Air Bud Returns</em> is being written and directed by Robert Vince. He was a producer on the original <em>Air Bud</em> film in the ‘90s and then produced all 14 sequels, as well as writing and directing 10 of them.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/air-bud-returns-aint-no-rule-says-a-dog-cant-release-another-movie-302512830.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/air-bud-returns-aint-no-rule-says-a-dog-cant-release-another-movie-302512830.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s the official synopsis of the upcoming movie</a></span>, which is set to start filming this summer in British Columbia, Canada: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> In <em>Air Bud Returns</em>, 12-year-old Jacob has always dreamt of being a star basketball player. After the passing of his father, that dream felt even more impossible. But everything changes when he and his mom move into his dad’s childhood home in Fernfield. There, Jacob discovers an original VHS of the <em>Air Bud</em> movie in his father’s belongings and has a chance meeting of a stray golden retriever he names Buddy. Together they embark on a journey of healing, unite a team of misfits, and chase a championship. Through it all they learn to play from the heart, believe in each other, and always take the shot!</p></blockquote><p> “<em>Air Bud Returns</em> isn’t just another sequel or remake—it’s a unique story,” said Vince in a press release. “This movie will engage nostalgic <em>Air Bud </em>fans while introducing a new generation to the beloved basketball-playing golden retriever, Buddy. It builds upon the legacy of the OG <em>Air Bud</em> with all the fun, the magic, heartwarming scenes, and Buddy playing basketball. More than anything, it’s a deeply human story about a dog and boy, centered on themes of adaptation, redemption, and teamwork.”</p><p>I can’t say I’m excited for a new <em>Air Bud </em>movie, as the previous films have all been low-quality, straight-to-DVD garbage made on the cheap in an effort to milk a decades-old franchise. But hey, maybe this one will be good. Or not. There’s not a damn thing I can do to influence that. The universe is a chaotic place that can’t be controlled by any one person. Events happen. We live through them. <em>Air Bud Returns </em>hits theaters next year. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/air-bud-returns-air-bud-15-new-film-2026-poster-teaser-1851786906]]></content:encoded>

A multiplayer reveal is set for next week, where we'll get a sample of the game's new and returning modes, as well as how Battlefield's iconic classes will look in this new modern skirmish.</p><h2>How to watch the Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_BRbvYxgOY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c_BRbvYxgOY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Battlefield 6's multiplayer reveal will be livestreamed on Battlefield's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Battlefield" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube </a>and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/battlefield" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a> channels. Following the showcase, which will feature developers from Battlefield Studios, viewers will be able to watch press and content creators play the game's new multiplayer suite live.</p><h2>Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal start times</h2><p>Battlefield 6's multiplayer reveal will kickoff at 11:30 AM PT / 2:30 PM ET on July 31.</p><ul><li>11:30 AM PDT</li><li>2:30 PM EDT</li><li>7:30 PM BST</li><li>4:30 AM AET (August 1)</li></ul><h2>What to expect</h2><p>EA and Battlefield Studios have claimed that Battlefield 6's multiplayer reveal will showcase various elements of the multiplayer suite. Specific mention is made of new and returning modes, which lends some credibility to reports of a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">battle royale mode</a> coming to Battlefield for the first time in the franchise's history.</p><p>Besides the aforementioned battle royale mode, it is incredibly likely that the team will be showing off both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-leak-shows-off-rush-mode-and-it-looks-fantastic/1100-6532821/" data-ref-id="1100-6532821">Rush</a> and Conquest, which are arguably Battlefield's signature game modes. The former sees teams planting bombs at pairs of objectives on a small section of a much larger map. The completion of these goals unlocks another set of the map and another pair of bomb sites, until eventually the entire map is unlocked or conversely, the attackers are held off within the time limit.</p><p>Conquest is Battlefield's flagship mode, often touting each respective games' biggest player count, and features warring teams fighting over a series of points of interest in a Domination-like competition. Holding the majority of the points begins to deplete the losing team's respawn counter, which also goes down with every kill.</p><p>Given the emphasis on New York City in the game's initial reveal, a safe assumption would be that the team will show off a multiplayer map taking place there. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-teases-all-out-war-ahead-of-full-reveal/1100-6533382/" data-ref-id="1100-6533382">teaser trailer</a> ahead of the reveal also made mention of Georgia (the country) and Gibraltar, which suggests these could also be maps in the latest game. Expect to see a lot of player destruction of the environments, as well as an emphasis on urban warfare in a deliberate callback to some of Battlefield's most iconic multiplayer arenas.</p><p>Battlefield Studios has also been very open about how it's been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-add-something-close-to-an-ultimate-ability-for-each-class/1100-6533119/" data-ref-id="1100-6533119">tweaking Battlefield's classes</a> following criticism of the last major release in the franchise, Battlefield 2042. That game released with specialists, which were reminiscent of heroes in titles like Overwatch 2, and their implementation proved to be controversial to stalwart Battlefield fans, who felt like the change diluted what they loved about the tactical squad-based gameplay of the series' past. Expect to hear a lot about these changes, as well as other alterations made to character and loadout customization.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Forget <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/enjoy-8-inches-of-lego-shadow-the-hedgehog-this-october">eight inches of Shadow the Hedgehog</a>; forget <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/treat-yourself-to-22-inches-of-snake-with-big-boss-metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-statue">22 inches of Solid Snake</a> (until you're alone at least), and behold the terrifying majesty of Grounded 2's 10-foot ant plushie/gaming chair hybrid, which Microsoft is currently giving away to promote its upcoming sequel.
</p>
<p>
Grounded 2 is, of course, the follow-up to Obsidian Entertainment's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-review-a-delightful-mix-of-harsh-survival-and-warm-hearted-design">well-received 2022 co-op garden survival game</a>, which cast players as inadvertently miniaturised children - very much in the style of 80s movie favourite Honey, I shrunk the Kids - then set them loose in a backyard now transformed into a perilous landscape of towering blades of grass and truck-sized spiders.
</p>
<p>
Obsidian's sequel doesn't do much to shake up the fundamental premise - you're small again, but this time in a park - but that new location should hopefully spice things up, and then there are mounts. Yup, this time you can saddle up on insects and barrel around the place, bringing us back to that giant ant. Xbox's <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1948367630902931457">giveaway</a> features a monstrous plushie version of that aforementioned mount, sprawling threateningly across your gaming room floor and equipped with a little saddle you can pop your botty on, spread-eagled and ready for more survival.

One winner will walk away with (well, awkwardly shuffle away with) that 10ft gaming ant, which Microsoft officially refers to as "gaming furniture", if you were wondering.

<p>
As for Grounded 2 itself, it launches into PC early access and Xbox Series X/S "game preview" on 29th July, and our Bertie Purchase has been having a natter with Obsidian ahead of its release.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/24/ea-sports-fc-26-preview-hands-on-the-new-authentic-and-competitive-gameplay-modes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-fc-26-preview-%E2%80%93-hands-on-the-new-authentic-and-competitive-gameplay-modes.1252482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA is looking at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ea-sports-fc-26">FC 26</a> to be a major turning point for its football games, especially with the tagline ‘The Club is Yours.’ FC 26 is all about taking the feedback from the community of the past two FC games, as well as from the preceding FIFA games, and using that to address gameplay complaints that have persisted over the years. These are things like passing being too rigid, goalkeepers not being intelligent enough, animations not being reflective of reality, and player behaviours not meeting expectations.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 | Official Gameplay Deep Dive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0GE8YCIQF2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A core change in FC 26 is splitting the gameplay into two distinct and different styles, Authentic and Competitive. Authentic has been designed to give a real match day feeling and experience, based on what you would expect to see if you are watching teams in real life, while Competitive could be considered the more arcade style of what you expect from a video game, and that reflects in where they are going to be used. Authentic has been created primarily for single-player modes whereas Competitive is for the online modes including Ultimate Team.</p>


<p>The preview build of FC 26 gave us access to the single player kick off mode featuring both the men’s and women’s UEFA Champions League – Bayern Munchen. Paris St Germain, Liverpool, and Real Madrid for the men, and OL Lyonnes, Bayern Munchen, Real Madrid, and Chelsea for the women. Given the gameplay split, I flipped back and forth between the modes using the Professional difficulty.</p>


<p>Immediately, FC 26’s Authentic setting feels heavy and slow, with player attributes, including size, having a much bigger influence here. Slow players will not sprint for long, while nimble players will have the ability to hop between defenders. But the bigger defenders can easily bully smaller players off the ball too. During my matches, you could absolutely feel when a bigger player was trying to shoulder off a smaller player, but on the flip side you learn how to avoid this situation by wrong-footing bigger players and putting space between them.</p>
<p>As this is supposed to mimic real world football, you shouldn’t expect players to be constantly going end to end. It is quite methodical in where you must place your passes and position your players, and while it is more fluid than previous FC experiences, there is still some of that rigidity. There is a slowness to it that will be appreciated by some, as you probe defences looking for that moment you can break through, or learning precisely when to go in for the tackle and when to bring your keeper out to stop a shot. Mistime these moments and the opposition will punish you.</p>
<p>In the Competitive setting, which will be used for online modes, the restrictions on players are a lot looser. Suddenly, someone like Harry Kane is a natural sprinter and can bully their way into the box, dealing with defenders with ease. This setting is much more fast paced, with the ball pinging from player to player, the action moving incredibly quickly. It will be familiar to most FC players, and it might not be what some were hoping for, because defensive play comes second to offence again.</p>

<p>There is a clear gulf between offence and defence in both modes, though the women’s game seemed better balanced than the men’s at this point. Here are the scores from the 10 matches I played:</p>
<p><strong>Authentic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Real Madrid 9 – 0 Liverpool</li>
<li>Liverpool 6 – 0 Real Madrid</li>
<li>Bayern Munchen 4 – 2 Paris St-Germain</li>
<li>Chelsea 3 – 2 Bayern Munchen</li>
<li>OL Lyonnes 8 – 2 Real Madrid</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Competitive</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Real Madrid 7 – 0 Liverpool</li>
<li>Liverpool 8 – 0 Real Madrid</li>
<li>Bayern Munchen 9 – 0 Paris St-Germain</li>
<li>Chelsea 10 – 2 Bayern Munchen</li>
<li>OL Lyonnes 6 – 4 Real Madrid</li>
</ul>
<p>EA has said it has reworked goalkeeping in FC 26 to be more responsive, but there still is still discrepancy between goalkeeper behaviour and attacker behaviour. While playing, I noticed that when a keeper performs well when their defensive players are near them, but fall apart in one on one situations. In one example, as Salah I cut in from the right-hand side of the box, and Courtois kind of slid past leaving the goal wide open. Goalkeepers do have some more animations compared to previous entries, and it can cause some interesting situations with this early build. In one match Allison punched the ball up into the air and did so a couple more times while still surrounded by players instead of trying to catch it. Quite an incredible flex, when you think about it. Real Allison should take notes!</p>

<p>There has been an increased focus on player individualism so each one is more distinctive, and plays more like their real life counterparts. PlayStyles make a return with players having up to six of these equipped to showcase their skills. Examples of PlayStyles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finesse Shot+ – Faster finesse shots with max curve and accuracy</li>
<li>Precision Header – Increased accuracy for headers, Precision Header animations</li>
<li>Acrobatic – Perform volleys with improved accuracy, acrobatic volley animations</li>
<li>Aerial Fortress – Higher jmpus and improved aerial defence presence</li>
<li>Trickster+ – More unique ground and flick Skill moves, quicker strafe dribbling</li>
<li>Whipped Pass – Accurate, faster crosses with more curve</li>
<li>Rapid – Higher sprint speed while dribbling, reduced error on knock ons</li>
<li>First Touch – Reduced trapping error, faster dribbling transitions</li>
</ul>
<p>In my view, these seem to able to shine better in Authentic gameplay compared to Competitive, as you notice the differences between each player. Of course, these play styles will come into play in both settings and impact the way matches unfold. Archetypes are new addition to further individualise the top players in the game, and there is a setting where these players will act and react like they would in real life too.</p>
<p>From the preview build. FC 26 does show a lot of improvements over <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/25/ea-sports-fc-24-review/">FC 24</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/ea-sports-fc-25-review/">FC 25</a>. Gameplay is generally better, and the split between Authentic for single player modes and Competitive for online modes while give a new variety for players that switch between the two. However, there is still work to be done on the defensive side, as it is still really easy to get through the defence and beat keepers one on one.</p>

<p>Coming January 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>NIS America has revealed that the next entry in the expansive turn-based RPG franchise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Trails Beyond the Horizon</a>, will launch on Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>15th January 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This announcement follows the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/trails-beyond-the-horizon-slips-to-early-2026-but-its-also-coming-to-switch-2">game's delay just last month</a> from its Fall 2025 date, where the Switch 2 version — which is a Game Key-Card — was also revealed.</p>
<p>Taking place across the continent of Zemuria, Trails Beyond the Horizon is the third game in the Calvard Arc, and the 13th game in the wider Trails series. You'll control three different protagonists throughout the adventure — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_through_daybreak">Daybreak</a>'s lead Van Arkride, the founder of Arkride Solutions and a Spriggan; Rean Schwarzer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_of_cold_steel_iii">Cold Steel</a>'s protagonist and the Ashen Chevalier; and Kevin Graham, a high-ranking member of the Septian Church who hasn't been seen since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_to_azure">Trails to Azure</a>.</p>
<p>The game features a robust blend of turn-based and real-time combat, which legendary Japanese developer Nihon Falcom has been steadily improving over the course of the series. The game will be playable at PAX West later this year, so if you're heading there, keep an eye out for the booth!</p>
<p>Let's get a better rundown of what to expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Van Arkride and the members of Arkride Solutions are back, and this time the future of the entire Zemurian continent is at stake! The people of Zemuria await the launch of humanity's first foray into space with bated breath. A sudden invitation from Marduk to cooperate in a high-tech training exercise sets Van, Ashen Chevalier Rean Schwarzer, and Father Kevin Graham on a collision course with the secrets at the very core of Zemuria.</p>
<p>Their paths may diverge, but the ultimate question remains the same: Just what lies beyond the edge of the horizon?</p>
<p>● All Trails Lead Here: Paths from across Zemuria intertwine with higher stakes than ever before as the Trails series enters its final chapter!<br>
● Gameplay, Evolved: New gameplay mechanics such as Shard Commands,<br>
Awakening, and the time-freezing Z.O.C. give you an unprecedented amount of options in both Field and Command Battles!<br>
● Dream Teams: Gather allies from all over Calvard and beyond and put a stop to Ouroboros' machinations in the Grim Garten, a dungeon that you can take on with your own custom party!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's looking pretty fantastic, and will be an excellent way to ring in 2026 for RPG fans.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Release Date Indirectly Confirmed by Official Website]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-release-date-indirectly-confirmed-by-official-website.1252476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, renowned leaker billbill-kun <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october10-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> details on the Battlefield 6 release date. According to the insider, the game would be released on October 10, priced at €69.99/79.99 for the Standard Edition and €99.99/109.99 for the Phantom Edition, with the PC version being €10 cheaper as with most games.</p>



<p>Today, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debut trailer</a> and the news that the reveal event would take place on July 31, eagle-eyed spotter Wario64 has already <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1948404850288427225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> some fine print on the official Battlefield 6 website that practically confirms the aforementioned release date as correct.</p>



<p>On the legal disclaimers, it is confirmed that pre-order offers will expire on October 10, which makes perfect sense if that's the game's release date. Moreover, the codes can be redeemed for two years through October 10, 2027, as with most games. If rumors are to be believed, fans should get their hands on an <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Beta test</a> much earlier than that, though, possibly in early August.</p>



<p>As to the game itself, the developers did not reveal much today, except that the bad guys are the so-called Pax Armata, a private military corporation 'bankrolled by former NATO states' whose agenda threatens to plunge the world into global conflict. This sets the stage for what players can expect on the battlefield, in both multiplayer and the series's return to a single-player campaign, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being handled by Motive Studios</a>. </p>



<p>The press release also confirms a veritable return to the core tenets of the franchise in Battlefield 6: visceral combat, epic warfare, and player freedom. Players will be able to blow through walls, bring down entire buildings, and take to the skies in dogfights for a tactical advantage, but working together with your squad will still be the secret to victory.</p>



<p>Next week, all will be revealed through a series of live events taking place in Los Angeles, Berlin, Paris, and London, with another scheduled in Singapore on August 2. We'll have Kai on the ground in LA to report his first impressions on the long-awaited next chapter in the Battlefield series. Stay tuned for his hands-on!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Officially Revealed, Release Date Seemingly Set for October]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-officially-revealed-release-date-seemingly-set-for-october.1252473/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has officially revealed&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>, and it looks like the first-person shooter will be launching across PC and current-gen consoles in October.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>will revolve around the conflict between NATO and a fictional private military company known as Pax Armata, which translates to "armed peace" in Latin. How very appropriate.</p>

<p>The new game will bring "high-intensity infantry combat", along with aerial dogfighting, tank combat, and more. Of course, since this is a&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game, you'll also have the ability to destroy the environment around you "for a strategic advantage", as EA says.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-revealed-destruction.jpg?itok=3tx_G83C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-revealed-destruction.jpg?itok=jxhwnGSj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>has officially been revealed.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that the conflict in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>revolves around NATO and a PMC, it's safe to assume we're in for another modern setting akin to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 4</em>; basically, we're not going to get a period-piece historical warfare game along the lines of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield V&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 1</em>.</p>

<p>If EA's legal disclaimers for&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>are anything to go by, it looks like we can expect an October release for the game as well. As spotted by Wario64 on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3luptwxr5rh2f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, pre-sell offers for the game expire on October 10th, so that's likely the release date, although it hasn't officially been announced yet.</p>

<p>That would also chime with the fact that EA has previously revealed the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game will launch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate" rel="nofollow">sometime before March next year</a>, as will the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot (which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-skate-reboot-no-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">won't feature an offline mode</a>).</p>

<p>The debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>doesn't give away any gameplay, although it's fair to say we know roughly what to expect from this one if previous <i>Battlefield&nbsp;</i>games are any indication. Nevertheless, you can check out the trailer here.</p>




<p>EA has a lot to prove when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>. Following the player base's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/60000-battlefield-2042-players-want-their-money-back" rel="nofollow">hostile reception</a> to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>, EA CEO Andrew Wilson admitted in 2022 that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-says-battlefield-needs-lot-of-work-restore-reputation" rel="nofollow">it would take "a lot of work"</a> to restore the franchise's reputation.</p>

<p>In April last year, when EA announced the end of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042&nbsp;</em>seasons, the publisher also confirmed that the next installment in the&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-2042-seasons-ending" rel="nofollow">would be a co-development effort</a> between four studios: DICE, Motive, Criterion, and Ripple Effect.</p>

<p><i>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</i>is set to launch sometime in the future for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807960/Battlefield_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10009568/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/battlefield-6/9p2ff14jzll3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. A multiplayer gameplay reveal is due to air next week, so stay tuned for that.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has been revealed, all official-like, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oops-battlefield-6-features-revealed-by-leaked-battlefield-labs-footage">after months of leaks</a>. And what a reveal it was, with a trailer featuring enough explosions to satisfy Michael Bay for at least two hours - though without a release date to accompany it.</p>
<p>Yep, we'll have to wait a bit longer to see if the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-release-date-appears-to-have-leaked-jumping-the-gun-ahead-of-its-reveal-trailer">October date recently cited by a prominent leaker</a> is on target, as for now all we got was a tease of the campaign that ended in promo for a multiplayer reveal next week. Which, to be fair, is a chef's kiss way to have done things if EA's aim was to be totally on brand for today's big shooters.</p>

<p>Despite the game's teaser trailer making a big deal of NATO being under attack, and featured various European cities, this trailer looked to be tapping more into the typical American jingoism both this series and its brother in big shootering Call of Duty have embraced at various points over the years. While the latter's now got Beavis and Butthead in it, this reveal was very much flying the flag for Battlefield 6 being back in its grimy, realistic modern-day military guise, at least as far as the singleplayer's concerned.</p>
<p>The game also really seems to hate helicopters, with the two-minute trailer featuring no less than four rotored birds having a bad time in various crashy and explodey ways, as things cut between cinematic action and a US president talking about an attack by the Pax Armata private military corporation. They're shaping up to be Battlefield 6's main baddies, further hinting in my eyes that it might be a bit of a 'Can you believe these mercenaries do war for money? You should do it for honour and nationalism like we do' sort of tale.</p>
<p>The trailer ended with the announcement that the game's multiplayer bit will be getting its own reveal on July 31st. That'll kick off at 7:30 PM BST / 2:30 PM ET / 11:30 AM PT / 8:30 PM CEST, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_BRbvYxgOY">link's already live</a> if you want to sit in chat for the whole week gradually typing out the lyrics to every anti-war song ever written.</p>
<p>EA promise it'll showcase some maps, as well as new and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-over-a-week-on-from-the-last-one-theres-a-fresh-battlefield-6-leak-here-that-shows-the-return-of-rush">returning modes</a> you'll be able to battle your way through the fields of. That's the same EA, of course, who are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late">reportedly hoping 100 million people</a> will join you in those killing fields. Given how the trailer went, I assume that means they'll have 100 million spare helicopters on standby.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-has-finally-been-revealed-with-a-firmly-anti-helicopter-trailer-and-no-release-date]]></content:encoded>

You save $20 off the digital copy of the game, and with Switch 2 stock being all over the place, locking one in now isn’t a bad move.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokemon TCG</a> side, both the Black Bolt and White Flare Elite Trainer Boxes have dipped below Amazon pricing on TCGPlayer, now sitting at $91.50 and $90.98, respectively. That’s some of the best pricing we’ve seen outside of limited restocks, and probably your best shot at avoiding inflated third-party listings (although it's still way over MSRP).</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in today’s deals, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is $799.99 at Best Buy, which is $500 off its usual price and a great buy for an unlocked flagship. ROG Ally is also down to $499.99 with the Z1 Extreme chip and 512GB storage, which makes it one of the better portable gaming options if you want full Windows access. Soundcore P20i earbuds are just $19.98, the Anker 332 Power Strip is $15.99, and the upgraded 100W Anker Nano Charging Station is $35.99. All three are practical, everyday gear at their lowest prices in weeks.</p><p id="switch-2-pokmon-legends-z-a-bund"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A Bund">Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225666"><div id="225666" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Launching the same time as Pokémon Legends: Z-A, this bundle knocks a cool $20 off the digital price tag of the game (digital code included). We're not at the custom limited edition console point of the Switch 2's life cycle yet, but this is a smart way to secure the system and save some money whilst doing it. Just preorder quickly - I'm amazed Best Buy still has it live.</p></div><p id="pokmon-legends-z-a"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A">Pokémon Legends: Z-A (Switch 2)</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225675"><div id="225675" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This $69.99 version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the Switch 1 game with the Switch 2 upgrade included. From what we've seen so far, we're talking 4K resolutions running at a buttery smooth 60 frames per second. Real-time battles, a fully explorable Lumiose City, and nighttime Z-A Royale events all benefit from the sharper visuals and faster load times. If you're already going in on a Switch 2, this is the version to get. It looks like the most technically ambitious Pokémon game yet, and Switch 2 seems to be the only way to experience it at its best.</p></div><p id="pokmon-legends-z-a"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A">Pokémon Legends: Z-A (Switch 1)</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225676"><div id="225676" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not ready to upgrade to a Nintendo Switch 2 yet, the Switch 1 version still has an upgrade path so you have options down the line. Legends Z-A switches things up with real-time battles, an urban setting in Lumiose City, and the full return of Mega Evolutions, including 27 new forms like Mega Dragonite. The starter picks are a nice throwback, but what really caught my attention is the Z-A Royale system and Alpha Pokémon lurking across the city at night. Add in deep trainer customization and the Switch 2 upgrade option, and it’s clear the developers are trying to evolve more than just the Pokémon this time. If it plays as good as it sounds, this could be the next real shift for the series.</p></div><p id="black-bolt-elite-trainer-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box">Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225517"><div id="225517" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The fluxuations on this Elite Trainer Box has been crazy this week, but TCG Player finally has listings cheaper than Amazon starting at $91.50, around $20 cheaper than the big box giant.

You’re getting a 200 megapixel camera, a sharp 6.8 inch OLED display, and enough power to handle anything. It works with nearly every carrier and still includes a built-in stylus, which is rare and actually useful.</p></div><p id="rog-ally-amd-ryzen-z1-extreme-512gb"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="ROG Ally AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme 512GB">ROG Ally AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme 512GB</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225763"><div id="225763" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>ROG Ally AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme 512GB</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At $499.99, this is the lowest I’ve seen the ROG Ally go with the Z1 Extreme chip and 512GB of storage. It runs Windows, so I can launch anything I already own on Steam or Game Pass without workarounds. The 120Hz screen is sharp and responsive, and I like that I can dock it or plug in a mouse and keyboard without needing extra gear.</p></div><p id="soundcore-wireless-earbuds"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Soundcore Wireless Earbuds">Soundcore Wireless Earbuds</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225764"><div id="225764" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Soundcore Wireless Earbuds</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At $19.98, these are about as cheap as I’ve seen for wireless earbuds that aren’t complete junk. You get 10 hours on single a charge, decent sound with actual bass, and the app gives you EQ control if you want to tweak things. Call quality is fine with two mics, and they’re small enough to carry around without thinking about it. For under twenty bucks, they do what they’re supposed to without falling apart.</p></div><p id="anker-332-usb-c-power-strip-surge-pr"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Anker 332 USB C Power Strip Surge Pr">Anker 332 USB C Power Strip Surge Protector</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225765"><div id="225765" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker 332 USB C Power Strip Surge Protector</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For $15.99, this is cheaper than most basic surge protectors and does way more. You get six outlets, USB-C charging with 20W power delivery, and a compact design that actually fits in tighter spots. It’s not going to blow you away, but it’s soound for a desk or nightstand setup, and the surge protection is better than the usual bargain bin stuff. At this price, I’d grab one just to stop moving my charger between rooms.</p></div><p id="anker-nano-charging-station"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Anker Nano Charging Station">Anker Nano Charging Station</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225766"><div id="225766" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker Nano Charging Station</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At $35.99, this is one of the few charging stations that can handle a laptop and still have room for everything else. Two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and three AC outlets is more than enough for a desk setup, and the 100W output means it actually charges a MacBook Pro properly. It keeps cables out of the way and cuts down on the need for multiple bricks. It’s compact, works well, and replaces at least two chargers and a power strip in one go.</p></div><p id="portable-neck-fan-with-led-display"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Portable Neck Fan With LED Display">Portable Neck Fan With LED Display</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225669"><div id="225669" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Portable Neck Fan With LED Display</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At $17.99, this neck fan is cheaper than a cumbersome handheld fan and way more useful. It's lightweight, quiet, and actually hands-free, which makes it easy to wear while working, traveling, or just trying to survive another summer heatwave. The LED display is a nice bonus since you don’t have to guess how much battery life is left, and the bladeless design means no hair tangles. Five speed settings and up to 15 hours of runtime for under twenty bucks? That’s a win.</p></div><p id="fourth-wing-wing-and-claw-collectio"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Fourth Wing (Wing and Claw Collectio">Fourth Wing (Wing and Claw Collection) (The Empyrean, 1)</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225670"><div id="225670" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fourth Wing (Wing and Claw Collection) (The Empyrean, 1)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're collecting The Empyrean series, this new edition of Fourth Wing is worth a look. It’s down to $23.09 right now, and the updated hardcover comes with stenciled edges to match Iron Flame and Onyx Storm, which should appeal to anyone trying to keep their shelf setup clean and consistent. This is a limited first print run for the U.S. and Canada, so it’s a good chance to own a unique version of your future favorite book series for a steal. </p></div><p id="iron-flame-standard-edition-the"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Iron Flame (Standard Edition) (The "> Iron Flame (Standard Edition) (The Empyrean, 2)</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225672"><div id="225672" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Iron Flame (Standard Edition) (The Empyrean, 2)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're already deep into Fourth Wing, grabbing Iron Flame for $13.92 is a no-brainer, especially with the list price pushing $30. The narration from Rebecca Soler adds a solid layer to the story, and this sequel dives straight into the brutality and politics of Basgiath without slowing down. Things are darker, the stakes are higher, and Violet’s got even more to lose. It’s long, intense, and exactly what fans of the first book are probably hoping for.</p></div><p id="anker-laptop-power-bank-25000mah"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Anker Laptop Power Bank, 25,000mAh">Anker Laptop Power Bank, 25,000mAh</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225671"><div id="225671" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker Laptop Power Bank, 25,000mAh</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The 25,000mAh capacity on this bad boy is enough to charge a laptop and a few other devices on the go, with the triple 100W USB-C ports make it way more versatile than your average power bank.

You’re getting all three Dark Knight films in 4K with HDR, plus Blu-rays and digital copies, all packed in exclusive Steelbook cases that are made for collectors. Nolan’s trilogy still holds up as some of the best superhero filmmaking, and if you're going to own it this is the version to get.</p></div><p id="funko-pop-plus-the-lord-of-the-rin"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Funko Pop!

It’s the glow-in-the-dark version, and Funkos usually hold up well over time on a shelf or desk (especially boxed). For the price, it’s a low-effort way to round out a collection or grab a gift that doesn’t feel like a cop out.</p></div><p id="bookoo-jump-starter-2000a"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="BOOKOO Jump Starter 2000A">BOOKOO Jump Starter 2000A</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225677"><div id="225677" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>BOOKOO Jump Starter 2000A</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>For Car/Boat/Lawnmower(8.0L Gas/6.5L Diesel Engine) </p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For under $35, this jump starter is a solid backup to keep in the car, especially with how often batteries can die without warning. It’s rated for larger engines, works in extreme temperatures, and includes extras like USB ports, a flashlight, and a hard case for storage. Most jump starters at this price don’t offer that kind of flexibility or power.</p></div><p id="tamashii-nations-x-men-cyclops"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TAMASHII NATIONS - X-Men - Cyclops (">TAMASHII NATIONS - X-Men - Cyclops (GAMERVERSE)</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225678"><div id="225678" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>TAMASHII NATIONS - X-Men - Cyclops (GAMERVERSE)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyclops GAMERVERSE S.H.Figuarts figure from Tamashii Nations is now up for preorder at Amazon for $100, and it's packed with the kind of articulation and premium detail the line is known for.

The new line of KRK Kreate studio monitors aren't just for recording music (Although they'd do an amazing job), they're a versatile sound option for content creation, editing, gaming, watching TV and movies and more. Buyers can even teather to them via Bluetooth for no fuss connections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been using the 8-inch speaker models for a couple of weeks now, and they destroy my soundbar and subwoofer combo that costs nearly double the price. There's precision adjustments knobs on the back, which I keep mostly in neutral with volume up by half for a crisp flat sound with the right amount of bass. Although that can be cranked up when needed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I use an audio splitter so my Krate 8s can handle my Nano QuadCortex guitar amp moddler, my TV audio and gaming PC audio for the best experience. For me, going from a 3-inch to 8-inch speaker option is night and day. The clarity difference and range is top-tier, not to mention the jack, XLR and aux outputs available on each monitor that fits in perfectly in everyone's setup.
