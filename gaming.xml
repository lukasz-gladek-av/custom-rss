			<p>Following a string of successful releases, Bethesda has struggled to deliver the same level of quality it did with <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/skyrim-special-edition-review-when-some-polish-is-not-enough/"><strong>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</strong></a></em>. Although <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-76-wearisome-wasteland-wandering/">Fallout 76</a></strong></em> has received <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-76-wastelanders-country-roads-take-me-home/"><strong>significant improvements</strong></a> since its launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/"><strong><em>Starfield</em></strong></a> has yet to receive the same treatment, as, aside from some minor improvements and additional content, the latest open-world RPG from the studio is essentially still <strong>the same game it was at launch in late 2023.</strong></p>



<p><span>Though it is undeniable that the game feels&nbsp;<strong>a little dated</strong>&nbsp;compared to other modern open-world role-playing games, the Skyrim design lead thinks Starfield would have been&nbsp;<strong>received</strong>&nbsp;much better if it were put out by <strong>another studio</strong>, without the burden of very high expectations</span>.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pressboxpr.co.uk/news/bruce-nesmith-exclusive-skyrims-design-lead-on-where-he-would-set-the-elder-scrolls-6-and-what-to-expect-from-the-future-of-fallout"><strong>PressBox PR</strong></a>, Skyrim's design lead Bruce Nesmith was asked about the incredibly high expectations many have for <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-quite-playable-state-though-release-window-remains-unknown-rumor/"><strong>The Elder Scrolls 6</strong></a></em> and the inevitable<em> <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-according-to-new-report/"><strong>Fallout 5</strong></a></em>, and how the "<em>game of expectations"</em> may <strong>impact</strong> the perception of both games.</p>



<p><em>"I am very fond of a phrase called the game of expectations, and I've been trotting the game of expectations out for well over a decade. Bethesda's in the bad position of having expectations being so high they cannot be met,"</em> said Nesmith. "<em>Managing expectations is the number one thing a good marketing department has to do. Let's take a look at Starfield. Let's assume that a new studio had put out Starfield. I suspect it would be talked about like the second coming. But because it was released by Bethesda, the expectations were so much higher that it was seen differently. Starfield is a good game. It's a very good game. It's just not the game that people expected it to be."</em></p>



<p>Although Bethesda lost this <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"game of expectations" </em>with <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Starfield</em>, the studio is in a<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> better position</strong> for both<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> The Elder Scrolls 6</em> and<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> Fallout 5</em>, as, according to Nesmith, the high expectations for <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Skyrim</em> coming from <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion</em> (whose remake proved successful enough on all formats, although <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/around-half-of-oblivion-remastered-players-on-ps5-played-for-less-than-15-hours-nostalgia-is-powerful-but-only-so-much/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">nostalgia didn't translate into great player engagement</strong></a>) and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout 4</em> were fully met. However, it won't be easy: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Boy, do they have their work cut out for them,"</em> Nesmith said, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">agreeing</strong> with former Bethesda Lead Artist Nate Purkeypile about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-do-you-beat-that-why-the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-no-win-situation/"><strong>challenges the sixth entry in The Elder Scrolls series will face.</strong></a></p>



<p>While <em>Starfield</em> has not met the high expectations of Bethesda's fans, the game reportedly has <strong>a shot to do so</strong> with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-might-get-cyberpunk-2077-2-0-style-update-ps5-switch-2-launch-2026/"><strong>rumored massive update</strong></a>. Allegedly launching this year when the game will hit PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2, this "Cyberpunk 2.0 style" update will <strong>address some of the most common complaints</strong>, such as load screens, improved space flight, and more.</p>



<p>Will this be enough to <strong>make players return</strong> to a game that had a lot of potential that was ultimately squandered by a series of questionable game design choices? Only time will tell.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Black Tabby Games has revealed that its surreal horror visual novel <em>Slay the Princess </em>has reached a new sales milestone, and the studio has divulged sales figures for <em>Scarlet Hollow </em>as well.</p><p>Per a new press release, <em>Slay the Princess </em>has managed to reach a million sales across all platforms. As a reminder, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slay-princess-is-new-time-loop-rpg-with-gorgeous-art" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="24809200-53e9-4bd9-816c-f6276e727e7a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">launched on PC first back in October 2023</a> before getting itself a console release in 2024.</p><p>Black Tabby's Tony Howard-Arias says the studio, which consists of Tony and their partner Abby, is "immeasurably grateful" for the reception <em>Slay the Princess </em>has garnered, and they express hope that the game's success means people will realize "visual novels are a serious medium".</p><figure role="group">

<p>It's not just <em>Slay the Princess </em>that is celebrating a new sales milestone. Black Tabby's first game, <em>Scarlet Hollow</em>, has managed to hit 100,000 sales since the release of its first episode back in June 2021.</p><p>The two games are very different prospects, of course; <em>Slay the Princess </em>is a self-contained experience with an absurd amount of branching and reaction to player choice, while <em>Scarlet Hollow </em>is...well, it's also that, but it's episodic, so the whole game hasn't yet seen the light of day.</p><p>Black Tabby is working to rectify that, however. <em>Scarlet Hollow</em>'s fifth episode is due to arrive on February 13th (that's next Friday at time of writing), and per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1609230/view/499470950023038028" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">progress update</a> on Steam, the episode currently "contains roughly 300,000 words", although much of that will be confined to branching paths.</p>
<p>If you haven't checked <em>Slay the Princess </em>out yet, it's a visual novel that combines distinctive pencil sketch-like art with a recursive narrative about, well, slaying a princess.</p><p>I don't want to spoil the game's many surprises, but suffice it to say there's more going on under the surface than that, so if you haven't yet, you can check it out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1989270/Slay_the_Princess__The_Pristine_Cut/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/slay-the-princess---the-pristine-cut/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/slay-the-princess-the-pristine-cut/9PG84GGVTSQV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/slay-the-princess-the-pristine-cut-switch/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Switch</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Just as the noise from the fan outcry about the disappointing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> finale</span></a><span> was starting to die down, another project from the Netflix sci-fi series is putting the Hawkins kids back in the limelight. </span><i><span>Stranger Things: Tales from ‘85</span></i><span> is an animated series that takes place between the main series’ second and third seasons, and all things considered, it looks pretty good in its first trailer.</span></p> <p><span>Netflix has pegged the show as a more kid-friendly “Saturday morning cartoon” take on </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, and it definitely comes off that way based on the clips we’ve seen thus far. It’s colorful, packed with jokes, and even the evil creatures from the Upside Down are kinda cute in its </span><i><span>Arcane</span></i><span>-esque art style. The main cast of characters are returning in the series, but they are notably not voiced by any of their live-action actors. All of them are grown now, so they probably couldn’t voice their younger selves anyway, and they definitely sound like kids in this first trailer, which you can view below:</span></p>

  <p><span>While the fifth and final season of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> created a whirlwind of controversy after some fans were </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><span>disappointed in its conclusion</span></a><span>, even prompting some to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><span>spin a conspiracy theory</span></a><span> that a secret finale was coming that would </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-conformity-gate-secret-netflix-crash-2000658155"><span>address all their grievances</span></a><span>, maybe </span><i><span>Tales from ‘85 </span></i><span>could serve as a low-stakes palate cleanser? I also wouldn’t be surprised, though, if the people who were that dissatisfied with season 5 just wash their hands of the series altogether and don’t watch the show. Which is valid. Live your truth, Byler shippers. Just, you know, be normal about it instead of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/saturday-night-live-snl-stranger-things-finn-wolfhard-2000661307"><span>harassing the creators of the show</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><i><span>Stranger Things: Tales from ‘85 </span></i><span>will premiere on Netflix on April 23.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Console boundaries are constantly shifting, especially concerning Xbox. It seems like most of their titles are playable on other platforms, and plenty of them are available as part of the Game Pass service.</p>







<p>When it comes to third-party titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a>, though, it’s not always a guarantee that they’ll appear on Xbox, let alone on Game Pass. If you were hoping to pick up Suda51’s latest title on Game Pass, then allow Insider Gaming to let you know if you stand a chance.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-romeo-is-a-dead-man-available-on-xbox">Is Romeo Is A Dead Man Available On Xbox?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Green like Xbox. Image by Grasshopper Manufacture.<br></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Romeo Is A Dead Man will be available to play on both Xbox Series X|S.</strong></p>



<p>Suda51’s titles have appeared on Xbox platforms in the past, so it’s not surprising that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-romeo-is-a-dead-man-have-early-access/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/does-romeo-is-a-dead-man-have-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a> will be available on the Series X|S. With the latest and greatest consoles available, expect to see bloody and gory brilliance like Grasshopper Manufacture has never displayed before.</p>







<p>However, while it may be available on the console, that doesn’t mean it will necessarily appear on Xbox Game Pass. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-romeo-is-a-dead-man-coming-to-game-pass">Is Romeo Is A Dead Man Coming To Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Whilst Romeo Is A Dead Man will be playable on Xbox consoles, it won’t be available as part of the Xbox Game Pass service. </strong></p>



<p>Whilst it may not launch on the service, that’s not to say that it will never be available there in the future. Xbox often pick up third-party titles after they’ve released and includes them as part of the deal—maybe Romeo Is A Dead Man could feature down the line?</p>



<p>If it ever does, Insider Gaming will be the first to let you know, so keep your eyes peeled on the site and the official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" id="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> for Xbox Game Pass updates. </p>

            <p>If you think we've had enough takes on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/harvest-moon">Harvest Moon</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> formula, think again. Starsand Island is almost ready to invite players into a "peaceful paradise," and its looks alone could seal the deal for many lapsed farmers.</p>
<p>The game, teased again during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-xbox-tokyo-game-show-broadcast">the last Tokyo Game Show</a>, comes from Chinese developer Seed Sparkle Lab, who has decided to first drop it on Steam Early Access and Xbox Preview in order to "finalise the comprehensive content and finesse the end-game experience." After that period, which is supposedly ending in mid-2026, the game will hit 1.0 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966320/Starsand_Island/">Steam</a>, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and even macOS.</p> <figure>

<p>On top of the striking cozy anime aesthetic covering it all, Starsand Island's secret weapon might be its bigger focus on side activities which aren't strictly related to running a farm and more open-ended building and customization options. NPC relationships and fluffy animal companions will play huge roles as well.</p>
<p>There's even vehicles like roller blades and hoverboards, with cars and motorbikes serving as bigger, more traditional means of transport. Online multiplayer won't be supported when the game hits early access on 11th February, but it's coming with the full release. In fact, the devs are encouraging cooperative crafting and construction through "extensive DIY" systems that aim to remove a few of the usual guard rails.</p><p>The developers have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starsandisland/comments/1kbfutr/why_we_created_starsand_island_every_choice/">quite open about the entire creative process</a> for months now, and that included <a href="https://imgur.com/PrlU0ZU">shooting down accusations of genAI use</a>. Our quick look at the game's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ErpRrv2jbm">official Discord server</a> has also revealed a strong anti-AI stance in its community, so at the time of writing, it <em>seems</em> free of slop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, I’d like to talk about Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds.</p>
<p>It has received high ratings, scoring over 80 on Metascore at “Metacritic” and earning an "Overwhelmingly Positive*1" rating on Steam's customer reviews. We recently announced that worldwide cumulative sales have surpassed 1 million units. However, initial performance did not meet our expectations, and we are aiming to sell approximately another 1 million units within this fiscal year. We aim to sustain long-term sales by encouraging players to enjoy the game over time through the continued support of the title including ongoing release of additional downloadable content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sega notes that its overall performance in the first half of the current fiscal year has been somewhat disappointing, citing lower-than-expected sales in the gaming division along with Rovio's performance in the entertainment sector.</p>
<p>The presentation highlights <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties</a> as a major full game release for the fiscal year, but we suspect it will probably want a few more big-hitters as the wider industry grapples with uncertain economies and price hikes across the board.</p>

            <guid>1422907</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Players in the United States have <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-console-wars-over-halo-on-ps-white-house-trump-ai-spartan-armor/">GameStop</a></strong>, players in Canada have <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-canada-has-been-sold-and-acquired-by-mcfarlane-toys-co-owner-stephen-tretrault-will-re-launch-as-eb-games-canada/"><strong>EB Games</strong>,</a> and players in the UK have <strong>GAME</strong> as their major gaming-dedicated retailers. Or at least, UK players did have GAME, as the retailer is set to close its last three remaining standalone GAME stores after it made creditors aware it would be entering administration, the UK phrase for declaring bankruptcy.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/frasers-owned-game-retail-signals-it-s-on-the-brink-of-collapse">Bloomberg</a> reported that GAME had entered administration, a report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/what-has-happened-to-game-the-game">The Game Business</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/uk-retailer-game-is-closing-its-remaining-standalone-stores-after-entering-administration/">VGC</a>) a few days later identified that the last three standalone GAME stores in the UK would be closed, as the company is once again on the brink of collapsing. It'll still operate its website, and players in the UK will still be able to visit locations that operate within larger Frasers Group-owned entities as concession stands, but it will no longer have standalone brick-and-mortar storefronts.</p>



<p>The British gaming retailer was acquired by the Frasers Group back in 2019, and over the years, the company has been cutting down on its services, like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">ending trade-ins in January 2024</a>, followed by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/game-reportedly-dropping-in-store-pre-orders-next-month">ending in-store pre-orders in July 2024</a>. And in between those changes, it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-game-braced-for-redundancies">laid off a "<em>majority</em>" of staff in April 2024</a>. </p>



<p>Ending pre-orders and trade-ins may be unique to GAME, but retailers dedicated to games across the world have suffered store closures and layoffs, including the aforementioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-reportedly-shutting-down-hundreds-us-stores/">GameStop</a> and EB Games. Plenty of players still buy their titles physically, but most are buying them on the digital storefronts available on their device, whether that's Steam, the PlayStation Store, the Xbox Store or the Nintendo eShop.</p>



<p>The writing has been on the wall for retailers dedicated to gaming for years now, and with GAME set to close its remaining standalone stores, it's the closing of a chapter in the business of video games. Still, back in 2023, the company's managing director, <strong>Nick Arran</strong>, denied that it would be turning away from selling video games to focus instead on selling toys and other physical items.</p>



<p>"<em>Gaming is our core business and we will be last man standing selling physical video games</em>," Arran said in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/game-we-will-be-the-last-man-standing-in-physical-video-games">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>. "<em>We see our place in the market as proving that there is a place for physical, whether that be the collector's editions, which we see as the vinyl of video games, or the gifter who doesn't want to wrap up a download code for Christmas. But we need to be realistic. We have a business to run and the expectation is this will decline. So we need to fill that gap</em>."</p>



<p>Three years later, it's tough to see the British retailer as the "<em>last man standing</em>" as a gaming-dedicated store if it doesn't have any stores around. Its concessions will continue, but if the company keeps declining, those may be gone sooner than later as well.</p>

            <guid>1422892</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s been over five years since Goichi “Suda51” Suda and his studio, Grasshopper Manufacture, developed a brand new concept, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a> is set to break that spell. </p>







<p>The upcoming bloody action-adventure title is on the horizon, and plenty of fans are dying to get their hands on it. If you’re struggling to wait for its release date, you might be wondering if Romeo Is A Dead Man has Early Access, and Insider Gaming has all the answers for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-romeo-is-a-dead-man-early-access">Is There Romeo Is A Dead Man Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Expect a bloody mess. Image by Grasshopper Manufacture.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, Grasshopper Manufacture is not offering any form of Early Access to Romeo Is A Dead Man.</strong></p>



<p>If you were hoping to get your hands on Romeo Is A Dead Man a little bit earlier than the rest of the crowd, then you’re out of luck. There will be no forms of Early Access for Suda51’s next title, meaning you’ll have to wait for its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-release-date-countdown-exact-start-times/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-release-date-countdown-exact-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a> like everyone else. </p>



<p>That’s not necessarily a bad thing, though. Paying more just to get a single-player title early seems to miss the point of Early Access—if there is one to begin with. </p>



<h2 id="h-does-romeo-is-a-dead-man-have-a-demo">Does Romeo Is A Dead Man Have A Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>Adding to the misery, Romeo Is A Dead Man does not have a playable demo, but that’s not to say there won’t be one in the future.</strong></p>



<p>PlayStation often offer two-hour-long demos for titles once they’re released as part of the PlayStation+ Premium service. Whilst there isn’t a pre-game demo to get a taste for Romeo Is A Dead Man, there’s a chance one could still come in the future, perhaps to that service in particular. </p>







<p>As things stand, though, the only chance you’ll have to play Romeo Is A Dead Man is by purchasing the game when it releases—standard procedure, all things considered.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-february-3-968/</link>
            <guid>1422886</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>How’s your week going? It has only just started, but let me know in the comments if anything amazing has happened. In the meantime, I know why you’re here. It’s because you want the best and fastest NYT Connections hints and solutions you can find anywhere online! Well, I’m more than happy to help you with that.</p>



<p>Read on to get today’s NYT Connections answers in a matter of seconds!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-3">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 3)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #968:</p>



<ul>
<li>CARD</li>



<li>WOOD</li>



<li>FOAM</li>



<li>DICE</li>



<li>BOARD</li>



<li>CUBE</li>



<li>QUARTER</li>



<li>HOLE</li>



<li>HASH</li>



<li>HOUSE</li>



<li>IRON</li>



<li>MINCE</li>



<li>WEDGE</li>



<li>LANE</li>



<li>LODGE</li>



<li>PUTTER</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Ways to chop food finely</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Give someone a roof and a bed</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> </em>You’ll find them in a golfer’s bag</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – Words that can follow “memory”</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 3:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-february-3-968">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, February 3 (#968)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CUBE, DICE, HASH, MINCE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BOARD, HOUSE, LODGE, QUARTER</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – IRON, PUTTER, WEDGE, WOOD</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – CARD, FOAM, HOLE, LANE</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>The Nioh franchise and Xbox don’t have the most solid of relationships, in all honesty. That said, let’s see if Nioh 3 is coming to Xbox, and if it will be a day-one Xbox Game Pass addition.</p>



<p>The first Nioh wasn’t on Xbox at any point, nor was Nioh 2. Things are so crazy in the gaming world that you almost expect to see any game appear on another platform. With new boundaries being crossed every day, let’s see if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nioh3.jpg" id="147929" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3</a> is finally <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox/" id="131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a>-bound, and if you, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/game-pass/" id="316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass</a> subscribers, are getting a nice bonus.</p>

<p><strong>There is no Xbox port for Nioh 3 on the Xbox One or Xbox Series X|S at launch, but one could be arriving later down the line.</strong></p>



<p>As it stands, you can’t play Nioh 3 on Xbox. The trend from the last two games repeats itself here. There’s no agreement between Team Ninja and Microsoft for an Xbox port. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-upcoming-soulslike-games-2026/" id="172993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soulslike</a> will be making its debut on PlayStation 5 and PC for now, but there’s room for an Xbox port in the future.</p>

</ul>



<p>It was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nioh-3-has-a-timed-console-exclusivity-deal-with-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3 has a timed console exclusivity deal with PlayStation</a>. The first six months of Nioh 3’s lifecycle will restrict it to the PlayStation as a console exclusive. However, after this, all bets are off.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean an Xbox port is happening, but this is definitely the closest Xbox owners will ever come to potentially playing a Nioh game on Xbox One or Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p><strong>Just like its official Xbox status, there will be no way to play Nioh 3 for free using Xbox Game Pass.</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>This again comes down to the game’s future. If Nioh 3 gets an Xbox console port later down the line, there’s every chance it could coincide with an Xbox Game Pass announcement,too. With the ever-increasing costs of Game Pass, Microsoft is surely on the lookout for ways to make the subscription service more appealing—offering Nioh 3 could be a big help!</p>

<p>Coming to Switch later this month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>French studio Seed for Seed — the developer behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pile_up_box_by_box">Pile Up</a> and <strong>Jump the Track</strong> — is bringing its cosy co-op RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/baladins">Baladins</a> to Switch on <strong>20th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Blending the tabletop co-operative experience with unique RPG gameplay, you and three friends can team up to explore Gatherac to help save the land, help the locals, and experience your own unique adventure. You can get a good feel of what to expect from the PC release date trailer up top.</p>
<p>As you'd expect from a co-op experience, you can pick and choose what class/character you can play as, like a Cook, a Dancer, or a fire mage. Or you know, your typical RPG job — a Luxomancer, who can "think outside the box".</p>
<p>But biggest draw here is the choose-your-own-adventure approach. Your choices matter in this game, with every decision shaping your adventure, leading to a lot of replayability. Perhaps with different friends each time!</p>
<p>For a brief rundown on Baladins, here are some details from its Steam Page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Choose your own adventure!</strong> Bring joy to the people of Gatherac with 1-4 players and let your collective choices shape the fate of this unusual world.</p>
<p><strong>- Be a hero!</strong> Play as one of five unique classes, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and watch your character grow as the story unfolds!</p>
<p><strong>- Play at your own pace!</strong> The story of the Baladins can be played in short sessions over the course of the whole campaign</p>
<p><strong>- Encounter a dragon!</strong> It wouldn’t be a fantasy roleplaying game without one!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yes, this might be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/icymi-paper-mario-styled-rpg-escape-from-ever-after-has-launched-on-switch">the second RPG of the day</a> with a <em>very</em> <strong>Paper Mario</strong>-like aesthetic, but Baladins is much different, as you've likely gathered.</p>
<p>The game launched on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1866320/Baladins/">Steam</a> back in May 2024, and it sits on a Very Positive rating after 116 reviews — hopefully, this console release will bring the whimsical adventure to more people's attention.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dragon Quest gets another great remake that’s perfect for newcomers]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/871307/dragon-quest-7-reimagined-review-ps5-switch-xbox</link>
            <guid>1422859</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When a video game series goes on for a long time, it raises a question for newcomers: Just where is the best place to jump in? In the case of <em>Dragon Quest</em>, there are nearly a dozen mainline titles, not to mention copious spinoffs and ports that span four decades of history. Of late, though, publisher Square Enix has been releasing a number of remakes that serve as almost ideal entry points for beginners who are intimidated by all of that baggage. And the new <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> might just be the best so far.</p><p><em>DQVII</em> was a pivotal game for the series when it launched on the original PlayStation, as it was the first with 3D graphics. For a franchise that evolves at a slow, deliberate pace, that was a big deal. Maybe that’s why this isn’t the first time Square Enix has remade it; the game also launched on the Nintendo 3DS under the new subtitle <em>Fragments of the Forgotten Past</em>. <em>Reimagined</em> builds on the core experience with a number of quality-of-life tweaks — you can see enemies before battle starts, for instance, and the game gives you a “previously on” story update each time you start it up — along with revamped graphics that make the game world look like a series of cute-as-heck dioramas. It doesn’t quite approach <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi">the handcrafted charm of <em>Fantasian</em></a>, but it’s close.</p><p>That stuff is great and makes <em>Reimagined </em>feel like a thoroughly modern game. But what really makes it a great entry point for <em>Dragon Quest</em> beginners is the way it’s structured. For the most part, every <em>Dragon Quest </em>is a standalone experience that tells its own story, so narrative-wise there’s no real issue with jumping into the series with any specific number, including the seventh game. But what makes <em>DQVII</em> unique is how its premise turns it into a series of episodes that are much more digestible than one single, epic quest.</p><p>Unlike most <em>Dragon Quest</em> games, and most other fantasy RPGs for that matter, <em>DQVII</em> isn’t set in one huge world. Instead, the game opens on a tiny island, one where the residents believe it’s literally the only place in the world. Of course, that turns out to not exactly be the case, as other islands slowly start to appear and you, the plucky hero, are also able to piece together magical tablets that whisk you to faraway realms.</p><p><em>DQVII </em>still has the epic scope of a traditional RPG, but this structure — which has you exploring these new islands and locations one at a time — makes it easier to both play in bite-sized chunks and remember just what the heck is going on. There’s an overarching story, but because each area has its own distinct storyline, the game ends up feeling almost like a series of chapters you tackle individually. I never really found myself lost in the story — thanks in part to the recap feature — nor did I find myself lost in the world itself, unsure of where to go next. And the islands are all pretty delightful places to explore; one moment you’re investigating a strange ritual in a giant volcano, the next you’re visiting a farming village where everyone has been turned into an animal.</p><p>It’s the combination of visual refresh, streamlined quality-of-life features, and less-intimidating structure that makes <em>Reimagined</em> such a good entry point. It’s also not alone. <em>Dragon Quest </em>has been incredibly popular in Japan since its inception, but has gradually grown its audience in the rest of the world. And over the last few years in particular, Square Enix has released a handful of titles that I consider to be great starter games. If you’re looking for something with a little bit more of a retro feel, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24297436/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">the remake of <em>Dragon Quest III</em></a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/840080/square-enix-hd2d-games-octopath-dragon-quest">part of the publisher’s fascinating HD-2D line of games</a> — manages to strike the right blend of depth and approachability. It’s straightforward in a way that turns into something like RPG comfort food. And for something larger in scope, there’s always <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/28/17790204/dragon-quest-11-review-ps4-steam"><em>Dragon Quest XI</em></a>, the most recent mainline entry in the series, which takes the familiar<em> DQ </em>gameplay and bolts on high-end graphics and cutscenes that make it feel more like a modern epic.</p><p>But I think that <em>Reimagined</em> has those games beat when it comes to being welcoming. Every <em>DQ</em> game is charming, and every modern release has quality-of-life tweaks that make it more palatable compared to older RPGs. But the narrative structure of <em>DQVII </em>turns a huge adventure into a series of smaller, digestible stories, making it easier to play on your own terms. So if you’ve been wondering what the deal with blue slimes is, this is your best chance to find out.</p><p><sub>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined <em>launches on February 5th on the Switch, PS5, Xbox, and PC.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/871307/dragon-quest-7-reimagined-review-ps5-switch-xbox]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-34-curved-gaming-monitor-falls-back-to-its-lowest-price-in-weeks-to-compete-with-samsung-odyssey-2000660670</link>
            <guid>1422853</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When it comes to gaming monitors, you have an overwhelming amount of options to pick from and specs to consider. Not just deciding on a brands, but also size, resolution, refresh rate—all of these factors come into play when finding what’s best for you and your budget. Though there’s one detail that’s more important than the others. How <em>curved&nbsp;</em>is it? If you’ve never worked with a curved monitor, it may just sound like a cheap gimmick, but you couldn’t be more wrong. Asus happens to have one of its curved monitors on sale right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6994/">The 34-inch VG34VQL1B TUF curved gaming monitor has seen a price drop at Amazon, coming down from $369 to just $289</a>. That 22% discount adds up to you being able to save a whole $80 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6994/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="472">Fully Immersive Gaming</h2>
<p data-start="0" data-end="472">A curved monitor is really something you need to experience firsthand to fully appreciate its advantages. The Asus 34-inch monitor features a 1,500R curvature designed to mirror the natural curve of human vision and how we perceive our surroundings. When placed at the optimal viewing distance, this curvature delivers a level of immersion that flat monitors simply can’t replicate, filling your peripheral with what’s happening on screen.</p>
<p data-start="474" data-end="1149">The Asus curved gaming monitor supports refresh rates up to 165Hz through its two DisplayPort 1.4 connections and two HDMI 2.0 ports, while also offering compatibility with AMD FreeSync and NVIDIA GeForce Adaptive-Sync to eliminate screen tearing. With a rapid 1ms response time and a QHD 1440p resolution, the display provides sharp, smooth visuals that are well suited for a 34-inch screen. Color performance is impressive for its price range, and the variety of available ports makes it an excellent choice for both PC and console gamers.</p>


<p data-start="1151" data-end="1391" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The display is mounted on a stand that allows for both height and tilt adjustments. This enables users to fine-tune the viewing position for maximum comfort, making it easier to enjoy longer and more extended gaming sessions without strain.</p>
<p>As a little bonus, Asus has generously thrown in a 3-month license for Adobe Creative Cloud. This software suite comes with applications like Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, and After Effects. Normally, you’d be paying in the ballpark of $70 per month for an Adobe subscription, so you can see this as a $210 value included for absolutely free. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6994/">If this is something you happened to already be planning on subscribing to and now you don’t have to pay, you can think of it as this monitor only costing you $79.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New content continues to come thick and fast in Fortnite, which always leads to discussions about when the next major update is on the horizon, and v39.40 is right around the corner.</p>



<p>2026 has already gotten off to a flying start for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> behemoth, with major collabs with the likes of South Park and The Office, and Epic Games is showing no signs of slowing down.</p>



<p>Fortnite v39.40 is due to arrive this week, and Insider Gaming has all the important details on when it drops and an overview of the content set to be added.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-fortnite-update">When is The Next Fortnite Update?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Teaser. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite’s next update is set to arrive on Thursday, February 5, with Epic Games deploying v39.40 into the fold.</strong></p>



<p>Epic Games has settled into a fairly regular update schedule for Fortnite, with major updates and downtime coming every two to three weeks. With the last update occurring on January 22, it’s time for a new update.</p>



<p>This won’t be the final update of Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, however, as it’s likely there is at least one more update midway through the month before the new season kicks off in early March.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-in-fortnite-v39-40">What’s Coming in Fortnite v39.40?</h2>



<p><strong>Fortnite v39.40 is packed full of major collabs, including a brand new Fortnite Festival season.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festival-season-13-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Festival Season 13</a> is expected to feature Chappel Roan as the headline act, with teasers for her addition already appearing in the game and being uncovered in datamines.</p>



<p>It’s not just Fortnite Festival set to star, however, as Epic Games has already teased a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-teases-brand-new-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">big crossover with Honkai Star Rail</a>, which is expected to arrive in the update, along with the second wave of KPop Demon Hunter cosmetics, including a Jinu skin and Derp as a Sidekick.</p>



<p>The update will also see the end of the South Park collab and the departure of the Born in Chaos Mini Pass, so there are only a few more days left to claim all the rewards.</p>



<p>Additionally, there will also be some bug fixes and adjustments, as is customary with Fortnite patches, but the general gameplay won’t be overhauled significantly.</p>

<p>When it comes to breaking boundaries in video games, there are few who do it better than Goichi “Suda51” Suda. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a> is his studio’s first new concept in over five years, and it’s finally almost here.</p>







<p>If you can’t wait to see what Suda51 has cooked up next, then don’t worry, as Insider Gaming has all the release date information for Romeo Is A Dead Man down below.</p>

<p>That being said, February is set to be a busy month in the world of gaming.

We need to get the funniest person we can possibly find!"</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of a "month of anniversary surprises," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a> developer Arrowhead has formally introduced us to the "face of Freedom, the voice of Victory, the light of Liberty… John Helldiver."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a fascinating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2l2g6H2ekc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>deep dive</u></a> into the writing and casting of the iconic character, actor Craig Lee Thomas and lead writer Russ Nickel discussed developing the face and voice of the game that the fandom has dubbed, quite rightly, John Helldiver.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Casting was crazy," said Russ Nickel, Helldivers 2's lead writer between 2020 and 2022. "I did all the writing, and then the script went off sort of into the abyss, and I didn't hear anything for a while. Then I found out that it was going to shoot in a week. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"They actually hadn't really done any casting. They were just going to use this actor who's based in Sweden, who was perfectly good, but I was like, 'This is going to be John Helldiver!' (I didn't know that would be his name at the time). We can't just get someone who's good! Like, we need to get the funniest person we can possibly find!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"From the initial audition, you read for what you can as an actor, and you get excited about so many things," added Thomas, admitting: "But this in particular, as soon as I read it, I was like, ahh, I really, really, <em>really</em> want to do this." So, with very little notice, he recorded a quick audition tape and sent it off. The video includes Thomas' audition and even though his portrayal is a little less amusing than we've come to expect, there's no doubting that it's our John Helldiver. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Within a couple days, I had gotten self tapes from Craig Lee Thomas, who plays John Helldiver," Nickel explained. "He's <em>perfect</em>. I love that man. He's so good!" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2l2g6H2ekc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>15-minute featurette</u></a> on YouTube, complete with insights into the recording and mocap process, and some thoughts from the director of the opening cinematic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2's next Warbond 'Siege Breakers' will release tomorrow, February 3.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-review">Silent Hill f</a> was one of last year's biggest surprises and marked a return to form for the veteran horror game franchise (if we don't count the SH2 remake). With a strong cast of characters, a 1960s Japan setting, and a dense atmosphere, it made an impression on veterans and newcomers alike. Now, two members of the main cast have been made ambassadors of the city that inspired the game's rural village.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-actors-appointed-tourism-ambassadors-for-japanese-city-that-inspired-the-game">IGN</a>, we've learned about the surprising <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/fZn1IovXDYw">YouTube short</a> posted on 2nd February by Takeshi Masago and Tamami Hiraoka, who played Hinako's (the protagonist) father and mother respectively. At first, fans thought they had a serious announcement to make given the video's initial tone, but it all ends with excitement and screaming as they reveal they've been made tourism ambassadors for Gero City in Japan's Gifu Prefecture.</p>
<p>The Kanayama-cho area, filled with "narrow alleyways and old houses" that instantly look familiar, served as the main inspiration for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>'s fictional Ebisugaoka village. Here's an image of the real-life location:</p>

<p>The wholesome video also serves as the culmination of an ongoing saga that had many of the viewers following the pair of actors' clips together wishing they were married in real life (and hopefully in a healthier relationship than in the game). Many thought for a second they were getting married for real, but they're keeping things professional, so calm down.</p><p>Masago has also been promoting Gero City for a while now, <a href="https://x.com/okuhidashuzo/status/2017953960754286795?s=20">wine brewery included</a>. There's even Silent Hill f themed sake and chocolates now, with the first batch selling out instantly. It's yet another example of a Japan-set mainstream video game bringing lots of attention to certain areas of the country.</p>
<p>Only a few years ago, Tsushima Island got a massive boost to tourism following the release of Sucker Punch's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> too. That also led to the game's lead devs <a href="https://sea.ign.com/ghost-of-tsushima-ps4/169560/news/ghost-of-tsushima-lead-devs-named-ambassadors-of-actual-island">becoming permanent tourism ambassadors of the city</a>.</p>

			<p>Remember that sense of adventure you had as a child, eager to explore the world around you? Imagine how much brighter that would burn if your island was the only one in existence. Your father, a renowned sailor, has sailed the seas and found nothing but pilchards as far as the eye can see.</p>
<p>So starts Dragon Quest VII Reimagined. You set out with your best friend and the local prince, Kiefer, and quickly discover that the rest of the world is locked away under the sea by the villainous Demon King. Only you can put the world right, travelling through space and time to right historic wrongs and secure the future of your world.</p>

<p>While such grandiose stories are now the hallmark of JRPGs, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better originator of this trope than the Dragon Quest series. This entry, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined, is a complete rebuild of the original game released in 2000, reimagined for today’s era. It keeps the overarching narrative, but modernises pretty much everything else, from the visual styling, to the battle systems and the smaller elements of the story. Not only is this the best looking Dragon Quest game, it’s easily the most approachable Dragon Quest game to date.</p>

<p>First the graphics: at first glance, I must admit I was a little taken aback. I didn’t play the original or the 2013 3DS remake, so I watched the trailer wondering who this guy with a head the size of Lord Farquaad’s is &nbsp;– you can’t un-see it, sorry. And when the game started, your first companion was about as grating as Hermione Granger in the first Harry Potter film. The first few hours with them were slow, but after spending a little time with the game, these characters become endearing. Maribel is still vaguely annoying, but she’s part of the gang and clearly a good friend to the protagonist.</p>

<p>These characters (and the monsters they face) are really brought to life in Dragon Quest VII Reimagined. Their appearance is the result of painstaking work, creating and then scanning real-life dolls into the game to create something that looks incredibly real, and it combines beautifully with a diorama style to the environments. It is so effective that it sets a new high-water mark for modern remakes. If you don’t want to go the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">Final Fantasy VII route with ultra HD graphics</a>, this is almost certainly the way to go.</p>
<p>As to the gameplay, we are looking at something pretty formulaic. Distilled down, you go out searching for stone fragments. Collect a set and you can go back in time to right a wrong in a village filled with amusingly caricatured Irish/French/Arabic/English people. Once that’s sorted, you go back to the present to visit the island and collect more stone fragments.</p>
<p>Being formulaic doesn’t necessarily mean it’s bad. The locations you visit are varied and the events within them are unique. Sure, your characters aren’t quick on the uptake, and the puzzles laid before them aren’t overly difficult, but on the whole the gameplay is very engaging. I never felt bored playing this game and I enjoyed seeing what treasures each new island held.</p>

<p>This is where the modernisation really comes to the fore. Gone are the days of surprise encounters — as with the 3DS version, enemies walk around the overworld map and dungeons, and you can avoid them or gain a sneak attack if you’re diligent. The turn-based gameplay is interesting, with quality-of-life additions like auto-combat and instant kills for weak enemies really helping pick up the pace.</p>
<p>There’s also an overhauled vocation system, allowing you to moonlight as a second character class. You can now literally be a Warrior Priest or a Troubadour Martial Artist, which adds some interesting variety to combat. There’s also a powerful limit-break-esque system which can really turn the tide of battle.</p>
<p>And then there are the most granular difficulty settings I’ve ever seen. I played on normal difficulty, but in the interest of getting through the story before launch, turned on the ability to automatically heal after each battle. The ability to fine-tune the difficulty to your taste and needs really does meet the team’s goal of making this a game for everyone.</p>

<p>There’s a bevy of other changes that have been made to tighten up the pace and improve gameplay, but pacing is still a bit of an issue. Slow start aside, you’ll be dozens of hours in before you unlock your new vocations, meaning all that experience you could have been accumulating had been going to waste.</p>
<p>There are also issues in that you can tackle certain things in any order — I had Kiefer comment on the Demon King long before any of the NPCs uttered his name by way of exposition. Finally, we have the odd issue where (on the Switch) mashing B while talking to different people does different things — in a conversation with an important character you can turn down the opportunity to help them (bad), but with the priest asking if you intend to continue your adventure, B is the same as A. A truly minor issue, but something that caught our eye.</p>
