			<p>Resident Evil 9 is taking a long time to release because it will be a reinvention of the series, according to a well-known insider.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, well-known Resident Evil series insider Dusk Golem talked about the ninth main entry in the survival horror series by CAPCOM, saying that fans will realize why the new game is taking this long to release when it is revealed, as it is a big reinvention of the series as much as the fourth and seventh entries in the series were back in the day that will be very ambitious and will try new things that will make it play anything like its direct predecessors or the remakes. Dusk Golem also seems certain it will be revealed this year, so hopefully, it will be part of the usual slew of summer reveals in a few months.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">(2/2) is taking so long is because it's like a big reinvention of the series, to the same level as RE4 &amp; RE7. It's not going to play just like RE7/RE8 or the Remakes, it's trying new things &amp; very ambitious. It will almost definitely be revealed this year, so just hold tight.</p>
<p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1901499831455186984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Very little is currently known about Resident Evil 9 other than the fact that it has been in development for a while. <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-stalker-enemies/">Early rumors</a> suggested that Leon and Jill would play a big role in the game, but according to Dusk Golem, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-wont-feature-jill/">these rumors are not correct</a>. In development together with the next main entry in the series is also a Resident Evil Zero remake, which will be the next series remake to release.</p>
<p>Resident Evil 9 has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>
The latest <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> game did not perform well for publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, it's been claimed.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, which launched last autumn to a mixed response from fans, resulted in "large losses" for the company, <a href="https://kabutan.jp/news/marketnews/?b=n202503130535">Kabutan analyst Hideki Yasuda stated</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ffxvi-has-apparently-sold-3-5-million-copies-could-be-old-numbers-read-op.1133091/">ResetEra</a>/<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-sales-financial-report-large-loss-square-enix-sequel-unlikely/">TheGamer</a>).
</p>
<p>
Officially, Square Enix is yet to comment on Double Exposure's performance - and there's been no word on Double Exposure's sales figures pubicly at all. Deck Nine, the game's developer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-studio-deck-nine-makes-more-cuts-to-staff">previously announced layoffs at the studio in the wake of the game's launch</a>, and it's unclear what's next for the franchise - despite Double Exposure ending with a message stating that protagonist Max Caulfield would "return".

<p>
Last week, Square Enix issued its most <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/25q3earnings.pdf">recent financial results</a> - which largely focus on the sales of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake and the successful launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> expansion Dawntrail. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps tellingly, there's no notice of how Life is Strange: Double Exposure sold. Instead, Square Enix simply says that its HD gaming division's revenues had fallen due to the fact that unnamed "new titles generated lower sales"  than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster and Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince did over the same period during the previous year.
</p>
<p>
Square Enix doesn't state what the new titles that underperformed were, but does say that the launch of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D helped offset these losses, as it had performed better than initially expected.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Yasuda and Square Enix for more detail. The company is yet to release a transcript of the financial briefing that includes shareholder questions.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposures-first-two-chapters-are-mostly-good-but-making-fans-pay-extra-to-play-early-is-a-huge-mistake">Life is Strange: Double Exposure launched amidst a major backlash from fans</a> upset at how the game handled the ongoing storyline of returning protagonist Max Caulfield, and the impact of players' choice at the beginning of Life is Strange 1. 
</p>
<p>
The situation turned uglier when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-fans-upset-after-square-enix-removes-reddit-posts-featuring-leaked-content-anonymous-developer-comments">Square Enix removed leaked development material from a popular Life is Strange fan reddit</a>, including posts by several anonymous commenters who provided proof they worked at Deck Nine, and who made a number of claims regarding how Double Exposure's story had changed through development, shaped by feedback from Square Enix itself. In response, Square Enix said it had acted to remove the content based on "appropriate legal requirements" for "intellectual property violations".
</p>
<p>
"Like its own hero's dabbling with time travel, Life is Strange: Double Exposure highlights the troubles of trying to revisit old memories, while raising unanswered questions about the future," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review">Eurogamer's Life is Strange: Double Exposure review</a>.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/repo">R.E.P.O</a> is a six player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> extraction spooper that currently sits atop Steam's best seller charts, having amassed around 70k players the week following early access launch on Feb 26, and another 160k since then. That's around 230 thousand players avoiding knifey chef frogs and persistent ducklings while extracting valuables to fill a cash quota. It's a bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> but even heavier on the absurdity.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this popularity comes down to two things. Firstly, the game is a verdant flub factory, stuffed with the sort of chaotic physics mishaps that translate very well to short video clips. Even the loot extraction point can kill you if lingered in too long. Secondly, the 'Jim Henson does <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> Automata' robots you play as flap their mouths in time to your mic chatter, making even the most bowel-curdling fear shrieks from your teammates look like a hammy comedy routine.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I'd usually emit a croaking complaint about being too old for anything viral - the acrid dust cloud from my throat lingering in the air momentarily before cascading downwards and coating me in a grimy sheen of irrelevancy - but R.E.P.O. actually looks great. As it stands, though, you need five willing friends to play: a truly biblical quantity of mates, in the sense that it'd be faster to carve co-op partners from my own ribs than hash out that sort of byzantine scheduling.</p>
<p>Good news re: my organs staying shielded - developer Semiwork are planning on introducing public or private matchmaking. This'll come with a kick button to keep players honest, although they do say it's not quite that simple, since server coding is new ground for them. Here's the update video.</p>

<p>Joining ironmates mode is a new museum level, which they show off by demonstrating some award-winning box parkour. There's also some quality of life bits, like a border at extraction points to show when loot is out of bounds so you don't accidentally let it get crushed. Semiwork also show off a squinty, angry facial expression. Finally, there's a bucket you can pop over the duckling monster that likes to imprint motherhood on one of your crew then follow you around getting in your way and biting anyone that tries to touch it.</p>
<p>My current idea o' the day is Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin's concept of the 'chronotope' - time and space configurations as a kind of contextual bubble -  as mentioned by valued RPS community member #9976 in the comments to Sunday's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-80-days-heavens-vault-and-a-highland-songs-jon-ingold?view=comme">Booked For The Week</a>. A fifteen minute internet rabbit hole with coffee this morning led me to <a href="https://youtu.be/r4yluKPhTKE">this video</a> by the eminently listenable Belgian sociolinguist Jan Blommaert, who gives the example of a lecture: the space is the hall, the time is the lecture slot, and this particular chronotope encourages or necessities certain identities, roles, or modes of behaviour within in. An insightful framing of the twin navigations of interpersonal relationships and horror-harried spaces in social extraction games? You, uh, you might be starting to see why I'm enthusiastic about R.E.P.O.'s no-mates mode.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sony has yet to respond to IGN’s request for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the now deleted video, Sony Interactive Entertainment director of software engineering, Sharwin Raghoebardajal, has a conversation with an AI-powered Aloy via voice prompts and AI-generated speech and facial animations. Raghoebardajal asks Aloy how she's doing, to which she responds: "Hello, I'm managing alright. Just dealing with a sore throat. How have you been?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The voice heard coming from Aloy's mouth is clearly not that of Burch, rather a robotic voice similar to those heard from text-to-speech voice generators. AI Aloy's facial movements are stiff and her eyes appear lifeless as she converses with Raghoebardajal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Burch, who has voiced Aloy in all four Horizon video games released so far (Zero Dawn, Forbidden West, Call of the Mountain, and Lego Horizon Adventures) took to social media platform TikTok to confirm that she had seen the video, and that Horizon developer Guerrilla had got in touch to let her know that the tech demo did not reflect anything that was in active development, nor did it use any of Burch’s performance (facial or voice data). That presumably rules out AI Aloy for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off">the upcoming Horizon multiplayer game, assuming the character is in the game, and the inevitable Horizon 3</a>. However, as Burch pointed out, Guerrilla (and parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment) owns Aloy as a character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With all this in mind, Burch said the AI Aloy video left her feeling “worried about game performance as an art form,” and used it as a jumping off point to discuss the ongoing video game voice actors strike that has claimed a number of high-profile casualties in recent weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) issued an update to its members on the status of negotiations over video game actor AI protections, saying that while progress had been made, it was still "frustratingly far apart" with the industry bargaining group on key issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Currently what we’re fighting for is, you have to get our consent before you make an AI version of us in any form, you have to compensate us fairly, and you have to tell us how you’re using this AI double,” Burch said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I feel worried not because the technology exists. Not even because game companies want to use it. Of course they do. They always want to use technological advancements. I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it, that does have someone’s voice or face or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn’t have any protections, any way to fight back. And that possibility, it makes me so sad it hurts my heart. It scares me. I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors. I want there to be so many more incredible game performances. I want to be able to continue to do this job. If we don’t win, that future is really compromised.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m genuinely not trying to put any game company specifically on blast,” Burch continued. “Certainly not Guerrilla. The technology isn’t the problem. Game companies wanting to use the technology isn’t the problem. The problem is we’re currently on strike and the bargaining group will not agree to give us common sense protections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I support the strike. I’ve always supported the strike. I believe fighting is what we have to do to protect the future and the longevity of this career that we all love so much.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Burch then pointed to the temporary union contracts that currently give all the protections the striking voice actors are asking for, that any video game company can sign right now. “There’s the interim, the tiered, and low budget agreement contracts available right now for any game company to sign,” Burch said. “I believe we deserve to be protected.”</p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashly.burch/video/7481742753991314734" data-video-id="7481742753991314734"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashly.burch?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="@ashly.burch" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ashly.burch</a> <p data-cy="paragraph">let us speak on AI aloy</p> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7481742843657194286?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Ashly Burch" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ original sound - Ashly Burch</a> </section> </blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. It has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent"><u>The game failed</u></a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, that hasn’t put off a number of video game companies from using generative AI in the development of their products. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen"><u>Activision recently disclosed the use of generative AI for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assets</u></a> as part of new requirements on Steam, amid a backlash to an "AI slop" zombie Santa loading screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the voice actor strike has begun to impact a number of video games. Players have reported that games such as Destiny 2 and World of Warcraft appear to have certain NPCs left unvoiced in otherwise voiced scenes, likely due to the strike. Late last year, SAG-AFTRA struck League of Legends after Riot <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sag-aftra-strikes-league-of-legends-over-alleged-flagrant-violation-of-labor-law"><u>allegedly tried to subvert the strike by canceling a game in response</u></a>. And Activision confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-character-recast-after-players-expressed-concern-about-new-voices"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 characters were recast</u></a> after players expressed concern about new voices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zenless-zone-zero-voice-actors-say-they-found-out-they-were-replaced-when-the-patch-notes-went-live"><u>two Zenless Zone Zero voice actors revealed</u></a> they learned they'd been replaced when they saw the game's latest patch notes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Head of PlayStation Productions and head of product at PlayStation Studios Asad Qizilbash recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-exec-says-ai-is-important-to-gen-z-and-gen-alpha-gamers-who-want-personalization-across-everything"><u>weighed in on AI to say its use in video games is important to Gen Z and Gen Alpha gamers</u></a> who seek "personalization across everything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For instance, non-player characters in games could interact with players based on their actions, making it feel more personal,” Qizilbash said. “This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalization across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-reportedly-compared-to-elden-ring-for-its-player-freedom/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet may be very different from what we're used to in Naughty Dog games. The studio's trademark has usually been cinematic, narrative-driven games, at least since Uncharted and, of course, The Last of Us.</p>
<p>However, MinnMax's Ben Hanson teased that he had heard from his sources that the studio's next project was being compared to something else. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhdtygZnYqI&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 2024 podcast</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>I heard from somebody very in the know who worked on the game that they're like Jesus Christ... the tone was like you are all not ready for how amazing this is going to be... and the tone was (I'm not going to say the game that they referenced to compare it)... but they compared to a game with a lot of player freedom.</em></p>
<p>Back then, the game hadn't been unveiled yet. That happened a couple of months later at The Game Awards 2024 <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with a gorgeous debut trailer</a>. Now that the dust has settled, in the latest episode of The MinnMax Show, Ben Hanson has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rcMrvLXPNY&amp;t=7232s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> exactly which game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet was being likened to:</p>
<p><em>I think it's fine to say it now: that game was Elden Ring that it was compared to back then. If I would have said 'Naughty Dog's next game is like Elden Ring' and then that reveal trailer came out, I feel like we would have been lit on fire. But now that idea of, okay, it's taking place on one planet, kind of uncovering the history of this world, you can kind of see a little more where they might be going with that.</em></p>
<p>Game Director Neil Druckmann has since provided a bit more context. Before the reveal, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-druckmann-new-project-is-the-most-thrilling-yet-may-redefine-mainstreams-perception-of-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> that the new game was fresh to the studio, and he was curious about the players' reactions. This certainly fits such a big change in the degree of player freedom compared to Naughty Dog's most recent games.</p>
<p>Druckmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-a-game-about-faith-and-religion-where-players-will-feel-lonely-says-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> as recently as last week that Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet would be a lonely game for players, unlike Uncharted and The Last of Us, where the main characters were almost always accompanied by allies. This is another hint that MinnMax's report is correct.</p>
<p>Of course, many questions remain. Is this a full-fledged action RPG, then? Can players explore the world of Sempiria in whichever order they see fit? Naughty Dog will undoubtedly respond in due time, although the game creator himself has also warned the project is still some ways off, so we might have to wait a while before learning all those details.</p>

            <p>I very much recommend the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2784470/9_Kings/">Steam demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/9-kings">9 Kings</a>, so it's with no shade I say that I'm using 'strategy' here the same way a tube passenger might use a hardback of Ulysses to envelop their novelisation of 2 Fast 2 Furious. Griddy placement and tower defence tactics are involved, but this is primarily a game about launching rocks at dickheads. This is fine by me: launching rocks at dickheads is as solid a premise as any videogame needs to have.</p>

<p>You'll start off with a 9 square grid surrounding a castle, then fill out those plots each turn by picking one of three cards. Some are buildings, like a cemetery that summons imps to fight in place of your slain units. Some are troops who'll rush to the centre of the battlefield at the beginning of each round. Your troops fight automatically, but you do have an important job here. I'm not sure if I mentioned it already: it's dropping rocks on heads. When you drop a rock really good, your dying foes squeak in falsetto anguish like a Lemming opening a devastating phone bill.</p>
<p>I'm being a touch facetious when I say it's all about rocks and heads. The demo is naturally a stripped-back sample, and even within it, I did start to notice some emerging combos. I gifted a square to some mercenary units early. They grew in number the more gold I had, which meant I could skip turns guilt-free by throwing cards down a well later, since each time I got bonus gold and so more bodies. There's also plenty of choice in how you expand your original plot, with positional buffs for certain buildings</p>
<p>Steam sez:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Build up your city into the most powerful of all kingdoms. Through endless combinations of buildings, troops, spells and positioning, find ways to break the game and become overpowered. Grow your kingdom in strategic ways, prepare for dozens of unique events, and show the world your kingdom can last longer than any other."</p></blockquote>
<p>If the full game contains lore, I would like to know where the rocks come from. They evidently come from your castle but there's no catapult or anything, just a void containing infinite rocks and the means to launch them. Gargantuan slingshot? Monkey with strong tail? Hellstorm rock battery? Answers, please, when the full game launches this April.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Yesterday, a fan-made standalone remake of Counter-Strike called CS: Legacy was unveiled with an announcement trailer. It's being made by a small group of developers who previously worked on CSPromod between 2008 and 2012 and have since got back together for this new project.</p>
<p>According to them, CS: Legacy will be a completely standalone remake of Counter-Strike 1.6, built from the ground up with entirely custom code and game assets (textures, models, sounds, animations, UI, et cetera). The game is built on Valve's official 2013 Source Engine SDK codebase, with the developers making their own major rewrites to the renderer, shaders and various systems. It runs on its own advanced custom branch of Valve's official Source Engine 2013 public SDK. The aforementioned tweaks include a custom renderer, Physically Based Rendering shaders, a wholly rewritten reflection system, a fully custom UI, custom in-house source engine tools, and many more features.</p>
<p>The early access will include five maps: Dust2, Nuke, Train, Poolday, Aim_map. Fans can support CS: Legacy by subscribing <a href="https://www.patreon.com/CSLegacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the team's Patreon</a>, which includes six tiers:</p>

He also wants to JP to recreate his experience of working with&nbsp;international developers back when he was&nbsp;at Square Enix.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[Final Fantasy] created opportunities for me to get to know game creators from not only Taiwan but the whole Asian region,"&nbsp;he explained. "I have a strong desire to create new games with these young Asian people."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tabata acknowledged that doing so wasn't entirely possible at Square Enix prior to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-final-fantasy-xv-i-game-director-hajime-tabata-departs-square-enix">his leaving in 2018</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which in turn spurred him to going independent.

While he'll be using his previous Square Enix experience, he wants to make games in a different way from his youth, in turn evolving the genre.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The RPG is a genre with a great potential," he noted. "I also had a desire to create a development team with more freedom, and it feels like people that share the same thought gradually gathered here."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Tabata wants his studio&nbsp;to help&nbsp;restore his developer status">Tabata wants his studio&nbsp;to help&nbsp;restore his developer status</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">JP Games is currently at work on an MMO-like project and a console RPG co-developed with another company.

"However, the sense of frustration that I felt gave me the motivation to produce better games from a freer standpoint."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">JP lets him take on "new challenges,"&nbsp;and he thinks it can redeem his name, along with other&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy XV&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">veterans who joined him.
