            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mezen-board-game-inspired-by-siberian-artisans-announced-by-arcane-wonders<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arcane Wonders has announced the launch of the <em>Mezen</em> board game. This puzzle tile-based tabletop game is based on the art style developed by traditional Siberian artisans, providing players a hands-on learning experience of this part of the world.</p>

<h2>The Mezen Board Game Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Mezen</em> board game is inspired by the meze style of painting, which emerged in the mid-eighteenth century. This style is characterized by distinct shades of red and white and imagery centered on fire, water, creatures and plants found in nature, the sun, the moon, and protective symbols.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mezen-board-game-game-pieces.jpg?itok=IRJ5g4s0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mezen-board-game-game-pieces.jpg?itok=T3vgOZ8t 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Players step into the role of one of these craftsmen creating intricate ornamental paintings to order. Players will take turns flipping tiles and earning points. Whoever earns the most points by the end of the final round is declared the winner.</p>

<p>These tiles are maneuvered over a 5x5 board. Each round starts with the active player choosing one of the animals on the tiles. All players then choose a group of one or more tiles with that animal to remove from their grid and flip over. Next, they slide the tiles above the open spaces down and place the newly flipped tiles back in the open spaces at the top.</p>

<p>Once this is done, everyone will score the current round's scoring objective. These objectives include revealing symbols or completing the image of an animal. These objectives are dealt to players through a deck of cards. Once five rounds are done, players get one point per black tile shown on their board. After the 10th and final round, players score one point per white tile&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Mezen</em> board game was created by Nikita Sorokin and Maria Stahkevich and developed by Hobby World. It is the latest board game to join Arcane Wonders' diverse tabletop catalog which includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/arcane-wonders-announces-onstage-trick-taking-game-about-theater-troupe" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Onstage</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/video-game-champion-brings-retro-game-collecting-fun-to-gaming-tables" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Video Game Champion</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ito-card-game-getting-western-localization" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Ito</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is available now at an MSRP of $39.99 on Arcane Wonders webstore and Amazon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/629949/star-wars-hunters-offline-october<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>So soon after <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24211078/spectre-divide-preview-mountaintop-fps-game">Specter Divide</a></em>, a multiplayer shooter developed by Mountaintop Studios, announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628698/spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios-shutting-down">its pending shut down</a> which will take its studio with it, is yet another live-service game going offline. Today, <em>Star Wars: Hunters</em> developer Zynga announced <a href="https://starwarshunters.com/news/sunset-on-vespaara/">the game will be sunset on October 1st</a>.</p><p><em>Hunters</em> is a class-based arena shooter featuring original characters (or at least they <em>seem</em> original, who knows with folks named Babu Frik running around) from throughout the <em>Star Wars</em> universe. It had a soft launch in select countries in 2021, but didn’t get a global launch on mobile and the Nintendo Switch until June 2024. This means that the game officially lived a scant 16 months before it inevitably goes offline. That short time though is downright luxurious considering <em>Specter Divide</em> lasted roughly six months before it will shut down sometime in the next 30 days.</p><p>The developers do have some parting gifts for players before the galaxy winks out on <em>Star Wars: Hunters</em>, though. The current season will be extended an additional three weeks and the game will still release a new hero April 15th. Then the developers will keep the ranked leaderboards running until the game shuts down in October.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Zynga has announced that it will be shutting down Star Wars Hunters on October 1st, with the final season dropping on April 15th. The shutdown will come near enough four years after Star Wars Hunters first soft launched, which occurred in November 2021 in some countries. The game then released worldwide in early 2022. The full statement regarding the shutdown can be read below.</p>

The list is so big that Obsidian had to split it. Heck, it’s so big that I couldn’t even fit the entire thing in this post.

These six extra points will help out a lot!</p><p>Also buried in the massive patch notes post is a hint from Obsidian about future updates. The developer says that in the coming weeks it will release a roadmap for <em>Avowed </em>that will share some of the plans the studio has for the game over the next year or so.

<p>New documents have revealed that People Can Fly and Sony Interactive Entertainment have signed a deal to create a prototype for a game based on Sony’s IP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by Zuby_Tech on <a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/1900605141914444110/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), People Can Fly and Sony have signed a “prototype development agreement.” The prototype in question is for a “new video game codenamed Project Delta,” which is based on one of Sony’s IPs.&nbsp;It is unclear which Sony IP Project Delta is based on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Sony and People Can Fly deal states that the latter will be hired through a “work-for-hire model,” meaning they will work as developers for Sony for an “agreed remuneration.” The production agreement states that the game’s development will be divided across milestones. </p>



<p>People Can Fly was recently announced as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/people-can-fly-is-co-developing-gears-of-war-e-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-developer on Gears of War: E-Day</a>, a month after the studio laid off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/people-can-fly-announces-layoffs-impacted-120-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">120 staff members</a>. The studio also cancelled its longtime game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/people-can-fly-cancel-project-dagger-after-years-of-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Dagger</a>, in April last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a PlayStation logo was recently spotted on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-logo-spotted-on-starfield-creation-club-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfield’s Creation Club</a> website. Also, a new job listing suggests another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-yet-to-announce-live-service-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-service multiplayer</a> game is in the works. What are your thoughts on Sony and People Can Fly entering this deal?

                <p>Although Assassin's Creed Shadows won't be available through Xbox Game Pass, at least at launch, there will be a perk for subscribers. Game Pass Ultimate members who purchase Shadows will have have the ability to play the game through Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p><p>Microsoft just revealed this feature as part of its <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/play/gallery/buy-and-stream" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“stream your own game”</a> perk for Ultimate tier subscribers. However, this only applies to digital copies of games, not physical ones. "Stream your own game" is different than Xbox’s own Play Anywhere program, which gives players both native Windows PC and Xbox versions of games if they purchase either one.</p><p>Certain games in the Game Pass library can be streamed, but not all of them. If a game leaves Game Pass, it can normally no longer be streamed even if it's been purchased. That makes this feature particularly useful, although it remains unclear how widely it will be supported. Some other games that are part of the "stream your own game" feature are Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Cyberpunk 2077, and Life is Strange: Double Exposure.</p><p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches on March 20 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

The April update also adds a new Support Hunter, Tuya. The character will be playable immediately when it arrives and at no cost.

<p>Eventually, on October 1, 2025, the online servers for Star Wars Hunters will be officially shut down, and the game will no longer be accessible.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Polish developer People Can Fly has announced that it's making a game for Sony Interactive Entertainment based on an IP that Sony owns, though it remains to be seen what the game is.</p><p>In a <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313-current-report-no-4-2025-conclusion-of-pda-with-sony-delta.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, People Can Fly said the new game is in the works under the codename Project Delta. As part of the agreement between People Can Fly and Sony, <span>there will be a milestone process. Details weren't provided, but this is a common practice where development progress is reviewed at certain intervals.</span></p><p>People Can Fly did not divulge the specific scope and terms of its milestone agreement with Sony but said it does not differ much from standard work-for-hire projects of this nature. The Polish studio has a lot of experience in this department, as it has worked with big game companies on projects before, including Gears of War: Judgment with Microsoft, Fortnite: Saves the World with Epic, and Outriders with Square Enix. People Can Fly is also working with PUBG company Krafton on a new game codenamed <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/project-echo-agreement/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Project Echo</a> and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526145/" data-ref-id="1100-6526145">collaborating with The Coalition on Gears of War: E-Day. </a></p><p>The official word is that People Can Fly's game with Sony is "based on the intellectual property rights owned by" Sony, but there is no word on what it is. It sounds like it could be an existing Sony franchise, but that is never stated outright in the document. Another document from People Can Fly describes the agreement as<a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313-current-report-no-3-2025-commencement-of-negotiations-with-sony-disclosure-of-delayed-inside-information-final.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> covering work to create a prototype</a>.</p><p>Founded in 2002, People Can Fly released the first-person shooter Painkiller in 2004 as its first game. Epic Games took a majority ownership of the company in 2007 following the cancellation of People Can Fly's game Come Midnight with now-defunct publisher THQ. In 2012, Epic bought People Can Fly and re-named it Epic Games Poland, but in 2015, People Can Fly became independent again.</p>

However, the Starfield Creation Kit hub <a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/all?sort=created_at&amp;timePeriod=ALL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">does not allow players to choose "PlayStation" as a platform in the filter</a>, despite the logo appearing on one of the mod's pages.</p><p>It's possible to<a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/all?platforms=PS&amp;sort=created_at&amp;timePeriod=ALL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> tweak the URL</a> to force the filter to show mods listed for PlayStation. For a period of time today, March 14, this displayed one result for the mod listed for PlayStation. However, it has since been removed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4459675-screenshot2025-03-14at1.32.45pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4459675" data-ratio="0.52787663107948" data-width="843" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4459675-screenshot2025-03-14at1.32.45pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4459675"></a><figcaption>A PlayStation listing sits alongside Xbox and PC platforms for a Starfield mod.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4459675-screenshot2025-03-14at1.32.45pm.png"></figure><p>It's possible this whole thing was an error and that it doesn't signal any kind of forthcoming announcement from Bethesda.</p><p>Earlier this year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was asked directly if he could confirm that Starfield would remain exclusive to Xbox on console. He said, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-on-ps5-isnt-ruled-out-xboxs-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529031/" data-ref-id="1100-6529031">"No,"</a> going on to state that he sees no reason to ever "put a ring fence around any game" and say it could never come to a platform where it could find an audience and bring in money for Microsoft. </p><p>Starfield coming to PS5 would fit within Xbox's strategy of bringing more games to PlayStation. However, the wait for Starfield to come to PS5 has been lengthier compared to some of the other Xbox games that eventually came to PS5.</p><p>Starfield launched in September 2023 and has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-passes-15-million-players-as-game-adds-new-vehicle-and-quest/1100-6527873/#:~:text=Starfield%20has%20crossed%20a%20new,quest%2C%20fixes%2C%20and%20more." data-ref-id="1100-6527873">reached more than 15 million players.</a> Bethesda recently acknowledged that fans are eager for updates, adding that the studio is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-knows-fans-are-eager-for-starfield-updates-promises-exciting-year/1100-6529956/" data-ref-id="1100-6529956">"hard at work" on new content</a>, but it's too soon to reveal anything. "We have a lot of exciting things planned for the game this year that we can't wait to talk about when the time is right," Bethesda said.</p>

            <p>I don't much enjoy sports sims, but sometimes an imaginative spin on a sport will sneak past my guard. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/electro-bop-boxing-league">Electro Bop Boxing League</a> has spins aplenty. You probably could have stopped at robot boxers, Developer Dob. You didn't have to give it a swaggering electro swing soundtrack as well. Special moves depicted as old-timey computer punched cards? Soldering limbs back on between rounds with a Repair-o-Gun? Little eggheads in lab coats clinging to the back of my gymrat C3PO as he pounds some would-be Megatron to shrapnel? Referee counts presented as a rebooting sequence? Developer Dob, you are spoiling us!</p><!--more-->

<p>There's a demo you can play and I suggest you play it, rather than endure my attempts to riff on boxing terminology. I'll keep this write-up brief. Electro Bop Boxing League is a musical autobattler with a decent dollop of micromanagement and some joyful atompunk presentation. </p>
<p>The opening hurdle that might turn away a few players is that the majority of commands have to be entered on the beat. This includes: completing the button combos for those punchcards; massaging your various gauges to keep your robot mobile, dukes up, and running at an optimal temperature; and button-bashing your way out of a clutch (here represented as a tug-of-war over which robot gets zapped by the other side's accumulated static electricity).</p>
<p>The whole world and HUD twitches and jiggles to the score, helping you nail the prompts, but still, I found this exasperating in the demo - until I realised that you don't have to match the tempo exactly and continuously. Just hitting the odd beat will do.</p>
<p>The robots are beautiful vintage creations - all Rock 'Em Sock 'Em elbows, caterpillar treads and lightbulb eyes. It feels like there's some decent depth of customisation here, too, though I wouldn't put this in the same league as Armored Core VI: Fires Of Rubicon. The career mode sees you unlocking new parts, abilities and passive crew skills from daily manager events. You can also have tourists come view your budding George Forebot to earn some extra dosh, at the risk of them breaking something.</p>
<p>It's out... soon! April 18th, which is barely a month away. Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3211280/Electro_Bop_Boxing_League/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/severance-ep-9-season-2-burt-irving-relationship-gay-1851770084<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As we head into next week’s season finale, I’m starting to better understand the frustration some viewers feel with <em>Severance</em>’s pacing in its second season. We’re nine episodes in and not a lot has happened. There have been several character-driven episodes in a row and not much movement on the main mystery, and we’re one episode away from the show going on hiatus once more. Given the three-year gap between seasons one and two, I can understand the worry that we’re going to reach the end of this season without having learned that much. But the season’s penultimate episode, “The After Hours,” felt like a necessary bit of housecleaning so the show would be free to focus almost exclusively on its overarching mystery and how protagonists Mark (Adam Scott) and Helly (Britt Lower) are faring. That means we spent a lot of time with the rest of the ensemble, wrapping up numerous storylines with a series of devastating conclusions. I’m a bit bummed we didn’t get full episodes dedicated to these characters like the one Patricia Arquette’s Harmony Cobel <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-ep-8-sweet-vitriol-harmony-cobel-1851768452&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-ep-8-sweet-vitriol-harmony-cobel-1851768452">got last week</a></span>, but god, the conclusion of <em>Severance</em>’s slow burn old man love story between Irving (John Turturro) and Burt (Christopher Walken) has sent me on an ongoing emotional spiral I haven’t recovered from.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>How do the makers of <em>Severance </em>expect me to function after watching these two men get to the precipice of running away together and escaping Lumon’s clutches, just for Burt to emphatically and repeatedly tell Irving that they <em>can’t</em>? I’m getting ahead of myself. But the image of Irving and Burt’s outies standing forehead to forehead in a train station is burned into my brain. As for how we got here, it turns out that yes, fans’ theories that Burt’s outie was actually an undercover agent working for Lumon were correct. As he explains to Irving, he has been working with the corporation for many years, helping to disappear enemies of its interests. Now that both Irving’s innie and outie have been investigating the company’s corruption, the man who his innie fell in love with is in Burt’s crosshairs. He’s been given orders to deliver Irving somewhere to be discreetly dealt with, as he’s done to many of Lumon’s enemies over the years.</p><p>While I sympathize with those who feel that <em>Severance</em>’s greater mysteries have been moving a bit too slowly, I do wonder if some viewers have gotten so fixated on the question of what the main cast is doing on the severed floor that they’re losing sight of these micro mysteries which help build out the world through the lens of the people in it. In Episode 6, “Attila,” Burt, Irving, and Burt’s outie husband Fields all pontificated about whether or not innies and outies had distinct souls that could ascend to Heaven independent of what the other personality had done. People rightfully assumed Burt was working with Lumon, but what could he have done that would make him so sure he wouldn’t see the pearly gates that he’d bisect his brain in the hope that some part of him would reach Heaven while the other burned for eternity? It turns out that helping Lumon whisk away anyone who slighted it weighs on a person.</p><p>But now, he’s met with the person this innocent version of himself fell in love with, and he’s been ordered to drop him off somewhere for the company’s nefarious purposes. After years of following Lumon’s orders, he finally hesitates, and instead of dropping Irving off where he was told to, he takes him and his dog Radar to a train station, gives him a one-way ticket, and tells him not to say where he’s going. Burt can’t know where Irving’s stop is, because as long as he doesn’t, the man his innie fell in love with will be safe.</p><p>If that weren’t devastating enough on its own, Irving’s own confession had me curled up in the fetal position on the floor. Before he gets on the train, he tells Burt he’s never been loved before, not really. But at his old age of 60-something, it’s painful for him to know he felt it once and can’t remember it, and he wants Burt to give them a chance to feel that connection in this life. The scene mirrors one from season one, in which Burt and Irving’s innies decide they can’t engage in “fraternization,” and Irving says that he’s “not ready” to break Lumon’s rules. Seeing the roles reversed and Irving begging Burt to give them a chance to get on that train together and see where things go generates the kind of devastating angst you rarely find outside of AO3.</p><p>Irving says he wants to remember the love they felt for each other on the severed floor, but I imagine it would break his heart to know that version of him passed on the opportunity to love and be loved. In the end, all either version of Irving has is the image he’s formed in his mind of what a life with Burt could have looked like. <em>Severance </em>has always been for the yearners, but I can’t lie, I was hoping and praying for a shot of Burt walking up to Irving on the train and escaping Lumon’s clutches alongside his innie’s love. But it never came.</p><p>If this show had come out 10 years ago, the version of me I was then probably would have been miffed that the queer love story ended so tragically when <em>Severance </em>is about to release a season finale spotlighting its straight leads. But the longer I’ve lived, the more that queer love stories like Burt and Irving’s resonate with me, stories that capture the reality that most relationships don’t end well. Statistically, more of us deal with heartbreak from disinterested partners, meeting the right person at the wrong time, and finding we wasted a lot of hours being too scared to take the next step, than with happily ever after. The greatest, most passionate love stories often end with someone on a one-way trip to god knows where. I imagine we’ve seen the last of Irving in <em>Severance</em>, and it’s fitting that Burt was the one who ensured he got a second chance. Wherever he gets off that train, I hope he doesn’t waste the time he’s been given the way he did on the severed floor.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> now less than a week away, Microsoft has announced it'll be the latest to title to join Xbox's steadily growing "Stream your own games" service.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-insiders-can-now-play-select-games-they-own-on-their-console-using-cloud-streaming">launched the ability for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to play "select" games they already own via streaming</a> last November, some five years after announcing the feature was in the works. It's a service distinct from the ability to play Xbox Game Pass titles via streaming, and one that currently only supports a limited number of games.
</p>
<p>
At launch, 50 titles featured on Microsoft's "Steam your own games" list - including the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> - and that's since expanded to encompass more than 70 games. Ubisoft already has a big presence on the list (many of its more recent titles including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown are on there), so it's perhaps not to surprising to hear Assassin's Creed Shadows is up next.

<p>
Microsoft announced Shadows' upcoming inclusion on Xbox's "Stream your own games" list in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xbox.com/post/3lkdwjnalz22p">message shared on social media</a>. The company hasn't yet specified exactly <em>when</em> it'll be available for streaming by Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers - it's only said "soon" so far - but hopefully it won't be too long after its release next week. And if it's launch information you're after, Ubisoft has already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-global-launch-times-detailed-pre-load-live-now-on-xbox">detailed Shadows' global release times</a>.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows, of course, whisks the series to 16th-century Japan, with players witnessing events through the eyes of two new protagonists: shinobi Fujibayashi Naoe and samurai Yasuke. Eurogamer's Katharine Castle reckoned Shadows was "shaping up to be one of the most promising [series entries] so far" when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-should-work-on-steam-deck-after-all-says-ubisoft">she took a look earlier this year</a>. And if you're contemplating other platforms, you might like to know Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-details-ps5-pro-enhancements-including-extended-raytracing">confirmed PS5 Pro enhancements</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-should-work-on-steam-deck-after-all-says-ubisoft">Steam Deck support</a> after doing a bit of a U-turn.
