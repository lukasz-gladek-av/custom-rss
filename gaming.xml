<p>Like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-155" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-152" rel="nofollow">updates</a> before it, the star of the show when it comes to Update 1.56 is the cars, and this time around, you're getting an "elegant convertible", a multi-purpose truck, and an old reliable rally legend.</p>

<p>First up, it's the BMW Z4 3.0i '03, a convertible sports car that debuted back in 2002. You can see the competition version of this model in action at iconic racetracks like the legendary&nbsp;Nürburgring.</p>

<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gran-turismo-7-update-1.56-peugeot-205-gti-88.jpg?itok=Oa8AGRch 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gran-turismo-7-update-1.56-peugeot-205-gti-88.jpg?itok=PPyYdbPg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This ol' reliable hatchback is fresh for&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.56.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as all three of these machines, you can also get your hands on a new body color style for the Mazda3 Gr.4, which gives the car a sleek silver-and-orange look.</p>

<p>Of course, the new update also brings the usual slew of extras with it, including a new Cafe menu, new World Circuits events, and more track compatibility for&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>AI Sophy, so you can test your skills against it.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, it's...well, it's actually the eighth main installment in the <i>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</i>series thanks to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-sport-delisted" rel="nofollow">now-delisted</a>&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo Sport</em>.</p>

<p>Like its predecessors, the game is a sim-style racer that emphasizes verisimilitude. It offers the chance to drive a ton of real-world cars, including the ones listed above, as well as plenty of others from iconic real-world brands.</p>

            <p>The requirements for your PC to feast on the treefrogs of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater </a>tactical espionage <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> have been revealed. The minimum specs ask for a RTX 2060 Super, same as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-pc-performance-best-settings">The Great Troy Bake Off</a>. While this might sound like Delta is following the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> in requiring ray tracing, producer Noriaki Okamura <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-a-doggedly-faithful-remake-but-new-controls-have-new-consequences">told Eurogamer last year</a> that no ray tracing features are included - so the RTX requirement is likely down to Unreal 5's Lumen lighting tech (although that can <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/lumen-technical-details-in-unreal-engine">include ray tracing techniques</a> anyway.)</p>
<p>You can find the full requirements below and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/">on Steam here</a>, in a notably less attractive font than classic Rock Paper Sans.</p>

<p>Did you know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> requires just 8 GB? It's not entirely fair to compare the two, I just wanted to marvel at that install size. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-pc-requirements-revealed">Eurogamer note</a> that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-system-requirements-are-here-and-its-yet-another-game-that-requires-an-rtx-graphics-card-and-tonnes-of-free-storage-to-play/">PC Gamer note</a> and RPS is now noting, Delta uses Unreal 5 instead of the studio's previous FOX engine, and Unreal 5's (usually optional) Lumen lighting requires an RTX 2000-series or later card if you want to use its hardware-based ray tracing effects. Eurogamer also note that the PC version includes the Snake vs Monkey minigame with Ape Escape characters, although the ancient Bomberman fan in me is a little jealous that that minigame is exclusive to Xbox.</p>

<p>According to a new leak, Pokemon TCG Pocket will feature a new Ranked Battles mode in March.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Pokemon TCG Pocket’s Ranked Battles mode news comes from popular leaker <a href="https://x.com/eb576dcfe/status/1894572652054155489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pyoro</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1894588040359625000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CentroLeaks</a>). Besides the mode releasing in March 2025, the leaker didn’t provide any more information. However, Pokemon Presents is all set to be hosted tomorrow, February 27, and players might hear more information about the new Ranked Battles mode and details about other Pokemon games then.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Pokemon TCG Pocket receives a Ranked Battles mode, it will become the third battle game mode, after Versus and Solo. The developers could implement a rank system reminiscent of other online competitive titles with its reward tree. At the same time, the game would need competitive changes which balance gameplay. However, it is all just speculation at this point, and we will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another TCG Pocket leak arrived today through CentroLeaks. This leak shed light on the upcoming booster pack <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-leak-triumphant-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a>, featuring an Arceus Ex card. The leaked pack will reportedly be released this week; learn more about it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-set-a2a-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Pokemon TCG Pocket card listings were recently&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards-are-being-listed-on-ebay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted on eBay</a>. Also, the game recently gave away&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-gifting-players-free-trade-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free trade tokens</a>&nbsp;after the community’s feedback on the restriction of the feature.

<p>Battlestate Games has adjusted pricing for Escape from Tarkov in LATAM regions to ‘balance things out’. To celebrate the new pricing structure, the team has published a small gift bundle that all users can take advantage of. It includes a full kit – a weapon, plate vest, headset, ammunition, and so on.</p>



<p>The downside is it’s only redeemable in PvP, so PvE players have once again missed out on this limited-time promotion.</p>



<hr>







<p>To get your hands on this latest Tarkov gift bundle, you’ll need to log into your account on <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">escapefromtarkov.com</a> and access your profile. From there, click on ‘Activate Promo Code’ and enter the following:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>TARKOVLATAM</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>This code will unlock the bundle instantly and it’ll be ready to collect when you next log in.</p>



<p>It includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Mk 16 Assault Rifle</li>



<li>Takedown BP</li>



<li>STRIKE Helmet</li>



<li>Banshee Rig</li>



<li>ComTac IV Headset</li>



<li>3 x GEN M3 Magazines</li>



<li>100 x M856A1</li>



<li>Propital Injector</li>



<li>Condor Glasses</li>



<li>EXPS3 Optic</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s not all, though. Battlestate Games is running a Twitch Drops campaign from February 26 – March 1 for Escape from Tarkov, and from March 1 – March 3 for Tarkov Arena. </p>



<p>On social media, the team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>LATAM regional pricing for Escape from Tarkov and Tarkov Arena is now in place! Prices for all digital products have been adjusted to match regional rates, enhancing the local accessibility of our games.</p>



<p>To celebrate the LATAM regional pricing, use the promo code in the launcher to receive in-game rewards: TARKOVLATAM.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Battlestate Games continues to evolve Escape from Tarkov, which was first released almost ten years ago (in beta). This year, big things are on the horizon, and the game moves ever closer to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">the fabled 1.0 version</a> that’ll be classed as a full graduation.</p>



<p>Are you still playing Tarkov or have you dropped off until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe/">the next wipe</a> arrives? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

a-game. Programmers, artists, designers, everyone. I don't know that I have ever worked with a team that cared more about making sure the end product was perfect," she said. "It was a dream come true. Wonder Woman had a dream team and they put their all into it. They made sure it had Wonder Woman and DC lore on every aspect of the game. It was a thrill and honor to work with them."</p><p>Simone said she understands there is a lot of "finger-pointing going on" now around why the game was canceled, but everyone she worked with at Monolith and WB was "enthusiastic and supportive."</p><p>Games, TV shows, movies, and all other types of media projects fall apart regularly, for any number of reasons, and the Wonder Woman game joins them.</p><p>"Sometimes, you give your all and it doesn't work out. But that was an amazing team and I can only hope they continue to make brilliant games. Someone is going to snap them all up and set a new industry standard, I know it," Simone said.</p><p>Monolith's Wonder Woman game was announced in 2021, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-has-reportedly-cost-warner-bros-100-million/1100-6529315/" data-ref-id="1100-6529315">more than $100 million was reportedly spent</a> on it prior to its cancellation. In confirming the game's cancellation and the closure of Monolith, management said the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">did not align with WB's new strategic pursuits</a>, despite projects in the DC franchise being one of WB's four core pillars going forward for games.</p><p>WB management said it will focus on four major franchises: Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC, and Game of Thrones. As part of this new strategy of focusing on only the biggest franchises, WB is producing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-one-of-warner-bros-biggest-priorities/1100-6526285/" data-ref-id="1100-6526285">Hogwarts Legacy sequel</a>, while WB Games Montreal is said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">pitching a new Game of Thrones title</a>. Rocksteady, meanwhile, may be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">plotting a new single-player Batman game</a>. As for DC, studio boss James Gunn recently said some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-dc-universe-game-wont-be-revealed-soon-but-some-really-interesting-projects-are-coming/1100-6529678/" data-ref-id="1100-6529678">"really interesting" projects are coming in the gaming space, but not soon.</a> As for the Mortal Kombat series, NetherRealm has not announced any new games, but it's expected the studio will continue the franchise with a new installment at some point.</p><p>In addition to the cancellation of Wonder Woman and closure of Monolith, WB is shuttering MultiVersus studio Player First Games and WB San Diego. MultiVersus is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiversus-shuts-down-in-may-but-can-still-be-played-offline-if-you-update-in-time/1100-6529169/" data-ref-id="1100-6529169">shutting down this May. </a></p><p>Warner Bros. Games' longtime boss, David Haddad, announced in January that he's leaving the company but will stay on for the next three months to help oversee the transition to a new leader. No such executive has been named yet for Haddad's replacement.</p>

			<p>Following <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-ceo-reportedly-cutting-funding-for-a-dozen-games-wont-support-marketing-for-nagoshis-and-other-japanese-made-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the decision of NetEase CEO William Ding</a>&nbsp;to pull out of several investments made across North America, Europe, and Japan, Quantic Dream fans were fearful about the studio's prospects. After all, the Paris-based developer was <a href="https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-has-been-acquired-by-netease-games-for-100-million-euros/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> for €100 million in February 2023. However, CEO and Head of Publishing Guillaume de Fondaumière reassured them with a lengthy post <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7300062734602100737/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared on LinkedIn</a>: the studio is unaffected.</p>
<p><em>We were deeply saddened to learn about the recent layoffs and studio closures affecting some of the NetEase group’s divisions. Our thoughts are with everyone impacted, and we sincerely hope that they quickly find new opportunities.</em></p>
<p><em>David Cage and I would like to express our gratitude to the fans and friends who have reached out to us in recent days regarding QUANTIC DREAM. We want to reassure everyone that our studios in Paris and Montreal remain unaffected. We are continuing to develop our projects at full pace, with several open positions available in both locations (please visit https://lnkd.in/e_AJFbUa for more details).</em></p>
<p><em>Founded 28 years ago, QUANTIC DREAM remains committed to the strategy outlined by David and I in 2019, when NetEase initially acquired a minority stake in our company. Over the past six years, NetEase has been a dedicated partner, providing us with creative freedom and the financial resources necessary for our studio to grow and strive. In 2022, QUANTIC DREAM became a wholly owned subsidiary of NetEase, aligning with our shared vision for the future.</em></p>
<p><em>In 2024, we achieved the highest revenue in our history, driven by the exceptional performance of our back catalogue titles. Notably, Detroit: Become Human reached 11 million units in global sales across PlayStation and PC last year, a remarkable 2 million increase year-on-year, demonstrating the lasting appeal and quality of our titles. The developments of our current projects are progressing as planned, and we are fully committed to delivering and launching these innovative, high-quality titles in the future.</em></p>
<p>De Fondaumière's mention of multiple projects is interesting, as we only publicly know about Star Wars: Eclipse. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-announced-by-quantic-dream-and-lucasfilm-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2021, the game is reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeting</a> a 2026 launch, although it could still be delayed further. Last we <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-development-is-reportedly-simmering-reveals-quantic-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> from Quantic Dream, the development was 'simmering' in September 2023. We also know that it will retain the studio's classic branching narrative while greatly expanding the gameplay with more action elements than in previous titles made by the developer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-quarantine-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ice-Pick Lodge and publisher HypeTrain Digital have revealed the release date for upcoming not-quite-a-demo&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine</em>, a free-to-play prologue that will introduce the world of the game.</p>

<p>Revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-quarantine-2025-prelude-demo" rel="nofollow">back in December</a>,&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>will be arriving for PC via Steam on March 17th, giving what the two studios call "a chilling glimpse into the dark and immersive world of&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>".</p>

<p><em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</em>will tell the story of how Daniil Dankovsky, also known as the Bachelor, came to leave his "acclaimed lab" and kick off the events of&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>&nbsp;proper.&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>will also introduce the core gameplay mechanics that will make up the basis of&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathologic-3-quarantine-release-date-bachelor.jpg?itok=rfWmWtlf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathologic-3-quarantine-release-date-bachelor.jpg?itok=j8ck-Ldn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</em>is officially coming in March.</figcaption></figure><p>As Ice-Pick and HypeTrain tell it,&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</em>will ask you to "examine patients, uncover strange secrets, and make first steps towards defeating Death". That's a pretty tall order for a prologue demo.</p>

<p>You'll be able to examine and diagnose patients with the mysterious Sand Plague, but you'll also be prying into their personal lives to see what kind of unsavory secrets they're hiding.</p>

<p>As you play, you'll also be building Dankovsky's mental map of the world around him; the two studios say the Bachelor is a "sharp mind in search of the truth", and it's that very truth you'll have to uncover throughout&nbsp;<em>Quarantine</em>.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date reveal trailer for <i>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</i>right here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>, it's the third game in the&nbsp;<em>Pathologic&nbsp;</em>series, although technically, it's actually sort of the first.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">in October</a>,&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>is actually an expanded and revised version of the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2&nbsp;</em>Bachelor Route, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-2-bachelors-scenario-announced" rel="nofollow">intended as an expansion for the second game</a> but which appears to have taken on a life of its own, appropriately enough for&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em>.</p>

<p>It gets more complicated, though, because&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2&nbsp;</em>is sort of an expanded and reworked version of the original&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em>. It's best to think of each game in the series as a reimagining of the first rather than a true sequel.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>is due to arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> sometime this year. The free&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3389330/Pathologic_3_Quarantine/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">demo-slash-prologue</a> will be available on March 17th.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wb-games-has-monolith%E2%80%99s-nemesis-system-under-lock-until-2036.1119288/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/wb-games-has-monoliths-nemesis-system-under-lock-until-2036/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Monolith Studios has shut down, and now fans wonder what will happen to its famed Nemesis System, which is locked under a Warner Bros. Games patent until 2036.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Nemesis System was seemingly set to make its grand return with the now cancelled Wonder Woman game. The game’s cancellation came along with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-warner-bros-games-cancels-wonder-woman-shuts-down-multiple-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutdown of the following studios</a>: Monolith Studios, Player First Games, and WB San Diego. Due to the sudden closure, the future of the Nemesis System has become uncertain, too, as the studio responsible for creating it no longer exists, and no other game developer will be able to utilise the system as Warner Bros Games holds its patent till 2036.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/wonder-woman-video-game-announced-in-2021-reportedly-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/warner-bros-owns-nemesis-system-until-2035-despite-monolith-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>), the Nemesis System was patented by Warner Bros. Games in 2021, which barred other game developers from using the system in their games. The patent will remain locked under Warner Bros. Games until 2036 if the company continues paying its associated fees, even after Monolith Studios has been shut down. This means that the Nemesis system may not see the light of day again unless Warner Bros. Games decides to do something about it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-nemesis-system">What is the Nemesis System?</h2>



<p>For those wondering, Monolith’s Nemesis System debuted with Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and was also used in Shadow of War. The system allows enemy NPC characters, who are usually unforgettable, to have more personality. With the Nemesis system, the player’s actions would be fed into the enemies, and their reaction towards the player character would change according to the decision made in battles, providing a personalised story and fresh encounters to players according to their choices. Thanks to the system, each enemy feels like an evolving rival to the player.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on the Nemesis System being locked under Warner Bros. Games till 2036?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm was shamed last year when he admitted to inappropriately messaging a minor on Twitch in 2017. That sequence made up the main reason why he was permanently banned from the platform in 2020. In the wake of the revelation, sponsors, friends, and peers alike all abandoned the controversial creator.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, Dr Disrespect <strong>erupted</strong> against those who have ‘disrespected him’ over the last few months. That long list of people includes NICKMERCS, Dr Lupo, Kai Cenat, and the entire ‘streaming network’ at large.</p>



<p>Despite having built an entire persona based on being disrespectful to others, Beahm is now struggling to contend with being shunned by the industry around him.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-crashing-out">Crashing Out</h2>



<p>In a perfect video posted on social media HUN2R, we see the best showcase possible of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-is-dr-disrespect-streamer-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr Disrespect</a>‘s recent mid-stream tirade. It’s a bizarre segment that lasts far too long, with Beahm calling out all his former associates while simultaneously bagging on several outlets, industry personalities, and the wider streaming community.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Dr Disrespect RANTS on stream saying: 

– </span><a href="https://twitter.com/NICKMERCS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@NICKMERCS</a><span> is a phony and a p*ssy 
– </span><a href="https://twitter.com/DrLupo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@DrLupo</a><span> has always copied him and is a rat
– “That’s how you get knocked tf out” 
– “We didn’t admit nothing” 
– </span><a href="https://twitter.com/timthetatman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@timthetatman</a><span> and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ZLaner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ZLaner</a><span> are good people, and he would accept their apology privately
-…</span></p></article></div>







<p>He labelled NICKMERCS ‘the biggest p*ssy in the world’, said that Dr Lupo is ‘a big-ass fake’, and suggested that publications are busy d*cksucking Kai Cenat’s content.</p>



<p>Hilariously, the creator said multiple times that he wasn’t going to say anything and wouldn’t address these ‘phony’ people <strong>before </strong>launching into a rant about some of the biggest names in the business.</p>



<p>Dr Disrespect said ‘We didn’t admit nothing’, reverting to the narrative that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-admits-minor-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he didn’t cop to messaging a minor</a> on Twitch. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>What the f*ck did we admit? Some jokes and bantering? That’s what we said? Wake up – we didn’t admit nothing!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As the segment unravelled, Dr Disrespect became increasingly flustered, stating that for streamers like TimTheTatman and ZLaner to play games with him again, they’d need to <strong>publicly apologise </strong>for abandoning him in 2024.</p>



<p>It was just a few days ago that Guy Beahm posted on his personal social media profile <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-twitch-plead-reinstated-stream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requesting that Twitch unban him</a>, stressing that he never should have been banned in the first place. It’s one hell of a rabbit hole here, folks.</p>



<p>And all this news comes after Dr Disrespect was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-loses-followers-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped by prolific sponsors</a>, removed from Midnight Society (which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-comments-midnight-society/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently shut down</a>), and signed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-run-rumble-head-of-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a deal with Rumble</a> that he seems to already be neglecting somewhat.</p>



<p>What a wild ride.</p>

            <p>Sonic Rumble, Sega's forthcoming party game for mobile and PC, has been delayed into the spring.</p>
<p>The game is currently available in pre-launch in 44 countries, with a global launch (including UK and US) originally planned for winter.</p>
<p>Now, in a new update from developer Rovio (known for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/angry-birds">Angry Birds</a> games), the global launch has been pushed back to spring, with its 1.2.0 update.</p>

<p>Sonic Rumble will be a free-to-play battle royale game where 32 players collect rings in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a>-esque competitive rounds.</p>
<p>Rovio has revealed the 1.2.0 version will also include a ranked competitive mode, a "Crews" feature to allow players to join up together, and the inclusion of character-specific abilities.</p>
<p>Before that, a 1.1.2 update for those in pre-launch will add a Quick Rumble mode for players to enter a single round challenge.</p>

<p>"We would like to extend a huge thank you to our players and Sonic fans for their patience in waiting for the global launch of Sonic Rumble," wrote the developer <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000111/">in an update</a>. "The team is committed to delivering a memorable experience for Sonic fans with even more new game mechanics, new features, and more exciting content to look forward to."</p>
<p>Known predominantly for its Angry Birds games, Sonic Rumble will be Rovio's first brand new game since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-buys-angry-birds-maker-rovio-for-625m">studio was acquired by Sega in 2023</a> for £625m.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-rumble-wont-include-gacha-mechanics-as-sega-says-theyre-shunned-in-west">Sonic Rumble is also notable for its lack of gacha mechanic</a>, due to its lack of popularity in the west.</p>
<p>Said Sonic franchise lead Takashi Iizuka: "In the Japanese and Asian markets, it's common to have to spend tens of thousands of yen [in a game] until you draw a rare character and finally get to move on. But this is not the case in the global market, especially for an action game like Sonic Rumble, where players should be able to enjoy the game on an equal footing. The starting point of this project itself was to make it a mobile game that would sell globally. Therefore, the monetisation model was designed from the beginning based on global standards."</p>
<p>The game will feature a season pass instead.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-async-compute-mod-performance-boost/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-async-compute-mod-introduces-significant-performance-boosts-at-every-resolution.1119261/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-async-compute-mod-performance-boost/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Kingdom Come: Deliverance II mod now available online brings significant performance improvements by enabling Async Compute without conflicting with other mods.</p>
<p>The FPS Boost - Enables Async Compute mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/440?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, brings significant performance improvements, mostly on high-end hardware, by enabling the aforementioned tech that is disabled in the vanilla game. The performance boosts vary depending on the hardware, but they are still consistent at every resolution. As showcased in a new video put together by Compusemble, the mod brings a 9.83% average FPS boost at 4K resolution, highest Experimental settings, an 11.88% boost at 1440p, and a 14.52% boost at 1080p on an RTX 4090. Other users are reporting significant performance improvements on other GPUs as well, so the mod is definitely worth a try, although it comes with some reported issues, such as broken lighting effects during rain.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II - Async Compute Mod Delivers Free Performance Boost!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/glKXld7JNTQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While a performance boost is always welcome, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is one of the very few games released in the past few years that doesn't require mods to run acceptably on PC. The game developed by Warhorse is a polished day 1 experience that almost feels <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-polished-impeccable-smoothness/">old school</a> in how it did not need any patch to improve either performance or image quality. The game also delivers on pretty much every other front, as highlighted by Chris in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">review.</a></p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

<p>A new Pokemon TCG Pocket leak has revealed the upcoming booster pack Triumphant Light, which will feature the Legendary Pokemon Arceus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coming from reliable Pokemon TCG Pocket leaks source <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1894551923203637657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CentroLeaks</a>, their new post on X reveals information on the upcoming pack, Triumphant Light. The post features a video that was “uploaded early to Pokémon’s TikTok”, where we see new Eevee, Magnemite, and Goldbat cards coming out of the new pack. At the end of the video, an Arceus Ex card is showcased, and the Legendary Pokemon’s battle skills are revealed, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Underneath the new post, CentroLeaks has commented that the TCG Pocket’s Triumphant Light set is “confirmed” and will be released “this week.” This information aligns with the source’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-set-a2a-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous leak</a>, which said the next themed booster pack (A2a) will be released on February 28, 2025, which arrives this Friday. </p>



<p>As per TCG Pocket’s Triumphant Light leak, the Arceus EX card will feature two abilities: Fabled Luster and Ultimate Force. Fabled Luster makes Arceus immune to any Special Conditions and doesn’t cost anything. Ultimate Force, on the other hand, inflicts 70+ base damage and 20 more points for each benched Pokemon. Players need three energy points to use the Ultimate Force and two to Retreat with Arceus Ex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Pokemon TCG Pocket card listings were recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards-are-being-listed-on-ebay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted on eBay</a>. Also, the game recently gave away <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-gifting-players-free-trade-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free trade tokens</a> after the community’s feedback on the restriction of the feature.

<p>Rebellion’s 2025 has Atomfall as a headline maker. The survival title shows a new side of England, and Game Pass subscribers—and everyone else—could benefit from a unique history lesson if an agreement is in place between the two companies.</p>



<p>There are genres and tropes it’s hard to get bored of. A dystopian world operating on an alternate timeline is fascinating. Atomic Heart showed us a terrifying look into an alternate-history Soviet Union. Whereas Wolfenstein’s Nazi-dominated world is also an eye-opening prospect. But Fallout is arguably where the focus usually falls.</p>



<p>Bethesda’s post-apocalyptic franchise looks at different areas of America in a world where nuclear war devastated the world. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a> doesn’t focus on nuclear devastation but more on radioactive consequences. The concept alone deserves attention, so let’s see if Game Pass is happy to risk it for a radioactive biscuit.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-atomfall-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Atomfall on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Danger lurks everywhere. Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The good news is Atomfall’s release day also coincides with a day-one debut on Game Pass—Xbox’s subscription service.</strong></p>



<p>Microsoft users must apply their radiation suits, arm themself, and prepare for an unpleasant trip to the Lake District. Thankfully, the Lake District is a lovely area of the UK in real life, but in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/atomfall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a>, it’s likely to be riddled with mutants and cultists.</p>



<p>It’s more than tolerable when it’s free though, and this is the benefit you get if you have Game Pass. Rebellion is enjoying a nice partnership with Microsoft as another 2025 release has already gotten the Game Pass treatment—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-sniper-elite-resistance-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-atomfall-on-xbox-game-pass">How to Play Atomfall on Xbox Game Pass</h2>



<p><strong>A valid Game Pass subscription, a working Xbox or PC, and a stable internet connection are all you need to play Atomfall on Xbox Game Pass.</strong></p>



<p>This is how to enjoy Atomfall for free through Game Pass:</p>



<ol>
<li>Log in to your Microsoft account—or make one if you haven’t got one already.</li>



<li>Check your Xbox Game Pass status.</li>



<li>If you don’t have one, go to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass?msockid=18c366288f2166303b0f72118e066724#join" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Join Xbox Game page</a>&nbsp;and subscribe.</li>



<li>Make your way to the&nbsp;<strong>Xbox Store</strong>&nbsp;once you’ve done this.</li>



<li>Search for&nbsp;<strong>Atomfall</strong>.</li>



<li>Obtain Atomfall through Game Pass on its game page.</li>



<li>Download it.</li>



<li>Once this process is complete, you can play Atomfall.</li>
</ol>



<hr>



<p>If you have some spare time, watch the latest <a href="http://Atomfall Trailer Shows Game’s Features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall trailer showing off the game’s features</a>.</p>



<p>Atomfall is set to fill a Fallout-sized hole in the gaming calendar. With Bethesda’s next post-apocalyptic foray likely several years away, I think Atomfall should work. Do you think this could be the start of a new franchise? Leave a comment and let us know.</p>

        Let Ars help you find some needles in Steam's massive haystack of game trials.

<p>If you head over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest?tab=23">the Steam Next Fest charts</a> right now, Valve will offer you a glimpse of the 2,228 games offering free downloadable demos as part of the event through Sunday, March 3. That is way too many games to effectively evaluate in such a short time, even with the massive resources of the Ars Orbiting HQ.</p>
<p>But we haven't let that stop us from trying. With the assistance of some early access provided by Valve and game publishers, we've spent the last few days playing dozens and dozens of the most promising Next Fest demos in an attempt to pull out some interesting-looking needles from Valve's massive haystack. Below are the results of that search—a varied list of 11 titles we think are worth investing some time (and zero dollars of money) into a demo download.</p>
<p>But this is just a starting point. Please use the comments below to share any other diamonds in the rough you think your fellow Ars readers need to know about.</p>
<h2><em>Afterblast</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KwBKiG_bVhk?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Lumino Games<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> April 2025<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> FPS, Online Co-Op, Action Roguelike, Roguelite<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1338490/AFTERBLAST/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>Start with the roguelike, room-based shooting action of <em>Returnal</em>. Move it to a first-person perspective and add in the double-jump-and-dash movement system of the new Doom games. Throw in a <em>Halo Infinite</em>-style grappling hook that can be used for traversal or combat. The result would come pretty close to <em>Afterblast</em>, a twitch-action shooter that shines from the jump in this fast-paced demo.</p>
<p>This is the kind of game where halting your movement for even a split second often means being instantly overwhelmed by enemies that swarm from all angles. Rather than being hard to handle, though, the game's zippy movement makes it feel relatively simple to jump and dash from ledge to ledge, avoiding bullet-hell style projectile patterns as you do.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The grappling hook is by far the most satisfying part of the demo, though. Beyond jumping out of the way of opposing fire, you can also use it to drag yourself over to stunned enemies, exploding them into piles of goo and collectible items. Bouncing from enemy to enemy in this way, with a few well-placed jumps and dashes in between, felt like being a kid bouncing on a trampoline.</p>
<p>The <em>Afterblast</em> demo provides a feel for the game's randomized item system, which gives access to automated drones, powerful grenades, and other superpowers that should make each run feel unique. We can't wait to see more.</p>

<h2><em>Castle V Castle</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3WHiA2nZrRE?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Nopopo<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> "Coming soon"<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Card Battler, Roguelite, Card Game, PvE<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3398880/Castle_V_Castle/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>If you remember cult-classic Flash game <a href="https://www.quickflashgames.com/games/castle-wars/"><em>Castle Wars</em></a>, you already know the basics of <em>Castle V Castle</em>. You and your opponent take turns using a handful of cards to either build up your own castle or break down the castle on the other side until one castle has been reduced to rubble. You then improve your deck and do it all again.</p>
<p>Playing effectively means figuring out when to attack, when to defend, and when to use cards to bulk up the various resources needed to play future cards. Strong play requires thinking a few moves ahead, both to avoid being left with a hand of unplayable cards and to counter or reflect potential incoming attacks from your opponent (or deny them the resources they might need).</p>
<p>An extremely clean black and white interface and quick, amusing animations make this a very easy game to pick up and play. But it's the strategy of taking on short-term risks to get long-term rewards that will keep you coming back for round after round. And while the demo's extremely punishing daily challenges are good for some continued longevity, we're hoping the final game will add online multiplayer battles rather than just letting us beat down the AI over and over again.</p>

<h2><em>Dragonkin: The Banished</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ulKicq4lig?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Eko Software<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> March 6, 2025 (Early Access)<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Action, Hack and Slash, Adventure, RPG, Loot<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1863430/Dragonkin_The_Banished/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>If you've grown tired of <em>Diablo IV</em> but are looking for another dark, mouse-based action RPG to scratch the same itch, <em>Dragonkin: The Banished</em> should be right up your alley. Just like in <em>Diablo,</em> the name of the game here is clicking to move and attack swarms of enemies in dark isometric dungeons, throwing in some magical attacks with the number keys on your keyboard as needed.</p>
<p>The <em>Dragonkin</em> demo leads you through a lot of extremely expository and overwrought cutscenes, broken up by short playable vignettes that introduce you to the main character classes: the heavy, the archer, the fire mage, etc. These introductory characters seem extremely overpowered for the early game, cutting through enemy grunts like butter while barely taking a scratch from underpowered opposition attacks. But it gives a good feel for the wide variety of available attacks available, from radiating lightning to a satisfying bull charge.</p>
<p>It's only after this introduction that you're thrown into a more standard challenge, clearing out a dungeon with a low-level character that needs all the help they can get. While the moment to moment gameplay will be familiar to <em>Diablo</em> heads, a few small touches like a handy dash-dodge maneuver make it all lean a bit more towards the "action" side of "action RPG."</p>
<p>If you're looking for pyrotechnic explosions, cinematic cut scenes, and plenty of things to click on, you could definitely do a lot worse.</p>
<p><em>-Kyle Orland</em></p>
<h2><em>Glum</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rdCzLAZuzVQ?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>CinderCat Games<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> 2025<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Adventure, Funny, Singleplayer<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2235550/GLUM/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>First-person shooters are obviously all about the shooting—it's right there in the name, after all. But the most satisfying part of these games is often running right up to an enemy and pounding them with a suspiciously powerful close-range melee attack.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p><em>Glum</em> takes this satisfying melee bit and makes it the focus of the whole game. Instead of fists or a bludgeoning weapon, though, your main melee weapon in <em>Glum</em> is a steel-toed boot. You'll see that boot hovering menacingly and incongruously in front of you as you zip around vaguely medieval-themed rooms, charging back with a bent knee for perfectly timed strikes as soon as an enemy gets in your face.</p>
<p>The <em>Glum</em> demo already takes this "first-person booter" concept in some interesting directions, providing plenty of barrels and other heavy objects you can convert into single-use projectile weapons with a kick from the right angle. You can also kick off of walls and other angled surfaces to fly through the air in some surprisingly satisfying and floaty platforming, which is key to finding the many secrets hidden in the demo's tutorial-esque rooms.</p>
<p>But the most satisfying part is still kicking an enemy directly and watching the ragdoll corpse fly off a wall and back toward your boot, where you can send it flying into other encroaching foes. The light-hearted comedy action is especially welcome in an industry that sometimes seems full of first-person games that are too full of themselves.</p>

<p>Seeing and hearing the pre-game logo screen for Ghost Ship Games immediately puts my brain into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/how-deep-rock-galactics-dwarf-miners-have-helped-me-survive-the-pandemic/"><em>Deep Rock Galactic</em></a> mode: headset on, workday stress abandoned, beverage ready. <em>Guntouchables,&nbsp;</em>published by Ghost Ship and developed by Game Swing, could readily fit into that slot. It's a multiplayer-first overhead shooter in which you and up to three other sausage-y folks with tiny stick legs grab loot, kill baddies, and get the heck out of there. If it's been a moment since you and your squad have shot some things together, send them a message and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2543510/GUNTOUCHABLES/">link the demo</a>.</p>

<p>A horde of mutants have overrun the world, and you and your fellow redneck preppers are having their moment. You pick a weapon, like the precise but slow hunting rifle or pray-and-spray SMG, and a character, each with their own secondary weapons and skill trees. The game shows you a map with stuff to grab or destroy and the car you need to reach to escape. Then you're off, moving with WASD keys and aiming in a circle with a mouse. The demo wasn't ready for controller play yet, but I could see it coming in the future (along with another justification for the trackpads on the Steam Deck).</p>
<p>I cajoled a friend into playing, and we had a great time, both blasting and winning, but also explaining to each other just how dumb that last move was. The game could do more to help you quickly identify and distinguish among your teammates, as they're currently all green names and health bars. And an optional tutorial mission would go a long way to help explain weapon and item mechanics that we had to test out live. But it's a demo, and the core experience—shoot, run, grab, swarm coming, panic—already feels plenty strong. There's a goofy, lightly icky charm to the voice-overs and visuals, and the upgrade paths are pleasantly addictive. It's a ridiculous game with a ridiculous name, and I recommend it.</p>

<h2><em>Hyper Empire</em></h2>

<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3096370/Hyper_Empire/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>When you play an RPG or strategy game, do you spend hours just staring at the tech tree, trying to figure out the upgrade path that will maximize your power going forward? If so, you'll probably love <em>Hyper Empire</em>, a super-condensed 4X space simulation where a good 80 percent of the game is spent staring at a menu screen and deciding how best to spend your limited resources.</p>

          
                  </div>

<p>That's actually more interesting than it might initially sound. You need to spend money on a fleet of ships to defend your carrier from potential attack, of course. But spending too much on powerful ships means you can't invest in the outpost stations and tools that will bring in even more resources (and more powerful ships) later in the run. The balance between short-term risk and long-term reward seems well-tuned for those who like to agonize over every potential decision.</p>
<p>When battles inevitably happen, they play out as automated orgies of interstellar explosions that can be a joy to watch, especially once you hit a critical mass of defensive ships. And while random happenings can influence your resources between those battles, none of them have seemed too impactful in the demo so far.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with <em>Hyper Empires</em> right now is that the demo caps out at 30 turns, right when the "just one more turn" resource-building loop is starting to get good. We can't wait to continue to juggle a bunch of numbers like an intergalactic accountant in the full game.</p>

<h2><em>Monaco 2</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aKF0feOQcPU?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Pocketwatch Games<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> 2025<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Co-op, Heist, Indie, Arcade, Top-Down, Loot<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063030/Monaco_2/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>It's been well over a decade <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/12/the-prince-of-monaco-andy-schatz-talks-up-his-indie-heist-simulator/">since the first <em>Monaco</em> wowed us</a> with its ultra-stylish overhead "heist simulator" gameplay. This long-delayed sequel keeps the same basic find-the-Macguffin-and-escape gameplay, but now with vibrant 3D graphics and more complex, multi-floor building layouts.</p>
<p>As with the first <em>Monaco</em>, this is a stealth game that doesn't absolutely require stealth. Sure, it's easier if you sneak by the guards and cameras without raising the alarm, using handy sightlines and quiet movements to avoid detection. But if you're found, the game quickly transitions into something of a 3D game of <em>Pac-Man</em>, where you have to outrun the guards and use hidden corridors or hidey-holes to outsmart them.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The <em>Monaco 2</em> demo includes four classes of thieves, each with their own unique way of distracting or avoiding the guards. I especially liked the socialite, who uses a toy poodle to charm nearby guards into ignoring her, and the tech specialist, who can use a drone to interact with doors and items while he hides in relative safety.</p>
<p>The updated 3D viewpoint loses some of the simplistic charm of the original's overhead perspective. Still, this modernized version of the classic stealth game is incredibly easy to pick up and play, especially with a few friends in co-op mode.</p>

<h2><em>Monster Train 2</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLmMkqeH_9w?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Shiny Shoe<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> "Coming Soon"<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Strategy, Card Game, Roguelike, Demons, PvP<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830/Monster_Train_2/">Steam page</a></p>
<p><em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>is a lot more <em>Monster Train</em>. Given that the original is in my top five of all-time Steam game hours, I'm happy about that. Just 30 minutes into testing it, I had to tell myself, "No, <em>this</em> really is the last round," and physically walk away to enforce it. Well, the last round, and then some upgrade shopping. OK, one more and <em>then</em> no more.</p>
<p><em>Monster Train 2</em> is, like the original, an amalgam of turn-based tactics and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/why-there-are-861-roguelike-deckbuilders-on-steam-all-of-a-sudden/">roguelike deckbuilding</a>, with a heaven-versus-hell backstory that is arch, goofy, and entirely skippable. Enemies enter your train on the bottom of three decks and fight their way upward, turn by turn. Your card deck has hellish monsters that you place across three levels of your train and spells that can damage, buff your monsters, and debuff their misguided angels. The music is high-energy melodic metal, the art pops off the screen, and the challenge is largely the same: balancing momentary threats against the need to prepare for future baddies.</p>
<p>Besides new monsters, cards, and clans, the sequel adds some new things, all of which might add up to be a bit too much to manage for some folks. Hero-type creatures can have abilities with cooldowns. New card types include equipment you can put on creatures and abilities you can apply to train floors. You can customize your train and upgrade its core pyre with abilities. This demo had me forgetting monster abilities and feeling overwhelmed with where to focus my upgrades. And yet I had a good time, and I'll probably learn a new approach to turn actions over time. Hell, after all, devours the indolent.</p>

<h2><em>Reignbreaker</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vpVDO7G_5eM?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Studio Fizbin<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> March 18, 2025<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Indie, Hack and Slash, Action Roguelike, Combat<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2129810/Reignbreaker/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>The surface similarities between <em>Reignbreaker</em> and <em>Hades</em> are hard to ignore. But <em>Reignbreaker</em>'s flavor of isometric run-and-gun-and-bash gameplay sets itself apart instantly with an extremely compelling steampunk aesthetic, full of clanging metal sound effects and relentless robotic enemies. That extends to the art direction, with thick outlines making it easy to pick out the color-coded hazards from the dull blues and grays of the metal-and-stone backgrounds.</p>
<p><em>Reignbreaker</em> also stands out for some extremely chunky-feeling melee attacks and a javelin that can be used for powerful ranged projectiles or slammed down as a temporary turret. Tight controls make it a joy to dash between enemy projectiles as you wait for the opportune moment to go in for the kill. The <em>Reignbreaker</em> demo also shows off a few of the powerful bosses that will require most players to acquire a few permanent power-ups before making it too deep into the game's randomized corridors.</p>
<p>This is one to keep an eye on as <em>Hades 2</em> continues to barrel through Early Access toward its eventual final release</p>

<h2><em>Shuffle Tactics</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LG0WEHIL7RQ?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Club Sandwich<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> "Coming soon"<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Singleplayer, Roguelike, Tactical RPG, Isometric<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186580/Shuffle_Tactics/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>Like any good game with the word "Tactics" in its title, <em>Shuffle Tactics</em> is all about positioning. Move your units on a grid to maximize the damage they can inflict on enemies while minimizing the counterattacks that will inevitably come on their next turn. You know the drill.</p>
<p>But <em>Shuffle Tactics</em> adds just a hint of <em>Slay the Spire</em> into the mix, limiting your actions to those drawn from a deck of cards that you can build and modify between battles. As the game goes on, that means you might not be sure what options will be available on your next turn, forcing some quick improvisation if you want to maximize your chances.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>I'm already a big fan of the demo's satisfying sword-throwing mechanic, which lets you toss your melee weapon for a ranged attack and then call it back for more damage when it returns to your hand. I'm also enamored with the game's evocative pixel-art animations, which make every movement and attack a joy to watch.</p>
<p>My biggest problem is that the demo gets very difficult very quickly; I had quite a few runs fall apart incredibly early when faced with an unavoidable "Elite" matchup that I wasn't yet powerful enough to conquer. Hopefully. the developer can work out the balancing issues before launch because this mix of tactical strategy and card-based luck is a match made in heaven.</p>

<h2><em>Squirreled Away</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LhJk44xeF6w?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Far Seas<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> "Coming soon"<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Exploration, Third Person, Cute, Relaxing<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2977620/Squirreled_Away/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>"Be the squirrel" is Far Seas' description of its upcoming game, and while that's a big promise, <em>Squirreled Away </em>seems on track to deliver. You're not <em>just</em> a squirrel, mind you, but a tool-crafting, home-building, achievement-unlocking squirrel, owing to the demands of the gaming format. But when moving around, you get to experience the manic, sticky-pawed, and often weightless nature of squirreldom. Why do squirrels run corkscrews around the perimeter of a tree instead of climbing straight up? Maybe because, like me, they're trying to keep up with their camera view on their right controller stick while moving with the left.</p>
<p><em>Squirreled Away</em>'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3453320/Squirreled_Away_Demo/">demo</a> gives you a taste of its core mechanics, like stashing away items in a cache for winter or building an axe out of a pebble and twig so you can break larger branches into sticks for a fellow squirrel. The look, feel, and sound of the experience are decidedly calm, with single-instrument melodies lilting in and out as you scamper about, gather resources, and unlock quests and areas. You have health and stamina bars, but the game is gentle if you run them out, sending you back to safety or reminding you to eat some food.</p>
<p>It feels like a more kinetic <em>Animal Crossing</em>, with friendly animals and low-stakes challenges. Except that at any time, you could bail on your tasks, scamper upward, and leap from one far-out branch to another, living out the daydreams of anybody who works next to a window overlooking a tree.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken">Tekken</a> boss Katsuhiro Harada has responded to a fan on social media criticising the new design of Anna Williams, stating "there will always be people like you".</p>
<p>Yesterday Bandai Namco revealed Anna would be the next fighter to join <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> as part of its ongoing DLC roadmap, complete with a redesign of her look - as with many returning characters.</p>
<p>However one fan shared their disappointment on social media requesting the old design return. "I don't like the new design," they wrote, "replacing Anna with this new character is the devs way at getting back at Anna fans for all these years of support makes me feel sad."</p>

<p>"While 98 percent of the fans are welcoming this, there will always be people like you," wrote Harada in response. "I understand and sympathise that it may not suit your personal taste, but if you prefer the old design, past works already exist. I am not taking those away from you.</p>
<p>"Also, you refer to yourself as 'Anna fans,' as if you represent all Anna fans, but you should express your opinion as an individual."</p>
<p>Harada then referred to the impossibility of pleasing players, writing: "You threaten to quit if she isn't brought back. You complain the moment she is brought back. You demand that she be reverted after she has been completely redesigned from scratch, including her model and framework. And if she actually were reverted, you'd just say, 'That's recycling!'"</p>
<p>"Either way," he concluded, "your method of expressing your opinion and the content of your argument are entirely unconstructive, utterly pointless, and, above all, disrespectful to the other Anna fans who are genuinely looking forward to her."</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1894542252967649717">Harada additionally responded to a more positive response</a> to Anna's design, and explained why he often responds to negative opinions.</p>
<p>"It's because these negative folks tend to have a narrow perspective," he said. "If I don't respond, they start spreading toxicity, saying things like, 'Why won't they engage with the community?!'"</p>
<p>He responded to other negative comments too, stating: "If you don't like something, you don't have to buy it, you don't have to comment, and you can simply leave."</p>
<p>Harada's comments exemplify the frustration of developers battling online toxicity. Take former PlatinumGames boss Hideki Kamiya, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-calls-out-shty-leakers-in-wake-of-switch-2-reveal">called out "shitty leakers" in the wake of Nintendo's Switch 2 reveal</a>, or Riot Games' head Anna Donlon who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valorant-studio-head-tells-toxic-players-to-play-something-else-we-wont-miss-you">discussed the "current state of player behaviour" in Valorant</a> and told toxic players to "play something else, we won't miss you".</p>
<p>Harada caused confusion last month when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-boss-says-he-just-wants-to-meet-more-people-as-fans-spot-linkedin-post-looking-for-work">set his LinkedIn profile to "open to work"</a>, causing fans to worry he would be leaving Bandai Namco. He responded saying he wanted to "broaden [his] horizons by connecting with more people".</p>
<p>Before Anna, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16s-clive-coming-to-tekken-8-as-first-seasons-final-dlc-character">Tekken 8 added Final Fantasy 16's Clive Rosfield</a> as a DLC character.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/26/fable-delayed-2026-new-gameplay-clips/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fable">Fable</a> has been delayed until 2026, giving developer Playground Games more time for their revival of this classic RPG series.</p>
<p>The news came from Head of Xbox Game Studios Craig Duncan – formerly the Rare Studio Lead until being promoted last year – who was speaking on the latest official Xbox podcast.</p>


<p>“<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/fable-gets-another-cinematic-trailer-and-a-release-window/">We previously announced the date for Fable as 2025</a>, we are actually going to give Fable more time and it’s going to ship in 2026 now,” he said. “While I know that’s not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want to assure people of is that it’s definitely worth the wait, and I have unequivocal confidence in the Playground team.”</p>
<p>Duncan also shared some new snippets of footage, beyond what was previously shown in the trailer last year, showing a snippet of combat against a werewolf, goblins, bandits in the city, and a cutscene with some cooked eggs and a bear trap. Nothing too deep, but little snippets to demonstrate the continued quality of the visuals that Playground are cooking up.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox Game Studios Update With Craig Duncan | Official Xbox Podcast" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7r1t_oDC7z8?start=853&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“Just think of the visuals of what you expect of Playground Games,” he said, “plus amazing gameplay, British humour, Playground’s version of Albion inspired by what’s gone before with the franchise, but their take in quite frankly the most beautifully realised version of Albion you’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>“So really excited about the plans and really excited about the future and I want the community to understand that we do these things for the best of the games and the teams, and ultimately that results in the best games.”</p>
<p>This time will naturally be used to refine and polish the game further, but there’s probably some broader strategic planning here. It’s potentially a similar situation to the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/avowed-review/">Avowed</a>. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/18/avowed-gameplay-deep-dive-reveals-fall-2024-release-window/">That game was set for a late 2024 launch</a>, but with Microsoft seeing that the end of last year was (at the time) packed with other big game launches, they chose to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/avowed-gets-new-release-date-of-february-18th-2025/">bounce it back to early 2025</a> to try and find it a little more breathing room.</p>
<p>For Fable, the elephant in the room is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">GTA 6</a>. While Rockstar’s games have traditionally been prone to get a big delay, Take Two has<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/"> repeatedly stated that it’s on target for the end of 2025</a>. Other publishers are sensibly wary of going up against what is inevitably going to be the biggest game of the decade, so we’ve already seen <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/the-next-battlefield-is-set-to-release-before-april-2026/">EA announce the next Battlefield</a> with a flexible release window to try and dodge GTA. It makes sense for Microsoft to do the same, even though Fable is in a completely different genre.</p>
<p>Fable is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PC, at the moment. Who knows if it’ll pop up elsewhere later down the line. Probably will, though.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/26/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Almost 30 years on from its debut, Tomb Raider is still one of the most recognisable names in gaming. Sure, we’re quite far removed from the series’ heyday, and are currently in a lull for both the modern games and movies, but Lara Croft’s adventures haven’t been entombed and forgotten by the public. Revisiting the original games seems like a great idea, to go back and have a look at where it all started. After playing these remakes, I have to say that maybe they are better left in our memories where the nostalgia can do all the heavy lifting.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vF9-JeSRRaI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now let’s get this straight, the remasters here are precisely what you expect them to be. We’ve got better quality textures, better lighting, and much better quality character models, which if you’re not familiar with the original PlayStation, didn’t really have many more polygons than the absolute minimum needed for a humanoid silhouette. You can jump between the new remastered visuals to the original graphics with the press of a button – something that still amazes me every time I see it, even if it’s a common trick for retro remasters.</p>



<p>But this second trilogy of Tomb Raider games is a bit different from the first, jumping ahead a generation to Angel of Darkness for the PS2 – Core Design’s sixth and final game in the series. After playing the first two games it can be a little hard to tell if you’re looking at a remastered version or the original in Angel of Darkness, until you examine things a little more closely. Lara’s model is the biggest giveaway, which is noticeably improved, but with the environments it’s hard to really spot the difference, some things even look untouched.</p>

<p>The biggest issue here is that this isn’t the ground breaking original Tomb Raider trilogy, it’s the second trilogy where Lara didn’t really know what to do with herself. The first two games are very much in line with their predecessors mostly, but even in the late 90s they were critiqued for retreading increasingly familiar ground. Heck, Core Design even tried to kill off their iconic heroine in The Last Revelation, only to have to create a kind of narrative clip show for Chronicles, while another team worked to bring her back for a jump to the new generation.</p>

<p>Angel of Darkness looked to revitalise the series, though making Lara into some kind of anti-hero in one of the weirder turns I’ve seen a series take. It’s not very good either, nor is it good at making it clear where you’re supposed to be going in the streets and rooftops of Paris that replace the tombs you’d expect to be raiding earlier on. There’s some cut content that’s been restored here with the Parisian Back Streets training area, and some other tweaks to subtly improve Angel of Darkness’ flaws, but these three games just aren’t Tomb Raider 1-3, which makes me far less willing to forgive the issues that remain.</p>
<p>Controls are still the biggest problem with these games, even if you still have the muscle memory from playing the original releases. The difficulty in these games comes almost entirely from absolutely horrendously bad tank controls, as they’re known, where left and right turn your character on the spot instead of strafing. Every single little thing you do, whether it’s pulling a lever, reaching a ledge, jumping for a rope, whatever, is made into a frustrating battle with the controls whilst you try to maneouvre yourself into just the right position.</p>

<p>A simple jump isn’t simple anymore, because you have to ensure you’re positioned perfectly beforehand, so it becomes a case of stopping and rotating on the spot before you can continue. Are you lined up right to grab that rope from a jump, or will you end up being two inches too far to the left? It doesn’t feel like “real” difficulty – as in, Dark Souls is difficult but it’s a challenge that’s fun to surmount, these remasters never feel challenging, they just feel annoying and success is just relief that you’re finally rid of whatever fiddly rubbish you were doing rather than celebrating overcoming a challenge.</p>
<p>As with the first batch of remasters, this trilogy does also come with a modern control setting that allows you to, shockingly, point your analog in a direction and move in that direction rather than turning like a tank. This is a little bit better when walking around but, once you get into a small platform that you need to rotate on so you can position yourself, you’ll likely walk off the edge trying to do it. There’s also the awkwardness of moving when the camera switches to fixed positions, and more generally, the run animation has to end for a moment before you can start moving again.. These games were designed with tank controls in mind, so annoying as they are, manoeuvring without them is almost as frustrating.</p>
<p>There isn’t much else to say really. The first two games look nicer than they once did, the third looks almost the same, and other than that the games are so old that they came from before controls stopped being terrible. I’ve always wondered why I didn’t really like the Tomb Raider games, never made much progress, and mostly messed around in the mansion. It turns out it’s because they’re bad? If Aspyr decide the remake the next trilogy of Tomb Raider games, though, it will begin with Tomb Raider Legend, the first genuinely good Tomb Raider because Lara, the titular tomb raider, can climb a wall without five minutes of prep first.</p>

<p>WWE 2K25 is going all out again to deliver a spectacle like nothing else. It’s the latest release in 2K’s vision of professional wrestling, and Xbox Game Pass Subscribers wonder if they can get a piece of the action.</p>



<p>Every new WWE 2K release feels like Wrestlemania. You have months of build-up and anticipation leading to a special payoff. Once a new game is out, attention naturally diverts toward DLC and updates, but behind the scenes, 2K is busy readying for their Wrestlemania next year. When WWE 2K24 was released, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a> presumably became the focus.</p>



<p>It’s nearly time for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a> to walk the aisle. But if you’re an Xbox Game Pass subscriber, let’s see if you can score a front-row ticket for cheap.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-wwe-2k25-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play WWE 2K25 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This is setting Priest on the warpath. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It doesn’t look like WWE 2K25 is a day-one Xbox Game Pass option for subscribers as no advertising or marketing suggests this.</strong></p>



<p>Xbox is proud of games coming to Game Pass and advertises them at all costs. Announcement trailers usually have the Game Pass logo stamp on them. It’s also mentioned in press releases and news articles.</p>



<p>WWE 2K25 has had countless trailers and press releases to this point. However, there’s no indication of WWE 2K25 being on Game Pass. Another tried and tested insight into a game’s Game Pass status is Microsoft’s Xbox Store.</p>



<p>If you go to the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/wwe-2k25-standard-edition/9P6NQMP5LXD6/0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25</a> game page, you’ll find <strong>no mention of playing the title through Game Pass</strong>. Instead, it’s a case of paying full price digitally or physically or finding yourself a tasty bargain.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-wwe-2k25-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will WWE 2K25 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>The chances of WWE 2K25 coming to Xbox Game Pass are very low—borderline not happening.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-pga-tour-2k25-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> is another 2K sports title released within a month of WWE 2K25. That’s also not coming to Game Pass, and 2K sports titles generally don’t. They don’t even come to Game Pass a year or two after release.</p>



<p>If you’re desperate to step into the squared circle and engage in graps, you must buy WWE 2K25 outright.</p>



<hr>



<p>Should 2K and Microsoft tighten up their partnership stronger than a sleeper hold and deliver 2K sports titles on Game Pass? Or are you not bothered and are committed to buying each new WWE 2K title anyway? </p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Last night, Warner Bros shocked the industry when it was announced the closure of three studios, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">including Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor's Monolith Productions</a>. Founded in the 1990s and part of Warner Bros since 2004, the studio was best known for Shadow of Mordor and its follow-up Shadow of War, which both used the studio's patented Nemesis system.
</p>
<p>The Nemesis system, for those unfamiliar, is a clever in-game mechanic which tracks a player's actions to create enemies that feel capable of remembering past encounters. In the studio's Middle-earth games, this allowed foes to rise through the ranks and enact revenge.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monolith-is-making-a-wonder-woman-game">Nemesis system was set to be utilised again in Monolith's Wonder Woman game</a>, though that project has now been cancelled alongside the studio's sudden closure - leaving the Nemesis system seemingly now lying unused, and protected by Warner Bros due to its successful patent application.</p>

</figure>
<p>The patent itself - <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160279522A1/en">which you can view here</a> - was originally filed back in 2016, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-is-trying-to-patent-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordors-nemesis-system">before it was granted in 2021</a>. It is dubbed "Nemesis characters, nemesis forts, social vendettas and followers in computer games". As it stands, the patent has an expiration date of 11th August, 2036.</p>
<p>So, even though Monolith is getting shut down, Warner Bros will be able to retain the patent for the Nemesis system for another 11 years, should it keep up the patent's associated fees.</p>
<p>Many are upset that this may well mean the death of the Nemesis system. "They really patented the Nemesis System only to do absolutely nothing with it," <a href="https://x.com/MarsSuccessor/status/1894469391846105516">wrote one social media user</a>. "RIP the Nemesis system, I guess," added <a href="https://x.com/Cade_Onder/status/1894486393952317771">video game journalist Cade Onder</a>. </p>
<p>"Monolith literally created a one-of-a-kind system that procedurally generated a complete hierarchy of unique enemies that interacted with the player and itself in the Nemesis System," <a href="https://x.com/counterscottGO/status/1894467261261389908">another wrote</a>. "WB took that from them, patented it, and then closed their studio. Fuck them."</p>

<p>Needless to say, the news of Monolith's closure last night, along with the closure of Player First Games and Warner Bros Games San Diego, has been met with sadness across the industry.</p>
<p>Comic book writer Gail Simone, who was serving as a consultant on Monolith's Wonder Woman title, said the game was both "gorgeous and expansive".</p>
<p>"It was beautiful to look at. I am not going to give details for a number of reasons, but every effort was made to make this not just a great game, but a great WONDER WOMAN game," Simone wrote on social media, calling the project a "showpiece epic". The consultant added the team wanted to "make the best game ever", however "sometimes, you give your all and it doesn’t work out".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/edge-of-eternity-studio-announces-jrpg-follow-up-with-xenoblade-and-chrono-trigger-talent<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
The French developer behind million-selling indie role-player Edge of Eternity has announced a fresh follow-up, Edge of Memories.
</p>
<p>
This new game - a blend of JRPG mechanics and French animation - is set in the same world, and will launch this autumn for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>
Once again, the Montpellier-based Studio Midgar has recruited JRPG veterans to join the game's development, with Edge of Eternity featuring an expanded roster. This includes Nier writer Sawako Natori and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-10">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> character designer Raita Kazama.

<p>
For the game's music, some of which you can hear in the game's reveal trailer above, Studio Midgar has called in Nier and Nier Automata singer Emi Evans, as well as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> and Xenogears composer Yasunori Mitsuda, plus <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a> composer Mariam Abounnasr.
</p>
<p>
Edge of Memories is being designed as an action RPG, with real-time combat focused on chaining combos across the game's plague-ridden new continent of Avaris. Today's teaser ends with the game's main character looking like she can draw power from the plague too - intriguing!
</p>
<p>The game's Kickstarter-funded predecessor Edge of Eternity launched on PC back in 2021 to a decent if not overly-enamoured response. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indie-jrpg-edge-of-eternity-headed-to-consoles-next-year">console version turned up in 2022</a>, including a cloud version for Switch. I wonder if we'll see <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> port announced down the line?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Fable has been delayed to 2026 for a few different reasons, according to rumors circulating online, but the delay may not be all bad news for PlayStation 5 owners.</p>
<p>Well-known Xbox leaker eXtas1s reported in a new video that one of their sources who informed them about a possible delay for the new entry in the series at the end of last month, said Fable has been delayed to next year for a few reasons, which include technical reasons caused by the Forza engine that powers the game that has been created for racing games. Also, additional development time was required to make some other adjustments to the game, including gameplay adjustment and pace of progression improvements, as gameplay in one of its first forms wasn't considered too fun. While it wouldn't have been a proper Fable game without a delay caused by technical issues, the comments on gameplay are certainly more concerning, so hopefully, the additional development time will help in this regard.</p>

<p>While this unnamed source said that Fable hasn't been delayed specifically due to the development of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/">PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2 ports</a>, a simultaneous console multiplatform launch is within the realms of possibility, according to well-known insider <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot34-reseteora.1090722/post-136273683" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NateDrake</a>. As the game was apparently scheduled to launch on other consoles one year after its PC and Xbox debut, it's definitely possible for Fable to launch on all consoles and PC at the same time in 2026.</p>
<p>The Fable delay to 2026 was confirmed yesterday during the latest episode of the official Xbox podcast. You can head over<a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/"> here</a> to learn more about the announcement and check out some pre-alpha gameplay.</p>

            <p>The upcoming reboot for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-everything-we-know">Fable</a>, the fantasy role-playing game of British chortles 'n' chuckles, has been delayed until next year, says head of Xbox Game Studios Craig Duncan. Developers Playground Games need "more time" to create the world of Albion, it turns out, but Xbox has offered a sparse sprinking of of game footage as compensation for the delay. There's nothing particularly mind-blowing among it. Some combat, some vistas. But it's something.</p>

<p>"We previously announced the date for Fable as 2025," said Duncan in an interview during the <a href="https://youtu.be/7r1t_oDC7z8?feature=shared&amp;t=857">Official Xbox Podcast</a>. "We are actually going to give Fable more time and it's going to ship in 2026 now. While I know that's not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want to assure people of is that it's definitely worth the wait... I have unequivocal confidence in the Playground team."</p>
<p>Duncan goes on to talk over some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h77gcgE1b8">pre-alpha footage of the RPG</a>. There are scenes of the player character walking through a city, riding their horse, and fighting what looks like various fantasy staples such as werewolves and goblins. At one point the player is being accosted by a giant violent chicken, which fans of the old games will undoubtedly welcome with feathery fondness (the humble chicken is the butt of many jokes, basically a series mascot). At another point the hero is using sausages in a frying pan as bait in a bear trap. I can cofirm this is how the British aristocracy spend their time ever since fox hunting got banned.</p>
<p>Playground Games are best known for their work on the Forza racing games, which are often hyper-realistic and glistening with The Graphics. Which would be why Duncan reassures prospective players that their RPG will be "the most beautifully realized version of Albion you've ever seen". That werewolf's hair is very detailed, to be fair. But as ever we'll reserve judgement until we get our hands on the beast ourselves.</p>
<p>The Fable reboot was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brand-new-fable-announced-for-pc-and-xbox">officially announced in 2020</a> but there had been rumours about it as far back as 2017. We've seen a couple of cinematic trailers since the announcement, starring the likes of comedy actors <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-trailer-doesnt-have-much-fable-does-have-richard-ayoade">Richard Ayoade</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FiBmVBaY0g">Matt King</a>. But now it'll be a whole other year until we see if their jokes land.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
