		<p>March’s PlayStation Plus monthly games have been announced, and it’s a very mixed bag with three big franchises.</p>
<p>First up, fans of loud trousers and little balls will be delighted with PGA Tour 2K25 on PS5, which originally launched just under a year ago.</p>
<p><iframe title="PGA Tour 2K25 - Launch Trailer I PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/56kdTsvVzYU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We gave the game a respectable<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/26/pga-tour-2k25-review/"> 8/10 in our review.</a> “While not striking the same feeling of EA’s golf games of old, PGA Tour 2K25 is HB Studios’ best effort yet,” said Nick. “There’s enough here to keep you going for a while and if the PGA Tour 2K series continues on this trajectory, might just have the best take on golf games in years to come.”</p>

<p>The next title is rather older, Monster Hunter Rise launched on Switch March 2021 with the PS5 version launching in 2023. Both the PS4 and PS5 version will be available.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Rise - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_zAOt8auYbw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“Monster Hunter Rise is an incredible game,” gushed Dominic in our<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/23/monster-hunter-rise-review-nintendo-switch/"> 9/10 review of the Switch version</a>. “While it may not feel quite as ground-breaking for the series as World did, it boasts a stronger and distinctly Japanese identity, and the changes and streamlined gameplay simply focus on the franchise’s true stars – the monsters. Rise is easily one of the best games for the Nintendo Switch, and one of the finest Monster Hunters ever.” He also gave the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/17/monster-hunter-rise-ps5-review-xbox-series-x/">PS5 version 9/10 as well</a>.</p>
<p>If you have never played the game, fret not, we have a bunch of guides for you.</p>

						<h5>God of War: Sons of Sparta</h5><p><span>February 12th, 2026</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Publisher</h5><p><span>Sony Interactive Entertainment</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Mega Cat Studios, Santa Monica Studio</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p><strong>Sony</strong>’s latest <strong>State of Play</strong> was full of surprises that players weren’t expecting from both old franchises and now, but perhaps the most unexpected was a new <strong>God of War</strong> title developed by a studio about as far as you could get from <strong>Santa Monica Studio</strong>’s AAA pedigree: <strong>Mega Cat Studios</strong>. A retro-first developer that’s made some of the latest titles to be released for the Sega Genesis and NES, the concept of <strong>Cory Barlog</strong> lending out the likeness off <strong>Kratos </strong>to another indie studio was something players would have never expected from 2026’s Sony Interactive Entertainment, where so many of their signature exclusives either dabble in live service or the cinematic and thousand-man-hour graphical powerhouses. <strong>God of War: Sons of Sparta</strong> represents a radical take on Kratos’ origin, but does this trip to Laconia appeal to more than just series tourists?</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/God-of-War-Sons-of-Sparta-Love-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p><strong>On the surface, God of War: Sons of Sparta shares so little with the namesake beyond a tattooed Kratos spending his afternoon whittling a gift for his daughter Calliope and sharing a story from his past</strong>. Strip these sentimental moments of narration, and you’re left with a Greek tragedy that could have just as easily been told about any other two Spartan brothers without dipping into the rich lore of David Jaffe and Cory Barlog’s franchise. The Olympian gods and the gifts they bestow sight unseen fit the Metrovania formula without anything that feels inherently linked to God of War.</p>



<p>Beyond the shaky ties binding Kratos and his brother Deimos to this Greek tragedy is <strong>a rather memorable story about the brotherhood of Spartans and how abandoning one means abandoning Sparta</strong>. Kratos’ journey is a rather simple one on the surface: find out what happened to fellow cadet Vasilis and safely bring them back home. Along the way, there are a few other Spartans who help guide and shape Kratos’ first formative adventure, but none have the same staying power in the story as Deimos. <strong>The two constantly banter back and forth like a straight man and funny man Manzai routine</strong>, with Kratos usually playing the stoic, serious older brother. <strong>Yes, there is a co-op mode</strong> here as promised by the developers, but it already has two strikes against it: it isn’t unlocked until after beating the game for the first time, and is limited to a select number of combat challenges for the brothers to overcome.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/God-of-War-Sons-of-Sparta-Stab-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>What can make or break an explorative platformer comes down to two core systems: exploration and how players interact with the environment, whether it’s by way of combat or solving emergent puzzles ala Rain World and Animal Well. <strong>The first is something I do have to applaud Mega Cat Studios for: trying something new with the franchise</strong>, even if it felt heavily bloated by the end of the 30 hours I spent running through Laconia's various biomes. New abilities are provided at a regular clip, with new gifts bestowed by the gods upon Kratos, which all serve a dual purpose of traversal and murder.</p>



<p>Long before he was “gifted” the Blades of Chaos, Kratos was a proud Spartan of the Agoge and only knew discipline with the spear and shield. As the single weapon used during the adventure, <strong>the options at the player’s disposal are quite limited compared to what one might expect from a God of War prequel</strong>. Among the two types of resources Kratos can spend on attacks is Spirit, a type of energy that augments almost all of his attacks to deal less damage but builds up a separate stun counter for that enemy. Fill it, and the enemy is left wide open for a Brutal Kill, perhaps the single most inspired by God of War above everything else that can be found in Sons of Sparta.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/God-of-War-Sons-of-Sparta-Spirit-Box-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>One thing that made the franchise so memorable was the dynamic combat, giving Kratos so many different tools to murder his foes. <strong>Scaling it all down to a single weapon not only limits that freeform combat but also reduces it to something that doesn’t fit into the greater ethos of the series</strong>. Even with the various gifts he receives from the gods, combat feels largely stiff and is at odds with the concept of what Kratos will eventually become. Enemies, especially in the later biomes or when Kratos’ level is lower than his foe’s, are HP sponges that simply take too long to dispatch. What’s intended here is to use your regular attacks to fill your spirit gauge and then hold down R1 to augment your strikes to deal additional damage (and recover a small amount of health in the meantime). I get that Mega Cat Studios is trying to combine the orb fountains of earlier God of War games with the deliberate flow of something like DooM Eternal, where each attack is intended to recover a certain resource or be more effective against a specific enemy type. <strong>Unfortunately, without the careful balance of these other titles, not playing the way the devs intended just makes routine fights drag on and pad the runtime</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>What I have to give the developers credit for is how the different biomes of Laconia slowly open themselves up to the player</strong>. Out-of-reach platforms and one-way obstacles are routinely scattered around the critical path for players to pass by the first time they traverse through the expanse biomes, only to return much later in the campaign with the requisite tools to do so. Sometimes players will get a gift and learn how to use it for traversal through emergent gameplay rather than just explicitly telling players outright exactly what every tool is used for (although there are more than plenty of tutorials to stop players if you want the signposting). One that wasn’t immediately apparent was that I assumed I was missing something crucial, where a variety of trees were scattered around Laconia, each bearing a single fruit. Since I couldn’t cut them free or otherwise interact to pick them off the vine, I assumed they were intended for a side quest, and I wouldn’t be able to gather them otherwise. It wasn’t until by pure accident that I tried plucking and sucking the fruits off the branch with the same suction powers granted to the Lycurgus Bust that was used much earlier in the adventure to gather up noxious fumes to traverse safely.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Midway through the adventure, Kratos will get a signature upgrade to take a snapshot of the room he’s in and create a catalog of points of interest when stumbling across an obstacle that takes a tool he’s otherwise missing</strong>. Granted, this was something I had first seen in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, but I am excited to see other developers embrace the feature as we’re well past the days of having to draft out maps and plot out points of interest by hand. Each biome also has its own discrete list of objectives and collectibles, so no needing to scour the entire world map just to find one iron bar you’re missing for the last craftable recipe.</p>



<p>If anything would detract from the exploration of God of War: Sons of Sparta beyond the combat, it would be the sheer length of the adventure. <strong>Most of the Iga-developed Castlevania titles can be comfortably finished in around 8-10 hours</strong>, depending on your appetite for completion. Here, with the adventure running triple that length with far less enjoyable (even if more mechanically complex) combat, <strong>I was eager to roll credits before I even hit the twenty-hour mark</strong>. For $30, players will certainly get their money’s worth, even if the adventure isn’t as refined as the pixel art would show.</p>

<p><strong>God of War: Sons of Sparta is a perfectly fine Metrovania on its own, but it doesn’t live up to the Kratos lineage otherwise</strong>. Either temper your expectations for Kratos’ origin story, or go into this one with an open mind that it’s another generic Greek adventure, and you won’t find your time in Laconia to be a tragedy.</p>

					<h2>God of War: Sons of Sparta</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>God of War: Sons of Sparta plays it safe when no other God of War title had done so before. Rather than the rage-fueled narrative of a Kratos beyond redemption, this story focuses on his formative years as a proper Spartan and learning the meaning of duty. Trouble is, the story could have just as easily been told with any two Greek brothers to the same effect.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Rich pixel art that makes the various biomes and populace feel distinctively different
</li><li>Hundreds of secrets and collectibles scattered around the world
</li><li>One particular unlockable (found within Sparta itself) pings hidden collectibles
</li><li>Each biome has its own collection list, so no scouring the world for one missing item
</li><li>No missable trophies or collectibles
</li><li>Close to thirty hours per playthrough for the completionists</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>Kratos has a constant hunch when charging about like a caveman with spear in hand
</li><li>Padded in unnecessary ways (especially when trying to complete the entire skill tree)
</li><li>Combat lacks dynamic moments and instead feels like a slog even as Kratos earns more gifts of the gods
</li><li>Only a few surface level references to Kratos' history on an adventure that doesn't live up to the God of War legacy
</li><li>Co-Op mode is not what players would expect and remains a postgame unlockable
</li><li>Narrative loses steam part-way and has some major padding issues throughout</li>						</ul>

<p>The latest Xbox Wire has announced updates to cloud screening quality for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members. They’ve also announced updates to ROG Xbox Ally and more.</p>



<p>The latest Xbox Wire has tied together a major change to Xbox platforms. The top change spotlighted an upgrade to Xbox Cloud Gaming. They have begun to allow up to 1440p, higher bitrate streaming for Game Pass Ultimate members. This update is specifically for current and last-gen consoles, joining the PC app, handhelds, and other tech that can run Game Pass.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-rog-xbox-ally-updates">New ROG Xbox Ally Updates</h2>



<p>They have also announced upgrades to the ROG Xbox Ally family of handhelds, including the ability to easily format removable storage. This update also works with officially licensed SanDisk microSD cards made exclusively for the handhelds. Now, when you’re installing a game on your Ally, you can select your removable storage Drive and format them directly.</p>



<p>They’ve also announced an update to graphic shaders on the Ally handhelds. When playing certain games, Ally and Ally X players will now see a pop-up indicating whether shaders were pre-compiled. Advanced Shader Delivery preloads game shaders during download to ensure a smoother experience when opening a game for the first time.</p>







<p>Other updates include adding Reanimal, High on Life 2, and Dragon Quest VII Reimagined to the handheld compatibility program. Reanimal is listed as “mostly compatible,” while the other two games are optimized for handheld play. Check out the full Wire here.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/valve-accused-of-promoting-illegal-gambling-with-loot-boxes-in-new-lawsuit-2000673735</link>
            <guid>1446490</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>New York state’s attorney general is suing Valve over its use of loot boxes in games like <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>. Attorney General Letitia James said Valve “enables gambling through” its popular multiplayer games.</p> <p>On February 25, the <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2026/attorney-general-james-sues-game-developer-promoting-illegal-gambling-through">New York attorney general’s office filed a lawsuit against Valve in Manhattan</a>. The state is accusing Valve, the company behind Steam, the largest digital gaming store on the planet, of violating its laws against gambling while also claiming its loot boxes will lead to children becoming addicted to gambling.</p> <p>“Illegal gambling can be harmful and lead to serious addiction problems, especially for our young people,” said Attorney General James. “Valve has made billions of dollars by letting children and adults alike illegally gamble for the chance to win valuable virtual prizes. These features are addictive, harmful, and illegal, and my office is suing to stop Valve’s illegal conduct and protect New Yorkers.” In the lawsuit and a press release, the state even directly compared Valve’s loot boxes to slot machines.</p>

 <p>Attorney General James criticized Valve’s system of charging people to buy digital keys to open virtual loot boxes and said that “Valve intentionally makes some items far harder to win than others, making the rare items more valuable.”<a href="https://kotaku.com/counter-strike-blue-gem-skin-sells-one-million-dollars-1851521593"> In 2024, a single <em>Counter-Strike</em> skin sold for over $1 million.</a></p> <p>In its lawsuit against Valve, New York is seeking to permanently stop Valve from promoting gambling features in its video games and wants to force the company behind <em>Half-Life</em> to pay various fines for violating New York’s law.</p>

 <p>In 2023 alone, <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-counter-strike-cs2-csgo-cases-keys-2023-1-billion-1851190615">Valve reportedly made nearly $1 billion off of <em>Counter-Strike</em> keys</a>. The skins and cosmetic items found in these digital boxes, which have been a part of many Valve games for years now, can be extremely valuable and are often sold on Steam’s marketplace. Valve gets a cut of every sale on this marketplace and has full control over it. In 2025, Valve made changes to how the skin economy worked and in the process, reportedly wiped out over a billion dollars, <a href="https://kotaku.com/counter-strike-2-cs2-valve-skin-marketplace-covert-red-2000638560">leading to a <em>CS2</em> crash among skin collectors, sellers, and traders</a>. Buying keys, opening boxes, trading skins, and selling cosmetics continues to be a controversial part of Valve’s gaming empire, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/youtube-gta-6-gambling-skins-violence-csgo-2000639821">YouTube cracking down on videos in 2025 that promote so-called “skin casinos” and third-party marketplaces.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The state of New York is suing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/valve/" id="172462">Valve</a>, claiming its loot box system constitutes gambling.</p>



<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James’ complaint asserts that loot boxes in Steam games, such as Counter-Strike 2 and DOTA 2, facilitate gambling by encouraging players to pay for a chance to win rare items, similar to how a slot machine operates. Gambling is illegal in New York, outside of certain exceptions.</p>



<p>“Illegal gambling can be harmful and lead to serious addiction problems, especially for our young people,” said Attorney General James. “Valve has made billions of dollars by letting children and adults alike illegally gamble for the chance to win valuable virtual prizes. These features are addictive, harmful, and illegal, and my office is suing to stop Valve’s illegal conduct and protect New Yorkers.”</p>







<h2 id="h-valve-is-new-york-s-attorney-general-latest-gambling-target">Valve is New York’s Attorney General Latest Gambling Target</h2>



<p>Ahead of the Super Bowl in early February, AG James took aim at the recent rise of prediction markets such as Kalshi, warning that they lack the same protections as regulated gambling venues.</p>



<p>Now, this lawsuit warns of the slippery slope from something like loot boxes to problematic behaviors in young individuals. The lawsuit cites a “well-known gaming publication” and claims that there are countless cases of kids using their parents’ credit cards to be sucked into the world of microtransactions and loot boxes, some as young as 11.</p>



<p>It stated that this lawsuit aims to permanently stop Valve from promoting gambling features in its games, to require Valve to disgorgue all ill-gotten gains, and to impose fines for violating New York’s laws.</p>

			<p>The <strong>PS Plus Essential</strong> games for <strong>March 2026</strong> have been <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/25/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-march-pga-tour-2k25-monster-hunter-rise-slime-rancher-2-the-elder-scrolls-online-collection-gold-road/">revealed</a>, and after February's lineup <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-february-2026-games-undisputed-ace-combat-subnautica-ultros/">added a couple of strong indie titles</a>, this month's lineup of four games includes a few bigger names like <strong>PGA Tour 2K25</strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-such-great-heights/"><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong> </a>headlining this month's batch.</p>



<p>Plays subscribed to the bottom tier of <strong>PS Plus</strong> or higher will get access to the two aforementioned games, along with <strong>Slime Rancher 2</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-zenimax-interview-free-content-battle-pass/">The Elder Scrolls Online Collection: Gold Road</a></strong> next week starting on <strong>March 3, 2026</strong>. As always, if you want to access these games after this coming month, you'll need to add them to your library before they're gone.</p>



<p>Speaking of adding these titles to your library, with next month's PS Plus Essential games arriving on March 3, that means <strong>March 2, 2026</strong>, will be your last chance to add February's games (<strong>Ultros, Undisputed, Subnautica: Below Zero</strong>, and <strong>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</strong>), to your library.</p>

<p>It's not the most exciting of PS Plus Essential game batches, but if any of these games are within your wheelhouse, they'll all certainly be able to provide you with hours of gameplay to dig into, particularly in the case of The Elder Scrolls Online and Monster Hunter Rise.</p>



<p>The bright side of this batch is that PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium members are actually getting new games to add to their library, instead of what can often happen where the new batch of Essential games includes titles that PS Plus Extra and higher-tier subscribers already had access to through PS Plus.</p>

              <p>President Trump gave his State of the Union speech to Congress last night. I skipped it and played video games instead as part of my ongoing 2026 resolution to practice more self-care. But pinhead sycophants like CNN contributor Scott Jennings and Trump advisor Stephen Miller thought it killed, especially one moment in which the president tried to trick Democrats into appearing unpatriotic by not standing in support of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/1/us-judge-orders-release-of-five-year-old-and-father-from-ice-detention">ICE kidnapping kids off the street</a>.</p> <p>“If you agree with this statement, then stand up and show your support: The first duty of the American government is to protect American citizens, not illegal aliens,” Trump told Congress. Got ’em! Sick burn, Mr. President! That’s how the charmless toadies riding his coattails responded on social media. “Will be signature moment of this speech,” Jennings, who gets paid <a href="https://www.status.news/p/scott-jennings-cnn-deal">the big bucks</a> to launder fascist talking points on cable TV, wrote somewhat normally. “Trump nailed them.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why does this guy always talk like a World of Warcraft npc <a href="https://t.co/HWIIhBWpSz">https://t.co/HWIIhBWpSz</a></p> <p>— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/2026696988272546182?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Then Miller responded like that friend at the party who promised you they they’d be chill and then moments later won’t shut up about the<em> Magic: The Gathering</em> banned card lists from 20 years ago. “Democrats declared to the world their searing disdain for, and profound disloyalty to, the actual citizens of the United States,” he wrote. “They were repeatedly entreated to stand. Over and over. They refused. It was a moment that chills to the bone and which will live for a thousand years.”</p> <p>Sounds about right for the guy <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/celebrity/articles/stephen-miller-danced-ice-ice-020716169.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABw1aucCtL0V3ooK882fxCGI3X9QkIovPuwGEiGYga_saAdGOLkXEfWwJdp4GXy_J7NKxRUKksUF1JrPccktILsrFTZ165XDBCDN7u8m0wwvMdWQaInFvi2yW8B2X6uw6y7LBUiRR3Mt7EH6_D3r_GLcmA3t8XWgmnGDKdlBQuuh">dancing like this</a> to “Ice Ice Baby” at Mar-a-Lago hours before his wife announces their fourth child. “Why does this guy always talk like a World of Warcraft npc,” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote back. “Holy shit…Wasn’t expecting to catch that stray today…” responded veteran Blizzard designer Chadd Nervig in the comments. Previously a developer on <em>World of Warcraft</em>, Nervig now works on <em>Hearthstone</em>, which has immortalized some of the MMO’s best NPCs in card form. It would all be that much funnier if Miller wasn’t foaming at the mouth 24/7 to ruin other people’s lives.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-developers-comment-on-new-locales-trailer-more-ign-fanfest-2026</link>
            <guid>1446457</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection’s release date is right around the corner, and IGN had the chance to speak to the developers in depth about a brand new locales trailer released at IGN Fan Fest. We’ve got never-before-seen concept art of the three main bases in the game – Azuria Castle, Shepharden, and Galyad – and insightful commentary from director Kenji Oguro, art director Takahiro Kawano, and lead game designer Daisuke Wakahara. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> is shaping up to be a beautiful game, which is wholly supported by the diverse scenery you’ll encounter on your journey as an environmentalist Ranger. The Monster Hunter Stories 3 team allocated a lot of time and research into making the locations enjoyable for players, and their attention to detail shows. You can watch the new locales video with commentary direct from the developers above, or, if you’d like to immerse yourself in the scenery with no commentary and a few bonus scenes, check out the trailer below. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Azuria </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played the free demo version of Monster Hunter Stories 3, you’ve seen Azuria. This land features fields, forests, and picturesque mountains on the horizon with a castle town on a lake, lending a classic storybook backdrop. 
</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Azuria Concept Art - Monster Hunter Stories 3</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the design process, we wanted to make the stereotypical fantasy castle type of design to depict how peaceful Azuria is, and to depict the beautiful nature of the world of Azuria and the castle itself,” Kawano said. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team had some real-world inspiration that made its way into the concept art for the surrounding area of Azuria and its castle, specifically, a Spanish castle called Alcazar de Segovia. This wouldn’t be the first time the castle has inspired a creator – as part of its 100th anniversary, The Walt Disney Company revealed in 2023 that it was the inspiration for Snow White’s castle. A magical locale, indeed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kawano also described how the wing-like flags represent the wings of Rathalos to signify the special bond Azuria has with the endangered species. The town even has a runway of sorts for monsters to take flight, something uniquely logical for the Stories series, where Riders form bonds with monsters called Monsties and, as the name suggests, ride them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The attention to detail in the scenery carries into the connection of Twisted Reflection's story as well. The main catalyst of the plot in Stories 3 is the “Crystal Encroachment,” a phenomenon with unknown origins affecting both the environment and monsters, but the Egg Quartz it leaves behind is used by the residents of Azuria and elsewhere as a source of light. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Shepharden</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shepharden Concept Art - Monster Hunter Stories 3</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Shepharden is the second locale the protagonist and the rangers will visit, and if you’ve played a certain entry in the regular Monster Hunter lineup, you may recognize the lush environment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One key feature of [Shepharden] is that monsters from Monster Hunter Rise inhabit the area around it,” revealed Kawano. “So based on Monster Hunter Rise, as you may have known, it has a very Eastern, Asia-like taste. So Shepharden and the surrounding area is also designed after that art style.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might also notice a structure at the base of the stairs to the village elder’s place inspired by Japanese torii gates, clearly recognizable as orange, angular arches. Right beneath that torii gate are masks stuck into the ground, which represent the graves of the former elders of the village, explained Kawano. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Shepharden detail the team had to consider is that this village is not built for Riders the way Azuria is. As such, there aren’t stables – so Ratha, the protagonists’ Rathalos, is stuck into a very small space that’s part of an unused residence. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Galyad</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Galyad Concept Art - Monster Hunter Stories 3</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Galyad is a bustling, prosperous town surrounded by desert and relatively desolate lands compared to Azuria and Shepharden. It’s covered in decoration, stones, and jewelry, somewhat fueled by the residents’ successful trade of Egg Quartz. Kawano described that as you get deeper into the city of Galyad, you might discover a boundary between the prosperous residents and the not-so-fortunate residents, and find slum-like areas. 
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The city’s architecture and design is actually inspired by Mediterranean regions and even has a Lagiacrus fountain in the city center. It's especially interesting given the desert environment – Lagiacrus is, after all, a Leviathan monster known to inhabit the water. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Galyad used to be an ocean port city that was floating on top of the ocean,” Kawano explained. “So all the jewelry and the decorations were based off of the Mediterranean sea theme, but desertification has caused the city to lose all the water and it is currently barren, sandy. So that is the reason why there's a difference between the decorations and the actual cityscape itself.” 
</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Monster Hunter 3: Twisted Reflection Q&amp;A </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, I had to take advantage of the time I had speaking with the Monster Hunter 3: Twisted Reflection developers, so I asked a few questions unrelated to the new trailer I thought might be interesting. We got into the game's more mature protagonist, the weapon availability, the habitat restoration mechanic, and dual-element monsters. 
</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The interview below has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I'd say habitat restoration is one of the biggest new gameplay mechanics in Monster Hunter Stories 3. Can you describe the inspiration behind building the system and why you included it?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kenji Oguro: </strong>The first reason we wanted to implement this feature into Stories 3 is because of the protagonist. He or she is the captain of the Ranger Corps and their objective is to protect and preserve the environment. So we wanted to express the preservation of the environment, not just only in the storyline, but in the actual gameplay cycle itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tthe second reason we implemented habitat restoration is to expand on the Monster Hunter Stories series formula, where deepening bonds with the monsters is very important. In the previous entries, you would collect monster eggs from dens, hatch them, and raise them, but the places where you could get those eggs were very limited and were the same across all players. But for Monster Hunter Stories 3, by implementing this habitat restoration feature, every player will have their very own environment. So your environment and my environment might differ a lot. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">By restoring the monster populations and sending them off back to the wilds, you might be able to find some rare eggs with dual-element monsters, as well as Deviant Monsters. [Deviant Monsters] are popular monsters from the previous Monster Hunter mainline series games. You might be able to find eggs of the Deviant monsters by raising the ecosystem rank within the habitat restoration feature. We wanted to reward players for helping to protect the environment and restoring the endangered species and growing their population in the world by providing rare monsters that might hatch from the eggs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: In the first Monster Hunter Stories, changing a Monstie’s element worked differently, and was achieved by swapping genes to change their stats. Can you tell us the reason behind changing this method to the new one? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kenji Oguro: </strong>In the first Stories game, when you change the genes of the monster and get a dual-element monster, the element that monster possesses completely changes. So that might end up as a disadvantage for a player if you get the wrong combination. But for Stories 3, the team wanted to expand the user's options more and also make habitat restoration more unique. So they implemented habitat restoration and by raising the ecosystem rank and getting the rare eggs, you are rewarded with the dual-element monster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Stories 3, the dual-element monster will retain their original element. So if the original monster has a fire element, they will keep the fire element, and on top of that, they'll get their second new element. So in the combat, players might want to keep the original fire element and get a new element on top.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This gives players an advantage and more options when they are forming their parties. Usually for RPG games, players tend to go for the strongest character or strongest monster with the highest stats and abilities. But developing Monster Stories 3, with the dual-element feature, you get special monsters with different appearances. One of [my] favorites is the Velocidrome imbued with the dragon element. So you get a pitch black Velocidrome, very badass. And that was [my] favorite monster within the development cycle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After finding [my] favorite dual-element monster, [I] found that, "Hey, maybe I can just play with my favorite monster instead of focusing on the stats or the ability skills." So that's one of the ways that the players can enjoy the game. It's not just going for the strongest, most powerful monsters, but instead finding a true partner that you love and want to bond with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I played the Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflections demo, and I did notice that the Long Sword was added to this game. It hasn't been in Monster Hunter Stories yet. But I didn't see the Sword and Shield in my bag. Can you tell me if the Sword and Shield is in Monster Hunter Stories 3, and why you decided to add the Long Sword?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Daisuke Wakahara: </strong>So first off, we implemented the Long Sword because the Long Sword itself throughout the Monster Hunter series is very popular amongst hunters and riders. However, we did have some trouble implementing the weapon itself into the RPG formula in the previous games. But in Monster Hunter Stories 3, we were able to come up with a formula to have the Long Sword join the weapon roster.</p><p>In terms of Sword and Shield, unfortunately, it is not going to be included in Monster Hunter Stories 3.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in terms of Sword and Shield, unfortunately, it is not going to be included in Monster Hunter Stories 3 this time around. The reason why we came to this decision is because we had to carefully think about the weapon balance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When looking at the overall weapon roster for Stories 3, we have Slash, Blunt, and Piercing weapon types. And having both Long Sword and Sword and Shield would change the roster to go towards the Slash weapon types a little too heavily, so we had to take out the Sword and Shield from the roster, unfortunately.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: The main character this time around is more of an adult than the previous protagonists in the Monster Hunter Stories series. Can you tell me why you made that decision to make the protagonist more mature this time around?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Takahiro Kawano: </strong>We wanted to differentiate this with the previous entry stories, Monster Hunter Stories and Monster Hunter Stories 2, where the focus was on a child growing into a young adolescent. We decided to start the story off with a full-grown adult as the elite rider. So in terms of the setting for Monster Hunter Stories 3,  the protagonist actually starts off already grown up as a prince or a princess of Azuria, and is an elite rider.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is there anything else you want to say to the fans watching before we let you go?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Takahiro Kawano: </strong>As you've seen in the video, we put a lot of effort into the background character designs for Monster Hunter Stories 3. So we’d like to have the players have fun and enjoy the beautiful scenery and the characters in Monster Hunter Stories 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Daisuke Wakahara:</strong> Thank you to all the players for supporting the Monster Hunter Stories series from the first title. You'll be surprised at how much the Monster Hunter Stories series has evolved throughout Stories 2 and the newest entry, Monster Hunter Stories 3. We are very confident in this game and that any player can enjoy it as an RPG title. So even if you haven't tried out the Monster Hunter Stories series yet, we highly encourage new players to try out the Monster Hunter Stories series. </p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p><strong>Kenji Oguro:</strong> [I’ve] played through Monster Hunter Stories 3 10 to 20 times during the development process. And every time I go through the gameplay, there's something new that the player can find. I’m very surprised that there's many, many cards up the development team’s sleeves. So we highly encourage you, the players, to have fun with the game. </p><p>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on March 12, 2026. You can play a free trial right now featuring a huge portion of the first area, Azuria, and continue your progress in the full release.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Casey DeFreitas is Deputy Editor of Guides at IGN, and is a first fleet Monster Hunter.

              <p>Full Circle, the studio behind the online-only <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-season-2-update-skin-tone-changes-tired-stoners-character-changes-2000649710"><em>Skate</em></a> reboot that launched last year, has announced that an unspeciifed amount of developers have been laid off.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle/news/an-update-from-fullcircle">On February 25,</a> EA-owned developer Full Circle posted on its official website that it is “reshaping” the studio to “better support” <em>Skate’s</em> “long-term future.” What does that actually mean? Well, it translates to some members of the studio being laid off.</p> <p>“These shifts mean making changes to our team structure, and some roles will be impacted,” posted Full Circle. “The teammates affected are talented colleagues and friends who helped build the foundation of skate. Their creativity and dedication are deeply ingrained in what players experience today. This decision is not a reflection of their impact and we’re committed to supporting them through this transition.”</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted EA for more information on the layoffs.</p> <p>Full Circle says its work on <em>Skate</em> will continue, adding: “Our commitment to <em>Skate</em> and to the millions of players who believe in it, remains strong.” The post wraps up with a message to the devs who are losing their jobs. “To our departing teammates: thank you. <em>Skate</em> exists because of your hard work and dedication to the craft.”</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/respawn-layoffs-star-wars-jedi-apex-legends-titanfall-1851778330">This is just the latest in a string of recent layoffs</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-panther-ea-cliffhanger-monolith-productions-1851782787">and game cancellations at EA</a>. Full Circle’s post doesn’t connect these layoffs to the massive <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">$55 billion Saudi Arabia-backed buyout</a> that is currently in the works. <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-steam-reviews-microtransactions-always-online-2000626503"><em>Skate</em> launched in September</a> of last year with a high playercount on SteamDB, but the online-only MMO-lite skating game has struggled to keep players around and news of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-grom-paywall-location-new-map-island-2000671466">new paid map expansion hasn’t helped win back frustrated fans.</a> The game’s third season launches March 10.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Prediction Markets Need Insider Trading, Despite What They Say]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/kalshi-mrbeast-insider-trading/</link>
            <guid>1446403</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>An editor for MrBeast was suspended from Kalshi and reported to the feds for insider trading, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/02/25/nx-s1-5726050/kalshi-insider-trading-enforcement-actions?ref=aftermath.site"><u>NPR</u></a> reported Wednesday. According to NPR, Artem Kaptur “traded around $4,000 on markets related to” the popular streamer, and that “Kaptur had ‘near-perfect trading success’ on bets about the YouTuber's videos with low odds, making the wagers appear suspicious.” Let me be the first to say: lmao, what did you think would happen.</p><p>Kaptur was reportedly barred from withdrawing his winnings, fined $20k, and reported to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In a statement to NPR, a spokesperson for Beast Industries, James “MrBeast” Donaldson’s company, said the company has “a longstanding policy in place against employees using proprietary company information” and that employees are not allowed to bet on markets relating to MrBeast.</p><p>According to NPR, this marks “the first time [Kalshi] has publicly revealed the results of an investigation into market manipulation,” though “Kalshi says in the past year it has opened 200 investigations into insider trading, 12 of which are still ongoing.”&nbsp;</p><p>Insider trading isn’t allowed on Kalshi or similar prediction market Polymarket, but this rule seems to fly in direct contrast to these companies’ promotions of themselves as sources of legitimate data. Prediction markets have been getting in bed with <a href="https://aftermath.site/journalism-prediction-markets/"><u>news outlets</u></a> lately, most recently with Polymarket’s increased involvement with Substack, in which it wrote in an <a href="https://news.polymarket.com/p/polymarket-is-doubling-down-on-substack?ref=aftermath.site"><u>announcement</u></a> that “data produced on our exchange has value for everyone on earth, especially for news readers who might never make a single trade.” This quote has been haunting me since I read it last week: what news or informational value is there in a bunch of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/2025/12/prediction-markets-and-the-suckerifcation-crisis-with-max-read/685330/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>manosphere-pilled</u></a> randos betting on what might happen <em>except</em> through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2026/jan/30/polymarket-prediction-markets-betting?ref=aftermath.site"><u>insider trading</u></a>? The only thing that makes any of this “data” in a journalistic sense is if people placing bets have some unique insight into the outcome; otherwise it’s just vibes. Several high-profile instances of suspicious bets have already emerged from these markets: a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/a-400000-payout-after-maduros-capture-put-prediction-markets-in-the-spotlight-heres-how-they-work?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Polymarket user won $400k</u></a> on a bet related to Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/02/12/nx-s1-5712801/polymarket-bets-traders-israel-military?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Israeli authorities have arrested and charged several people</u></a> on suspicion of betting on military operations.</p><p>Betting on MrBeast’s subscriber numbers or what he might say in an upcoming video, as NPR describes the market around the YouTuber, is far less consequential than international military moves. But it’s precisely these kinds of low-stakes situations that are <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-game-awards-2025-polymarket-kalshi-gambling/"><u>the lifeblood of these prediction markets</u></a>, and that are ripe for insider trading. At <a href="https://www.theverge.com/business/881967/polymarket-kalshi-journalism-sponsorship-ad?ref=aftermath.site"><u>The Verge</u></a>, Elizabeth Lopatto called them “pseudo-events… planned events that can be repeated, such as awards shows, press conferences, political conventions, and earnings calls.” They’re minor and, to some extent, predictable in their flow, and scores of everyday people are involved in their planning, production, and rollout. That makes them the perfect place for both outsiders and insiders to seize a chance to make a quick buck.</p><p>In December, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coinbase-ceo-earnings-call-words-prediction-markets-bets-2025-12?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong rattled off a list of words</u></a> Polymarket users had bets that he would say at the end of an earnings call. He claimed he was “just having a little bit of fun” and that he didn’t bet on the outcome himself, but the situation perfectly highlights the insider trading risk of these markets, especially surrounding minor events that can be pre-planned and manipulated. Armstrong himself even gets it, noting in a conversation with a nominee to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission&nbsp; that "You actually want insider trading [on these markets]... You want [someone]... who has really good information to be trading so you get better, higher quality signal out of them, right? Now, if you want to preserve the integrity of those markets, maybe you don't want insider trading, right?"&nbsp;</p><p>But Polymarket and Kalshi can’t have both “higher quality signal” and “integrity.” Unlike regular gambling, where bettors wager against the house, prediction markets make their money off transaction fees. So they need a high volume of transactions; they need people betting on everything and anything, the novelty of bets that are basically glorified shitposts to get people into their apps. They need those big, headline-making payouts to attract people to the service with the promise of cashing out, the kinds of wins only an insider trader can achieve. They need the idea that bettors have unique knowledge to make their markets seem valuable to people <em>not </em>placing bets, to get investments and news outlet money and for what happens in their markets to show up on TV–but they <em>also </em>need the whole thing to seem fair. Their quest to paint themselves as legitimate sources of information <em>needs</em> people like Kaptur and other insider traders, as much as the companies might make a show otherwise.</p><p>And the insider traders need this too. Lopatto writes that insider trading&nbsp;</p><blockquote>doesn’t matter much to the purveyors of gambling-addiction-as-a-service; because contracts are peer-to-peer, the house isn’t getting ripped off. It’s only the punters dumb enough to enter the bet without insider information who’ll lose their shirts…&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>For the insiders to make their money, there must be a steady supply of suckers. And there is! Only about a third of traders actually make profits, and “a large number of traders systematically lose money to a small minority of skilled participants.”</blockquote><p>If these markets are going to embrace nihilism, financializing everything to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciapark/2025/12/02/how-kalshis-luana-lopes-lara-cofounder-went-from-professional-ballerina-to-worlds-youngest-self-made-woman-billionaire/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>turn their owners</u></a> into <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciapark/2025/11/29/inside-the-deal-that-made-polymarkets-founder-one-of-the-youngest-billionaires-on-earth/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>billionaires</u></a>, they have no incentive for “deterring and finding the bad actors, manipulators, and those who willingly cheat,” as Kalshi head of enforcement Robert DeNault told NPR. The whole system is manipulators and bad actors–not just insider traders, but the markets themselves, luring people into their apps with the false promise of an easy payday. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hoyoverse-added-clause-to-genshin-impacts-privacy-policy-train-ai-model-on-players-voice-chat/</link>
            <guid>1446391</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>With <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/ai/">Generative AI (GenAI)</a></strong> remaining the most controversial topic in the video game industry, any mention of GenAI or AI in general is making the hair on players' arms stand up. The latest occurrence of this comes from <strong>Genshin Impact</strong> players looking a little more closely at <strong>Hoyoverse's</strong> recent updates to the popular free-to-play game's Privacy Policy, which appears to have indicated that unless players opt-out, Hoyoverse will collect players' <strong>in-game voice chat data</strong> to train an internal AI model.</p>



<p>Initially spotted on a now-removed Reddit post, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cevian.bsky.social/post/3mfnpxo44xc2u">Bluesky user Cevian</a> shared a change to Genshin Impact's privacy policy that was made as recently as <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/company/privacy"><strong>January 14, 2026</strong>.</a> The change specifically referred to a clause from Section 1, subsection XVIII, being removed, which read, "<em>Where applicable, our services may offer voice-based chat functions that allow users to communicate with others in real time using voice. If you choose to use such features, <strong>we may process voice communication data</strong> for the purposes described in Section 2 and Section 13 of this Privacy Policy, including providing communication services, maintaining service security and stability, content moderation, and complying with applicable laws and regulations.</em>"</p>



<p>Now, with the above section removed, Section 2 of the Privacy Policy, titled "<em>Why We Collect and Process Your Personal Data</em>," simply reads:</p>



<p>"<em><strong>Like many AI-powered experiences, we may use your user-generated input such as chat data to train and improve the model that we use to provide our Services. You can opt-out of model training anytime in your Service-related settings. Opting out will not affect your existing gameplay.</strong></em>"</p>



<p>It's worth noting that the now-removed subsection XVIII statement is referring to Hoyoverse using the data it collects for things like improving its customer support and its moderation efforts. Essentially, there's no indication that Hoyoverse is using this data to train an internal GenAI model, which appears to be part of the concern players had when this policy was first spotted.</p>



<p>We've reached out to Hoyoverse for a comment on the situation, and despite the fact that it doesn't appear to be the case that Hoyoverse would be using this data for anything unsavory, the concern players have seems to mostly come from a feature like this being on by default, with users having to manually opt out.</p>



<p>That's what caused players to have issues with <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-training-gaming-copilot-ai-watching-you-play-games-unless-you-turn-it-off/"><strong>Microsoft's</strong> <strong>Copilot Gaming AI</strong></a>, which added an 'on-by-default' feature that initially appeared to be recording your gameplay to train Copilot. That wasn't <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-comments-gaming-copilot-ai-controversy/">exactly the case</a>, but the fact that it was on automatically, without players being sufficiently asked about it in the first place, is what caused the uproar around it. And it's worth betting that people would care more about their voices being recorded without their knowledge or proper consent, over some of their gameplay footage.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll have some word from Hoyoverse soon to properly explain the situation.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/electronic-arts/" id="52204">Electronic Arts </a>has unfortunately announced layoffs for the makers of Skate.</p>



<p>On February 25, 2026, <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle/news/an-update-from-fullcircle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Electronic Arts issued a statement </a>announcing that it is reshaping the studio behind Skate, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/full-circle/" id="96165">Full Circle</a>. In their statement, they announced that they are changing the team structure and “some roles will be impacted.” The company’s statement does not specify how widespread the restructuring will be or how many roles will be affected.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/skate/" id="352">Skate </a>launched in Early Access in September 2025.</p>



<p>The Full Circle statement, however, states that the decision is not a reflection on those affected and that they will support them through their transition.</p>



<p>“Our work on skate. continues. We look forward to working with you as we move faster, listen more closely, and deliver consistently for all of you. Our commitment to skate., and to the millions of players who believe in it, remains strong.”</p>



<h2 id="h-layoffs-and-restructurings-are-a-common-theme-in-2026-s-video-game-industry">Layoffs and Restructurings Are a Common Theme in 2026’s Video Game Industry</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, several studios have been making similar statements about layoffs and major restructurings lately. Riot Games recently severely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-downsizing-2xko-team-focus-shifts-to-core-improvements/" id="175347">downsized to restructure the team around 2XKO</a>. Highguard’s development team was also<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Why-Highguard-Failed-Highguard-Layoffs-Explained-guide.jpg" id="176090"> heavily restructured</a> less than a month after the game’s release.</p>



<p>Ubisoft continues to make major changes and is restructuring its teams moving forward. Several game projects were canceled, including the much-anticipated remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Learn more about those canceled projects <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/six-games-ubisoft-canceled/" id="176792">here</a>.</p>







<p>Microsoft Gaming and Xbox are also in the midst of a massive restructuring, following Phil Spencer’s retirement and Sarah Bond’s resignation. However, while there have been major changes to the Xbox executive team, no major in-house studio shakeups are planned.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Wrestler provided motion capture for the latest DLC.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">On March 17, Street Fighter 6 is getting a new DLC character: the pro wrestling-inspired Alex, and All Elite Wrestling's own Kenny Omega is the man behind the motion capture. At IGN Fan Fest 2026, he explained how the opportunity to do the motion capture actually came out of a simple misunderstanding. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When the news broke and they told me, we signed the NDAs and we know who the characters are and Alex will, in fact, be one of them. And they said, 'For you being such a good sport, it'd be cool if we put a move of yours in,' maybe one or two or a taunt or something," Omega told IGN. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I had said, 'Wow, that would be great. I just don't know when I could fit that into my schedule to do the mocap for it.' And they'd said, 'Oh, wait, you do the mocap for it?' I said, 'Yeah, is that what you were talking about, or no?' They said, 'Oh my, if you would do the mocap for it, that would be awesome.' And so a misunderstanding on my part is what led to me actually going to the studio and doing a slew of mocap for the character. If there was ever a better time to be stupid, that was one of them, because it worked out in my favor completely to not understand what they were talking about at that moment. So because of that one discussion, I got invited back to the next year's Tokyo Game Show. And then before doing the game show, I stopped over at Osaka, where they do the mocap for Capcom. And we hammered it out in one day. It was a grueling 10- or 11-hour shoot. I remember losing like 8 or 9 pounds of water weight, but it was so worth it and so fun." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also revealed that the developers were open to suggestions – he can see how his ideas were incorporated into the final game animations – and that wrestling without an audience wasn't as alien of an experience as people might expect. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think because of COVID, I got used to wrestling and performing in front of no one. It reminded me of being back into an empty arena and just having cameras all around me, but there's no sound. There's no adulation. There's no people. I see staff here and there, but it brought back memories of the COVID era, for sure."   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alex first appeared in 1997 Street Fighter III: New Generation in arcades. Early concept art shows the professional wrestler character was initially positioned as the new face of the franchise. In Street Fighter 6, his super moves include Raging Spear, Sledgecross Hammer, and The Final Prison. He also has an alternate level 2 super called the Omega Wing Buster, which is a sequence of moves inspired by Kenny Omega's own trio of signature moves, including the V-Trigger, Snap Dragon Suplex, and of course, the One Winged Angel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is just the latest news from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-fan-fest-2026-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect"><u>IGN's Fan Fest 2026</u></a> – check the schedule to see what else is coming and to keep up to date on all the latest from the worlds of games and entertainment.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Head of Editorial Development at IGN and an elder millennial.
