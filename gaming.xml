Being an NPC in a Hidetaka Miyazaki game, Igon doesn’t have a lot of lines, which Lintern was well aware of going in. Initially, Lintern assumed he could wrap up his line reads in about 40 minutes. The entire thing ended up stretching to about five to six hours instead. Lintern thoroughly enjoyed the experience though, saying, “It felt creative, and it felt engaged. And I didn’t quite know what I was doing, but I knew that I’d had fun doing it.”</p><p>Funnily enough, Lintern frames the VO session quite a bit like a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346">boss fight</a></span> you’d encounter in a FromSoft game. According to him, he walked into the studio to find more than a dozen people kind of gathered around <em>Elden Ring</em>’s director Hidetaka Miyazaki, who Lintern likens to a “god of the gaming world.”</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“I didn’t know the game, and I didn’t know the status of the game, and I didn’t know [Miyazaki’s] status. But when I walked into the room, his status was very clear, very clear immediately. Everyone was very friendly, but at the same time, I could see that this was a bigger deal than I’d imagined it was going to be.”</p></blockquote><p>He describes Miyazaki as “the mysterious figure in the center of the room…very much in control of the operation.” After reading a line, it’d go through several channels back to Miyazaki who would then deliver notes. “We were doing lines hundreds of times, literally hundreds, because if I was there for five hours, the actual total amount of lines that I spoke, I could’ve done in seven minutes,” Lintern shared. I can see him walking back through those theoretical fog gates time and time again. Throughout, Lintern says that the most consistent note he got was simply to amp things up. “Do you have more? Can you explode?”</p><p>And goddamn, did that man explode. Lintern—who in in his own words had to go from “naught to 5000” for his portrayal of Igon—claims he was “giving it as much as I possibly can, vocally, emotionally, neck stretching, vocal cords ripping, everything,” before taking a water break and running it back. Lintern’s director must’ve told him to take five, but I think he heard “change lives” instead and delivered the performance of a lifetime.</p><p>Lintern claims that he was spent in more ways than one by the end of session, and if that doesn’t sound like the feeling of triumphing over a FromSoft boss, I don’t know what does. I’ve been visibly shaken by the end of the most arduous encounters, including one that took me the entirety of a Saturday afternoon and evening during my first run of <em>Bloodborne</em>. I’ve held my breath only to let out the deepest of exhales upon doing that last tick of damage. I haven’t cried, but I have screeched at the top of my lungs upon having tasted the ichor of victory.</p><p>Elsewhere, Lintern talks about how his time with <em>Elden Ring </em>has opened him up to further possibilities in voice acting, which is great considering the fanbase his first stab at it has garnered. Despite how little he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-s-story-explained-1851566799&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-s-story-explained-1851566799">knew about the game</a></span>, and the air of mystery that hung around Miyazaki the whole time, Lintern still managed to pull it out. Now, Igon is already among one of the most beloved characters in one of the most esteemed catalog of games. How’s that for a first day at a new job?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The new platforming brawler will be available on PC via Steam, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5. </p>



<p>Fans can pre-order the game now, with pricing at $39.99, and today’s trailer also teases physical copies. GameStop will notably have a <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-unleashed-defenders-edition-bundle---switch/B406253A.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collector’s Edition</a> going for $199.99, which includes a variety of collectibles.</p>

<p>TMNT: Mutants Unleashed is set in the same universe as the animated Mutant Mayhem film. Players must contend with the TCRI corporation with the help of April and Splinter. </p>



<p>Today’s new trailer adds that the beloved turtles will also “battle an all-new wave of havoc-wreaking mutants.” Naturally, missions will be set “across the streets of NYC.” </p>



<p>Mutants Unleashed will support both solo and local co-op gameplay. The devs also tease that “it’s filled with action, humour, and nostalgia.”</p>



<p>Outright Games recently announced Transformers: Galactic Trials. It combines both racing and shooting mechanics, and it’s also coming in mid-October 2024.</p>



<p>Besides Mutants Unleashed, fans of the ninja turtles can also look forward to TMNT: Splintered Fate. The latter launches on July 17, 2024, and the devs just announced this week that it will similarly support couch co-op.</p>



<p>There’s also anticipation for a darker take on the turtles, with an action RPG <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">based on The Last Ronin</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Nintendo unveiled a chilling cinematic trailer for their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-reveals-trailer-for-m-rated-game-teases-creepy-emio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming horror game,</a> Emio, sparking widespread curiosity about the title. While details surrounding the game’s storyline remain shrouded in mystery, fresh information has emerged, offering a glimpse into the game’s nature, courtesy of Emio’s rating in Australia.</p>



<p>Emio has received an M rating from ESRB in America, a standard rating for games with mature content, such as strong language, intense violence, and sexual themes. This aligns with the horror nature of Emio but doesn’t provide any specific information. </p>



<p>On the other hand, Australian ratings are more detailed, informing players why such a rating has been provided. Emio has received an MA 15+ rating in Australia due to “Strong themes, violence and suicide references”. Moreover, it has been restricted for players younger than the age of 13 due to “violence, cruelty, domestic abuse &amp; suicide themes”.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Emio" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h5uSd32MdOI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The trailer for Emio is a surprising departure from Nintendo’s usual family-friendly content. The inclusion of violence, suicide, and other mature themes has sparked players’ curiosity about what Nintendo is planning. Also, The fact that Emio has already been rated in Australia has led to exciting speculation that a 2024 release might be on the cards, and the Halloween season seems like the perfect window.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Studio Mechka has announced that its metroidvania game inspired by 90’s cartoons and Slavic folklore, Marko: Beyond Brave, is set to launch on Steam on September 17th. There is a demo available at the moment to check <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1186470/Marko_Beyond_Brave/">Marko: Beyond Brave</a> out, and you can see some gameplay in the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mg2Fck_etTU?si=4Vyqq9Ls-ghEWRGR" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>


<p>In Marko: Beyond Brave, entropy has broken free from its prison, and threatens to consume the world. Armed with his greatsword and moustache, Marko has to confront evil forces, duel against legendary beasts, and form alliances to reestablish balance in Zagora. Marko has abilities that let him control elemental powers to aid him in his quest, where every decision has an impact on Zagora. Zagora is made up of multiple locations including forests and dilapidated castles. Enemies and bosses have been designed by drawing inspiration from Slavic folklore figures like Vila, Koz’el, Urgl, Vlashko, and the Tree of Life.</p>
<p>Marko: Beyond Brave has a non-linear map featuring hundreds of individual rooms, containing concealed treasures, relics, and decaying edifices that shed light on the past. There is crafting and enhancements within the game allowing players to construct the weapons and tools to help in the fight for victory.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/double-dragon-revive-continues-a-classic-franchises-rebirth-next-year.924657/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/double-dragon-revive-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arc System Works and Yuke's have announced&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon Revive</em>, a new entry in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon&nbsp;</em>series of beat-'em-up games.</p>
<p>Due to land sometime in 2025,&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon Revive&nbsp;</em>transposes the classic action gameplay of the series into 3D, giving the iconic Lee brothers a modern makeover as they take on "powerful foes from their past".</p>
<p>Although the game is in 3D, it looks like the gameplay will still take place mostly along a 2D plane, although you will be able to knock enemies into the background or use area-of-effect attacks to take down enemies from different angles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/double-dragon-revive-announcement-gameplay.jpg?itok=QljJYo75 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/double-dragon-revive-announcement-gameplay.jpg?itok=SzRWhM4g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Double Dragon Revive&nbsp;</em>will adapt the series' classic gameplay with modern visuals.</figcaption></figure><p>Developer Yuke's and publisher Arc System Works are promising "the same simple and intuitive gameplay" you love about classic&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon</em>, but "with controls and balance refined for the modern era".</p>
<p><em>Revive&nbsp;</em>will offer a "carefully crafted experience" supervised by Arc System Works staff, with the publisher pointing to its extensive experience in the fighting genre as proof it can be trusted with the franchise.</p>
<p>According to the two studios,&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon Revive&nbsp;</em>won't just let you get away with button-mashing; instead, you'll have to carefully observe your enemies to spot patterns and pick out your timings.</p>
<p>Don't worry, though.&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon&nbsp;</em>isn't about to turn into a Soulslike; it's still the same side-scrolling beat-'em-up you know and love, by the looks of things, but with a few modern twists to keep things interesting.</p>

<p>This is the second&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon&nbsp;</em>game to be announced in as many years, after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/double-dragon-gaiden-announcement">last year's pixel art roguelite</a>&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons</em>.</p>
<p>Unlike its cousin, however,&nbsp;<em>Revive&nbsp;</em>is going for a more modern 3D style rather than the nostalgic retro look. It remains to be seen whether Arc System Works and Yuke's can pull it off, but I'm rooting for them.</p>
<p><em>Double Dragon Revive&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3012220/Double_Dragon_Revive/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010965" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and Xbox in 2025.

			<p>Turkish developer Motion Blur has announced Black State - an Unreal Engine 5-powered upcoming third-person action adventure that appears to have been inspired by Metal Gear Solid.</p>
<p>The new PC title packing strong Metal Gear Solid and Portal vibes was announced by the studio yesterday through an official reveal trailer (courtesy of IGN). We've included the announcement video below alongside some key features of the game. We've also included some impressive-looking screenshots. It has to be said, this pre-alpha footage does look pretty impressive, although it's clear that performance needs to be improved. According to the developer, this new trailer opens the door to a photo-realistic single-player third-person shooter. "This trailer is just the tip of the iceberg", Motion Blur's CEO Kadir Demirden said. "We can't wait for players to dive in and experience the full depth and intensity of the game."</p>
<p>In Black State, the player is summoned for a secret mission by a group of scientists known as the Architects. The task at hand? Save captives and uncover the truth behind a cataclysmic event, with each door leading to new and unexpected locations.</p>

			<p>This Thursday, NVIDIA announced the addition of three games to the GeForce NOW cloud library.

<p>Granted, Once Human isn't exactly a taxing game, having been designed to also run on mobile devices. Its system requirements, as you can read below, are quite low for mid-2024.</p>

<p>However, GeForce NOW is also supported on mobile devices and even directly on TVs, which certainly provides a greater level of accessibility for those interested in playing Once Human.</p>
<p>This week, GeForce NOW users can also play Cricket 24 via the Xbox app/ PC Game Pass. The latest edition of the cricket game was released by Australian developer Big Ant Studios in late 2023, featuring more than 200 real players recreated with photogrammetry, over 50 officially licensed stadiums, tournaments like The Ashes, the KFC BBL and Weber WBBL, The Hundred, the Caribbean Premier League, and the Pakistan Super League.</p>
<p>Lastly, the action first-person shooter game Anger Foot launches today <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1978590/Anger_Foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> and will be playable via GeForce NOW. Anger Foot was made by Free Lives and published by Devolver Digital. Here's what you can expect:</p>
<p><em>Crash through the caffeine-fueled fever dream of Shit City, putting the boot to a menacing menagerie of merciless gangsters.</em></p>
<p><em>Unleash the world's deadliest feet on a colorful cast of anthropomorphic enemies. Clearing out slums, sewers, and skyscrapers as you grab new weapons, unlock new sneakers, and upgrade your powers in absurd and wonderful ways. Kick and shoot your way to the exit as you leave behind a smoldering trail of shattered doors, broken bones, and crumpled energy drinks.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-review-changeling-mischief<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</em> was a phenomenon upon its initial release. Great character writing and imaginative situations helped elevate the animated show's themes of friendship and community. There's a reason why it is the most beloved incarnation of Hasbro's equestrian-themed toy line. <em>My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria</em> expresses that imagination in an official TTRPG module. One that features magic, friendship, and the shapeshifting antics of Queen Chrysalis and her changeling hive.</p>

<p><em>My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria</em> is a 166-page <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/opinions/how-to-use-essence20-to-make-perfect-transformers-crossover" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Essence20</a> adventure module for the <em>My Little Pony Roleplaying Game</em>. It features six interconnected adventures where players stop the schemes of Queen Chrysalis from laying waste to Equestria. It is also a mini-supplement, providing players new Perks, Spells, and rules for playing as Changelings.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-changeline-artwork.jpg?itok=hPBc3Jq7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-changeline-artwork.jpg?itok=2KPjGZTk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They're adorable little shapechangers.</figcaption></figure><h2>How are the new player options in <em>My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria</em>?</h2>
<p>The new player options in <em>My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria</em> mostly focus on Changelings. Since the prewritten adventure is Changeling-themed, adding them as a player option makes some sense. The book even provides options and story seeds for how Changeling characters can be introduced in the adventure. It cites characters like Thorax and events like the metamorphosed colony for players that want to play good Changelings and recommends different Roles like Loyalty and Generosity.</p>
<p>The new Changeling options are handled well. Players can choose between being a Colony Changeling, part of the collective that Queen Chrysalis commands, or a Metamorphosed Changeling transformed by the magic of friendship.</p>
<p>In game terms, the Changeling Origin is powerful. Changelings can shape-shift at will into other creatures, have a flying speed, and even have some magic skills. Effectively, if their disguise is good enough they can pass for anything they turn into.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-shapeshifting-rules.jpg?itok=Z8EsX7iu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-shapeshifting-rules.jpg?itok=kB7IEUXX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The design team thought this stuff through.</figcaption></figure><p>Thankfully, there are several controls. First, shape-shifting is imperfect and limited without the use of certain Perks. You can't change into an inanimate object or change your size. Changing into a creature doesn't give you any inherent benefits like a wolf's sense of smell or a unicorn's magic. You can't perfectly imitate a specific character, meaning infiltration potential is limited. Changelings only have one health, making them glass cannons if discovered. Lastly, depending on your Origin, you need to take certain Influences and Hang-Ups, which can make it harder for you to maintain your cover.</p>
<p>The book does provide advancement options for those who want to become perfect chameleons. Some Perks remove various shapeshifting restrictions. Personal favorites are Size Shift and Object Shift; Prop Hunt energy in Changeling form. The potential to be a master shapechanger is there, you have to work for it.</p>
<p>As someone who generally bans shapechanging options in my games, I have to applaud the designers of <em>My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria</em>. It lets Game Masters maintain intrigue and pacing at the start of an adventure while allowing players to become masters of disguise in the late game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-widget-artwork.jpg?itok=OIRkmV-C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-widget-artwork.jpg?itok=chFYeBCg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Great Scott! A brilliant pony inventor!</figcaption></figure><h2>How Fun Are The Adventures in <em>My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria</em>?</h2>
<p>The six adventures in <em>My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria</em> maintain a great balance of mystery and comedy. The first adventure, <em>Lost In Shadow</em>, is a straightforward mystery story. Ponyville locals are accusing one another of stealing or causing mischief and the players need to solve it.</p>
<p>It's a solid introduction. Every major character has answers to major questions players may ask. The twists and turns are well-telegraphed, which indicates confident storytelling. Lastly, the adventure can end diplomatically, leading to different outcomes.</p>
<p>The second adventure, <em>Day Becomes Night</em>, is one of the weaker entries. For some reason, the sun isn't rising in Equestria. A local eccentric inventor pony, Widget, has a gizmo that may help, but repairing will take some work.</p>
<p>By itself, the adventure isn't bad. There's some novelty in helping Ponyville's locals deal with the lack of light. Widget's character design is inspired by <em>Back To The Future's</em> Doc Brown, which is delightful. The adventure is packed with alternative options for fixing Widget's machine, allowing any potential party composition to get to the end.</p>
<p>My issue is that the connections to Queen Chrysalis' plans aren't established until the end of the adventure. The result is a scenario where the enemy feels more like an evil lamp than a persistent antagonistic force.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-pony-noir-artwork.jpg?itok=qhKFCJZX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-pony-noir-artwork.jpg?itok=fgrBUQeE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Alright, smarty pants, where are you keeping the stolen color!?</figcaption></figure><p>The third adventure, <em>Equestria Noir</em>, is a personal highlight. It follows up from the last adventure. The party wakes up the next day to discover that all color has been drained out of Equestria. On top of that, everyone has begun dressing and talking like hardboiled detectives.</p>
<p>As a kid-friendly genre exercise, it is perfect. The wordplay is excellent. The adventure is packed with references to noir staples like <em>The Maltese Falcon</em> and <em>The Third Man</em>. Players are encouraged to lean into character with internal monologues, trenchcoats, and fedoras. Even the adventure as a whole is framed as a whodunnit mystery with witnesses, clues, and red herrings. It is my favorite part of this book, hands-down.</p>
<p><em>In The Land of Shadow</em> is the most action-packed, conventional adventure in <em>My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria</em>. Players reactivate a mysterious portal, enter a land ruled by Queen Chrysalis, and disrupt her plan to siphon energy from Equestria. It's a great <em>MLP</em>-themed take on a fantasy adventure module. Puzzles, traps, navigating maps, creative solutions to big problems. There's even a wrinkle of complexity with the introduction of Lost Land Ponies: ponies that are loyal to Queen Chrysalis' rule.</p>
<p>The weakest adventure of the bunch in my opinion is <em>The Balance of Harmony</em>. In isolation, it's fine. The Mane Six get sick, and the players need to go on an adventure to cure them. There's a great mix of unique characters and difficult challenges, a personal highlight involves a married couple and a magic apple. There is even a tricky moral decision near the end.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-bedridden-applejack.jpg?itok=iRmSJEIf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-bedridden-applejack.jpg?itok=awKEolgb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Well this took a turn.</figcaption></figure><p>My problems with the adventure mostly come down to design ethos. I like keeping my players as the main characters in an adventure. If it is a game set in an established setting, I change it so the original main characters don't exist or are in a supporting role. This adventure centers on the well-being of The Mane Six and assumes they still wield the Elements of Harmony. It effectively turns the PCs' adventure into a filler sidestory.</p>
<p>This is a “me” problem, but it does make adapting this adventure tricky. There is a certain thrill in having your characters interact with these main characters,&nbsp; a big draw of licensed TTRPGs, and this adventure delivers that fantasy. But the way this adventure is framed, I think it takes from the players' ability to make their own mark in the world.</p>
<p>The finale, aptly named <em>The Dark Queen</em> is a bombastic conclusion. Queen Chrysalis unleashes her changeling army, infiltrating and invading Equestria. Her sights settle on Ponyville, Princess Celestia, and Canterlot.</p>
<p>Running this adventure is a thrill. The book provides different approaches to Chrysalis' invasion alongside <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/among-us" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Among Us</em></a> hijinx with Changeling dopplegangers, There's even an exciting setpiece on a runaway train.</p>
<p>It feels like a <em>Friendship is Magic</em> season finale in RPG form, packed with returning characters, arcs coming to a close, and a big bad getting their comeuppance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-queen-chrysalis-artwork.jpg?itok=yJvI7NeA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-queen-chrysalis-artwork.jpg?itok=1F490HNi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>How will your group stop her?</figcaption></figure><h2>Should You Pick Up <em>My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria</em>?</h2>
<p>Overall, <em>My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria</em> is an entertaining, imaginative, and engaging <em>My Little Pony</em> mystery adventure. The puzzles are clever, the characters are entertaining, and the new Changeling player options are impressively designed. There are some low points, but they are overshadowed by solid quality and exciting setpieces. If you want to continue your adventures through Ponyville with a Changeling twist, this book will do just that.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria is a breezy, entertaining slice of the My Little Pony world in TTRPG form. Aside from some narrative hiccups, the prewritten adventure and Changeling options are wonderful additions to a table. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

<p>As first spotted <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/uk-high-street-video-game-retailer-game-set-to-end-in-store-pre-orders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by TechRadar</a>, an internal staff memo at UK retailer GAME reportedly revealed the company will end in-store pre-orders soon.</p>



<p>The report adds that the staff memo mentions this move is due to “part of the continued integration into Frasers Group.” The changes will go into effect on August 1, 2024. </p>



<p>This information was also corroborated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-to-end-in-store-pre-orders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by EuroGamer</a>, which reported direct contact with GAME staff. A staff member further stated that “going forward the tills will only be able to sell and return products.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Late last June, GAME only just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-uk-stop-selling-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied reports</a> that it will stop selling games and hardware. At that time, representatives stated that GAME would “continue to support the physical gaming market.”</p>



<p>The new memo does clarify that GAME customers can still order online for home delivery, “or purchase in store once released.” </p>



<p>Also, existing deposits and pre-orders for releases through January 31, 2025, will still be honored. For anything with a release date after that time, GAME is offering a pre-order refund for deposits.</p>



<p>This would mark another step in GAME winding down, after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-reward-ending-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ending its GAME Reward</a> card scheme in early June 2024.  TechRadar’s new report adds that further instructions for staff about in-store marketing displays are coming.</p>



<p>GAME has not issued an official statement regarding the memo at this time.</p>

        <p>It’s up to Aero the Acro-Bat, the circus’s star performer, to rescue his friends and girlfriend Ariel, and put a stop to Edgar Ektor’s mad plans so everyone can enjoy the show again!</p><p>The powerful and eccentric industrialist Edgar Ektor has sworn to destroy the world of amusement as revenge for being banished from the circus when he was a kid after one of his pranks went too far and almost killed a circus animal. He started by invading a local circus with his gang of mad clowns and kidnapping all the circus staff to spoil the show.</p><p><strong>A Challenge to Become the Best</strong></p><p><em>Aero the Acro-Bat</em> is NOT your typical platformer in which you just go from start to goal. The players will need to use Aero’s skills in specific ways in order to accomplish the objectives in each stage, and this sets the game aside from many platformers that came before or after. <em>Aero</em> also comes from an era in which games were famous for being challenging, and the Aero series in particular has always been known for its challenging difficulty. Those who can clear these games can really consider themselves platforming masters! But fear not, if it’s too much for you, this new version includes cheats to make things a bit easier!</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_898429"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Play to Win</strong></p><p><em>Aero</em>‘s display presents a health bar and each stage starts with a number of hit points which can be added to by collecting items.

Hazards, such as spikes and lava, cost Aero a life regardless of his health metre. Aero can gain more health and more lives by finding items in the stages and also gains an extra life for every 20,000 points earned.

<p>A new platform has been added to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/play-doom-robot-lawnmower-husqvarna/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">list of things</a> that can run Doom, which is not as surprising as the others. A developer has posted the original Doom running on Unreal Editor for Fortnite, and you can check out the clip below.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Original Doom running on Fortnite is a unique and intriguing feat. The most fascinating aspect is the addition of build mechanics to the player character, offering a fresh perspective on the game. The ability to ‘crank 90s’ in Doom is a feature that was never imagined. The creator, Jackson Clayton, shared that while he can’t officially publish this, the process of getting Doom to run on Fortnite was a valuable learning experience about Material and Post Processing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through an interview with <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-running-inside-fortnite-uefn-how-epic-twitter-fps-1851585177?utm_campaign=Kotaku&amp;utm_content=1720637674&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, Clayton detailed how he got Doom running on Fortnite. He stated that the first thing he did was export the E1M1 files as a 3D model from Ultimate Doom Builder and ported that into Fortnite’s UEFN. Then Clayton removed “Unreal’s fancy effects” to make the game feel like it was running in Fortnite. Additionally, Clayton used Unreal’s material system to provide a choppy spinning effect for the Doom Marine and the Post Process material to add pixelation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clayton’s journey of getting Doom to run on Fortnite was not without its challenges. He found the UEFN to be advanced, requiring him to ‘get creative’ with the process. His experience in creating other Doom-like games in the past was a significant advantage, making this process easier.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In other news, Doom: The Dark Ages was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-trailer/">officially revealed during this year’s Xbox Showcase</a>; check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-doom-the-dark-ages-releasing-on-ps5-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whether the game will be playable on the PlayStation 5</a>. What did you think about Doom running on Fortnite? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

R. Martin. Now, a new high-end book called Grace Given: The Mythology of Elden Ring brings all of the mythology of the Lands Between into a beautifully-crafted tome. But it's also extremely expensive.</p><p>Irish publisher Tune &amp; Fairweather is releasing Grace Given, which was written by Geoff "SmoughTown" Truscott. The book is over 500 pages long, and it is "encased in a lavish, gold-foiled, full-color hardback." YouTube personality Quelaag wrote the introduction, and the book will feature 25 bespoke chapter-header illustrations by Chris Lewis Lew. Shimhaq is contributing over 15 full-color Elden Ring illustrations, while the artist known as MenasLG is providing over 100 spot illustrations. To cap things off, artist Elliot Wells has created five full-page gold illuminated numeral illustrations.</p><p>The Collector's Edition will be $277 or €250. But the Limited Edition will jump to $775 or €700. That version includes gold page-edge gilding on all three edges, and a signed and numbered art print by Shimhaq. It also comes with free shipping.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4331437-eldenringbook1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4331437" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4331437-eldenringbook1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4331437"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4331437-eldenringbook1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4331490-eldenringbook2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4331491-eldenringbook3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4331492-eldenringbook4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4331490,1300-4331491,1300-4331492" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4331490-eldenringbook2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4331491-eldenringbook3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4331492-eldenringbook4.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4331490-eldenringbook2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4331491-eldenringbook3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4331492-eldenringbook4.jpg"></figure><p>For anyone with money to burn, there's also the Benefactor Edition, which has a price tag of $1,107 or €1,000. That includes everything from the Limited Edition, but adds a custom name credit that will be included at the back of the book and in any future editions of Grace Given.</p><p>Although Grace Given is not officially endorsed by From Software, Tune &amp; Fairweather has previously published books about Bloodborne, Dark Souls, and Demon's Souls. Grace Given: The Mythology of Elden Ring is expected to be released in the first quarter of 2025. Preorders are open now <a href="https://www.tuneandfairweather.com/collections/grace-given-the-mythology-of-elden-ring" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">at Tune &amp; Fairweather's official site</a>.

		<p>It’s Amazon’s annual Prime Day promotion in just a few days, the time where we all all buy loads of junk we really did not need. Talking of loads of junk, Prime Gaming are joining in the fun and are giving away Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League! Arf!</p>
<p>The game, along with Chivalry 2 and Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration, will be free on PC to Prime Gaming members from July 16th at 12am PT / 3am ET. You will have just 48 hours to claim the titles but then they are yours to keep forever.</p>


<p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was the highly anticipated game from Batman Arkham creators Rocksteady but unfortunately it was, well, not very good.</p>
<p>“Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a perfect example of how live services can sap all the energy out of a game experience,”<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/"> wrote Gareth in our 6/10 review.</a> “The story, the character and gameplay all range from good to fantastic, but the missions grow stale before too long, the loot system’s few bright spots are tarnished by the chore of everything else you earn, and the story and characters all but evaporate once you reach the endgame.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League | Official Gameplay Launch Trailer - “Do the Impossible”" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YmWFiQj70gM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Jim took a look at Chivalry 2<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/15/chivalry-2-review-ps4-xbox-pc/"> and gave it a solid 8/10. </a>“The melee combat may not be as technical or strategic as some hardcore fans might like, yet it’s hard to deny the appeal of Chivalry 2’s dismembering deathmatches,” he said. “Those first few sieges are truly enthralling as watch waves of red and blue troops smash against each other. Over time it may lose its edge though Chivalry 2 is still one of the most fun and unique multiplayer games out there.”</p>

<p>Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration is the daddy here having been released way back in 2016, but we also gave that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/11/09/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review/">8/10 in our review</a>. “Rise of the Tomb Raider is an action-packed tour-de-force that, while derivative at times, is a fantastic romp from beginning to end. This sequel learns some of the lessons of its predecessor by making the game more like a recognisable Tomb Raider game, while at the same time implementing some new features and impressive visual design. While not quite the globetrotting adventure some were hoping for, Rise of the Tomb Raider is well worth playing.”</p>

            <p>
An unofficial Elden Ring lore book is on the way courtesy of a YouTuber expert.
</p>
<p>
Grace Given: The Mythology of Elden Ring will be a 500+ page book from Geoff "SmoughTown" Truscott, and will include beautiful artwork from fans of the game.
</p>
<p>
While not an official product - the description notes it's not endorsed by FromSoftware or Bandai Namco - it's certainly a lavishly created book. But, at £215.00, you'd expect it to be.

<p>
That price is for the basic Collector's Edition, with gold page-edge gilding and white leather binding ensuring a premium feel. Additionally there's a Limited Edition version at £602.00, which includes a collectible art print, and an £860.00 Benefactor Edition to have your name credited in the back of the book.
</p>
<p>
It's certainly pricey, then. As for the content, it will include details on gods and nations, history and ideology, and more alongside the artwork.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SmoughTown/videos">SmoughTown</a> has over 230k subscribers on YouTube and has produced plenty of lore videos across a whole range of games, with a particular focus on Elden Ring and Dark Souls.
</p>
<p>
Yet considering much of Elden Ring's lore is somewhat up for interpretation - unless, of course, George R. R. Martin unearths whatever manuscripts he wrote for the game - this unofficial book is likely only for diehard fans, especially at that price.

Still, there are plenty of adaptations of the game being created. Earlier this year an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/official-elden-ring-webcomic-out-next-month">official manga webcomic was released</a>, which follows a particular Tarnished on their journey to become Elden Lord.

</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fan-made-elden-ring-anime-adaptation-receives-teaser-trailer">fan-made anime adaptation received a first teaser trailer</a> ahead of a release in the autumn.

</p>
<p>
And could we see an official TV or film adaptation in future? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-writer-george-rr-martin-tells-us-nothing-and-everything-about-a-live-action-spin-off">George R. R. Martin certainly seemed to hint it could happen</a>.

Martin has revealed a set of new covers for A Game of Thrones and the entire A Song of Ice and Fire book series.</p><p>Revealed on his <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2024/07/10/a-bold-new-look-for-the-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-boxed-set/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a>, the stunning new covers "capture the vastness of Westeros and the dangerous journey readers will encounter." The five books are available in a boxed set and will be available online and in stores in October 2024, though no price was revealed.</p><p>"There is a raw and gritty quality to linocut and woodcut art," the post continued. "A certain starkness that seemed to fit the stories, and a long history to the art form that felt right for this world.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>A Song of Ice and Fire 2024 Box Set</h3></div></output><p>"This cover design process paired linocut artist Mark Seekins and designer Tim Green, with art direction from David G. Stevenson. They worked together to develop sketches and carve the designs into blocks of linoleum, where the raised areas were inked and pressed onto paper. The covers feature several colors, which required separate blocks for each color layer. The finished prints were then photographed and incorporated into the covers."</p><p>This boxset doesn't include the entire A Song of Ice and Fire story, of course, as Martin famously, perhaps infamously, has yet to finish the final two books.</p><p>The next entry, The Winds of Winter, is so far 10 years late and seemingly making slow progress. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/george-rr-martin-has-written-1100-pages-of-the-winds-of-winter-the-same-number-as-last-year">Martin said in November 2023 that he'd written 1,100 pages of the highly anticipated book</a>, the same number he'd written a year earlier.</p><p>No writer is blessed with producing a perfect first draft, of course, and Martin's "writing" of The Winds of Winter will also encompass re-reading, re-writing, editing, planning, and so on, so there's still plenty of work to be done without actually increasing the page number total.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/george-rr-martin-says-the-winds-of-winter-is-about-three-quarters-of-the-way-done">Martin said in October 2022 the book was around three quarters of the way done</a>, noting he's completely finished some characters' stories but still has others to weave throughout them. The overall progress of The Winds of Winter has become somewhat of an ongoing gag within the fiction community though, with even <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/george-rr-martin-winds-of-winter-late-fans-vicious">Martin himself getting in on the joke</a>.</p><p>An estimated release window for The Winds of Winter was first given in 2011 when the previous book, A Dance With Dragons, was released, and Martin said it would take three years to finish at a good pace. That set expectations for a 2014 release date, but year after year, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/george-r-r-martin-rejuvenated-after-support-following-book-delay">delay</a> after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/winds-of-winter-update-george-rr-martin-says-hes-healthy-isolated-and-getting-plenty-of-writing-done">delay</a>, Martin still isn't ready to release the penultimate A Song of Ice and Fire entry.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

New indie action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-best-jrpgs-on-pc-in-2024">JRPG</a> Tako No Himitsu: Ocean of Secrets  - customary disclaimer: "JRPG" is a contentious term which some feel fetishises Japan culture, while others define it more neutrally as a specific style of role-playing game - is set in a world shadowed by a long-ago war between Human and Octopus. This in itself would be borderline post-worthy, but it's also heavily inspired by Game Boy Advance <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>s such as Golden Sun, and features music created by Golden Sun composer Motoi Sakuraba alongside Terranigma composer Masanori Hikichi.

I wouldn't want it to get around these parts that I used to play handheld console games, in case my official RPS explosive collar detonates, but I <em>loved</em> Golden Sun. It's a beautiful lightshow, with its plush 2D sprites and spinning, zooming battle camera, and an entertaining though rarely challenging fantasy adventure. The first customer service call I ever made to Gamestation as a wee nipper was to ask if they had Golden Sun in stock, the second after reading about the game in a magazine. "We don't have a release date yet," the cruel voice on the other end of the line informed me, smashing my hopes and dreams. Tako No Himitsu doesn't have a release date yet either, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2357380/Tako_no_Himitsu_Ocean_of_Secrets/?curator_clanid=40737195">it does have a demo on Steam</a>, and I'll be giving that a go over lunch, because the trailer looks tremendous.

<p>
Some plot from that Steam page: "Wild animals are disappearing, the mysterious Temple of the Order is on the rise, and shadow voids are suddenly populating the land. Gather six heroes and their Octopus companions and work together to save a world consumed by the secrets of its past." This sounds a touch more involved than Golden Sun. It also has top-down real-time combat that puts me in mind of Alundra or Zelda, rather than Golden Sun's turn-based spell-o-swording. You can switch characters on the fly, and enlist the skills of various magic octopi - "the heroes of the past" - to lacerate foes with elemental fizzibangs, and solve puzzles. Sounds like there's a touch of monster-catching to the proceedings, then.
</p>
<p>
The demo offers around an hour of mollusc-abetted Game Boy Advancing and look, you can even play it on a mocked-up in-game "Himitsu" handheld if you like to layer up your nostalgia like peanut butter and jelly. It's almost enough to overpower my habitual reservations about writing up Kickstarter games - this one feels like a safer bet than most. Tako No Himitsu is a "spiritual successor" to developer Deneos's 8-bit platforming homage Save Me Mr Tako (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1472540/Save_me_Mr_Tako_Definitive_Edition/">Steam page hyah</a>), which was well-received back in 2021, and which appears to chronicle the aforesaid Human-Octopus War. I'm curious to know whether Deneos's evident vast and unholy love of tentacles came before their evident vast and unholy love of retro consoles. I'm thankful that they've found a way to combine the two.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/modded-nintendo-switch-baldurs-gate-3-run-crysis/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A modded Nintendo Switch with 8GB of RAM is capable of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-8-gb-pro-model-modded/">running select PC games surprisingly well</a>, but it fails to do the same with more recent and demanding games, as highlighted by a new video shared today.</p>
<p>The new test, which was conducted like the previous ones by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030">naga</a> on YouTube, puts a modded console with 8 GB of RAM, CPU running at 2.6 GHz, and GPU at 1.26 GHz to the test by running multiple PC games using Box64 + Wine on an L4T Ubuntu 18.04 with custom kernel OS. While Devil May Cry 5 runs surprisingly well, although never hitting 60 FPS consistently, the modded console fares much worse running more demanding games like Baldur's Gate 3, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Fallout 4, and Assassin's Creed Unity. In the case of the Larian Studios' successful role-playing game, the modded Nintendo Switch console can't even hit 20 FPS, although the fact that it is even running is impressive enough. The latest main entry in the Tomb Raider series fares even worse, hitting single-digit framerates during the benchmark. Surprisingly, the modded Nintendo Switch can run the original version of Crysis rather well, although performance is unstable and not exactly playable.</p>
<p><iframe title="14 PC Games Tested on Nintendo Switch (8GB RAM) - Box64 + Wine" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fwLaAkcp7Vg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the Nintendo Switch was undoubtedly an underpowered system even at launch, some developers managed to release some extremely good ports of demanding games, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-switch-preview/">The Witcher 3 port developed by Saber Interactive</a>. Hopefully, developers won't struggle porting their multiplatform titles to the console's successor, although there's the chance that things will become <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-ports-issues-next-gen/">more complicated</a> once the next-generation systems from Sony and Microsoft launch.</p>

<p>Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst is one of the most controversial young players in the Call of Duty League. He has been amazing viewers worldwide since his debut season last year, constantly performing at the highest level and enabling Toronto Ultra to score some major upsets. However, his loudmouth attitude and failure to deliver when it matters most have led many to criticise him time and again.</p>



<p>Recently, Scrap got down to brass tacks on a stream and spoke the truth about abusing Adderall while playing Call of Duty. It’s no big secret that it’s something of a pandemic in the esports space, with many competitors leaning on the prescription drug to focus their attention and lock in on a game – but it has so many adverse effects.</p>

<h2 id="h-don-t-get-yourself-onto-that">‘Don’t Get Yourself Onto That’</h2>



<p>In 2023, Scrap talked smack against the New York Subliners then promptly lost against the team in a record-breaking Grand Final at COD Champs that saw Toronto Ultra fail to win a single map. It effectively happened again at Major IV this season, with Scrap running his mouth and being booted from the tournament by the Subliners with a scoreline of 0 – 3.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, Scrap was clipped talking about Adderall, admitting that he took the drug when he played at Challengers tournaments. He quickly warned anyone off the medication, stressing that it’s ‘so bad for you’. He then stressed that he’s clean now and only drinks water during events – he doesn’t even consume caffeine. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ll be honest, I took it in Challengers, bro. I took it in Challengers for tournaments, like LANs. I don’t take it anymore, I drink straight water. I took it for tournaments only, but that shit is so bad for you, bro. If anyone in here… I do not recommend ever trying to take it to play a video game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For years, Adderall abuse has been a big issue in the Call of Duty space, and a few months back, scenes emerged that led many to believe that Indervir ‘iLLeY’ Dhaliwal was hooked on the pills. While talking on stage after Major I, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjLdxlPXzlY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">iLLeY appeared skittish</a> and unpredictable, failing to deliver his words and visibly tweaking. He said that he was on caffeine, but many doubted that claim.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip of Scrap talking about Adderall:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Scrap had to explain that Adderall was never the reason for his attitude towards other players – he’s just been like that for years, he insisted. It’s widely assumed that testing is relatively loose in the Call of Duty League, as many players have had quite public battles with Adderall addiction over the years.</p>

		<p>It’s an understatement to say that the last few years have been difficult for video game creators both big and small. Cancelled projects and huge publishers have led to swathes of layoffs, but it goes deeper than that, with smaller studios struggling to find the funding to make ends meet.</p>
<p>That was the situation that Dutch studio KeokeN Interactive faced earlier this year, the creators of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/deliver-us-the-moon">Deliver Us The Moon</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/deliver-us-mars">Deliver Us Mars</a> unable to either find support for a third Deliver Us game or for other projects and forced to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/01/deliver-us-the-moon-studio-keoken-lays-off-entire-team-will-rebuild-brick-by-brick-to-deliver-us-home/">almost completely wind down the studio</a>. But game development is often a passion, and that holds true for KeokeN co-founder Koen and Paul Deetman. They’re looking to rebuild their studio “brick by brick”, with a foundational stone being <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keoken/deliver-us-home">a Kickstarter for Deliver Us Home</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Deliver Us Home - Kickstarter Teaser [PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uwzy_hQS-o8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With the crowdfunding drive in its final hours –&nbsp;it concludes at 9PM BST today, and has crossed its minimum funding goal –&nbsp;we’ve been able to go hands on with a prototype demo that is included with some backer rewards. It immediately features familiar ideas and gameplay mechanics from Deliver Us Mars in particular.</p>
<p>The ending of Deliver Us Mars suggested that the surviving characters and all of the knowledge and technology they had managed to salvage would be heading back home, to Earth. Naturally the assumption for a sequel titled Deliver Us Home is that it would, somehow, tie into that desperate struggle to salvage something from our homeworld.</p>

<p>What KeokeN actually has in mind is something a little bit different. Much like in the blockbuster film Interstellar –&nbsp;how is that a decade old now? – Earth is a lost cause and mankind needs to find their way to other planets in order to survive as a species. Skipping ahead to the 23rd century and humanity has long since departed this planet and our solar system, journeying into the unknown to prospective new homes.</p>

<p>A descendent of the evacuees from Earth sent to survey planets, you crash land on Carlo 394e and are faced with a stark reality. Yes, it appears that this planet is rather Earth-like, but you’re not the first human to have set foot on this world. There’s isolated little facilities and buildings of different kinds, dotted across the landscape, a few message logs that start to peel back just a little of what the rest of this planet holds and what the previous expedition faced, and more.</p>
<p>There’s also little previews of the fundamental gameplay mechanics, many of which are returning from Deliver Us Mars. Played from the third person, there’s some environmental traversal in the vein of Uncharted or Tomb Raider, aided by a jet pack, some early puzzles to find and repair an ASE companion bot, and a vehicle you can hop in to get around.</p>

<p>A new element is that there’s much more scavenging the environment, scrounging up the left behind resources needed to craft core items: a new radio antenna, thrusters to repair the ASE, and the like. The Deetman brothers have also explained that they want to take more of a ‘wide linear’ approach, opening up the world a bit more for freeform exploration and getting a mix between the lonely adventuring of Deliver Us The Moon, and the more cinematic group storytelling of Deliver Us Mars.</p>
<p>This prototype amounts to a tech demo, but it also shows the direction that KeokeN will take now that they’ve successfully funded the Deliver Us Home. You still have a little time to dive in and add your support to the game’s development, but now the long road of game development and for KeokeN’s revival begins. Through the next year, they’ll be working to create a vertical slice of the game –&nbsp;another backer reward –&nbsp;with an aim to release the full game in the second half of 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/amd-fidelityfx-brixelizer-gi-is-a-compute-based-dynamic-global-illumination-solution-available-now-in-sdk-1-1/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new compute-based dynamic global illumination solution, <a href="https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-brixelizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD FidelityFX Brixelizer GI</a>, has been released alongside <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fidelityfx-sdk-v1-1-fsr-3-1-support-enhanced-upscaling-quality-decoupled-frame-generation-dlss-xess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SDK 1.1</a> (which also introduced AMD FSR 3.1).</p>
<p>AMD FidelityFX Brixelizer GI is based on the Brixelizer library, which generates sparse distance fields for triangle geometry in real time to effectively trace rays in a given scene. Brixelizer works with static and dynamic geometry, providing a shader API to trace rays against the distance field. It outputs cascades of sparse distance fields around a given position, with each cascade divided into 64x64x64 voxels. Once a voxel intersects any geometry, a local distance field is generated within the voxel. These local distance fields are called Bricks, hence the name of the technique.</p>
<p>Its main goal is to provide a faster alternative to traditional DXR-based ray traced shadows and/or ambient occlusion. Depending on the size of the scene, it can offer a sizable performance boost, as shown in the comparison slide below.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>To further improve performance, developers can increase voxel size to an extent. That will result in a coarser sparse distance field, which can be offset with increased ray bias.</p>
<p>AMD FidelityFX Brixelizer GI takes a game's G-Buffer and the sparse distance fields (SDFs) plus Bricks generated by Brixelizer to create Diffuse and Specular GI outputs. The sparse distance fields lack any material information, so there's an internal radiance cache based on the lighting output of previous frames. According to AMD, including the composited output from the previous frame effectively provides free multi-bounce global illumination. Then, screen probes are spawned on the depth buffer's visible surfaces. Rays are shot with Brixelizer, while the radiance cache is sampled for shading.</p>
<p>Ultimately, AMD FidelityFX Brixelizer GI is a simplified version of the GI-1.0 <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-capsaicin-graphics-framework-out-now-includes-gi-1-0-real-time-solution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> in May 2023 alongside the Capsaicin Graphics Framework. Perhaps AMD noticed game developers haven't been picking it up and decided to make it more accessible. We'll keep an eye on whether any studios select this technique over traditional hardware-accelerated ray tracing.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fromsoftware-new-job-ad-suggests-studio-will-continue-to-work-on-armored-core-in-the-future.924543/</guid>

			<p>FromSoftware will continue working on the Armored Core series in the future, judging from a new job ad that was discovered online this week.</p>
<p>As reported by cindiestarlight on the <a href="https://forums.tech4gamers.com/threads/exclusive-fromsoftware-hiring-for-armored-core-7.206/">Tech4Gamers forums</a>, the Japanese studio is looking to hire a Character Modeler whose responsibilities will include modeling and texturing characters or robots. While this is in no way an indication that a new entry in the series is already in the works, a new Armored Core definitely seems to be in the cards.</p>
<p>FromSoftware planning to release another entry in the Armored Core series comes as no surprise, given the success of Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon and Hidetaka Miyazaki stating multiple times in the past few months how he wanted to make another game in the series. With the sixth entry in the series being among some of the best, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon/">review</a>, it will really be interesting to see how the studio will evolve the formula.</p>
<p><em>FromSoftware has created its pinnacle mech-fighting opus with Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon. The faster pace of combat and higher difficulty may deter newcomers from strapping in for the first time, but there’s truly something special at play here. If the pace of Elden Ring leaves you wanting more or you simply want to blow up anything that moves, Armored Core VI’s got a job for you.</em></p>
<p>The latest game released by FromSoftware is the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. You can learn more about it by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">review.</a></p>

<p>Sonic the Hedgehog is one of the most iconic series in gaming history. It was debuted by Sega in 1991 in an effort to rival Nintendo’s Mario, and today, it’s one of the most popular multimedia franchises in the world. However, the head of the studio at Sonic Team, Takashi Iizuka, isn’t fully satisfied with what they’ve created thus far and was recently discussing the concept of a Sonic RPG.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-last-project">The Last Project</h2>



<p>In a recent interview, Takashi Iizuka, who has worked on the Sonic series since 1994, addressed the topic of a Sonic the Hedgehog game with a twist – an RPG-focused twist.</p>



<p>He said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Personally, I really like role-playing games. The RPG game format is a lot of fun, and I’ve even thought to myself, ‘You know, for the past 30 years, we haven’t done a Sonic RPG.’ And I’m questioning myself. ‘Why haven’t we done a Sonic RPG in all this time? How have we gotten to 30 years with no RPGs?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the video that covered Iizuka’s comments:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>The 54-year-old developer would love to produce a Sonic-themed RPG before he retires. He explained that it’s ‘just a dream right now’, but it sounds like it’s his ultimate deliverable before he retires from Sega, where he has worked for 30 years. In 2022, the team released Sonic Frontiers, an open-world platformer that saw players ‘battle hordes of powerful enemies’ as Sonic and his fellow anthropomorphised buddies.</p>

		<p>The boys are back in town and this time they’ve got an added dimension. Billy, Lee and the gang from the classic Double Dragon arcade series are being reimaged by Arc System Works and Yukes in to a 3d brawler, check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Double Dragon Revive - Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ihrv32XmEdQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game is described as “more than a simple button-masher” so it sounds like you are going to have to learn some combos, “delve into the strategy by learning enemy patterns and finding the most effective attack timings” add Arc System Works,.</p>
<p>The game keeps the side scrolling element of the original, “This work faithfully reproduces the real thrill of the belt scrolling while adjusting the control feel and difficulty level to suit modern times,” reads the Famitsu article via Google Translate.</p>
<p>The last game in the main series was the fairly average Double Dragon IV, but there was a spin off, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/04/double-dragon-gaiden-rise-of-the-dragons-is-coming-this-summer/">Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragon,</a> released last year that went for a cutesy pixel based aesthetic.</p>

<p>Double Dragon Revive -is due to launch in 2025 on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.</p>

Let Me Solo Her has once again changed their name as part of an effort to help other players defeat <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree's final boss.
</p>
<p>
Last week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-legend-let-me-solo-her-is-back-but-with-a-new-name">legendary player changed their name to Let Me Solo Him</a> to help with a certain boss encountered around halfway through the DLC.

</p>
<p>
Now they've turned their attention to the notoriously tricky final boss that's had players stumped. <strong>Spoilers follow</strong>.

</figure>
<p>

In a new video with the description "Finally, the trilogy", Let Me Solo Her becomes Let Me Solo Them for the battle against final boss Radahn, Consort of Miquella (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-is-finally-complete-let-me-solo-her-finishes-shadow-of-the-erdtree-as-let-me-solo-them-perfectly-destroying-the-dlcs-final-boss-with-its-biggest-weakness/">GamesRadar</a>).
</p>
<p>
The jarhead legend is summoned by a player called I'm Sorry, before single-handedly beating the pair of bosses with perfect precision.
</p>
<p>
So how is it done? Multiple Antspur Rapiers are used, in part due to its buildup of Scarlet Rot. After all, that's what Radahn and the region of Caelid are inflicted with in the base game. This rapier also has bleed damage and is used against Promised Consort Radahn.
</p>
<p>
Two further Antspur Rapiers are used in the second phase against Radahn and Miquella. The first inflicts ice damage to slow the boss down; the second inflicts poison for a gradual build up of damage. It's the latter that eventually kills the boss, without the need for a final stab.
</p>
<p>
All the while, Let Me Solo Them dodges every single attack to not lose a single point of health. When some of us really struggled against the boss, it's actually filthy to watch this in action.

<p>
But why are so many people struggling against this boss? Over on reddit, players have been complaining about hitboxes. 
</p>
<p>
A hitbox is where two characters make contact and damage is taken. However, during this final boss, it appears that damage is sometimes taken before a hit makes contact and the player has a chance to block or dodge.
</p>
<p>
For example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dygok7/spoiler_dont_trust_the_boss_animation/">one player takes damage before a hit makes contact</a>; another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1dzhrcx/why_can_the_endboss_hit_you_midroll_tho/">player gets struck down mid-roll</a> when it should have been dodged. This, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346">Kotaku</a> points out, was a major criticism of bosses in Dark Souls 2, and it appears to have infected the final boss of Shadow of the Erdtree too. 
</p>
<p>
If you're really struggling, you can always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-new-thrusting-shields-make-shadow-of-the-erdtree-difficulty-trivial-players-say">try the shield method</a> - this proved successful for me. Otherwise, give Let Me Solo Them a call.
