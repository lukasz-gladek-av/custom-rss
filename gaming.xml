			<p>What would you do if you were transported to another galaxy moments before Earth is unexpectedly destroyed? That is the scenario Doug and his pet guinea pig, Boom Boom, face in the Beyond Galaxyland. This part turn based RPG, part creature collector, is filled with various quests to undertake, from taking photos for people to trying to tear through space and time itself to save Earth. You know, your standard RPG stakes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Beyond Galaxyland | Gameplay Overview Trailer | Pre-Order on PC, Playstation, Xbox &amp; Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d3_H7SZFDBo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Galaxyland is a pocket of space where sentient beings from all over the universe have been transported over hundreds of years when they walk through portals on their home planets. Some have, like Doug, arrived as their planet faces annihilation, while others stumbled across the portals when no threat was present. Most of the aliens live together on the core world of Neo, though Erros is primarily the home of humans, and a few other planets around have their own people too, and little hubs to visit.</p>


<p>Each of these planets provides Doug with places to rest, allies, shops to pick up consumables like health tonics, and artifacts to help improve attributes for battles. Beyond Galaxyland also features crafting allowing you to put together the tonics along with making artifacts, as long as you have the correct blueprint and ingredients. It is a simple process to craft, but you can only do so at save points. In fact, you can only save at save points too and there is no autosave. Helpfully, there are plenty of these dotted across the galaxy.</p>


<p>The core of Beyond Galaxyland is battling, and there is quite a bit to it. You can sneak up on an enemy and get in a preemptive strike, before your party of three characters – Doug and two companions of your choice – settle in for the fight.&nbsp;Each character has their own unique abilities. For example, Doug can scan enemies to learn more about them, such as their health and type, while Boom Boom can restore some HP for the whole party.</p>
<p>Abilities use ability points that are in a group pool, so you do have to think about which one will benefit in the moment. You can regain ability points using basic attacks, but some enemies have their own moves that can take away ability points. In addition to ability points, each character has their own summon points, which is where the creature capturing comes in.</p>
<p>Doug can capture enemies, including some of the bosses, and once captured they can be assigned to characters. Each character can equip up to four summons, and each of those summons can level up. Summons also have types, which have strengths and weaknesses against enemy types. For example, it is not a great idea to use an electric type against an electric enemy as you are more likely to heal it than hurt it.</p>

<p>As you battle, your main characters will level up too, opening more areas for them to adventure in without getting killed in one hit. You will move back and forth between the planets of Galaxyland a fair bit as more quests become available, and the quest log will show you the minimum level you should be to try and attempt a quest. The quests themselves follow a generally similar pattern in that your party needs to go somewhere to retrieve an item or speak to someone, with the questline finishing with a boss battle. The boss designs are very good too, as are the various enemies, and the different attacks can make fights interesting.</p>
<p>Outside of the battles and creature collecting, Beyond Galaxyland falls down a bit in various ways. First, there are numerous bugs. For example, on the planet of Arcos using the lift to get from the first floor to the top floor would see Doug fall through the surface. The only workaround I found was by going down to the lower floor and then using the lift to go to the top floor. There were also a few occasions where Doug and co would fall from a platform and end up in the background, making it impossible to interact with the foreground.</p>
<p>The platforming itself is not fun either, and the game would flow much better without it. It feels like, on the course to include so many different elements, there has been a bit of quality loss in some areas. The game includes racing and that could be better as it does not have any real feedback to it and the navigation can be cumbersome when moving.</p>

<p>The story of Beyond Galaxyland is serviceable, but feels familiar despite its setting. It is the classic fish out of water tale, facing off against insurmountable odds. The characters are decently written, though there isn’t a lot of depth to them. Boom Boom could become a fan favourite due to his backstory, while Pablo kind of appears and you learn very little about him through the story.</p>
<p>The visual design is a real strength, though, even if some effects are a bit heavy handed – I turned some off so that just walking around didn’t look so blurry. The world designs are each distinctive and the various peoples you meet and creatures you face all look great too. The soundtrack is very good too, and some of the tunes are a properly good vibe, especially some of the boss tracks.</p>
<p>Beyond Galaxyland is a game you could get through in a few days. Completing the story and the majority of side quests took me approximately 15 hours.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dlss-3-added-to-greedfall-ii-the-dying-world-and-the-casting-of-frank-stone.989925/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-added-to-greedfall-ii-the-dying-world-and-the-casting-of-frank-stone/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA announced the latest batch of PC games that support DLSS 3 (Frame Generation) and DLSS 2 (Super Resolution). Fans of roleplaying games will find both in <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-hands-on-preview-swapping-places-with-dragon-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GreedFall: The Dying World</a>, out today <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/GreedFall_II_The_Dying_World/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> for a price of $40. With this RPG sequel, Spiders made some bold choices, such as switching from action-based combat to tab-target-like real-time with pause. Narratively, GreedFall II: The Dying World flips the premise of the previous installment, putting players in the shoes of a Teer Fradee native who is forcibly removed from the island and brought to the old continent.</p>
<p>At the Early Access launch, GreedFall II includes the beginning of the main quest, three explorable regions (Teer Fradee, Thynia, and Uxantis), six companions, and six skill trees. Between Fall and Winter, fans can expect new companions and companion quests, an extension of the main quest, a new region, new skill trees, and the addition of the crafting system. There is no set release date for version 1.0 yet.</p>
<p><iframe title="GreedFall 2 | Early Access Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QYklAgJGzlU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>DLSS 3 is also available in The Casting of Frank Stone, the horror game developed by Supermassive Games in the Dead By Daylight universe. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-casting-of-frank-stone-death-is-not-the-end/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received an 8/10 score on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>To be honest, I wasn't expecting much of The Casting of Frank Stone, given how I only have a passing knowledge of Dead by Daylight, but after a few hours, I was hooked. This is a testament to the quality of the experience, which manages to be a great one for all sorts of players, granted they can stomach the little gameplay the adventure features, and the short run time for a single playthrough. The asking price of $39.99 is maybe a little too high for a six-hour-long game, but if you are into well-constructed horror stories, it could be a price worth paying.</em></p>
<p>DLSS 3 is available in Witchfire, too, which is out now on Steam with a new weapon, achievements, visual improvements, and rebalanced mechanics.</p>
<p>DLSS 2 is supported in Satisfactory, which recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/satisfactory-finally-leaves-early-access-on-september-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exited</a> early access, Mortal Kombat 1, which received the Khaos Reigns expansion, and the new open world first-person shooter Echo Point Nova, out today.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Vanillaware Strategy RPG Unicorn Overlord Hits One Million Sales]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unicorn-overlord-one-million-sales</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vanillaware-strategy-rpg-unicorn-overlord-hits-one-million-sales.989922/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unicorn-overlord-one-million-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atlus and developer Vanillaware have announced that fantasy strategy RPG&nbsp;<em>Unicorn Overlord&nbsp;</em>has crossed a major sales barrier.</p>
<p>Released back in March, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unicorn-overlord-by-vanillaware-has-sold-500000-copies">hit 500,000 sales</a> just a few weeks after its initial launch, and now, the two studios have <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1838385009322758274" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> that&nbsp;<em>Unicorn Overlord&nbsp;</em>has officially sold a million copies across all platforms.</p>
<p>In order to celebrate the milestone, Atlus posted special artwork of the three characters Berengaria, Melisandre, and Rosalinde, created to mark the occasion by&nbsp;<em>Unicorn Overlord&nbsp;</em>artist Takashi Noma. You can take a look at that artwork below.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unicorn-overlord-sales-million.jpg?itok=DhVlGWoR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unicorn-overlord-sales-million.jpg?itok=iedeixpu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Unicorn Overlord&nbsp;</em>artist Takashi Noma created this specifically to mark a million sales.</figcaption></figure><p>Atlus calls the milestone "huge" and thanks&nbsp;<em>Unicorn Overlord&nbsp;</em>players for helping it to reach a million sales, or, to put it in the studio's words, for "supporting the Liberation Army".</p>
<p><em>Unicorn Overlord</em>'s sales milestone is pretty impressive; after all, the game belongs to a fairly niche genre, although it's fair to say Vanillaware (whose previous works include games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/13-sentinels-aegis-rim"><em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</em></a>) has a fanbase all its own as well.</p>
<p>The fact that the game is published by Atlus, whose works include immensely popular RPGs like the&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>series, certainly doesn't hurt either. That title's a pretty catchy one, too.</p>
<p>Still, it took the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/13-sentinels-aegis-rim-sales-top-million-worldwide">several years to hit the million mark</a>, although it's only on two platforms as opposed to&nbsp;<em>Unicorn Overlord</em>'s multiplatform release.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Unicorn Overlord</em>, it's a fantasy real-time strategy RPG created by Vanillaware, the studio responsible for games like&nbsp;<em>Odin Sphere</em>,&nbsp;<em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</em>, and&nbsp;<em>GrimGrimoire</em>.</p>
<p>The game casts you as exiled prince Alain, who must <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unicorn-overlord-by-vanillaware-shows-off-how-you-can-make-your-army-stronger">gather an army</a> to rise up and take back his kingdom from an oppressive empire. As you go, you'll recruit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vanillawares-unicorn-overlord-reveals-characters-classes-and-more-with-gorgeous">new fighters</a> for your army, engage in optional extra battles, and explore the fantasy world of Fevrith.</p>
<p><em>Unicorn Overlord&nbsp;</em>is available right now for PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch (although not for PC, for some reason). Stay tuned for more.</p>

And while fans love the game itself, they're much less enthusiastic about Sony's edict that forces PC users to connect to PlayStation Network just to experience the title.

And now, a modder has already come up with a way to sidestep Sony's restriction.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-mod-removes-controversial-psn-requirement-and-its-creator-has-vowed-to-maintain-it" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, a modder who goes by iArtorias has released <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/22" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the NoPSSDK mod</a> that removes the PSN linking restriction and essentially gives God of War Ragnarok an offline mode. Additionally, iArtorias left a promise on their Nexus Mods page to "try to maintain the tool even if something changes, but hopefully nothing crucial happens."</p><div tabindex="0"

that remove the PSN requirement. But it's unclear why Sony put that in Ragnarok in the first place since the game is only a single-player title. It makes more sense to utilize PSN for multiplayer games that actually need to be online. There's no apparent reason why Ragnarok has to be subject to the same restrictions.</p><p>Sony previously showed some willingness to compromise when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-helldivers-2-mandatory-psn-sign-in-requirement-following-player-uproar/1100-6523180/" data-ref-id="1100-6523180">it dropped the PSN requirement for Helldivers 2 </a>after a backlash. However, the upcoming remake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/until-dawn-remake-is-out-october-4-puts-it-on-collision-course-with-silent-hill-2/1100-6525780/" data-ref-id="1100-6525780">Until Dawn</a> will also be subject to a mandatory PSN connection. This issue is likely to be an ongoing irritation for gamers if Sony keeps insisting on adding the PSN requirement to future PC games.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-by-daylight-dev-behaviour-acquires-darkest-dungeon-studio-red-hook.989883/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/behaviour-red-hook-purchase<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>publisher Behaviour Interactive has announced that it has acquired&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon&nbsp;</em>developer Red Hook Studios for an undisclosed amount of money.</p>
<p>In a press release, Behaviour says its acquisition of Red Hook "highlights [Behaviour's] commitment to horror", and that the purchase of the studio "reinforces Behaviour's leading position in horror gaming".</p>
<p>None of Red Hook's team members will be let go, it seems, and the studio will contoinue to function "as an independent studio within Behaviour", so it sounds like no management or strategy changes will be taking place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/behaviour-interactive-red-hook-darkest-dungeon.jpg?itok=8R2sEtMn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/behaviour-interactive-red-hook-darkest-dungeon.jpg?itok=knDyN1Qg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Red Hook is best known for the&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon&nbsp;</em>games.</figcaption></figure><p>Behaviour CEO&nbsp;Rémi Racine says the acquisition of Red Hook is "another emphatic step" towards his studio's objective of becoming "synonymous with horror". He also teases "more to come" on this front.</p>
<p>Red Hook co-founder Chris Bourassa, meanwhile, says that his studio and Behaviour are "kindred spirits"; they're both Canadian, they're both independent, and, according to Bourassa, they're both "devoted to fantastic horror games".</p>
<p>Fellow Red Hook co-founder Tyler Sigman says Red Hook will benefit from Behaviour's "considerable knowledge and resources", and that the two studios are "stronger together than apart", pledging to "delve even deeper" into the&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon&nbsp;</em>franchise alongside Behaviour.</p>
<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>is known for its many IP collaborations, including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-castlevania-crossover-release-date"><em>Castlevania</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider-crossover"><em>Tomb Raider</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover">many</a> more <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-dragons-crossover">besides</a>, could this acquisition result in a&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>crossover someday? We can but hope.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/behaviour-interactive-red-hook-dead-by-daylight.jpg?itok=Dg6k2wzC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/behaviour-interactive-red-hook-dead-by-daylight.jpg?itok=DpKggLZf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Behaviour's best-known game is the multiplayer horror title&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The announcement of Behaviour's acquisition of Red Hook arguably comes at a somewhat inopportune time.</p>
<p>Last week, the studio announced it had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-spinoff-project-t-canceled">canceled&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>third-person shooter spinoff&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-spinoff-project-t-canceled">Project T</a>&nbsp;</em>and shut down development studio Midwinter, so announcing that another studio has been acquired in the wake of that news seems a touch insensitive.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we'll have to wait and see what Behaviour does now that Red Hook is part of its studio stable. With <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/darkest-dungeon-2-kingdoms-update-split">big things coming for&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon 2&nbsp;</em>in the future</a>, Behaviour's support could mean even more updates or DLC for the game. Stay tuned for more.</p>

There are also calls for a similar mod for Sony’s other recently released PC games, such as <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. Ghost of Tsushima requires a PSN account for the Legends online multiplayer mode and to use PlayStation overlay, but it is not required to play the single-player game, which makes Sony’s decision to enforce a PSN requirement on the purely single-player God of War Ragnarok all the more baffling.</p><p>Sony’s PSN account requirement for its PC games was thrust into the limelight with the release of Arrowhead’s explosive PC and PS5 co-op shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a> earlier this year. Helldivers 2 suffered a review bomb campaign on Steam after Sony made PSN accounts mandatory for PC gamers on Valve’s platform (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-psn-review-bomb-cape-mia-as-arrowhead-awaits-clarity-on-game-being-sold-in-more-countries"><u>Arrowhead subsequently decided to turn the Steam user review history graph into a cape, which is ready for launch but has yet to release</u></a>).</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-reverses-course-on-helldivers-2-psn-account-requirement"><u>Sony eventually backed down and reversed Helldivers 2’s PSN account requirement</u></a>, but the game remains unavailable in the many countries that lack PSN. And indeed all Sony’s games on PC now suffer from this problem, which means God of War Ragnarök is unavailable on PC in over 100 countries.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Behaviour Interactive is buying <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a> developer Red Hook Studios.</p>
<p>Sharing the news today, Behaviour - known for its work on multiplayer survival game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> - said Red Hook will remain a "fully independent studio under the Behaviour banner" and was "ecstatic" about the acquisition.</p>

<p>"Darkest Dungeon has long been a series we've admired, enjoyed (and maybe even lost a little sleep over) as fans," Behavior wrote on social media platform X. "We look forward to supporting Red Hook as they continue to do what they do best: put your sanity to the test."</p>
<p>In a separate statement, Behaviour CEO and co-founder Rémi Racine called it a "privilege" to welcome the Darkest Dungeon developer into the fold.</p>
<p>"Earlier this year, we established an ambitious goal for our future as a publisher - to make Behaviour synonymous with horror, and surround Dead by Daylight with a library of similarly exceptional horror games. Our acquisition of Red Hook is another emphatic step towards this objective, with more to come," Racine said.</p>
<p>Red Hook co-founder Chris Bourassa added: "We've found kindred spirits in the Behaviour team. Both studios are Canadian, independent, and devoted to fantastic horror games. Where we differ is scale, which opens the door to new possibilities.</p>
<p>"Behaviour's support will help us pursue our vision for Red Hook's future, and focus fully on transforming Darkest Dungeon into an absolute juggernaut of the dark fantasy genre."</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Behavior in collaboration with Supermassive Games released their Dead by Daylight spin-off, The Casting of Frank Stone. You can check out a trailer for it above. We awarded the narrative-driven horror game three stars on its launch, calling it a "a drawn-out multiverse adventure" in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-casting-of-frank-stone-review">Casting of Frank Stone review</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, Behaviour Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-pve-spin-off-project-t-cancelled-after-unsatisfactory-player-testing">cancelled its Dead by Daylight four-player co-op spin-off</a>, known as Project T, after early player testing "yielded unsatisfactory overall results".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Look out, it's Spiders. It's fun to write about Spiders, because you get to frighten people for a moment, before they realise you're talking about the game development studio, Spiders. They have just released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/greedfall-2">GreedFall 2: The Dying Land</a> into early access. For those who don't remember the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/greedfall">GreedFall</a>, it was a colonial-styled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the "old world". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks. </p>

<p>Spiders say that this release includes the "beginning of the main quest", and note that extensions to that story will be drip fed in future updates. Aside from that the release includes three regions to explore, six companion characters to party up with, and six skill trees to clamber up. Future updates are marked for unspecified times in  "autumn" and "winter", and will bring further companions, plus side quests related to those sword-swinging pals, along with new regions and a crafting system. </p>
<p>Behind the scenes, there have been grumbles of dissatisfaction from workers at the studio. At the beginning of the month roughly half the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/greedfall-2-developers-call-a-strike-over-working-conditions-lack-of-gender-equality-and-parity-and-global-mismanagement">signed a letter calling for a strike</a>. This was to address their frustrations at working conditions in the company, including "global mismanagement, turnover and recruitment problems, unacceptable delays in achieving gender equality and parity, important lack of transparency, denial of problems... and blocked negotiations." </p>
<p>The studio management replied that those accusations were false, saying they "in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's employees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully mobilized to produce quality games."</p>
<p>Since then, the French union representing the workers, the Syndicat des Travailleurs/ses du Jeu Vidéo (STJV) have said on Xitter that talks between the union and company have <a href="https://x.com/stjv_fr/status/1834634007151001930">yielded some promises from management</a>, including an "audit" of working conditions and a "bonus based on GreedFall 2 Early Access performance." (Comments translated by Google.) What do you know, it's almost as if collective action works. Huh! </p>
<p>Regardless of the studio's inner conflict, GreedFall 2 will have to improve on the team's previous games if it wants to impress some players. The first GreedFall didn't wow Astrid very much in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/greedfall-review">their review</a><a></a>. "In GreedFall, the first three hours make you want to astrally project out of your body and float away to do or see literally anything else," they said, "and then you reach the island of Teer Fradee and you’re like, 'Oh! This is actually mediocre!'"</p>
<p>Spiders have a track record of making good-looking games with lots of flair and a promising hook, but upon playing they reveal themselves to be so-so. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/steelrising">Steelrising</a> was a steampunky soulslike with a French Revolution angle that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steelrising-review">made Alice B shrug</a>. They also made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-technomancer">The Technomancer</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mars-war-logs">Mars: War Logs</a>, neither of which shone particularly brightly. Richard Cobbett summed up this general trend in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bound-by-flame-review">Bound By Flame</a> review, saying it "dreams of being epic, but ends up just feeling slight - RPG action that would love to be in the same company as The Witcher and Dragon Age, but instead has to sit with the likes of Game of Thrones: The Game." Perhaps this sequel can bring them a step further to their BioWare-in-their-heydey aspirations. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

BioWare, the developer behind the Dragon Age series, has already figured out most of the possible ways that gamers can level up their characters. And according to game director Corinne Busche, BioWare is eager to see if players manage to surprise them by coming up with builds that can break its leveling system.</p><p>"We want players to find emergent builds," Busche told <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/bioware-hopes-youll-make-dragon-age-the-veilguard-builds-so-good-theyll-break-the-game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/ea-sports-fc-25-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Let us cut to the chase. If you are expecting a major overhaul and update in FC 25 compared to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/25/ea-sports-fc-24-review/">FC 24</a>, you will be disappointed. There are some changes and a brand new game mode, but when it comes down to it, FC 25 is going to be very familiar to FC 24, from the presentation to the on the pitch action. The big change, and in my opinion a change for the better, is that Volta is gone and Rush is in.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 25 Official Launch Trailer | For The Club" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RefXbk1_taI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For many people, the first port of call in FC 25 will still be the career modes, whether that’s player or manager. In player career, you can create your own professional, or pick a player and rewrite their story to create an alternate history for them. I chose to create a player and to mix things up I decided to pick a team that I am sure very few will: Punjab FC. I chose them partly because getting the chance to play as any team from my own cultural background is rare, and partly because it would be easier for my new player to breakthrough into the first team here compared to a big team in the major European leagues.</p>


<p>At the start of your career, your agent will also give you the option to pick a target club that you want to eventually sign for, but you need to perform on the pitch to get there. Once you finally start, it is obvious that the career mode is the same as FC 24, except the starting rating for my player was 75 and not 70 as it was in last year’s game. Just like FC 24, you pick your position and personality type – Maverick, Heartbeat or Virtuoso. Again, your player is set objectives and you play training drills to unlock abilities and improve your player rating, and you have the option to play as just your pro during matches or as the whole team. Down the road, Live Start Points will be added to player and career modes, taking moments from the 2024/25 season, and letting you replay them, but they are not available yet.</p>


<p>Manager mode is similar to player career, and just like last year you can create your own or choose a real life manager to take control of. I made my own, and went to Punjab FC again. Rush mode is part of career mode as well, at least for the youth team, where you can play as some of your club’s up and coming stars in a small Rush tournament. This is a decent addition as it focuses you on players that could eventually break into the first team, and lets you really focus on their development. Other than that, manager career is very similar to FC 24 in terms of layout and objectives. The coaching rating system returns too, in which coaches are rated on their effectiveness of training players in different areas of the field.</p>
<p>On to the multiplayer, and Rush is very front and centre to get eyes on it. It is part of Ultimate Team, and in it you pick one of your Ultimate Team players to control as part of the five player squad, though not the keeper who is controlled by the computer. Rush has potential if players learn to remember that this is a team sport, and not a place to always show off individual skills or ball hog. You can play with friends, but I jumped into random squads, which were a mixed bag in this regard. Getting a group of players together who played as team really displays how Rush comes together, but play with selfish players and it sucks any fun out of the mode. You can also play Rush in kick off mode where you control the whole team yourself, which is fun too.</p>

<p>Rush, as implied by the name, is fast paced and moves end to end very quickly, as you are playing on a smaller pitch. The commentary is very repetitive though and only one arena could make the mode feel stale quickly. Rush features the same rules as a normal match, but also adds the blue card where a player is removed from the pitch for a minute before being allowed back on.</p>
<p>Aside from the addition of Rush, the other online modes are very familiar. Ultimate Team is still the same where you play to climb the ranks, play in tournaments, and earn/buy coins to buy packs or buy specific players in the transfer market. Chemistry is still key to how a team operates together, with those sharing the same nation, club, or league having a better chemistry with each other than those that do not. Your enjoyment of the mode will really come down to how your team shapes up against other players, and if you are good enough to climb the ladder.</p>

<p>On the pitch, there have been some changes with the key addition being FC IQ. This adds Player Roles to FC 25, making players much more like their real life counterparts in terms of what they do on the pitch, and these roles do impact your tactics. Across the 11v11 modes, you can set up different tactics to rotate between, with the success of these being dependant on your players and how they will do in the positions your put them in.</p>
<p>Additionally, FC IQ will suggest tactical changes while in matches depending on the situation. If you are losing, it will suggest new formations or tactical approaches to counter your opponent, and if you are winning it will likely suggest tactics to defend that lead. It’s a good addition, but just like switching a team playstyle in matches the way to do so feels clunky and does not fit into the rest of the flow. There is also something noticeable in that players do not seem to react as well or quickly to any changes, and off the ball movement comes across as lacklustre, which does not change if you are playing as either a top tier team or a bottom rung club.</p>

<p>Where Rush is an arcade style fast paced mode, 11 vs 11 matches go further into simulating real life, and that is starting to remove some of the fun from older EA football games. The focus on real world simulation means, as the series has progressed you are less likely to go in for sliding tackles due to the high risk of being booked, for example. I’m old enough to remember running away from the referee in FIFA 94 on the Sega Mega Drive…</p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro's increased specs over the base model will not bring any improvement to AMD FSR 2, as its biggest issues aren't caused by low base resolution.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> replied to a fan question asking if the better specs of the PlayStation 5 Pro over the base model would bring image quality improvements to games using AMD FSR 2. The tech experts have no doubt that the new system will be able to do little to improve some of the upscaler's issues, which have very little to do with base resolution, but rather with the way it reconstructs the image, leading to the known visual issues in motion. These issues may only become less noticeable with a higher base resolution but will still be very much present. PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, from the available footage, looks like a considerable step up in terms of image quality, as showcased recently in <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-vast-improvement-playstation-5-pro/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, so, at the very least, PS5 Pro owners will be able to enjoy much better visual quality in games.</p>
<p>Speaking about the PlayStation 5 Pro's PSSR, which will be the first AI-powered upscaler in the console space, Digital Foundry also highlighted how similar upscalers are not going to bring the cost of future consoles down. While they could have, as manufacturers could have saved on manufacturing costs with smaller chips and better efficiency of dedicated hardware, manufacturing costs for specialized SoCs are likely going to continue being high. So, it seems more and more likely that the PS5 Pro's high cost may just be the beginning of a general price increase for consoles in the future.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-film-production-company-named-stellarblade%E2%80%99-is-suing-playstation-over-stellar-blade%E2%80%99.989817/</guid>

<p>A Louisiana-based film production company, Stellarblade, has just filed a case against the developers of Stellar Blade, Shift Up and the publisher, PlayStation.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellarblade-trademark-lawsuit-sony-shift-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Griffith Chambers Mehaffey, the owner of the film company, has filed a trademark infringement case against PlayStation, Shift Up, and an unnamed insurance company for using the trademark “Stellar Blade”. Mehaffey’s complaint adds that his business was damaged due to the similarity in names and logos.</p><p>&nbsp;Mehaffey’s complaint states that he has owned stellarblade.com since 2006 and has offered “multimedia entertainment services” since 2010. The complaint also discusses how the game was announced as Project Eve in 2019 and later changed to Stellar Blade in 2022.&nbsp;Shift Up registered Stellar Blade as a video-game-related trademark in January 2023, and Mehaffey registered Stellarblade in June 2023. He followed this up by sending a cease and desist to Shift Up in July.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>Regarding the business, the owner of the film company has claimed that his customers could easily find details about his business on the internet. However, since the game was released, his business has been overshadowed by Shift Up’s Stellar Blade in the searches. Mehaffey has also claimed that both trademarks are “confusingly similar”, pointing out the colour schemes and how both logos have a stylised S.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mehaffey’s demands are clear: he wants Shift Up and PlayStation to cease using the name ‘Stellar Blade’, hand over all materials bearing the name for destruction, and compensation for the damages and attorney fees.</p>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Behaviour Interactive [62 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/behaviour-interactive">Behaviour Interactive</a> has acquired Vancouver-based developer <a title="Companies > Red Hook Studios [12 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/behaviour-interactive/red-hook-studios">Red Hook Studios</a>, the companies announced. <span id="more-916502"></span></p><p>Red Hook Studios is the studio behind <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> and <em><a title="Games > Darkest Dungeon II [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/darkest-dungeon-ii">Darkest Dungeon II</a></em>, released in 2013 and 2023, respectively, which have sold over seven million copies combined. The studio is made up of 29 team members and will continue to function independently within Behaviour Interactive.</p><p>Find comments from each party below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Remi Racine, Behaviour Interactive Co-Founder and CEO</strong></p><p>“It’s a privilege to welcome a developer of Red Hook’s caliber. Earlier this year, we established an ambitious goal for our future as a publisher—to make Behaviour synonymous with horror, and surround <em>Dead by Daylight</em> with a library of similarly exceptional <a title="Genres > Horror [488 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror games</a>. Our acquisition of Red Hook is another emphatic step towards this objective, with more to come.”</p><p><strong>Stephen Mulrooney, Behaviour Interactive Chief Product and Technical Officer</strong> </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>“<em>Darkest Dungeon</em> offers a natural complement to <em>Dead by Daylight</em>. Both franchises occupy unique points on the horror spectrum, and both offer their players deep, innovative gameplay and original, eldritch worlds. We’re so excited to add Darkest Dungeon to Behaviour’s horror portfolio. Not just because we’re huge fans of the games, but also because of the unparalleled creativity and passion demonstrated by Chris, Tyler, and every member of the Red Hook team.”</p><p><strong>Chris Bourassa, Red Hook Studios Co-Founder</strong></p><p>“We’ve found kindred spirits in the Behaviour team. Both studios are Canadian, independent, and devoted to fantastic horror games. Where we differ is scale, which opens the door to new possibilities. Behaviour’s support will help us pursue our vision for Red Hook’s future, and focus fully on transforming <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> into an absolute juggernaut of the dark fantasy genre.”</p><p><strong>Tyler Sigman, Red Hook Studios Co-Founder</strong></p><p>“Joining forces with Behaviour is exciting on multiple levels. They have demonstrated a commitment to allowing our team to continue developing Darkest Dungeon in the manner we know best, but with the benefit of their considerable knowledge and resources. We are stronger together than apart. Critically, there is a shared love of Darkest Dungeon, and with Behaviour’s help we can delve even deeper into the franchise.”</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Don't Nod has high hopes for Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, after Jusant and Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden failed to reach company expectations.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-87839">financial report</a>, the French developer and publisher said it will now "partially write down, in the amount of €24m, the assets of Jusant and Banishers: Ghost of New Eden, given the inability to demonstrate future cash flows commensurate with the value of these assets".</p>
<p>It will also turn its attention to games currently in production, such as Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, which the Don't Nod said "received a particularly positive reception" after being played by press at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, Don't Nod also has two in-house, yet-to-be-named projects in the works, which are scheduled to release by the end of 2027. The company is also supporting two external publishing projects, which are due to release next year.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Don't Nod has temporarily paused two projects currently "in the design phase". The company said this will allow it to "prioritise resources and maximise the chances of success of the titles with the greatest potential" at the current time.</p>
<p>"We are obviously disappointed by our recent performance in an extremely competitive and selective market," chairman and CEO of Don't Nod Oskar Guilbert said.</p>
<p>"Despite an excellent critical reception, Jusant and Banishers: Ghosts of new Eden unfortunately did not achieve the commercial results we had hoped for, resulting in a deterioration in our 2024 half-year results and leading us to consider all possible options regarding our roadmap."</p>

			<p>As reported <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellarblade-trademark-lawsuit-sony-shift-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by IGN</a>, Sony and Stellar Blade developer Shift Up have been sued in the United States for trademark infringement. The plaintiff is Griffith Chambers Mehaffey, owner of a multimedia company named Stellarblade LLC whose officials website is available <a href="https://www.stellarblade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Mehaffey's lawyer sent the following statement to IGN:</p>
<p><em>Mr. Mehaffey registered the stellarblade.com domain in 2006 and has used the STELLARBLADE name for his business for nearly 15 years. Given this long-standing and public use, it's difficult to imagine that Shift Up and Sony were unaware of Mr. Mehaffey's established rights before adopting their identical mark. We believe in fair competition, but when larger companies disregard the established rights of smaller businesses, it's our responsibility to stand up and protect our brand. The defendants’ far superior resources have effectively monopolized online search results for STELLARBLADE, pushing Mr. Mehaffey's long-established business into digital obscurity and threatening the livelihood he's built over more than a decade.</em></p>
<p>In all likelihood, none of this would have happened if Stellar Blade had not become a major success. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-over-one-million-units-since-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became a million-seller</a> very quickly, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-developer-is-now-worth-as-much-as-koei-tecmo-in-market-capitalization-following-huge-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boosting Shift Up's evaluation</a> right before the Korean company went public. Shift Up is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working</a> on DLC and a PC port.</p>
<p>We rated Stellar Blade 9 out of 10. Here's the excerpt from Kai Tatsumoto's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>

			<p>A Nintendo Switch Lite OLED mod is being released this week, and a new trailer was shared online to showcase the gorgeous screen that users will be able to install on the system in just a few days.</p>
<p>The SUPER5 OLED mod for the Nintendo Switch Lite, created by Taki Udon, will go <a href="https://retroremake.co/pages/super5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on sale</a> in multiple variants on September 26th at 10 a.m. Hong Kong time. The new screen boasts significantly higher brightness, contrast ratio, and color gamut compared to the vanilla screen, resulting in a much more pleasing experience that is more in line with the one that regular Switch OLED users can have on their system. A trailer was also shared to showcase the gorgeous screen, and you can check it out below.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">SUPER5 OLED Pricing / Launch Date</p>
<p>The SUPER5 OLED kits will go on sale on September 26th at 10 am Hong Kong Time (GMT +8). We have promo coupons for the first two days while supplies last. An install guide for the base package will go up this week.</p>

<p>— Taki Udon (@TakiUdon_) <a href="https://twitter.com/TakiUdon_/status/1838275690405523554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 right around the corner, it's unlikely the Japanese company will ever offer an official Nintendo Switch Lite OLED, so getting the modification by Taki Udon is the only way to enhance the portable-only experience the system offers. An OLED screen also doesn't seem to be in the cards for Nintendo's next generation system as well, at least at launch, although the console is still going to offer a good portable experience, thanks to its low power consumption, which will grant it great battery life. The portable experience seems to have been a focus for Nintendo from the very beginning of development, as AMD's bid to create the system didn't go through due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-amd-performance/">performance and power consumption issues in handheld mode.</a></p>

<p>God of War Ragnarok PC now has a mod that allows players to play the game without linking their PSN and Steam accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>God of War Ragnarok was released for PC on September 19, 2024. However, the players didn’t receive the game well. Within hours of release, the new PC port experienced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-players-psn-ragnarok-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a surge in negative reviews</a>, with most players complaining about the PSN account linking requirement. Interestingly, one modder has released a solution for this problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/someone-made-a-mod-to-bypass-the-psn-login-for-god-of-war-ragnarok-and-it-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, iArtorias has released a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/22?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NOPSSDK</a> mod, available through Nexus Mods and GitHub. Through NOPSSDK, a tiny library will strip the PlayStation PC SDK runtime requirement for God of War Ragnarok entirely. After installing this mod, players can rampage all over the Norse realms without worrying about having a PSN account.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-install-god-of-war-ragnarok-nopssdk-mod">How to Install God of War Ragnarok NOPSSDK Mod?</h2>



<p>Players can head to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/22?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nexus Mods</a> or <a href="https://github.com/iArtorias/nopssdk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GitHub</a> to install NOPSSDK for God of War Ragnarok PC. Download the latest release, and copy the “version.dll and PsPcSdk.dll” files to the game folder. After that, players can select “No” when the game asks them to link their Steam and PSN accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The creator has also provided some troubleshooting methods if the mod doesn’t work correctly. If players encounter a login screen error, they should remove this file, “C:\Users[Username]\Saved Games\God of War Ragnarök[AccountID]\userpreferences”. Then, when the game asks you to link your Steam and PSN accounts, press “No”.&nbsp;</p>

And the game looks f***ing great. But when I play on the PS5, I play performance.”</p><p>Space Marine 2 has two display modes for PS5 and Xbox Series X: 'Quality' offers higher resolution, a stable 30 frames per second, and better graphics, whereas 'Speed' drops the resolution in a bid to hit 60fps.</p><p>However, Space Marine 2 has performance issues on PS5 relative to the Xbox Series X version. According to the tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-impresses-on-xbox-series-x-s-but-flags-on-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a>, Space Marine 2 impresses on Xbox Series X and S, but “flags” on PS5. Here’s DF’s analysis:</p><blockquote>“In testing Space Marine 2 on PC, it's clear that the game's encounters with alien swarms pushes the CPU hard - and at least as of patch 1.02, that results in lop-sided performance on consoles in the 60fps speed mode. Series X typically outperforms PS5 by around 10 to 15fps, despite both machines using the same settings and resolution targets. The lowest drops come when taking a flamethrower to the encroaching horde, where PS5 drops to the mid-30s while Xbox Series X is in the mid-40s.”</blockquote><p>Willits’ “hope” — he admits he’s not a technical person — is that Space Marine 2 in Speed Mode on PS5 Pro will look better than Quality Mode does on the base PS5.</p><p>“So what I hope — and it's just me, I don't know anything technical — but what I hope is with the PS5 Pro, with the AI upsampling, that players will be able to play Space Marine 2 in Performance [Speed] Mode, and it'll look better, hopefully — hopefully, I don't know — it'll look better than it does in Quality Mode now.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>It true, it means those who play Space Marine 2 in Speed mode on PS5 will benefit from its higher frame-rate (hopefully locked to 60fps this time, but no guarantees as the issue on the performance side — hitting 60fps — is the CPU limitation) <em>and</em> improved graphics. The game will have a higher resolution owing to the PS5 Pro's faster GPU (more pixels) and then PSSR upscaling (better upscaling of those more pixels).</p><p>But what about a PS5 Pro Enhanced patch for Space Marine 2? Sony has said several games will be patched with free software updates for gamers to take advantage of PS5 Pro’s features (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-game-enhanced-for-ps5-pro">IGN has a list of all the confirmed PS5 Pro Enhanced games so far</a>). These games can be identified with a PS5 Pro Enhanced label within their title.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We're actually in discussions with Sony to figure out what we want to do.</p></div><p>Willits said Saber has no plans right now for Space Marine 2 to join the PS5 Pro Enhanced list, but did confirm that the company’s engineers are in talks with Sony to work out if it’s something they want to support.</p><p>“So we're actually in discussions with Sony to figure out what we want to do,” Willits said. “Sony's really happy about the game. Microsoft is happy about the game too! But yes, our engineers are discussing what we can do. We have no plans right now. We're still trying to figure that out. Again, the PS5 Pro is brand new, our game, we're just trying to catch up. So we just have to be patient with our official plans.”</p><p>Sony is set to host a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-for-september-2024-officially-announced">State of Play broadcast</a> today, September 24, at 3pm PT / 6pm ET, with news on more than 20 upcoming PS5 and PS VR2 games “from studios around the world.” Perhaps we’ll get a clearer idea of what to expect from the PS5 Pro at the show.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Game Enhanced for PS5 Pro So Far</h3></div></output><p>Meanwhile, we have plenty of Space Marine 2 coverage to check out, including Willits on the record-breaking success of the game and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3">what it means for a potential story DLC or even Space Marine 3</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-version-0-3-0-download/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new version of the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, introducing a lot of improvements over the previous version.</p>
<p>Version 0.3.0 introduces cheating and patching, DLC, 26 more languages, additional controllers (DualShock and Xbox controllers), trophies support, GUI improvements, and much more. As a result of the many changes introduced in this new version of the emulator, old save files may no longer be compatible. A guide is available on the emulator's official Discord server on how to migrate and save files created with the previous version of the emulator without losing any progress.</p>
<p>The ShadPS4 emulator has been making incredible progress in the past few months, going from being able to play only simple 2D games such as Sonic Mania and barely booting up more complex titles to making Bloodborne playable on PC. These emulation improvements have also allowed modders like fromsoftserve to work mods that improve the game's visuals and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-fanmade-remaster-improved-models/">unofficial remastering projects</a> that will breathe new life into the haunting city of Yarnham.</p>
<p>More information on the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/">official website</a>. The new version of the emulator can be downloaded right now for free from <a href="https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/releases/tag/v.0.3.0">GitHub.</a></p>

            <p>The in thing when it comes to dinosaur conversations now is this: "Yeah but did you know that they weren't all like, lizardy, but covered in feathers". You might want to chuck in that chickens are basically dinosaurs, because their feet have a "Triassic Flange", a (made-up) term that will make you sound authoritative. If you really want to showcase your knowledge, though, you may want to mention that dinosaurs may have actually fought with large swords lodged between their teeth. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dinoblade">Dinoblade</a> demonstrates this! And no, they haven't discovered swords alongside dinosaur fossils yet because palaeontologists have been unlucky thus far. "Soon", you tell them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Jean Nguyen, a senior gameplay animator at Sucker Punch, started working on side project Dinoblade in 2023. And I am thankful, because it looks like a right laugh. Obviously, much of it is still a work in progress, but the premise is this: you are a dinosaur, you have a sword, and you must fight another dinosaur who also has a sword. But the fights don't look like when two giraffes fight, with necks and heads flailing at each other. Oh no. There's dodge-rolling, power slams, and blades that blast spectral missiles.</p>
<p>Much of the footage lies on Nguyen's Xwitter, which showcases little tangoes between dinos worked on by Nguyen himself, together with fellow animator Randy Nguyen and composer Samuele Vona. Have a gander at these:</p>

</span></p><p>It sort of reminds me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95Uu3enn-Ao">Mushiking: The King Of Beetles</a>, which was a Japanese arcade game I remember seeing a lot in Japanese arcades or department stores when I was a kid - if I recall correctly, there were even trading cards? Not that Mushiking is Soulsy like Dinoblade, being more of a rock-paper-scissors fighter, but I dunno. It's stirred up some memories of two beasties going at it, and that's nice.</p>

            <p>
We <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jusant-review">liked</a> Jusant, Don't Nod's clamber-upper masterpiece, and we also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-review">liked</a> Banishers, their colonial ghost-busting action-adventure, but it seems that not enough people did. The company have posted a profit warning, reflecting an 11% decline in operating revenue for the first half of 2024. They've also "paused" two unannounced games in development, and altered other unannounced games to be more appealing to a "wider audience". Beyond that, they're considering "all possible options regarding our roadmap", which sounds just a touch ominous.  
</p><!--more-->
<p>
 "Despite an excellent critical reception, Jusant and Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden unfortunately did not achieve the commercial results we had hoped for, resulting in a deterioration in our 2024 half-year results and leading us to consider all possible options regarding our roadmap," chairman and CEO Oskar Guilbert explains in <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-87839">a press release</a> published yesterday. He adds that Ghost Of New Eden and Jusant "performed well below expectations". They're expecting to make a loss for the first half of 2024 of around €1 million.
</p>
<p>
To compensate for this, Don't Nod are writing down the assets of Jusant and Banishers: Ghost of New Eden (i.e. lowering their value on company books, to match what the market says they're worth) and making some sweeping changes to their line-up of games in development. 
</p>
<p>
These include two unannounced in-house projects, codenamed P10 and P14, which are pencilled in for release before end of 2027. "In order to bolster sales potential and increase partnership opportunities with industry leaders, project design has been refocused to reach a wider audience, which involves scrapping certain developments (P10)", the press release notes. It's not wholly clear from the wording whether this means that P10 has been entirely cancelled.
</p>
<p>
They're also  "temporarily pausing two projects in the design phase in Paris", codenamed P12 and P13, for a write-down of €7.6 million. "This decision will enable us to prioritize resources and maximize the chances of success of the titles with the greatest potential at present," the press release adds.
</p>
<p>
Don't Nod's big hope right now is Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage from their Montreal team, which is being created by some of the people behind Life Is Strange. The press release hails the game's "particulary positive reception" from press - "I'm well up for this one," Alice0 (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-is-strange-studio-return-to-teen-mysteries-with-lost-records-bloom-rage">wrote back in December 2023</a> - but adds that "at the same time, discussions are continuing with industry leaders to secure economic benefits". Again, all rather open-ended.
</p>
<p>
These in-house games sit alongside two unspecified external publishing projects that are due for release in 2025. The press release doesn't mention whether Don't Nod are revising their approach to these projects as well.</p>
<p>If you are thinking "this seems like a lot of things in dev for a team with (reportedly as of 2022) 320 people on the books across two studios", then congratulations, you share the opinion of the French video game union workers who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-union-report-alleges-mismanagement-at-life-is-strange-developer-dont-nod">expressed misgivings about Don't Nod's management in February</a>. They painted the picture of a studio with "no long-term vision" for staff welfare, where deadlines change "frequently" and projects move in "contradictory" directions.
</p>
<p>While Jusant's fortunes are perhaps predictable, going by stereotypes about which games tend to be big hits, the underwhelming returns on Banishers are more worrisome. Don't Nod had it vaguely pegged as a spiritual follow-up to Vampyr, which remains their biggest seller for all its middling reviews, as Don’t Nod’s head of creative Phillipe Moreau <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-wants-to-be-a-thoughtful-blockbuster-on-a-budget">told me in December</a>. Still, there's a difference between "game that is popular" and "game that sells what the company in question needs it to sell".</p>
<p>As ever, best of luck to the rank-and-file developers caught up in these machinations.</p>

			<p>French game developer DON'T NOD reported its financial results for the first half of 2024, and the news is not good, as both Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden and Jusant have underperformed. Oskar Guilbert, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at DON'T NOD, said:</p>
<p><em>We are obviously disappointed by our recent performance in an extremely competitive and selective market. Despite an excellent critical reception, Jusant and Banishers: Ghosts of new Eden unfortunately did not achieve the commercial results we had hoped for, resulting in a deterioration in our 2024 half-year results and leading us to consider all possible options regarding our roadmap.</em></p>
<p>It's a damn shame. Both were great games, and I have particularly enjoyed Banishers, as explained in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nods-finest-action-game-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my review of the action RPG</a>:</p>
<p><em>There's little doubt Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden is Don't Nod's finest action game yet. I would also venture to say it's one of their best games, period, not to mention a great action RPG in its own right thanks to enjoyable combat, a big world with lots of content to explore and interesting stories to experience, and particularly for the amazing couple of lover protagonists.</em></p>
<p>The two games' underperformance forced DON'T NOD to partially write down their assets for €24 million and temporarily suspend two projects in the design phase in Paris (P12 and P13) for another €7.6 million write-down. The developer will focus on completing <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-interview-discussing-the-setting-inspirations-multiple-timelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>, the spiritual successor to Life is Strange. Moreover, it will support two external publishing projects due to launch next year.</p>
<p>DON'T NOD is also exploring other options to be implemented as soon as possible to secure its operations and enhance value creation. The purpose of this review is to give DON'T NOD the ability to compete more successfully in a constantly evolving industry, respond effectively to the expectations of players and partners, and continue to offer innovative, high-quality experiences.</p>
