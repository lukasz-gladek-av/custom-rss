            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-state-looks-fantastic-in-this-4k-gameplay-from-ces-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Turkish independent developer Motion Blur immediately caught our attention when they first <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-state-is-an-impressive-looking-single-player-third-person-shooter-with-strong-metal-gear-solid-vibes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed off</a> their upcoming Black State project last Summer. The third-person shooter puts a lot of emphasis on stealth and seems clearly inspired by KONAMI's legendary series Metal Gear Solid.</p>
<p>Black State was demonstrated once again at the recent CES 2025 in Las Vegas, where IGN <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeHqPHRAWR0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grabbed</a> around three and a half minutes of new footage in 4K resolution, and it looks glorious. The level of photorealism is incredible, especially for an indie studio. The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5, but interestingly, it won't leverage the built-in Lume and Nanite features as nearly all UE5 games do. Motion Blur has instead developed a 'special pipeline after a long R&amp;D process', which they promise will provide outstanding visuals and unbelievable optimization.</p>
<p><iframe title="Black State | CES 2025 4K Alpha Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XeHqPHRAWR0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Black State is already <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> as one of the games that will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation, which will allow for optimal performance on the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards.</p>
<p>In the game, the main character is summoned by a secret group of scientists called the Architects for a mysterious mission to save captives and uncover the truth behind a cataclysmic event. Players will be able to seamlessly move between levels without any loading screens. Motion Blur said these real-time transitions lead to different adventures, ensuring players never know which door opens to where, adding an element of thrill and danger.</p>
<p>Players will have a vast array of weapons and tactical gadgets at their disposal to succeed in a series of intense combat scenarios and stealth sequences, including guns (pistols, rifles, shotguns) and unique explosive devices. Just like in Metal Gear Solid, there will be close-quarter combat as well, with over a hundred cinematic kill moves implemented in the game. Players must be very careful, though, as they will face both elite human tactical forces and relentless robot-like killing machines. To top it all, Black State also includes several boss battles featuring unique patterns and mechanics to learn.</p>
<p>Black State doesn't have a release date yet, but we'll be sure to let you know when it does.</p>

            <p>There are currently 35 heroes in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, split between the roles of Vanguard (tanks), duellists (DPS) and Strategists (support). That's plenty to get your head around, and the roster is expanding rapidly. NetEase have announced that they plan to introduce a new hero approximately every six weeks - in other words, twice per three-month season. I wonder how long it'll take them to probe beyond the obvious Marvel headliners and start seriously abrading the bottom of the Connected Universe barrel. <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Nagneto_(Earth-14094)">Nagneto</a>, for example. Or how about J. Pennington Pennypacker, who shoots coins out of his wrists?</p><!--more-->
<p>All that's from an interview with the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/">Metro</a>, in which Guangyun Chen spills the beans on questions of hero design "Every season we'll be rolling out fresh seasonal stories, new maps, and new heroes," he said "We'll actually be breaking down each season into two halves. The length of one season is three months. And for each half of the season, we will introduce a new hero."</p>
<p>The just-launched Marvel Rivals Season 1 is seemingly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-patch-makes-hulk-less-hulky-hawkeye-less-shooty-and-the-goddess-of-death-deader-just-in-time-for-season-1">juicier than the norm</a>. It introduces several new heroes in the shape of the Fantastic Four, together with three new maps, a Doom Match game mode and some special events.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview with Metro, Chen expounds upon the game's competitive design. One detail that catches my eye is NetEase's decision not to enforce a role lock, which would ensure an even spread of Vanguards, Duellists and Strategists per team, but might also scare off the antisocial people who just want to play DPS. You know who you are.</p><p>"Yeah, so we totally get that the community is discussing role lock and role queue," said Chen, when asked whether NetEase would consider changing their stance here. "At its core, it's really about the game balance. So, what we want to offer is more line-up or more team comp possibilities through our hero design and our team-up mechanic. So, we'll be taking a little bit more of a Marvel-inspired approach.</p>
<p>"It's all about giving the players the freedom to experiment and find their unique strategies, as we've seen in many games and streams. Post-launch, people have been exploring an indefinite amount of team compositions, and we're excited about what's coming, we believe no role queue will lead to a richer gaming experience for everyone."</p>
<p>Strong early days of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> vibes here. I for one look forward to the spectacle of six Pennypackers kicking Iron Man's face in.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
You know when you drop your nice, shiny pen and it rolls under your bed, and you look under there and see it winking from the depths of a stygian expanse of superannuated dust bunnies, lakes of mildew and anomalous debris that absorbs far too much light? Just me? I need to get out the mould spray more often.
</p>
<p>
OK, how about when you were a kid and you lifted up a nice, round stone and the damp, fertile soil beneath writhed away from you in a fervent knotting of pellucid, boneless bodies and the tickling of a thousand little legs? Right. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anoxia-station">Anoxia Station</a> is that and also, a turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game about drilling for oil. The recently released <a href="https://abylight-studios.itch.io/anoxia-station">Itch.io demo</a> is rough around the edges, but I do adore the vibe.

<p>

In Anoxia Station you lead a huge, mobile rig into the depths of a dying world. In each chapter, you'll deploy your rig so that you can build resource-generating structures such as refineries and convertors, search for pools of petroleum on your radar, then either relocate to the area or expand in that direction. 
</p><p>
You'll also have to worry about keeping your workforce alive, happy and non-mutinous. This is difficult, because there is a lot down here that can either kill you or severely bum you out: heat, suffocation, radiation, earthquakes, marauding fungus, acts of human treachery, oh, and the insects. You'll definitely want to avoid the insects.</p>
<p>Right now, my proud rig the HMS Dork Fortress is nestling close to a clutch of eggs the size of sperm whales. I do not know what lurks in the eggs and I do not wish to find out. If anybody from my crew asks about them I will say that they are just really sticky rocks. I am also going to build a watchtower pronto, so that I can equip my crew with grenades.
</p>
<p>
Each semi-randomised tile-based level is a mass of unholy 2D art, viewed from a cramped, angled perspective. Buildings form shadowy huddles of pipes, windows and turbines, their fittings blurred by hanging mist and the insidious, queasy wobbling of the camera. The soundscape consists of machine tones, tectonic rumbles, and unidentifiable organic noises. Building anything here feels like a presumption, like you're inviting the darkness to take an interest.
</p>
<p>
Again, I adore the vibe. I'm less keen on the interface being made up of very small icons and text. It can be hard to find the necessaries, even given tutorial hints, and that's bothersome because each turn is on a timer. You can pause using F11, but you can't queue up orders while time is suspended. I'll probably acclimatise to the fiddly presentation, but it's going to be a pain if I have to manage any especially elaborate drilling operations. Right now, I'm only worrying about the tiles around my rig. Especially the one with the sticky rocks.
</p><p>
According to developer Yakov Butuzoff, Anoxia Station takes particular inspiration from Into The Breach, Polytopia, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>. They've written <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2924310/view/546723866324501263?l=english">a little Steam blog about the core mechanics</a>, putting an emphasis on random map generation and unpredictability: apparently, one of the key objectives is "to make sure something crazy happens every turn". The full game is out... at some point.

            <p>Rocksteady has released the final piece of content for its beleaguered live-service game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>.</p>
<p>Back in December, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deathstroke-kicks-off-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-announced-season">studio confirmed the fourth season would be the game's last</a>, and now its final chapter has been released. Season four, chapter eight went live last night, and in the process wrapped up the story of Harley Quinn and her fellow band of misfits as they sought to stop the conniving Brainiac from causing mishap here, there and everywhere.</p>
<p>It also gave players clarification on exactly what was going on with DC's heroes, such as Batman. <strong>Please be aware of spoilers for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League season four, episode eight below</strong>.</p>

</figure>
<p>The final chapter of the game closes with a 2D animated cinematic narrated by Harley Quinn, revealing that - shocker - those members of the Justice League that were popped off earlier in the game were in fact clones. So yes, the actual Batman is still alive and well. In fact, it is the caped crusader who delivers that final blow to Brainiac. The mini bombs that were implanted in the Suicide Squad's heads at the start of the game are then disabled, and Brainiac gets delivered to Waller.</p>
<p>However, many players are, alas, pretty disappointed by how the ending of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League ultimately played out.</p>
<p>"What was the point of the game if they are all alive," reads one comment on a video showcasing the final scenes. Another added: "Because of some small clues, the Justice League not actually being dead was teased since the launch of the game. However this still feels cheap as hell."</p><p>Some are more forgiving than others, though. "Honestly that's all I care about is seeing (Batman Alive)," one wrote. Another reasoned given some of the backlash Rocksteady faced early on in the game's life, bringing the Justice League back from the supposed dead was a good move.</p>

<p>While it won't be receiving any new content from here on, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will still remain playable in both online and the recently released offline mode, Rocksteady has said.</p>
<p>"All online features will continue to be available after Season 4, so players will still be able to enjoy co-op with friends, as well as all previous seasonal/episodic content. An offline mode will also be available as part of the Season 4 update, giving players the option to experience the main campaign and all seasonal story mission content without an internet connection," reads the season's <a href="https://dcgamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/36121518094995-SEASON-4-FAQ">FAQ page</a>. The developer added any remaining LutherCoin will "continue to be available after Season 4", while also confirming the in-game store will also continue to function.</p>

<p>Soon after release, Warner Bros.

Warner Bros. went on to attribute a $200m revenue loss to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. A report then followed, which stated a culture of perfectionism, an ill-suited genre pivot, and a constantly shifting vision were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">key reasons for the live-service game's failure</a>.</p>

            <p>NetEase has confirmed Marvel Rivals will receive a new hero every month and a half, but won't be adding enforced roles.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/">Metro</a>, game director Guangyun Chen was asked about the cadence of heroes joining the game.</p>
<p>"Every season we'll be rolling out fresh seasonal stories, new maps, and new heroes," said Chen. "We'll actually be breaking down each season into two halves. The length of one season is three months. And for each half of the season, we will introduce a new hero. We just eventually want to continue to enhance the experience, and, you know, keep everyone excited in our community."</p>

<p>Chen also discussed why the team has not included enforced role lock - setting a limit on what class types can be in a team, for a balanced spread of healers, tanks, attackers - which is something the community wishes to change.</p>
<p>It appears the team won't be altering this, but will instead provide new possibilities with the team-up mechanic.</p>
<p>"At its core, it's really about the game balance," said Chen. "So, what we want to offer is more line-up or more team comp possibilities through our hero design and our team-up mechanic. So, we'll be taking a little bit more of a Marvel-inspired approach.</p><p>"It's all about giving the players the freedom to experiment and find their unique strategies, as we've seen in many games and streams. Post-launch, people have been exploring an indefinite amount of team compositions, and we're excited about what's coming, we believe no role queue will lead to a richer gaming experience for everyone."</p>
<p>Game balance will also continue to be scrutinised. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-season-1-will-nerf-some-of-the-most-dominant-characters">Season One has brought a number of balance changes</a> to nerf some of the most popular characters, as NetEase has released a Hero Hot List to show the most frequently chosen heroes.</p>
<p>"After the launch, we've been keeping a close eye on the game's environment and balance," said Chen. "Moving forward, we will be looking at hero pick rates and win rates in different scenarios. Once we have some more detailed analysis and through thoughtful consideration, we'll definitely make necessary balances and adjustments.</p>
<p>"It's all about creating a good experience for our players. It hasn't been that long since our launch, so we're going to continue to monitor everything and make sure everything feels right."</p>
<p>The hero shooter's first season also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-update-kills-mods-removing-cheats-skins-and-19-inches-of-venom">briefly put an end to mods on PC</a>, to prevent custom skins, FPS boosts and potential cheats. However, modders quickly found a way to use them once again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Where to next for the Doom Slayer? Having battled against wave after wave of demonic invasion and delved through Hell to defeat even the Dark Lord himself by the end of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/doom-eternal">Doom Eternal</a>, there’s really only one place to go: back to the start. It’s time for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Doom: The Dark Ages might be a Bethesda game (and by that virtue a Microsoft and Xbox game), but it’s also a sign of the times within that company that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/doom-the-dark-ages-announced-with-a-gory-trailer-and-its-coming-to-ps5/">it is coming to PlayStation 5 as well as Xbox Series X|S and PC</a>. Of course, it’s also going to be day one in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a> as well.</p>
<p>We’re due a fresh look at the game next week as part of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/09/xbox-developer_direct-stream-will-feature-doom-the-dark-ages-more-on-23rd-january/">the 2025 Xbox Developer Direct stream</a>, but for now, here’s the announcement trailer from last year:</p>
<p><iframe title="DOOM: The Dark Ages | Official Trailer 1 (4K) | Coming 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4tk8lkmYGWQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Yup, this game is a prequel to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/05/16/doom-review/">Doom 2016 reboot</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/17/doom-eternal-review/">Doom Eternal</a>, nipping back in time to the last time that the Doom Slayer was out and about for some demon bashing. You’ll go thoroughly medieval on those demons, which will include a mix of very familiar foes from the series as well as some all-new enemies.</p>

<p>You’ll be just as powerful as in the last couple of Doom games, but the weaponry in your hand will be just a little bit different. Now you couldn’t do without a Super Shotgun, even if you’re this far back in time, but alongside that you’ll be able to whip out a Flail to knock some heads in, or rev up a throwable chainsaw shield, like it’s some kind of Captain America –&nbsp;Warhammer 40,000 crossover.</p>

<p>And lets add the Power Rangers into that mix as well? The Slayer will also be able to hop into the cockpit of his Atlan, a huge skyscaper-sized mech that will let you go toe-to-toe with kaiju-sized demons, and there’s also the Mecha Dragon complete with jet engines and a huge amount of weaponry for when you need to take to the skies.</p>
<p>I’m sure that id Software will be able to claim medieval mythology for these additions, with tales and Arthurian legends of dragon slaying and giants, but it’s given an over-the-top twist here.</p>

<p>On intriguing facet will be the direction that the latest iteration of idTech will take. After making various compromises through Doom 3, Quake 4 and Rage to meet the platforms of the day, while pioneering various ingenious graphical techniques through the end of John Carmack’s tenure at the studio, 2016’s Doom was a bit of a reset with the arrival of Tiago Sousa to lead development of the renderer –&nbsp;he had previously worked on CryEngine. While still looking fantastic, Doom really put performance first with 60fps achieved on PS4 and Xbox One to enable the ultra-slick FPS action.</p>
<p>But we’re now in an era of ray tracing, an especially costly technology in terms of performance that often relies on machine learning to upscale and enhance lower resolutions and fidelity. Doom Eternal was able to feed ray-tracing effects like flashy RT reflections when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/29/doom-eternal-free-ps5-upgrade-how-to-guide-xbox-series-xs-smart-delivery-update/">upgraded with PS5 and Xbox Series X|S support</a>, while MachineGames have just released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> with a customised version of idTech (branded Motor) that puts more focus on RT global illumination for consoles, but offers full path-tracing on PC. Which direction will Doom: The Dark Ages take? Well from the initial trailer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-doom-the-dark-ages-trailer-tech-analysis">ray-tracing is subtle at best in what it showed</a>, with a greater emphasis on ramping up volumetric effects and fine detail, but we’d trust id Software to strike the right balance between performance and visuals.</p>
<p>Not that you’ll really have a moment to take in those fine details when sprinting around and blasting enemies. We can’t wait!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-was-originally-going-to-have-much-more-gore-says-ex-employee/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you were hoping to find more gore when playing <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starfield</a>, it might be interesting to know that the game was originally going to feature much more of that. The systems were in place, at least, according to former Bethesda Game Studios Character Artist Dennis Mejillones. In an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebSmOGZnmeM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the YouTube channel KIWI TALKZ</a>, he explained the motive behind the cut was two-fold: technical and thematic.</p>
<p><em>The level of gore has a lot of implications with the different suits. From a technical perspective, there's a lot that has to go with it. You have to cut the helmet in a certain way and it's got to come off and you got to meet caps to the bottom where the flesh is. We had systems for all of that and it turned into a big rat's nest of all these things you have to count for now with all these crazy hoses </em><em>on the helmets and all that kind of stuff that we added. In Starfield, you can change your body size significantly. You</em><em> know, the character creator had evolved quite a bit, so I think that was part of it. The other thing is, like, Fallout is very stylized in that regard. It's meant to be part of the tongue-in-cheek humor. You know that perk, splatter mess, where you can make a mess out of something and it just blow up into goo? It's part of the fun. It's like those old-school animes, like Fist of the North Star; they punch each other, and gushes of blood come out. Nobody can hold that much blood, but you're like, that's cool. It adds to that style.</em></p>
<p><em>I think Starfield was definitely meant to be more low-fi and realistic. We were inspired a lot by things, The Expanse, Star Trek, stuff like that. So I think it just didn't fit thematically, and on top of that, you have the technical overhead cost to get that to work. So, we were kind of like, it's&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br>
<em>probably better not to include it in this game.</em></p>
<p>In the lengthy interview, Mejillones also shared his profound admiration for Todd Howard, whom he regards as a mentor. As for Starfield gore, if you're looking to add that kind of spice to your playthrough on PC, there's a neat new mod called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/12833?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gorefield</a> that was just updated today.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-can%E2%80%99t-rush-christmas.1082577/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-rumors-reveal<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo is perhaps just days from announcing a new video game console, and that has understandably got a lot of people excited. </p><p>For a while now--but it feels like things really got going in the last week or two--the more enthusiastic sections of video games and tech media have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/11/24341043/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-details-leaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been filling the quieter holiday news cycle with rumours, whispers and speculation</a> about new hardware. "Nintendo Switch 2 reveal imminent, reports suggest"<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> reads a Eurogamer headline</a>. "Nintendo Switch 2: everything we know about a potential Switch successor"<a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> is at the top of this Techradar story</a>. There was even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a frenzy over a third-party peripheral maker’s CES booth</a>.</p><p>This kind of fever pitch isn't new. As long as we've had the internet--<a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/54076/the-nintendo-revolution-and-why" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and especially dating back to the 2000s reveal of the Wii</a>--we've been inundated with rumours, guesses, mockups and hoaxes during the leadup for each successive Nintendo console, few if any of which proved to be even <em>remotely </em>accurate, or even if they were, actually meant anything. Doesn't matter! People <em>really </em>want to know what a new Nintendo machine is like, and when we’re going to see it for the first time, and if Nintendo isn’t forthcoming with that information then fans will gobble up whatever else is out there.&nbsp;</p><p>I understand the excitement; a Nintendo console announcement is a big deal, and we haven't had one for <em>eight years</em>. But the Switch 2 (or whatever it's called) will be announced...only when it's announced. Nintendo will show a video (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342802/get-ready-for-the-switch-2-announcement-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">or two</a>), unveil the machine, announce some games, maybe even some prices and release dates. Then it'll be a <em>thing </em>that we know about. Until that moment, despite everyone's excitement and enthusiasm, none of the guesses and rumours and reports mean much. They’re vapour, rumour, fragments of information mostly lacking in context.&nbsp;</p><p>You cannot rush Christmas. Christmas (if you celebrate it!) rules. You get cool stuff to play with, there's joy, you see people, it's great. Folks look forward to it all year long; it’s a very special day. But no matter how much I love Christmas, no matter how many rumours I could read about Santa leaving his workshop on December 3, no matter how many Photoshops I could see showing him climbing down chimneys on December 19, I cannot change that date, or its significance. The presents only get opened one day a year. Like other jolly old men with white beards, Santa will get here precisely when he means to. The calendar is immovable.</p><p>And so is Nintendo. So unless we find ourselves in the extremely unlikely event of a full leak ahead of time--images, specs, dates, the works--we can just relax! The Switch's successor is coming. One day hopefully soon, and when it arrives, you will know everything about it, see everything about it, and it will be a real, verifiable thing.</p><p>Until then, despite all the rumours and speculation flying around out there, you'll just need to wait a little bit longer. You've made it this far, you can make it another few–if reports are to be believed–days.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/diy-speaker-pioneer-dennis-murphy-andrew-jones"><h3>The Affordable Accuracy Monitor Is Everything That DIY Should Be</h3></a><p>Dennis Murphy's mod to the now-discontinued Andrew Jones Pioneer speakers are the perfect combination of price and performance.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The latest release from heralded indie developer Heart Machine entered early access on Steam today, January 14, so this is a pretty generous launch discount.</p><p dir="ltr">While purchasing Hyper Light Breaker through Fanatical gets you an official Steam key, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam is also offering a special launch deal</a> that bundles Hyper Light Breaker with a free copy of the first entry in the series, the Zelda-inspired action-adventure game Hyper Light Drifter, for $27 (was $30). Fanatical's Hyper Light Breaker launch deal does not include the bonus Hyper Light Drifter key, but it's worth considering if you want to save some cash on the new game--especially if you already own Hyper Light Drifter. </p><p dir="ltr">According to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyper-light-breaker-finally-launches-into-early-access-this-week-new-trailer-showcases-what-to-expect/1100-6528788/" data-ref-id="1100-6528788">early access launch trailer</a>, Hyper Light Breaker is a prequel set before the events of Drifter. Players take on the role of Breakers, who are elite warriors tasked with restoring civilization by exploring an ever-changing realm called The Overgrowth and defeating the evil Abyss King who controls it. Players team up in online co-op and head out in expeditions to explore, defeat bosses, and collect loot--then return to base to upgrade the settlement with the resources you acquired, gear up, and head back out to an all-new version of the Overgrowth.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4427649-hyperlightbreaker.png" data-ref-id="1300-4427649" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4427649-hyperlightbreaker.png" data-ref-id="1300-4427649"></a><figcaption>Hyper Light Breaker</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4427649-hyperlightbreaker.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Note that like all early access games, Hyper Light Breaker is not considered a finished game yet, and you're likely to encounter some bugs and performance issues if you dive in now.

Heart Machine is working to address performance issues and bugs as quickly as possible. AS of 5:30 PM PT, Hyper Light Breaker holds a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Mixed" review average on Steam</a> based on roughly 600 reviews.</p><p dir="ltr">The initial early access version only includes a portion of the planned final content, with more playable characters, bosses, equipment types, and other additional updates planned between now and the final launch. Hyper Light Drifter's Steam page says the early access period is planned to last around a year, but that is subject to change. </p><p dir="ltr">Between making Hyper Light Drifter and Breaker, Heart Machine also launched the 3D platformer Solar Ash. While the gameplay style differs from the Hyper Light series, Solar Ash shares many of the same aesthetic elements and is worth checking out to see what else the team has made.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-officially-ends-after-final-update-offline-mode-and-true-ending<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League just received its final update, which along with the promised offline mode, adds an official ending to the game's story that wraps everything up in a tidy, if rather uninteresting, way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously announced, Episode 8: Balance is the final update planned for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Alongside some new armore and exotic weapons, the biggest feature in the update is a new Offline Mode that will allow players to continue playing Suicide Squad Game by themselves without requiring an internet connection.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">As a reminder, Episode 8 will be the final update to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SuicideSquadGame?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#SuicideSquadGame</a>. The title will remain playable in both Online and the recently released Offline Mode for players to continue to wreak havoc in Metropolis 💥</p>— Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League (@suicidesquadRS) <a href="https://twitter.com/suicidesquadRS/status/1879238211643605436?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Offline Mode was announced in December 2023 as part of Rocksteady's post-launch plans, but the studio was also committed to releasing its promised DLCs and additional characters, leaving the Offline Mode for its final update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a big comic book ending to wrap up the story of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, <strong>so if you're okay with spoilers feel free to read below the break. You've been warned.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay so Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, as the name implies, is about taking out members of the Justice League who have been brainwashed by Brainiac. One of the biggest shocks in the game was when Harley Quinn <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kevin-conroys-batman-is-completely-wasted-in-suicide-squad">shoots Batman point blank in the head</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Batman was actually still alive. In his masterful gambit, he allowed Brainiac to create clones of the Justice League and then oversaw the events of the game from the shadows as he worked to take down Brainiac in secret.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The ending is told via the comic book illustrations that the different post-launch episodes have been presented in and in true comic book fashion, your favorite heroes are still all alive and the bad guys are defeated. Woo-hoo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this how Rocksteady envisioned the end of Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League? Who can say. The game released to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-worst-reviewed-games-of-2024">mixed reviews</a> and Warner Bros. said the game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms">fell short of expectations</a> when it came to sales, and the developers announced that it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-confirms-its-pulling-the-plug-on-new-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-content-after-season-4">ending future updates</a> on the game after Season 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can read our full review of Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League here and for anyone looking to play the game, the Offline Mode means you're able to fully. So if you see it on sale next time, don't worry about picking it up as the game will still run just fine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The series has been largely dormant since then, outside of a few Rival School character cameo appearances in other Capcom fighting games, which makes the new Complete Works artbook and Project Justice's inclusion in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-fighting-collection-2-launch-edition-includes-exclusive-comic-book/1100-6528240/" data-ref-id="1100-6528240">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a> later this year all the more exciting.</p><p>Speaking of which, preorders for the PS4 and Nintendo Switch physical editions of Capcom Fighting Collection 2 are <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZCRiN6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available now at Amazon</a> and include a limited-edition Capcom vs. SNK comic.

Along with hundreds of images, you’ll also get a detailed rundown of character profiles, world lore, and more. Considering the game has deep mythology to pull from, there should be plenty of incredible details packed between its covers. Wo Long was quite popular when it released in 2023--if you’re worried about the art book selling out, consider landing a preorder soon.

All of these earned positive reviews from readers, and The Art of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty should retain the brand’s high-quality publishing standards.</p><p>These previous volumes also make great companions for the upcoming book, and since many are currently on sale, they’re worth checking out ahead of The Art of Wo Long’s release in July.

            <p>
Following the launch of last year's well-received Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars remaster, developer Revolution Software has teased a similar "reforged" treatment for the beloved point-and-click adventure's 1997 sequel, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/broken-sword-2-smoking-mirror">Broken Sword 2: The Smoking Mirror</a>.
</p>
<p>
Last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged-gets-september-release-date">Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars Reforged</a> took the original 1996 series instalment - in which American tourist George Stobbart teams up with photo-journalist Nicole Collard to unearth a global conspiracy - and gently reinvigorated it with 4K backgrounds, re-animated sprites, enhanced audio, and more.
</p>
<p>
The end result - which released for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation last September (with a Switch version arriving a little later) - was positively received among fans, and Revolution has now hinted it's getting ready to give Broken Sword 2 a similar makeover.

<p>
As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/revolution-software-teases-development-of-broken-sword-2-the-smoking-mirror-reforged">GameWatcher</a>, Revolution Software boss (and Broken Sword designer) Charles Cecil ended the studio's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2nhvPuhXyc">recent Christmas recap video</a> by rifling through concept art created for Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars Reforged. However, one last drawing lurked at the end of the pile - this one featuring various designs for George Stobbart's shorts-and-sunglasses get-up, worn as he explores the Central American town of Quaramonte in Broken Sword 2.
</p>
<p>
At that point, Cecil offered a knowing shrug to the camera before the video cut to a lingering close-up of George's holiday gear, just in case it wasn't obvious enough the first time around.
</p>
<p>
A Reforged edition of Broken Sword 2: The Smoking Mirror would undoubtedly be warmly received by fans (especially as it's been fifteen years since the game's last remaster), but it's unclear when Revolution might get round to it. The studio is still hard at work on its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/broken-sword-parzivals-stone-is-a-new-entry-in-the-classic-point-and-click-adventure-series">previously announced sixth series entry</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/broken-sword-parzivals-stone">Broken Sword - Parzival's Stone</a>, which is currently expected to arrive next year. Hopefully it'll have more than a tease to share before too long.

The original Lunar: Silver Star Story is considered a landmark title in the Japanese RPG lineage and was one of the first console RPGs to feature voice acting, animated cutscenes, and CD-quality music thanks to its original platform, the Sega CD. It was later remade for PS1 and Sega Saturn as Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete, which is the version included in the Lunar Remastered Collection. Its sequel, Lunar 2: Eternal Blue, also launched on PS1 and Saturn and built upon the gameplay and story presentation of the first game, featuring even more voiced dialogue and a larger cast.</p><p dir="ltr">Voice acting, cutscenes, and high-quality soundtracks are now common elements of video games, they were groundbreaking at the time--though the voice performances and the localized English script are now notorious for their uneven quality. However, the new Remastered Collection includes all-new English text and voice acting for both games. While the new English voice tracks replace the originals, the Lunar Remastered collection includes the option to play with Japanese voice acting instead. You can also swap between the new enhanced visuals or the PS1 visuals for both games.</p><p>Lunar isn't the only classic RPG series getting long-awaited remasters this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/diy-speaker-pioneer-dennis-murphy-andrew-jones<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>Clear, inviting and precise for not a lot of money. The Affordable Accuracy Monitor is the perfect project.</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>The Affordable Accuracy Monitor is the ideal speaker mod. It takes a fairly decent, plentiful speaker that you can often find on fire sale at big box stores and turns it into something beautiful via some elbow grease, and not a lot of parts. Pioneer doesn’t make the original speaker used as a basis for the Affordable Accuracy Monitor speaker any more, in part because the ecosystem that allowed them to sell those speakers at that price has changed radically. But the Affordable Accuracy Monitors are still beautiful speakers, a mod designed by DIY legend Dennis Murphy. It’s an incredible mod to do if you happen upon those old Pioneers, and one that tells you a story larger than itself.</p><p>You often don’t get into DIY speakers to save money in much the same way that you don’t get into home brewing beer to save money. You can just buy good, accurate speakers now in the same sense that you can just buy good beer. In the case of both hobbies, you get into it because you want something, such as the sense of satisfaction that you have made something truly yours.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaker Designer Dennis Murphy got into DIY a long time ago because he was unsatisfied with what was currently on the market. “At the time, and it was a looooooooong time ago, companies like Acoustic Research, KLH, and JBL dominated the speaker market, and each brand had its own type of company sound, none of which were accurate,” Murphy told me, saying that companies did not optimize driver locations on the baffle to limit interaction effects. “The result was usually [a] highly colored sound that I, as a semi-professional violinist, found particularly annoying.”</p><figure><figcaption>There's a long history of DIY speaker building that goes back decades. Credit: Speaker Builder Magazine via worldradiohistory.com</figcaption></figure><p>Murphy dove headfirst into DIY, tearing through old issues of audio magazines like <a href="https://www.worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Audio/Speaker-Builder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaker Builder</a>, attempting to build kits but being largely unsatisfied. Towards the end of the 90s a few key things changed – measurement equipment and computer software became affordable to home hobbists and forum culture erupted. “The Internet made discussion groups such as the <a href="https://www.madisoundspeakerstore.com/index.php?p=home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madisound</a> Forum available, which greatly facilitated the exchange of ideas and product information.”&nbsp;</p><p>After winning a speaker designing contest sponsored by DIY component retailer Madisound, Murphy found himself designing crossovers – the circuit inside passive speakers that splits the audio signal between drivers like the tweeter (for high frequencies) and woofer (lower frequencies). These found their way into commercial products, the first being the <a href="https://www.salksound.com/model.php?model=Ellis%201801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ellis 180lb</a> for Dave Ellis. From there, Murphy moved on to designing speakers for Jim Salk. In 2012, he quit his full time job as an economist for the Federal Trade Commision to start a speaker building company – <a href="https://philharmonicaudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Philharmonic Audio</a>, named after the Washington Philharmonic Orchestra. “I was particularly interested in offering affordable speakers that excelled in reproducing the sound of a symphony orchestra faithfully and that were based on science rather than expensive gimmicks.”</p><figure><figcaption>Philharmonic Audio has many fans on forums like AVS Forum and Audio Science Review. Above: The True Mini, The BMR and the Ceramic Mini.</figcaption></figure><p>By all accounts Murphy has succeeded on that front. One needs only read any part of the (as of this writing) <a href="https://www.avsforum.com/threads/philharmonic-audio-dennis-murphy.1348949/page-1611?post_id=63776551#post-63776551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1611 page AVS Forum thread</a> dedicated to Murphy’s company, which Philharmonic Audio proudly links to. Both the BMR and the Ceramic Mini seem like well-loved and fantastic deals, with the latter being reviewed and measured quite favorably by Erin’s Audio Corner, a well-known audio YouTuber who I tend to trust in these matters. Importantly to me, Murphy is a forum guy through and through, responsive via email and who still posts on forums to this day.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Philharmonic Ceramic Mini Review (LIVE!)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/313qwtkdMxo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Erin's Audio Corner is a YouTuber that does extensive measurements on the speakers he reviews.

Back in 2012, speaker designer <a href="https://www.enjoythemusic.com/magazine/manufacture/0915/Andrew_Jones_Elac_Article.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Jones </a>designed a line of passive home theater speakers for Pioneer. An update to his previous model, the entire system was lauded by home audio enthusiasts for being an incredible value for the money, in particular tiny bookshelf speakers the Pioneer SP-BS22-LR. They retailed for <a href="https://www.stereophile.com/content/pioneer-sp-bs22-lr-loudspeaker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about $130</a> and sold like hotcakes, often being put on clearance at Best Buy for as low as $60.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Andrew Jones SP-BS22LR Bookshelf Speakers" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QAlbYA-iFic?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Andrew Jones, showing off the Pioneer SP-BS22LRs. Jones would move on to ELAC and MoFI later on in his career. </figcaption></figure></div><p>“The Andrew Jones family of Pioneer speakers made quite a splash when they were introduced around 2012,” Murphy told me via email. “Several of my audio friends wrote to me raving about how high [quality] the cabinet and sound was for such affordable speakers.” Unable to resist, Murphy would soon order the line and get to work attempting to tweak the imperfections in the speaker.</p><p>“Although I thought the bass response was impressive (particularly for the monitor), the lower treble and upper midrange sounded murky.” After some attempts to design the crossover, Murphy realized the issue was an intrinsic flaw in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveguide#:~:text=A%20waveguide%20is%20a%20structure,than%20light%20like%20radio%20waves." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waveguide</a> in the tweeter (which handles high frequencies). He swapped it out with an inexpensive but good Vifa dome tweeter. “Once I had redesigned the crossover to optimize the response for the new tweeter, the problem was gone and the overall sound was the best I had heard in an entry-level speaker,” Murphy recalled. The Affordable Accuracy Monitor was born.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The Pioneer SP-BS22-LR made waves when it first hit the scene, and you can still find them on secondary markets from time to time. Credit: Pioneer.</figcaption></figure><p>Dennis started selling this mod. He would seek out the Pioneer bookshelves whenever they went on clearance, putting in $86 worth of parts and selling them for close to the original MSRP of the unmodified speakers. It was an incredible deal, one that I cannot imagine was terribly profitable for the amount of time and care that Murphy put into them. By 2015, Pioneer had stopped producing the line, and Jones eventually moved on to ELAC, where he made a splash once again with the Debut series before moving on to a different company.</p><p>Murphy went on to revise the mod a few times based on the <a href="https://www.parts-express.com/Dayton-Audio-BR-1-6-1-2-2-Way-Bookshelf-Monitor-Speaker-Kit-300-640?quantity=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BR-1</a> kit from Parts Express, dubbing it the “Affordable Accuracy Plus.” “I finally came to my senses about a year ago and retired the Affordable Accuracy kits for good,”&nbsp; Murphy told me. Meanwhile, he put the design for the original Affordable Accuracy Monitor into the public domain, allowing anyone to tweak the old Pioneers if they happened to find them. That’s exactly what I set out to do.</p><p><strong>MDF, Glue, and the perfect entry level speaker.</strong></p><p>I’ve wanted to create Affordable Accuracy Monitors for several years now. I was originally inspired by a <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/affordable-accuracy-monitor-review.13624/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glowing review</a> on the Audio Science Review forum in 2020, and this urge was reinforced by seeing stock Pioneers used on secondary markets for cheap. I was not seeking my endgame speaker. I needed to know how much speaker you could get from modding a used speaker with less than a hundred dollars worth of parts.</p><figure><a href="https://audiokarma.org/forums/index.php?threads/dennis-murphy-pioneer-sp-bs22-lr-diy-modifications.610820/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><figcaption>All the parts needed for the Affordable Accuracy Mod, by way of the very helpful tutorial on Audiokarma. Credit: MCM_Fan.</figcaption></figure><p>I snagged two bookshelves and a center channel from a guy on Facebook Marketplace who was upgrading his system. Murphy had briefly offered a matching center using the <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/pioneer-sp-c22-review-center-speaker.33717/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SP-C22</a>, although the mod is far less documented than the bookshelves. I ordered a handful of parts off of Parts Express and Digikey since the Vifa tweeter appeared to only be in stock at the latter.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Taking apart a perfectly fine Pioneer for the sake of journalism.</figcaption></figure><p>The Affordable Accuracy Monitor mod (<a href="https://audiokarma.org/forums/index.php?threads/dennis-murphy-pioneer-sp-bs22-lr-diy-modifications.610820/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed instructions can be found here</a>) does several key things. First, it improves the internal reflections of the speaker by adding deadening material inside the bottom half of the cabinet. The stock speaker already has some inexpensive polyfill material, which the mod reuses. Second, the stock tweeter is swapped out for the Vifa tweeter, although the rubber gasket in the back of the original is retained. This is by far the most annoying part of doing this mod, as it requires you to remove the gasket carefully using a single-sided razor blade or an exacto knife. In addition, the hole for the tweeter must be enlarged with a small notch to account for the slightly different dimensions of the new tweeter. This is done with either a rotary tool like a dremel or a file.&nbsp;</p><p>From there, the meat of the mod happens: modding the crossover. The stock crossover of the SP-BS22-LR is comically simple, with a handful of parts like resistors and capacitors and a single air core on a double-sided PCB. The crossover is removed from the cabinet, and a handful of the parts are desoldered from the board. Some are harvested to build the new crossover, and a few are left on there, while the air coil is removed completely. The genius of the mod is that it reuses the existing parts to make the new crossover, thus reducing the cost to the user. The one downside of this is that, in addition to being soldered on, the parts are also glued to the board. This means that solvent or light heat must be used to loosen and remove the glue, because it will gum up your soldering iron.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Drilling holes in ancient Radio Shack boards at the precise location.</figcaption></figure><p>From there, you need to build the other half of the crossover. This involves using a <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Using-Perfboard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perf board</a>, an adaptable off-the-shelf circuit board meant for tinkerers. This mod is old enough that it was designed based on a Radio Shack 276-168 PC Board, which they don’t make anymore because Radio Shack really doesn’t exist in the same capacity now. Someone actually made<a href="https://hackaday.io/project/165498-classic-radioshack-protoboards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> exact replicas of these a few years back,</a> since they are often referenced in books going back decades, and Adafruit makes a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perma-Porta</a> replacement that is somewhat similar. I opted to pay for a deadstock Radio Shack board out of a sense of nostalgia.</p><figure><figcaption>The components for the new half of the crossover laid out for demonstration purposes. </figcaption></figure><p>From here, you have to solder the correct components and wires to the board to create the required circuit. Holes have to be drilled into the perf board at specific locations to not only mount the crossover, but provide spaces for zip ties to go to secure the heavy copper air cores to the board. Once this is done, the original PCB and the new one are sandwiched and soldered together, separated by nylon spacers. The parts are gluegunned to the board to make them more stable, the wires are reconnected at the right points, and the new board is screwed together. The drivers and crossover are returned to the newly padded cabinet with more durable wood screws. Everything else is tightened up and connected. Repeat this process for the number of speakers you are making.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Though it is easier to do this process to two speakers at once, I did one speaker first to get a good sense of how different a change the mod made. After I finished one, I connected both the unmodified Pioneer and the completed Affordable Accuracy Monitor to a cheap but solid amplifier. I listen to both – first one at a time and then together. The result was dramatic, and even my girlfriend who isn’t a dweeb like me about this stuff could pinpoint the difference immediately. The ugliness of the stock tweeter was laid bare as being shrill and fatiguing. Meanwhile, the completed speaker had a character of its own: smooth and effortless without sacrificing detail. It was not the best speaker I had heard in my life, but it reached far beyond its humble part list.</p><p>With a new rush of excitement, I quickly got to work the next day finishing the mod on the other speaker, a faster process because I knew exactly what I needed to do. By evening I had two Affordable Accuracy Monitors in front of me on a table, plugged into my little cheapo amp. I played some music, and what I heard made my jaw drop. These things were fantastic. Though they were small and needed a subwoofer to really open up, everything in the mids and highs sparkled. The tracks that complemented them sounded clean and vivid, playing with a shocking clarity. I was overcome with pure joy and I could have sat at that small table listening for hours and hours if it wasn’t so late.&nbsp;</p></div><figure><figcaption>Left: One speaker completed.  Right: Both completed.</figcaption></figure><p>I had found what DIY speaker builders so often seek, a sense of fulfillment at having built something special. It’s not just that the speakers sounded good, there is no shortage of great-sounding audiophile equipment. I was not just hearing music, but also my labor and the skills I had learned. I had made something, or at least half of something, that was precious to me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Affordable Accuracy Monitor Is Dead</strong></p><p>We can learn a lot about DIY from the Affordable Accuracy Monitor, but it is worth noting that it existed in a singular moment in time. The conditions that created it were ideal – a shockingly good passive speaker sold at high enough volume to go on sale frequently coupled with a particularly talented designer digging inside it to make it sing. But several parts of that equation have changed. The market segment that the Pioneers occupied is now full of sound bars and active speakers. “There will almost certainly be an increasing emphasis on active designs with built-in dsp and room correction,” Murphy told me.</p><p>The passive speakers on the market that remain are finely tuned and the value proposition of upgrading them instead of buying a slightly better speaker is often questionable. There are tons of good speakers out there without much tinkering, like the ELAC’s debut line — in some ways the natural successor of the Pioneer line.</p><figure><figcaption>I've heard seen solid reviews of the ELAC DEBUT DB63s, but I have not had a chance to test them out myself. Credit: ELAC.</figcaption></figure><p>“I don't see a bright future for DIY as a means of achieving greater bang for the buck,” Murphy told me. “More and more brand-name manufacturers are outsourcing cabinet construction to Asia and are designing speakers that follow the teachings of <a href="https://www.crutchfield.com/S-Ctoc1PFcdLd/learn/crutchfield-visits-harman.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harman research</a>. The result is a greatly increasing supply of high-value commercial offerings.”</p><p>There will always be people messing around with MDF, wires and glue in search of something special, there’s plenty of examples on <a href="https://m.facebook.com/groups/DIYLoudspeakerProjecPad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook groups</a> or forums like <a href="http://diyaudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DIYaudio</a>. And it’s worth mentioning some truly great, affordable designs in DIY in the last few years, including a speaker mod to a <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/hivi-3-1a-diy-speaker-with-sehlin-mod-review.15802/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">popular kit by Swan</a> by a designer named <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sehlin-sound-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scott Sehlin</a> and the fantastic open source <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/mechano23-open-source-diy-speaker-review.54066/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mechano23</a> by XMechanik. But few will rival the combination of price, convenience and performance that those modded Pioneers offered. If you happen upon them at a garage sale, consider picking them up if the price is right. You may find modding them to be as enriching and rewarding as I did.</p><figure><figcaption>The Mechano32 by XMechanik is an open source design that has reliably tested well. They also developed the <a href="https://xmachina-ai.blogspot.com/p/xmachina-is-passive-crossover-planning.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XMachina passive crossover designer</a> software that's free to use.</figcaption></figure><p>The Affordable Accuracy Monitor is dead, but I hope its memory lives on as a perfect example of what DIY can be.

            <p>
Somewhat unbelievably, this February marks <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> series' 25th anniversary - that's a whole two and a half decades of "yibs", "neibs", and mysterious "incidents" involving suddenly ladder-less swimming pools - and EA is celebrating the occasion with a whole bunch of activities, including free updates, limited-time events, paid DLC, and more.
</p>
<p>
The Sims' quarter anniversary celebrations officially begin on 4th February, with a "huge" free <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> update introducing over 70+ new items spanning both Create a Sim and Build Buy modes. There's talk of turtlenecks and bodysuits, bike shorts, accessories, and hairdos. New furnishings, meanwhile, include "stylish" windows and doors, wood finishes for kitchen cabinets, and even a new playground pirate ship for the young 'uns.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, 4th February sees the launch of The Sims 4's new limited-time Blast from the Past event, presenting players will four weeks of challenges unlocking "iconic items from the 2000s", including a milk carton, telephone, alarm clock, birthday cake, and inflatable chairs. The Sims FreePlay is getting a similarly themed event on mobile, then, to wrap up the series' 4th February festivities, EA is hosting a 25-hour livestream from 10pm GMT. This'll feature Simmers and other special guests for a nostalgic look at The Sims' impact over the years.

<p>
That's not everything within The Sims' 25th anniversary orbit, however. Hurtling forward to 18th March, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-looks-like-2007s-surprisingly-alright-the-sims-spin-off-mysims-is-heading-to-switch">recently released MySims: Cozy Bundle</a> - which contains beloved Wii series spin-offs MySims and MySims Kingdom - is making the jump from Switch to PC. And before that, there's another free update out today.
</p><p>
This one introduces a number of new features previously playtested as part of EA's relatively recent The Sims Labs initiative. There's a new main menu, for instance, putting your currently in-use Sims family front and centre, and all townie houses in Willow Creek and Oasis Springs - including those belonging to the Pancakes, Goths, Calientes, Landgraabs, and BFFs - have been rebuilt and renovated using some of the items added to the base game over the years. Full details of these latest improvements can be <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-1-14-2025">found in EA's patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Sims 4's latest update arrives ahead of three new paid Kit DLC packs, launching this Thursday, 16th February. There's the Secret Sanctuary Kit, providing a range of items players can use to build a "luxurious space tucked behind a secret passage in a bookcase", while the Casanova Cave Kit promises items Sims can use to "entertain and make an impression". Lastly, there's the Comfy Gamer Kit, incorporating items themed around creating a "warm, inviting gaming room with personal touches".
</p>
<p>
EA says two additional kits are due this month, with more coming "later this year" - and further information on all the above is included in its <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/news/behind-the-sims-episode-4?isLocalized=true">25th anniversary news post</a>.

			<p>Data mining may have leaked the Nintendo Switch 2's computing power in teraflops. <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-3950#post-1544590" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Famiboards user Zachy</a>, the undocked or handheld mode will have a GPU clock speed of 561 MHz, translating into 1.71 TFLOPS. In docked mode, the GPU clock speed nearly doubles at 1000 Mhz, translating to around 3.1 TFLOPS.</p>
<p>That's one-fourth of the 12 TFLOPS of the GeForce RTX 3060 GPU, which launched in 2021. However, the RTX 3060 is a desktop GPU, so it's not an apples-to-apples comparison. A better comparison is Microsoft's Xbox Series S console. It has been said that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dynamic-ai-upscaling-ports-xbox-series-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less powerful than the Xbox Series S</a>, and indeed, the leaked TFLOPS data supports that theory since the Series S has 4 TFLOPS of computing power. That's not a big difference, though, and third-party game developers will undoubtedly use their Xbox Series S configurations as starting targets for their ports to the new Nintendo console.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2, powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-pro-successor-rumored-nvidia-tegra239-soc-confirmed-to-be-real-to-feature-8-core-cpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA's Tegra 239 SoC&nbsp;</a>(featuring an eight-core CPU and an Ampere-based GPU with 2048 CUDA cores), does have an advantage over the Xbox Series S: its reported native support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction technology. While the latter may not prove to be very useful as developers wouldn't want to spend the meager GPU power on ray tracing effects, DLSS SR will indeed be invaluable to uplift the performance to acceptable standards.</p>
<p>New leaks and rumors about the new Nintendo console pop up nearly daily at this point. The Japanese game developer and console manufacturer has promised it will unveil the hardware (which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to include backward compatibility with existing Switch games, providing immediate access to a very large library) before the end of March, which is when Nintendo's fiscal year ends.</p>

Diamond Comic Distributors, the parent company of Alliance Game Distributors, filed for bankruptcy. This may impact the future of physical tabletop game supply.</p>

<h2>The Alliance Game Distributors Bankruptcy Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official <a href="https://diamondcomics.com/Article/279611-Diamond-Comic-Distributors-Files-Voluntary-Petition-for-Relief-Under-Chapter-11" rel="nofollow">press release</a> on their website, Diamond Comic Distributors has filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code.</p>

This money will go towards operating expenses and working capital to meet obligations with various associates and suppliers. This means this filing shouldn't affect any pre-existing shipping agreements they've had with distributors.</p>

<p>In addition, the report mentions a bid to purchase Alliance Game Distributors, a $39 million stalking horse bet by Canadian shipping company Universal Distribution. Alongside this bid is a signed non-binding letter by the company of intent to purchase Diamond UK. Naturally, this deal isn't set in stone, another company can up the bid, but $39 million is the current floor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Universal Distribution is looking forward to working with the Alliance and Diamond UK teams to bring a stronger balance sheet and growth opportunities to retailers and suppliers. Both companies have deep roots in the industry, and we look forward to continuing that into the future,” said Angelo Exarhakos, President and CEO of Universal.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is major since Alliance Game Distributors is one of the tentpole distribution companies in the tabletop industry. Providing over 250 vendors board games, miniatures, TTRPGs, and gaming accessories worldwide. The company even published a tabletop consumer guide, Game Trade Magazine.</p>

<p>Alliance Game Distributors isn't the only one of Diamond's businesses up for sale. Other units up for sale are Diamond Book Distributors, Collectible Grading Authority, DIamond Select Toys, and the company's main toy, comic book, and collectible distribution lines.</p>

<p>If the purchase of Alliance Game Distributors goes through, Universal may be primed to be a new big name within the tabletop industry.</p>

Hunters can use the Portable BBQ Grill to cook up a meal with their Palico, wherever and whenever out in the fields. Once it's ready, you can scarf down some hot and fresh meat. Seeing this gives the powerful sense that the hunter, which is to say the player controlling that hunter, is really living within the world of the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Depicting the act of eating, a central part of life, is more important than anything when giving a sense of reality to the ecosystems of these monsters and the world that they share with hunters. That belief has been also held by the development team ever since the very first Monster Hunter.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">First we dine</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Kaname Fujioka, Executive Director and Art Director for Wilds as well as the Director of the first Monster Hunter game, tells IGN: "Ever since the first Monster Hunter, we've put a ton of focus in our designs on what it means to live in its world. Even the monsters drink water, and they hunt prey to eat. Humans also feel hungry if they move around a lot, and they get sleepy if they're tired. We thought that maybe we could make a game that makes you feel like you're living in it if we did a good job of incorporating these elements based on real-life senses."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Food remains as important as ever in the newest installment in the series.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The concept goes that being able to eat a delicious piece of meat when you're hungry makes you happy. And if that piece of meat is gigantic, you feel all the happier. The element of eating in the series, something so filled with primitive desires, became a part of the gameplay as time went on, buffing a hunter's stats.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Tokuda likes meat, so meat plays a pretty central role in any titles he's involved in, says Fujioka, referring to Wilds Director Yuya Tokuda. “We put fruit and vegetables on the menu as well in the past, but it's become pretty meat-centric ever since Monster Hunter: World." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You just want to feel stronger before you go hunting, right?” adds Tokuda. “I thought it'd be intuitive to eat meat and become stronger.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Tokuda says he has absolute confidence in Fujioka's guidance as someone who has been involved in the series from the start, it seems that at times, he'll sometimes advise him when it comes to meat. "It might be more exciting if you made that meat a little bigger..." and so on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are of course difficult elements when it comes to depicting eating in a game, but Fujioka, as the game’s Art Director, says he creates graphics that are entirely focused on what looks delicious. If a piece of food shows up in Monster Hunter that makes players think it must taste good, you can be sure that the development staff has already felt the same way. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The art director says he creates graphics that are entirely focused on what looks delicious.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"Something isn't necessarily going to look delicious just because it's realistic,” he says. “We have to think quite a lot about what kind of depictions we need to use to make it look tasty. We have paid close attention to lighting and effects in particular since World, and we may exaggerate the food's appearance too."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, during the November 2024 open beta test of Wilds, so many food videos flooded social media that they even reached demographics who don't normally play Monster Hunter. The sound of sizzling fat and the golden shine of honey dripping on top of cabbage were filled with detail that would make anyone's mouth water. Was that delicious-looking meat and cabbage based on real footage of something actually cooked by the development team?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"While I'm not aware of the fine details, we don't cook dishes for real and use them as-is as models,” says Fujioka. “Simply recreating something that exists in reality wouldn't actually look that tasty when placed inside a game. We do of course create high-resolution meat textures and so on, but what we want to focus on in the end is how we depict it, which means essentially creating it from scratch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In that sense, it seems that creating tasty depictions of vegetables, like those similar to cabbage in the game, was far more difficult than with meat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After a great deal of research, we created an exaggerated depiction where the cabbage puffs up for a moment when the skillet's lid is popped open in-game,” says Fujioka. “That doesn't happen in real life, and while it is a small detail, that feeling of it expanding makes it look incredibly delicious."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, it may be a lie if you're comparing it to a real-life depiction. But as an artistic expression, it just looks so delicious. Fujioka and the development team studied every depiction of food that they could, from how food scenes are exaggerated in anime to the lighting used when food is shot for commercials.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Depicting eggs is incredibly difficult too,” he says. “Creating the feeling of the white being cut from a dripping soft-boiled egg was so hard, but our designers drew on all their knowledge to make it work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fujioka continues, "My ambition is for Tokuda to hopefully see something aside from meat as delicious. That's why the staff making the food models also say they get hungrier and hungrier as the game nears completion. We've prepared quite a lot of different dishes this time as well, so I hope players enjoy each and every one."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The unique food system in Wilds</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In Wilds, a game where the situation in the field changes in real-time, the buffs and enhancements provided by food have gone from being quest-based to time-based. Hunters also no longer eat inside a canteen run by Felynes, but rather inside camps or with the Portable BBQ Grill set up on their own, allowing them to now prepare a meal whenever and wherever. This change apparently is the result of changes to Wilds' gameplay loop.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The buffs and enhancements provided by food have gone from being quest-based to time-based.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"In World and the games before that, lots of different elements were decided based on your quest, so you would eat an appropriate meal before you went on one,” says Tokuda. “Since this game focuses more on a seamless experience, hunters will have time to freely play around in all kinds of different ways, especially after completing a quest. As players choose one target to hunt after the next on a seamless map, we decided that food should be time-based, not quest-based. When doing this, we considered amounts of time that would keep it from feeling too much like a chore while also tuning it to seem realistic."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hunters will receive rations from the Felyne at the Ingredient Center found in the base camp, then use them to make food in the field. Tokuda explains that if you have rations, you can use them as meat, fish or even vegetables. "If we separated them into items like vegetables, meat and fish, we wouldn't be able to avoid tendencies toward one or the other, so you could end up with something like too many vegetables,” he says. “That's why we've made it so that you can use rations as meat, vegetables or fish so that there's no waste and players can choose according to their preferences."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dishes made by hunters use both main ingredients based on the rations provided by the aforementioned Felyne as well as spices and other additional ingredients. These can, for the most part, be acquired while in the field. Meanwhile, it's interesting that the rations delivered by Felynes to the hunter's base is differentiated by having a long shelf life, like smoked meat or pre-cleaned fish. In the cutscene where Quematrice is encountered, you can even see Felynes who refuse to let go of their meat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We ask Fujioka if Felynes are natural-born cooks. "They cook food in the canteen because they're creatures with an incredible sense of curiosity, and because they become so engrossed in their interests, absorbing so much about them,” he replies. “While some Felynes may follow the path of cuisine, others may look up to hunters and pursue the path of supporting them. I think they're a species where you can still see that strongly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After hearing all this talk about the effort the team has put into food, a long-held question pops into my head. In Monster Hunter, you hunt herbivorous monsters, get their raw meat, and cook it until it's well-done. But do they have any plans to ever let us hunt a large carnivorous monster for its meat to eat? Or is using large monsters as ingredients not a part of the food culture in the world of the series?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"It comes up during the planning stages of every game,” replies Tokuda. “We talk about how it'd be interesting to hunt a monster and also get an ingredient of sorts as a bonus, but the world is already full of so many attractive ingredients that it makes us wonder if you'd really go so far as to make a meal out of portions of a monster that can be used as valuable materials (for equipment). It's possible that if you could get all the food you need from large monsters, and if that food had incredibly powerful effects, there would be no need for anything else, making the game's loop less attractive. That's why we discard the idea. We are trying a lot of different things, though, like Motley Mixes in World would let you hand over extra monster tails to get well-done steaks and other special items." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mr. Fujioka adds to this, saying, "In the game's lore, at least, there are legendary chefs of a sort. We haven't depicted them yet, but there should of course be some people in its world who pursue that kind of field."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Cultural connection of cuisine</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the food that you can make inside a pop-up camp, there are dishes you can find in villages you visit all around Wilds. Tokuda explains that food in the game belongs to two major categories: camping meals and village feasts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We wanted to design the game in a way that you could keep on playing it without interruption within an environment that continues to change in real time,” he says, comparing the meals you can create yourself with portable ingredients and the sumptuous feasts you can eat when invited to a village. “That's why we decided to add a feature where hunters could prepare very simple meals from an early stage. In contrast to that, we also looked into a way to add meals that let players understand the relationships between people and local food cultures. We thought of a kind of meal that could only be possible now that the game loop is based on time and not quests, as well as one that provides different in-game benefits." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Interacting with the different species that live in the Forbidden Lands and coming to understand one another is an important part of the game's world and its story to us,” adds Fujioka. “We're putting a ton of work into depicting those interactions."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you progress through the story in the Windward Plains, your hunter will be invited to a meal in the village of Kunafa, where those who live in the desert reside. These villagers who know nothing of hunting and haven't even seen weapons before treat you to a dish that resembles a freshly baked cheese naan. As you bite into its crispy surface with charred spots, both steam and melted cheese come pouring out. The meal is an unbelievable feast for a hunter from the outside world, making it a scene that shows just how much you're welcomed by these villagers.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As you bite into its crispy surface with charred spots, both steam and melted cheese come pouring out.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers filled this short yet memorable food scene with attention to detail, as close care is paid to how it helps form the game's world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We spent quite a lot of time coming up with what those villagers eat,” Fujioka explains. “Since they aren't a hunting people, what could they normally be eating? When we thought about how they get animal-based nutrients, we decided that they must raise livestock and eat dairy-based foods. You're able to get a grain similar to wheat when you go out to a more wide-open part of the map, right? So maybe they make something like naan using that grain. On top of that, we wanted it to be something made from simple ingredients, and not too complicated. We thought that a dish like cheese naan would be simple yet possible to depict in a delicious way, and so we put a good amount of effort into that." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So while it may appear to be a casual dining scene, it seems that a lot of labor went into showing this dish similar to one that exists in real life, cheese naan, in a delicious and meaningful way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's actually incredibly difficult to depict something that's crispy on the surface but springy on the inside using CG,” says Fujioka. “We'd been making attempts at the food scene in Kunafa from early on in development, even at the prototype stage, and we just couldn't get it to look the way we wanted. Still, the Wilds development team is incredibly talented, and I was shocked to see them ultimately reach the way it looks in the released version after a lot of trial and error. It really does look tasty..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Serious motion capture technology was used in the development of Wilds, and it seems that this change in the development environment helped broaden the range of expression when it comes to the game's food.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"While we of course wanted to focus on the food itself, we also wanted to put effort into depicting the way someone eats and their expression as they do so, which is why we used facial capture and other technologies as well,” says Fujioka. “It's not as if we used all of the data we filmed, but we did have actors eat actual food like bread during motion capture sessions. It's not easy to rely on your imagination alone to come up with the expression of someone who just finished eating or someone savoring the aroma of food through their nostrils. We had the actors think about these details as they performed in our attempt to depict everything, even the act of eating, as delicious."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We did have actors eat actual food like bread during motion capture sessions.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">These thoroughly created food scenes do add a dramatic effect to the Wilds experience. Hunters can see just how much the villagers care as they show you incredible hospitality, sensing the way they live in the unknown Forbidden Lands while also feeling as though you've become a part of the land despite being a foreigner. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You can continue to deepen your relationships with people in settlements even after you've completed the main story,” adds Tokuda. “Being offered food by them isn't a one-time thing, and they'll come to invite you to eat every now and then. Accepting these invitations will provide you with powerful food buffs that last for a long time, so even from a gameplay perspective, you'll receive more frequent offers by creating stronger bonds with villages. Also, while it is possible for you to gather local ingredients yourself, trading with locals can allow you to get lots of cheese. We've intentionally designed the game so that changes in your relationships that take place through food help deepen the world."  </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">IGN First Monster Hunter Wilds Oilwell Basin Artwork</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">By the way, the game has settlements aside from the one in the Windward Plains, and Tokuda says that they will treat you to food as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are villages in lots of different areas this time around where locals live their lives,” he says. “Each of those peoples eat different things, and there are rather unique monsters in Oilwell Basin. The dishes made with those monsters are pretty novel, so we hope you'll see them for yourself and be surprised."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even after hearing all of this about food and eating, I still find myself with one question. In that case, is there nothing like a canteen where Felynes show off their culinary skills in this game? Not being able to stop by a place where Felynes enjoy serving you food so much would feel a little sad. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Monster Hunter Wilds Screenshots - State of Play September 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When I ask this, Tokuda replies, "You're right about that. We are aware that this may weaken the sense of everyone gathering together, exchanging vouchers for food, and enjoying a meal as a means of communication, that players have experienced in the past. I hope you'll wait for further information when it comes to that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>For more on Monster Hunter Wilds, check out our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-exclusive-oilwell-basin-ajarakan-and-rompopolo-gameplay-ign-first"><em>exclusive 4K gameplay videos</em></a><em> battling Ajarakan and Rompopolo in the new Oilwell Basin area, and our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/evolving-monster-hunter-how-capcoms-belief-in-the-series-made-it-a-worldwide-hit-ign-first"><em>interview with the development team</em></a><em> on how Monster Hunter has evolved over the years.

                <p dir="ltr">The Sims 25th anniversary is next month, and as expected, EA has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-25th-anniversary-celebration-features-free-content-in-game-events-and-a-25-hour-stream/1100-6528814/">loads of activities, updates</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-three-new-sims-4-content-kits-including-one-made-with-lilsimsies-help/1100-6528807/">new content</a> planned for the celebration. But one thing players weren't expecting was the surprise update EA just launched for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-3/">The Sims 3</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The new update simply fixes an issue that made newer Intel CPUs unable to run The Sims 3, allowing the game to be run on modern machines more easily. Although EA hasn't made a public statement regarding the update, some players are hoping this could mean more updates for The Sims 3 are on the way.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether that's the case or not is hard to say. After all, EA hasn't even publicly acknowledged that it launched the update. But even if EA has no more planned content for The Sims 3, players--and modders especially--are thrilled to see new life breathed into the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"So it begins," Sims modder <a href="https://x.com/SimMattically/status/1878888709535490291" rel="nofollow ">SimMattically tweeted</a> after discovering the update.</p><p dir="ltr">The last time The Sims 3 received an update was back in November 2015, and it's entirely possible the latest update was simply released to ensure players continue to buy the game. But players who miss the game's incredibly detailed customization options (many of which are still absent from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/">The Sims 4</a>) are happy to see this update, even if it's not necessarily indicative that more Sims 3 content is on the way.</p><p dir="ltr">During its heyday, The Sims 3 struggled to run even on high-end PCs. Crashes and bugs were common, but players loved the ability to make Sims' hair, clothes, nails, and furniture any color they wished via the game's color wheel. That color wheel is almost entirely absent from The Sims 4--it can be used when coloring a pet's fur, but cannot be used on Sims' hair, clothes, furniture, walls, or flooring. Sims 4 players have bemoaned the game's lack of customization options for years, and since modern machines will now have an easier time running The Sims 3 without crashing, the latest update allows nostalgic Simmers to travel back to the good old days, when Sims (and their houses) could be any color of the rainbow.</p><p dir="ltr">There's no telling whether EA will release further updates for The Sims 3--and if they do, those updates are likely to be focused on stability improvements rather than new content. Still, being able to load up an ancient save file and customize Sims to your heart's content is certainly something to celebrate, even if the update itself isn't officially a part of The Sims 25th Anniversary celebration.</p>

Based on Andrzej Sapkowski’s short story “A Little Sacrifice” from <em>Sword of Destiny</em>, <em>Sirens of the Deep </em>tells the tale of how Geralt of Rivia (Doug Cockle) and Jaskier (Joey Batey) get caught up in an age-old conflict between humans and merpeople.</p><p>In a new trailer for the movie, things seem simple enough to Geralt as he’s first hired to put his special skills to good use. It makes sense that humans would want a witcher’s help to deal with a deadly series of sea monster attacks. The gig’s also easy money for Geralt and a solid way to keep his mind off Yennefer of Vengerberg (Anya Chalotra). There’s something nefarious at the root of the interspecies war, though, and by the time Geralt realizes he might have gotten things wrong, he can only do but so much to stop the bloodshed.</p><p>Compared to the live-action series, <em>Sirens of the Deep </em>looks like it’s going for a more spectacular (in the sense that the action’s <em>big</em>) depiction of Geralt’s adventures. And while it might not connect directly to the events of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23955404/the-witcher-sirens-of-the-deep-trailer-netflix">Netflix’s last animated <em>Witcher </em>movie</a> or the live-action <em>Witcher</em>’s fourth season, it should make the wait a little more bearable.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What followed is one of the most indelible sequences in the show’s short history: the normally stoic Milchick dancing under Technicolor lighting like he was transported back to the ‘70s with quaaludes steering his limbs. The unabashed joy and unhinged dancing were jarring in a place where handshakes only transpired after formal requests. It also shocked the people who made the show.</p><p>“We had a choreographer who came, but basically, Tramell just kind of went off and said, ‘I’ve got some ideas. I’ve got some thoughts.’ Then, they just showed me this dance he came up with,” Stiller jokingly says.</p><p>Lumon workspaces are typically monotonously mundane, barren of anything but four interconnected cubicles. Disrupting that with this foolishness seven episodes into the season added a somewhat terrifying levity that makes the bleakness of the characters’ everyday lives more apparent. That’s because every detail in the show seems meticulously arranged, down to the  lights used in the scene, which Stiller revealed he hoped “wouldn’t break the reality” of the show. </p><p>The surprise on the Innies’ faces when the lights started changing colors underscored the strangeness of scenario, and was pretty genuine. “We didn’t know the lights were going to change until we were shooting the scene,” Scott reveals. </p><p>There are only two more episodes left for the podcast to break down. They’ll also be sharing tidbits about the new season of <em>Severance</em> as each episode airs. Let’s hope, at some point, we’ll get some answers about those damn goats. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cs2s-biggest-superstar-donk-dazzles-in-first-match-of-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The brightest star in CS2 right now, Team Spirit rifler Danil “donk” Kryshkovets, is already dominating pro play in 2025 after a breakout year. Fresh off a Major win and a sweep at the biggest Counter-Strike awards show, donk is already off to a blistering start this year.</p>



<p>Is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best CS2 player in the world</a> going to dominate the year again? It’s certainly looking that way.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-donk-dominates-fnatic-in-spirit-s-first-cs2-match-of-2025">Donk Dominates Fnatic in Spirit’s First CS2 Match of 2025</h2>



<p>The 2025 competitive CS2 calendar begins with the BLAST Spring Bounty event this year. Lower-seeded teams are gifted the opportunity to pick their higher ranked opponents, and can claim a higher bounty award if they manage to defeat them.</p>



<p>Fnatic, once a famed dynasty in Counter-Strike, earned the “honor” of taking on the reigning Major champions for a $60,000 bounty. But donk and company were not interested in lining Fnatic’s pockets.</p>







<p>The series began on Train for the first time in tier one competitive CS2. Donk started hot on Train, producing a ton of impact for his team and winning 80 percent of his opening duels. On Nuke, Spirit’s pick, donk dominated again like he did in Shanghai, dropping 19 kills and only giving up nine deaths. Spirit rolled over Fnatic 13-4 on Nuke, quickly eliminating them from the single-elimination qualifier.</p>



<p>It’s a fitting start for a player that closed out the year by definitively proving that he is the best player in CS2 right now. Donk put on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donk-counter-strike-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">historic, record-breaking performance</a> at Perfect World Shanghai, claiming MVP honors with ease. At the HLTV Awards, he swept all four categories he was nominated in. He <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40752/all-the-winners-of-the-hltv-awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won the awards</a> for Rookie of the Year, Opener of the Year, Highlight of the Year, and the illustrious Player of the Year.</p>



<p>Is donk can back-to-back as Player of the Year and a Major winner? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

EA hasn't yet shared details regarding what exactly this event will consist of, but given the fact that it's named after the in-game cheat used to fill a Sim's bank account with cash, it's probably safe to say this season will be all about those sweet, sweet Simoleons.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>February 25:</strong> ???</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4427397-sims25.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4427397" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4427397-sims25.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4427397"></a><figcaption>The Sims 25th Anniversary celebration is packed to the brim with content celebrating the series' history--and its future.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4427397-sims25.jpg"></figure><p>Whatever EA has planned for February 25, The Sims 4 devs are keeping their lips zipped for now, with an emoji of two large eyeballs in place of the event's description. But it's possible that February 25 will see the announcement of the game's next expansion packs, as EA has historically used large Sims-based events to promote upcoming DLC.</p><p dir="ltr">The livestream also revealed that The Sims 25th Anniversary event will include a free update that gives the game's generally underwhelming townie homes a much-needed makeover, with pools and other features that weren't available when those houses were first created. It's unclear if the digital dollhouse redecoration will take place as part of the free update on February 4, or if it will launch later in the month.</p><p>For more information on all the new content coming to The Sims 4, The Sims FreePlay, and MySims: Cozy Bundle--plus details on The Sims 25th Anniversary merch--check out <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/behind-the-sims-episode-4" rel="nofollow ">EA's recent blog post</a>.</p>
