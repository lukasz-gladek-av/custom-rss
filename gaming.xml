            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24230878/nintendo-switch-samsung-music-frame-speaker-deal-sale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo recently confirmed it’ll announce a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">next-gen Nintendo Switch</a> next year, but beyond that, the company hasn’t revealed much about the forthcoming console (including how much it will go for). If you’d rather not wait and see, the standard <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> is currently receiving a rare discount at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BFJWCYTL/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, where you can buy it with blue and red Joy-Con controllers for $267 ($33 off). </p><p>If you like to game on the go, the base Switch remains an excellent handheld, one that can last up to six hours on a single charge. It’s still limited to 32GB of built-in storage — unlike the larger, seven-inch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">Switch OLED</a> — but its built-in microSD card slot means you can always invest in more external storage. That’ll come in handy because the Nintendo eShop is home to a vast library of both first- and third-party titles, particularly in its swan-song era, with many exciting games in the pipeline. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180615/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-nintendo-direct"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180608/mario-and-luigi-brothership-release-date-nintendo-direct"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi:</em></a><em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180608/mario-and-luigi-brothership-release-date-nintendo-direct"><em>Brothership</em></a> are both launching in the fall, for example, along with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24180977/a-new-mario-party-game-is-here-to-ruin-your-family-relationships"><em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em></a>, a remastered <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/27/24229056/mysims-nintendo-switch-remastered-launch"><em>MySims</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/27/24228945/nintendo-indie-partner-direct-news-trailers">much more</a>.</p><p>Granted, the Switch 2 is rumored to feature an eight-inch screen, but the standard model’s 6.2-inch display is still spacious enough in most instances. Besides, if you crave more screen real estate, you can always play it on your TV while in docked mode, unlike the Switch Lite.</p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Read our original Nintendo Switch review</a>.</h5></p><div><p>The Nintendo Switch offers a 6.2-inch touchscreen, three play styles, and a Wi-Fi connection, thus enabling multiplayer gaming (with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription).</p></div><p>If you’re looking for a piece of home decor to spruce up your home or office, few gadgets are as unique as <strong>Samsung’s new Music Frame</strong>. And right now, the capable speaker is down to a new low of&nbsp;around $297.99 ($100 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Q-Symphony-Customizable-HW-LS60D-ZA/dp/B0CTKT886K/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1803388-REG%2Fsamsung_hw_ls60d_za_music_frame.html">B&amp;H Photo</a>, and <a href="https://howl.me/cmYIin57SmK">Best Buy</a>.</p><p>Samsung’s unique gadget looks like a traditional 12.9 x 12.9-inch picture frame — it even offers room in the front so you can add a physical photograph or art print (though you’ll only be able to use an 8 x 8-inch picture if you use the provided matte). You can hang the speaker on your wall or rest it on the included stand and even customize it with an <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/business/televisions-home-theater/television-home-theater-accessories/audio-accessories/music-frame-white-bezel-vg-scfd60wtbza/">optional white bezel</a> ($59.99).</p><p>But what’s really neat is that the Music Frame also functions as a wired Bluetooth / Wi-Fi speaker, which is one of the reasons the gadget was one of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24034953/ces-2024-verge-awards-best-tv-laptop-monitor-gaming-car">our favorite audio products from CES 2024</a>. It’s not going to sound as immersive as a high-end soundbar or a speaker with up-firing drivers like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23657335/sonos-era-300-review-spatial-audio-atmos-speaker">Sonos Era 300</a>, but it supports Dolby Atmos and can pair with select Samsung TVs or soundbars for surround sound. The art-inspired speaker is also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Samsung Bixby, allowing you to control it with just your voice.</p><div><p>Samsung’s Music Frame is a 12.9 x 12.9-inch picture frame with a physical print at the front that you can customize with art or a photo.

                <p>Five years ago, Remedy Entertainment made a splash with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/control-review-an-action-packed-paranormal-portal/1900-6417278/" data-ref-id="1900-6417278">Control</a>, but the developer had to go through 505 Games to publish the game. Now, Remedy has struck a deal with Annapurna that will not only bring Control 2 to fruition, but it may also lead to films and TV shows based on the games and Remedy's other signature title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alan-wake-remastered-review/1900-6260843/" data-ref-id="1900-6260843">Alan Wake</a>.</p><p>As announced on <a href="https://www.remedygames.com/article/remedy-and-annapurna-announce-a-strategic-cooperation-agreement" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Remedy's official site</a>, the company's new pact with Annapurna will allow it to co-finance and self-publish Control 2. Remedy also promised that the deal means the company "is able to make Control 2 exactly the game we want it to be, while we now also have an incredible partner to extend our IPs to other mediums." The developer reiterated that Control 2 is in the works, but no further details were revealed.</p><p>As part of the announcement, Annapurna's president of Interactive and New Media, Hector Sanchez, shared his belief that Remedy's titles can go even further into other mediums.</p><p>"This deal with Remedy isn't just about adapting great games--it's about breaking new ground in how companies can collaborate," said Sanchez in a statement. "By backing Remedy's move toward self-publishing, we're putting our faith in their vision.

This collection, which has been dubbed “Decades of Horror,” is made up of just about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-main-resident-evil-games-from-worst-to-b-1847399290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-main-resident-evil-games-from-worst-to-b-1847399290">every mainline entry in the series’ nearly 30-year history.</a></span> There are a few notable exceptions, like <em>Code Veronica</em>, and some remakes are there in favor of the classic versions of these titles, but for the most part, <strong>$30 will net you just about every </strong><em><strong>Resident Evil </strong></em><strong>game.</strong></p><p>These bundles are known for having tiers, though, and there are a few to work through. For example, <strong>beginning at $3, you can pick up the HD remaster of the first <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Resident Evil Revelations</em>, and the first episode of <em>Revelations 2</em>.</strong> The first title is obviously a classic that defined the survival horror genre, and gave us some of gaming’s most enduring characters in folks like Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, and Albert Wesker. Though remakes and remasters can be hit or miss, the <em>Resident Evil </em>series actually has one of the most sterling track records in this department, and it all more or less started with this game.<br></p><p>I’ve never gotten around to the <em>Revelations </em>sub-series, which curiously began on the Nintendo 3DS, but I remember hearing at the time that they were a refreshing return to the series’ roots. After some time, the <em>Resident Evil </em>games started to become more synonymous with outrageous plotlines and non-stop action than horror, and while some welcomed the evolution, others missed what made them love the series in the first place. <em>Revelations </em>was a bid to win back that hardcore audience that missed slower, scarier games, and the success of them seemed to pave the way for the mainline games to return to survival horror as well.<br></p><p>Speaking of the screwy path that the <em>Resident Evil </em>franchise eventually found itself on, the next tier of the Humble Bundle packages in a ton more games. <strong>For $7, you can pick up everything I already mentioned, as well the critically beloved </strong><em><strong>Resident Evil 4</strong></em><strong>, its less acclaimed action-centric follow-ups, </strong><em><strong>Resident Evil 5 </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>6 </strong></em><strong>(and their respective DLCs), </strong><em><strong>Resident Evil 0, </strong></em><strong>and all of </strong><em><strong>Revelations 2</strong></em><strong>, which was released piecemeal</strong>. The legacy of <em>4</em> is well-established (and it has a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891">pretty great remake</a></span> from last year) but both <em>5 </em>and <em>6</em> have divided fans for years. Some are in favor of the gung-ho, balls-to-the-wall action of these increasingly ludicrous games, but for others, this is where the series really jumped the shark. I think if you are a person capable of shutting your brain off and being a part of really dumb sequences of events, such as punching a huge boulder, then you can’t really go wrong checking them out.</p><p><em>Resident Evil 0 </em>and <em>Revelations 2</em>, like the first <em>Revelations </em>game, are slower, and far more typical, installments in the franchise, though neither is particularly beloved. If you just want to round out the bases, though, it can’t hurt to pick them up.</p><p><strong>For $20, you get all of the aforementioned titles, <em>Resident Evil 7 biohazard </em>and its DLCs,<em> </em></strong><br><strong>and the recent remakes of <em>Resident Evil 2 </em>and <em>3</em>. </strong>This widely beloved trio of games have more or less ushered the franchise into a renaissance since the late 2010s. The first brought the mainline games back to survival horror but also shook up the formula by putting the action in first-person. This romp through a decrepit manor in the Louisiana bayou was creepy as fuck, and introduced Ethan Winters, the corny catch-phrase spewing protagonist of the game and its immediate sequel. While it’s definitely a little clunky, <em>RE7 </em>is the most atmospheric and unsettling of the modern games, in case you’re looking for the most frightening prospects.</p><p><em>Resident Evil 2 </em>and <em>3</em>, meanwhile, are currently held up as the gold standard of remakes across the industry. They both maintain the spirit of their original iterations while modernizing the controls and visuals in a from-the-ground-up reimagining. Even if people are down on <em>3</em>—which I believe mostly has to do with the fact that people <em>never </em>really liked it as much as <em>2</em> to begin with—you’ve got two absolute bangers here that Capcom managed to develop in tandem and release in back-to-back years.</p><p>Finally, the biggest bundle is the previously mentioned <strong>$30 one that brings everything, including the most recent mainline entry, </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333"><em><strong>Resident Evil Village</strong></em></a></span><strong>, as well as its DLC.</strong> <em>Village</em> maintains the first-person perspective of its horror-focused predecessor, but shifts gears once again. Stylistically, it’s like a first-person <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, and plays a lot of the same hits, like opening in a creepy village in the middle of nowhere, but it also takes some even wilder swings in due time. It is also the game that gave us Lady Dimitrescu, otherwise known as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/you-dont-want-resident-evil-villages-tall-vampire-lady-1846710943&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/you-dont-want-resident-evil-villages-tall-vampire-lady-1846710943">big woman that the internet wanted to step on them</a></span>.</p><p>Even if the ending of the game dragged on a little too long for me, I’m pretty confident that <em>Village </em>is actually my favorite <em>RE </em>game, since it pretty successfully melds all of the disparate things the series has been over the years into something that’s <em>mostly </em>cohesive and, importantly, ludicrously fun.</p><p>For as little as half of a retail game, you can play <em>the </em>most legendary survival horror series in games. Considering that Capcom unceremoniously announced a sequel earlier this year, now’s as good a time as any to jump on in. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-has-exclusivity-deal-with-playstation-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.967608/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-has-exclusivity-deal-with-playstation-its-claimed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>We now seem to know exactly why Black Myth: Wukong isn’t on Xbox consoles yet. According to Forbes reporter Paul Tassi, Black Myth: Wukong has a console exclusivity deal with PlayStation.</p>



<p>“A source with knowledge of the situation has told me that Black Myth: Wukong is not currently on Xbox because of an exclusivity deal, and is not delayed because of any sort of technical issue,” <a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1829211594108350790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>.</p>



<p>Just one week ago <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/an-update-on-black-myth-wukongs-xbox-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tassi reported</a> that the game wasn’t on Xbox due to a “Tech Issue”. This comes based on the statements made from developer Game Science. More on that below.</p>



<p>“The bad news is that once again, Xbox seems to have blundered into a Baldur’s Gate 3 situation,” he said at the time.</p>



<p>In his latest report, however, Tassi references the conflicting statements between Microsoft and Game Science. Game Science has gone on record stating that they were “currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version” to hit quality standards. There has been no mention from the studio of any sort of exclusivity deal with PlayStation. Microsoft, on the other hand, has said in multiple statements that it “can’t comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders”.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">from the start, the statements from Game Science and Microsoft conflicted with each other, with Game Science citing optimization while Microsoft cited "deals with other platform holders." <a href="https://t.co/47Up179ZWh">pic.twitter.com/47Up179ZWh</a></p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1829216520502948098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>For now, no such deal has been confirmed by either developer Game Science or Sony. Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony and Game Science for comment on the report. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article.</p>



<p>Since its release on PC and PlayStation 4, Black Myth: Wukong has sold over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million copies</a>. It’s also become the second-highest played game in Steam history when it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-player-count-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comes to concurrent users</a>. </p>



<p><strong>EDITOR’S NOTE: Paul Tassi has clarified that his original report was based on what Game Science said at the time, as mentioned above. He states that he believes his source regarding an exclusive deal for PlayStation.</strong> <strong>This article has been updated to reflect that.</strong></p>



<hr>



<p>Do you think PlayStation really has an exclusivity deal for Black Myth: Wukong, or is it actually a tech issue keeping the game off Xbox consoles right now?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/iconic-mmo-wizard101-to-be-released-on-console/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Wizard101 is one of the <a href="https://www.wizard101.com/?utm_source=%C3%9CberStrategist+PR+List+-+Leading+Gaming+and+Tech+News+%282023%29&amp;utm_campaign=71122f979a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_08_22_05_15_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-9e9ced9085-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most iconic MMOs</a> out there. It is set to be released on all console platforms, including PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. This release comes after its first release on PC in 2008, making the game a whopping 16 years old.</p>
<p>If you've wanted to get stuck into an <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-is-a-co-op-multiplayer-game-focused-on-mmo-like-dungeon-runs/">MMO</a> that takes you through a magical school with deckbuilding and strategic turn-based combat, Wizard101 is the way to go. There are over 20 magical worlds for players to explore, all with unique traits that make them memorable and special. You get to play as a student wizard, where you'll have to go on your journey, completing quests and meeting new people in bustling worlds full of active players. The game will also be fully voice-acted, giving each quest that personal touch.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you've been wanting to introduce your friends to this MMO but they are all on console, console users will share a server, allowing those on PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch to all play with each other via crossplay.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release of Wizard101 on console, they have released a short 26-second trailer to get dedicated players excited about finally being able to play the game on console, as well as players who don't have access to a PC being able to play it on console for the first time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wizard101 Official Console Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdH0cSINQlA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At the moment, there isn't a set release date for when Wizard101 will be available on console, and KingsIsle Entertainment has yet to announce it. While Wizard101 has been around for a while, it was only added to Steam in 2018, with it being a much more efficient way of running the game.</p>
<p>Even though the game is relatively old, there are still millions of players getting stuck into Wizard101 regularly, and the game is home to over a thousand hours of questing to be done. This doesn't include the battles players can participate in, where they can participate in 1v1 duels or team-based battles to try and get a space on the leaderboard.</p>
<p>This MMO is still home to weekly rewards, praising players for their dedication to the game and rewarding them for their time and effort spent completing challenges set out for them in-game, with the events of Wizard101 rotating weekly to provide as much variety as possible for the players.</p>

<p>The details surrounding crossplay in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 have been announced a week before the game’s launch.</p>



<p>Developer Saber Interactive published their <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/68-august-community-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">August Community Update</a> on Thursday, and with it came everything you need to know about how crossplay will work in Space Marine 2.</p>







<p>From launch day, Space Marine 2 will support “full crossplay” between PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Steam, and Epic Games Store (EGS).</p>



<p>“You will be able to play the Campaign and PvE modes without any restriction,” the developers say. </p>



<p>When it comes to the PvP mode Eternal War, Saber Interactive says that things have to be split for “fairness and balancing purposes.</p>



<p>“[Crossplay] will be split between PC players in one pool (Steam &amp; EGS) and console players in the other one (PlayStation 5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S),” they said.</p>



<p>Lastly, players will have the ability to disable crossplay entirely should they only want to play with those on the same platform.</p>



<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 releases on September 6.</p>

<p>Corsair has unveiled its new Ultrawide curved monitor, the XENEON 34 QD-OLED. </p>



<p>Retailing <a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/monitors/CM-9030005-NA/xeneon-34wqhd240-c-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-34-inch-3440-x-1440-wqhd-1800r-curvature-240hz-0-03ms-gtg-displayhdr-true-black-400-1-5m1-contrast-ratio-cm-9030005-na" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for $1,199.99</a>, this new monitor has a 34-inch WQHD screen size featuring an 1800R Curve Quantum Dot OLED Display. It also has a 0.03ms response time with a 240Hz refresh rate.</p>



<p>“QD-OLED enhances response times and refresh rates, making the XENEON 34 QD-OLED an ideal partner for high-speed gameplay, whether it’s racing, FPS, or action games,” Corsair says. “With a refresh rate of up to 240Hz combined with an impressive response time of up to 0.03ms (GtG), the image on screen reacts to inputs faster than you can perceive.”</p>



<p>The monitor also includes support for both Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium.</p>



<p>The rear of the monitor features a number of I/O ports. Those include two HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, USB-C 3.1 DP ALT with 65W PD, USB-C 3.1 DP Upstream with 15W PD, four USB-A 3.1 with KVM, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. As far as on-screen display is concerned, that is activated by placing your hand near the bottom of the monitor.</p>



<p>Lastly, the monitor has burn-in prevention features like “an image retention refresh after eight hours of use and an Orbit feature that shifts the entire image by one pixel every three minutes”. </p>

"So guess how big the script is? 2,200,000 words! Or 11,000 typical screenwriting pages.

Reeves plays the personality inside protagonist V's mind, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-now-features-the-sad-keanu-reeves-meme">terrorist rocker Johnny Silverhand</a>, while <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-spent-roughly-125-million-turning-cyberpunk-2077-around-post-launch">Elba plays secret agent Solomon Reed</a> in expansion Phantom Liberty.</p><p>Elba called the team up "destined" in an interview with IGN, below, in which he said he's a big fan of Keanu and hears Keanu is a big fan of him: "We are destined to make something together."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Idris Elba reacts to Keanu Reeves as Shadow the Hedgehog 👀 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Knuckles?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Knuckles</a> <a href="https://t.co/lGiEmnRDRY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/lGiEmnRDRY</a></p>— IGN (@IGN) <a href="https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1780743736919822479?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will therefore act as a reunion for the pair, and they're joined by a wealth of other famous faces including Ben Schwartz as Sonic, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jim-carrey-returning-as-robotnik-for-sonic-the-hedgehog-3">Jim Carrey as Doctor Eggman</a>, and more.</p><p>"Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails reunite against a powerful new adversary, Shadow, a mysterious villain with powers unlike anything they have faced before," treads the official synopsis. "With their abilities outmatched in every way, Team Sonic must seek out an unlikely alliance in hopes of stopping Shadow and protecting the planet." <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-release-date-cast-story-trailer-details">It arrives in theatres on December 20, 2024</a>. </p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <p>
Remedy Entertainment has announced a new partnership that'll see Annapurna Pictures financing half of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a> in exchange for the film and TV rights to Control and Alan Wake.
</p>
<p>
Control 2 - the sequel to Remedy's acclaimed 2019 paranormal shooter - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-officially-announces-sequel-to-control">officially announced back in 2022</a>. Earlier this month, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production-control-2-features-in-playable-form">revealed the project had now entered full production</a>, and that the Control 2 team was currently "working towards developing the game to an early functional state from beginning to end."
</p>
<p>
Remedy announced its new partnership in a <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-plc-inside-information-remedy-and-annapurna-announce-a-strategic-partnership-agreement-on-control-2-and-bringing-control-and-alan-wake-to-film-and-television/">statement shared on its website</a>, confirming Annapurna will finance 50 percent of Control 2's development budget and gain the rights to "expand the award-winning Control and Alan Wake franchises into film and television".

<p>
Remedy notes the terms of the deal will see it retain full IP rights for Control and Alan Wake, but that revenue share from the deal will shift according to the release medium. Remedy will receive a greater revenue share from sales of the Control 2 game after initial investments have been recouped, while Annapurna will receive a greater revenue share from its audiovisual productions.
</p>
<p>
"The future of storytelling requires seamlessly integrating gaming, film, and television," Annapurna CEO Megan Ellison said of today's news, "and this partnership will allow us to explore new ways of bringing these narratives to life. By leveraging Remedy's innovative narratives and immersive worlds, we can push the boundaries of how stories are told and experienced across mediums."
</p>
<p>
Control and Alan Wake are, of course, set in the same universe, giving Annapurna significant flexibility in how the two properties might manifest for television and film.
</p>
<p>
Alongside Control 2, Remedy is currently developing its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-details-control-live-service-multiplayer-spin-off">live-service multiplayer Control spin-off Condor</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-in-the-works-remedy-confirms">remakes of Max Payne 1 &amp; 2</a>. The latter project is also now in full production. Remedy's next release, however, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-expansions-detailed-include-trip-inside-fictional-tv-show">Alan Wake 2's second DLC</a>, The Lake House, which arrives in October and sees players exploring a "mysterious facility situated on the shores of Cauldron Lake set up by an independent government organisation to conduct secret research".
