            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/game-manufacturers-association-opposes-new-trade-tariffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Game Manufacturers Association has made an official announcement regarding the recent United States trade tariffs. The organization has declared that they oppose the US' 54% tariff on Chinese Goods, stating that they will severely impact the entire US tabletop industry.</p>



<p>In an official press release, the Game Manufacturers Association explains its stance on opposing the newly implemented US trade tariffs. It states that the United States' 54% tariff on Chinese products imposed by the Trump Administration is dire news for the tabletop industry. This is because the vast majority of tabletop game manufacturing depends on producing the product overseas and then importing it to the US.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tabletop-dice-image.jpg?itok=DLvlC4wZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tabletop-dice-image.jpg?itok=LSqVOLdi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This will have devastating consequences on the tabletop industry. First is the obvious: trade tariffs are essentially taxes on the consumer. not the countries being affected. This is because, while the tariffs only affect import cost, publishers will pass this extra cost on to consumers. At best, this means prices for imported products will skyrocket. At worst, it will cause smaller companies to cease operations altogether.</p>

<p>The Game Manufacturers Association is not alone in this assessment. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/esa-trump-tariffs-comments" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ESA</a> (Entertainment Software Association) has stated these trade tariffs would cause "significant harm to everyday Americans" and to the videogame industry itself.</p>

<p>The Game Manufacturers Association's statement adds further economic context. Nearly one-third of all US consumer goods are imported. This includes food, clothing, certain appliances and cars, and entertainment electronics like videogame consoles. Think the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> has a hefty price point? It may be a sign of what is to come. To quote the release,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not only will game prices rise, but everything will become more expensive, reducing discretionary income for entertainment items like games. This one-two punch is likely to put many of our members out of business or force them to downsize and lay off employees to survive. This will have ripple effects across all segments of the industry.</p>

<p>The US lacks the production capacity to quickly ramp up and create replacement products at affordable prices, contrary to the administration's beliefs. This policy is not well thought out and is doomed to fail. It will have major repercussions throughout the US economy and could lead to a recession.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In response to how these trade tariffs will impact the tabletop industry the Game Manufacturers Association will continue to oppose them publicly alongside calling on the US Congress to, "avoid wrecking the US economy in a misguided tariff war that is neither necessary nor needed."</p>

<p>The presser ends with a call to action for all US citizens to call upon their own local representatives and senators</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-part-2-on-pc-struggles-beat-ps4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Digital Foundry has published an in-depth technical review for The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC, which was released earlier today. While it has been regarded as an improvement over the woeful release of The Last of Us Part I on PC, it’s still <strong>not as good as it could be</strong>.</p>



<p>In some aspects, The Last of Us Part II on PC performs worse – or not as well as you’d expect comparatively – than the base PlayStation 4, which was released in 2013. For instance, Digital Foundry found that a GPU with more than three times the compute power of the base PS4 wasn’t able to consistently double the performance of The Last of Us Part II on PlayStation 4.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-in-the-weeds">In The Weeds</h2>



<p>Digital Foundry’s comprehensive technical review of The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC is pretty insane. It’s fifteen minutes long, and it takes the time to dive into absolutely every aspect of the game, from frame rates and load speeds, and from texture clarity to settings optimisation.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Last of Us Part 2 PC Review - We're Disappointed - Analysis + Optimised Settings" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z0IoZxiv1i0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The team mentioned that the game’s usage of GPU resources is ‘a bit inordinate’, comparing the figures between a base PS4 and an RTX 3060 GPU. The PC GPU should be able to walk rings around the PlayStation 4’s tech, but that’s not what’s happening with this game, as DF explains:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We should be looking at a GPU that is around 3.5 times <strong>more </strong>performant in compute, even at a non-boosted clock. Yet the RTX 3060 cannot fully double the PS4’s performance in this game at the closest equivalent settings.</p>



<p>This is a very large outlier in our history of examining PC ports.</p>



<p>Whether or not that’s justified is up to the jury, but that means you as a user will have to adjust your expectations accordingly. You really don’t want to drop below those PS4 settings, as I see it, as you’re getting a visual experience worse than a 12-year-old console at that point.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>DF also revealed that stuttering and framerate drops were fairly common, and at one point, they reveal that the game would lock up without any prior warning before leaping back into life a few seconds later. They also detected issues with shadows popping in at odd times – even on maxed-out settings. </p>



<p>These issues weren’t present on the PS4 Pro backwards-compatible version of the game on PS5.</p>

                <p>Following the announcement of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> this week for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, Nintendo showed off even more gameplay footage during a Treehouse Live event, and more information about the game has come to light.</p><p>Social media user BearUNLV clipped a segment from the broadcast that shows the Mario Kart World character-select screen. There are three rows of four characters on one page for a total of 12, with seven tabs shown at the bottom of the screen. If each tab has 12 characters, this suggests there are a whopping <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-mario-kart-9-racer/2900-6141/" data-ref-id="2900-6141">84 characters in Mario Kart World</a>.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ign/video/7488860529600285998?_r=1&amp;_t=ZT-8vEQLcI9xSV" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">subsequent video from IGN runs through</a> the characters and costumes, featuring 60 in all, including costume variants like Gondolier Luigi and Yakuta Peach. The IGN video features five tabs as opposed to seven tabs in the official Nintendo video.</p><p>For comparison, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for Switch had 36 characters, including those featured in the base game and through DLC. It hasn't been explicitly confirmed as of yet if Mario Kart World does indeed have 84 characters; since we haven't seen the full roster, it's unknown. But Mario Kart World appears to be aiming to be a bigger Mario Kart game overall, so a larger character roster wouldn't be a surprise.</p><p>The new Mario Kart World video also suggests the game will have at least 28 tracks spread across seven Cups, along with 24 vehicles. Interestingly, it looks like Mario Kart World has fully formed vehicles; players seemingly no longer select individual parts to assemble a car.</p><p>One major lingering question that remains unanswered for Mario Kart World is if the game will have DLC characters and courses like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe did.</p><p>Another video from the event showed the stage DK Spaceport, which includes a segment at the end that recreates the classic 1981 arcade game Donkey Kong. As you can see in the video below, racers have to dodge barrels that a giant DK is tossing down at them right at the race's finish. With up to 24 players competing at a time--the most ever for the Mario Kart series--things may get pretty chaotic.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1907857457340448811" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">At the end of the DK Spaceport stage in Mario Kart World, they've recreated the arcade classic. <br>A very cool ending to a track, especially when you have that many racers at once trying to dodge barrels. <a href="https://t.co/WSf0z52RO4" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/WSf0z52RO4</a></p>  — Stealth (@Stealth40k) <a href="https://twitter.com/Stealth40k/status/1907857457340448811?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Mario Kart World appears to be a larger-scale Mario Kart game with a price tag to follow--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-reach-staggering-80/1100-6530563/" data-ref-id="1100-6530563">it will cost $80</a>.

<p dir="ltr">He said he thought the idea of having to pause the game and go to the home screen, find the right menu, make a chat room, and then return to the game (the way basically every other modern video game console does it) was "bothersome." That resulted in the idea of the C button.</p><p dir="ltr">"So we asked for a special button to be added while the hardware design was in progress," Ono said. "It was a very last-minute request, just before the controller molds were about to be made."</p><p dir="ltr">Ono said he thinks GameChat's ease of use, as well as the fact that the Switch 2 comes with a built-in microphone, will result in more players trying voice chat for the first time.</p><p dir="ltr">"We knew a lot of players would eventually stop using this feature if it wasn't easy to understand, so we worked hard to ensure it could be used easily to play with friends and family without any fuss," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">In the interview, Ono described GameChat as one of the Switch 2's "defining features," and that its origins came from trying to capture the vibe of a "student lounge" where people can gather not just to play games but also hang out.</p><p dir="ltr">"Until now, online play for Nintendo games has meant everyone coming together to play the same game," Ono said. "But more than anything, we wanted to create a space where people would naturally gather, whether it's to play the same game together, or different games, or even just to watch."</p><p dir="ltr">GameChat will technically require a Nintendo Online subscription to use, but can be accessed for free until March 2026, around nine months after the Switch 2 releases in June 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">In a previous developer interview, Nintendo said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-could-have-had-magnetic-joy-cons-like-switch-2/1100-6530577/" data-ref-id="1100-6530577">Switch 2's magnetic Joy-Con 2's were originally an idea for the first Switch</a>, but the idea was shelved following a meeting with late Nintendo President Satoru Iwata where he gave feedback on the prototype.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">Nintendo Switch 2 will launch on June 5 for $450</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">preorders, including a Switch 2 bundle with Mario Kart World, going live April 9</a>. Nintendo announced a number of new first-party games coming exclusively to Switch 2, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-red-faction-gorilla/1100-6530581/" data-ref-id="1100-6530581">Donkey Kong Bonanza</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-upgrades-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-revealed/1100-6530550/" data-ref-id="1100-6530550">Switch 2 versions of games like Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>

If you found yourself bopping along in admiration to 2023's Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical, you might be interested to hear Dragon Age creator David Gaider's Summerfall Studios has announced its follow-up game. It's a "demonic roguelite deckbuilder" called Malys, and a Kickstarter campaign is coming soon.
</p>
<p>
Malys casts players a Noah, a former-priest-turned-demon-hunter, who's on a mission of vengeance to exorcise the infernal forces running rampant in a festering night-time city. "Expose, endure, and expel evil from the innocent possessed," teases Summerfall. "Confront your past, forge precarious alliances, and uncover the truth."
</p>
<p>
At the centre of all this demonic mayhem is the titular Malys, a being of "extraordinary cunning and power" and Noah's primary target. As players hunt the demon down, they'll deploy their deck of arcane tricks, finding unique combinations and strategies to withstand the city's horrors and expose the rot within. And if death wins out, they can always try, and try again.

<p>
Malys is written by Gaider - perhaps best known as the lead writer on BioWare's original Dragon Age trilogy - and it's promising to deliver a "unique take on a familiar genre, pushing the boundaries of roguelite storytelling and delivering a satisfyingly moody experience".
</p>
<p>
And that's pretty much all we know so far. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/summerfallstudios/malys-exorcise-demons-on-your-hunt-for-an-ancient-evil?ref=t828fa">Malys' crowdfunding campaign</a> starts later this month, and Summerfall says the Kickstarter will enable it to "work closely" with backers to "ensure Malys is the best game it can be". The game itself is planned to release on PC this year.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale called Summerfall's Stray Gods "fascinating but flawed" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stray-gods-a-roleplaying-musical-review-greek-melodrama-fails-to-reach-lofty-expectations">three star review</a>, but it was interesting enough that Malys should be worth keeping an eye on.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-the-esa-expects-trumps-tariffs-to-have-a-detrimental-impact-on-the-video-game-industry/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Immediately after Donald Trump announced his proposed tariffs that will go into effect this coming Saturday, April 5, and then a second wave on Wednesday, April 9, there was speculation across the video game industry as to how this would impact games.</p>
<p>So far, the sentiment is that these tariffs will have a huge impact on the video game industry, and the latest report from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/esa-trump-tariffs">Game File</a> reveals that the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) expects the tariffs to have "<em>a real and detrimental impact on the video game industry.</em>"</p>
<p>Game File spoke to Aubrey Quinn, senior vice president at the ESA, who said that gaming hardware, for example, will be hit on multiple fronts, not just from the tariffs levied against countries like Vietnam, China, and Cambodia.</p>
<p>"<em>Any one product that a consumer would buy is likely to be subject to many of the tariffs announced, all compounded on top of one another,</em>" said Quinn.</p>
<p>It was already speculated that the tariffs on Vietnam and Cambodia, in particular, could potentially impact the pricing of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but Quinn's point is that there's more to gaming hardware that comes from other countries beyond Vietnam and Cambodia, which means that the base 10% tariff levied against all imports to the United States will only add on to the already high tariffs on specific countries.</p>
<p>Quinn did add, though, that the ESA remains "<em>optimistic that there will be a solution that doesn’t damage U.S. industries, ours included, and doesn’t hurt U.S. consumers</em>."</p>
<p>As we previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-selling-a-cheaper-region-locked-nintendo-switch-2-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>, Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad believes that Nintendo won't raise the price of its new console anytime soon, at least on the specific question of the pricing for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, we could still see things shift with these tariffs for the better, with the potential still remaining for a deal to be reached with exemptions for certain products, a lower tariff, or no tariffs at all being levied. Those deals, however, will take some time to set up with each impacted country, and in the meantime, we could still see the video game industry take a serious hit.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/642869/genki-nintendo-switch-2-accessories-cases-shells-magnetic-battery<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With every new portable console comes a mountain of new third-party accessories. We’ve already seen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642514/nintendo-switch-2-usb-c-camera-hori-piranha-plant-privacy">Hori’s Piranha Plant alternative</a> to the Switch 2’s USB-C camera, but Genki has announced a larger lineup of accessories designed to help protect the portable console while you’re playing away from home, plus some clever ways to keep it and its Joy-Con controllers charged.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/joy-station-pre-order">$49.99 Genki Joy-Station</a> looks like a sleek way to avoid the annoying juggling act of keeping more than two Joy-Cons charged, with some additional, well thought-out functionality. The Joy-Cons attach to two delta-shaped grips turning each pair into standalone controllers. Two Joy-Cons can be simultaneously charged using a USB-C cable while attached to the grips – useful for those times when you want to play and the Joy-Cons are nearly dead – but they also charge when the grips are reattached to the charging base.</p><p>Thanks in part to a larger screen, the Switch 2’s battery life is estimated to be between two and 6.5 hours per charge. You can extend that using <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/energy-pack-pre-order">Genki’s $69.99 Energy Pack</a> which is designed to conveniently magnetically attach to the back of the console and charge it at up to 30W speeds. The 10,000mAh Energy Pack is Qi2 compatible so you can also use it to wirelessly charge your phone, but the Switch 2 isn’t, so the battery instead connects to the console’s top USB-C port using a short included cable.</p><p>For gamers wanting added protection while they’re playing the Switch 2, <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/attack-vector-pre-order?variant=42025271623754">Genki’s Attack Vector is a $49.99 three-piece dock-compatible protective shell</a> that can be upgraded with a screen cover for an extra $10. Its most compelling feature is that it comes with three different sizes of sweat-resistant grips including a slim option designed for travel and a chunky option for maximum grip.</p><p>The $29.99 (or $39.99 with an optional screen cover) <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/force-field-2-pre-order?variant=42025278701642">Force Field 2 shell</a> is a cheaper alternative to the Attack Vector featuring a swing open design so you can detach and reattach the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons without having to fully remove it. It’s also dock-compatible, and allows for full use of the Switch 2’s folding stand.</p><p>If you’re simply looking for a way to keep the Switch 2 safe from dirt and scratches while it’s stuffed in a bag, <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/sleeper-case">Genki’s $42.99 Sleeper Case</a> features a hidden zipper and a soft wool finish inside and out wrapped around a sturdy shell the company describes as both “crushproof” and “virtually indestructible.”</p><p>Genki has also introduced a $19.99 Switch 2 screen protector called the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/aegis-shield-pre-order">Aegis Shield</a>, and the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/mimic-chest-pre-order">Mimic Chest</a>: a $19.99 plastic case sold in three-packs that each hold 12 game cartridges. All of the accessories are available for preorder now and expected to ship sometime in May or June 2025. If you want them all, <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/pre-order-genki-accessory-pack-for-switch-2?variant=42025332637770">Genki also sells the collection as a bundle</a> with either the Force Field 2 shell for $184.99 or the Attack Vector for $199.99.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>More details and news about Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter Marathon could be coming sooner rather than later. </p>



<p>On Thursday afternoon, the official Marathon Twitter <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1907840558544072722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">account posted</a> a “glitching” teaser video while updating its header image. Not long after that, the official PlayStation account also updated its header image to something Marathon related. </p>



<p>Other aspects of the game’s online presence such as its Steam page, Facebook, and YouTube were also updated. Lastly, a MIDA profile had been created on Twitter as well.</p>







<p>That has led to plenty of speculation that fans are only days away from getting more information of the relatively unknown reboot of the classic Bungie franchise.</p>



<p>To add fuel to the fire, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeff Grubb reported</a> back in February that Marathon wasn’t a part of that month’s PlayStation State of Play because PlayStation was planning a standalone event for the game. At the time, he said that April was the target for such a showing.</p>







<p>“I think April [is] when we probably hear from them about Marathon,” he said. “And it would be its own thing separate from a State of Play.”</p>



<p>As of publishing, neither PlayStation nor Bungie have officially confirmed anything regarding when more Marathon news will be announced. Based on the teases, however, it should be only a matter of time.</p>



<p>When do you think Bungie will give the next look at Marathon? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

<p>Call of Duty Warzone is back at the top of the streaming charts as Verdansk comes storming into the game once again. In 2021, Verdansk was removed rather unceremoniously from Warzone, being replaced with Caldera – a decision that many fans were disappointed with.</p>



<p>Even if it’s a flash in the pan, the return of Verdansk has proven the power of nostalgia – at the time of writing, more than 336,000 people were watching Call of Duty Warzone on Twitch. The last time the game had numbers that high was in <strong>November 2022</strong> when Warzone 2.0 was released.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-up-the-charts">Up the Charts</h2>



<p>Warzone is currently the most popular game on Twitch, which is a position it hasn’t occupied for many years. It was in 2022 that the previous peak was set, as 615,000 people tuned in to see what was new in Warzone 2.0, the release that came with Modern Warfare II.</p>



<p>Presently, more than 336,000 <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/512710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">are watching Warzone on Twitch</a> – and the number is growing. Before this, Warzone had struggled to push beyond the 280,000 mark, even during groundbreaking events and new map releases.</p>



<p>As I write this, 11,000 channels are streaming Warzone gameplay, which is <strong>almost </strong>hitting that November 2022 peak. It seems everyone wants a piece of the Verdansk pie on streaming platforms – and this is before we even start talking about YouTube. On <strong>that </strong>platform, streamers like TimTheTatman are currently broadcasting to as many as 40,000 viewers.</p>



<p>It’s safe to say that, all in all, across the suite of streaming platforms, a good 500,000 – 750,000 people are watching Warzone gameplay in some way, shape, or form.</p>



<p>Many doubted that Verdansk would herald a return to form for Warzone, but if streaming figures are anything to go by, it’s looking <strong>very </strong>good for the battle royale title.</p>



<p>Are you playing in Verdansk? Let me know what you think of the map’s return on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>It seems that people are just a little bit excited for the start of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 3 and the return of Verdansk in Warzone. After just the first few hours since the start of the season, player count for Call of Duty on Steam has risen over 200%.</p>



<p>As of writing, Call of Duty currently sits with 111,377 players <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/#3m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Steam</a>. That represents a 207.8% increase from its numbers prior to the start of the season. It also marks the first time Call of Duty has been over 100,000 concurrent players on Steam since early February when 102,000 players were on at once on February 2.</p>







<p>While not the be all, end all for numbers, Steam’s player counts are often a solid indication of the performance for a game. With numbers rising as high as they have on the platform, it could be safe to assumed that early numbers on console are just as strong, if not stronger.</p>



<p>The question then becomes whether these numbers will continue, or if players will tune out again after seeing what the return of Verdansk has to offer. Either way, the game has a ways to go to match the 160,000+ average player count it saw in its first month after release. Since then, the average count has dropped by double digits each month as of the end of March.</p>



<p>Do you think Call of Duty’s player count will stay elevated with Season 3? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1812/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

Anyone up for a little shindig? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/netease">NetEase</a> clearly are, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>' second season is all about the Hellfire Gala, a fun little party gone wrong hosted by Emma Frost. As you'll no doubt be aware, Emma Frost isn't in the game currently, making her the first of the new characters to join this season, which kicks off next week, April 11th. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The Hellfire Gala is actually a story from the comics, set on Krakoa, a living island where mutants live, with the whole gimmick of this season being that everyone and anyone is invited for a big ole party.

<p>
That gets rudely interrupted by the second new character of the season (who'll be coming a bit later), Ultron, who crashes the party by saying that man and mutant "will be exterminated." Here's the thing I can't get over though: he really sounds like a bloody Dalek. That choice to have him say "exterminated" can't be a coincidence, right? He just sounds like a Dalek that's trying to deepen its voice so that it sounds a bit tougher. Not quite the sultry tones of the likes of James Spader.
</p>
<p>
You can also spot a number of characters in new costumes you'll inevitably spend way too much money on, like Wolverine in a white tux, Storm with some vividly blue hair, Magneto cosplaying as a Space Marine, amongst a few other mutant and non-mutant characters.
</p>
<p>A <a href="https://youtu.be/LOuv0tO_aLI?si=_lYN36-L8wO5KKcp">new Dev Vision</a> was shared today too, offering some more details on what lies ahead for the game. For one, from season 3 onwards, a new hero will debut every month, which just sounds like overkill if you ask me. There's also mission adjustments coming, new colour options for popular costumes, the ability to gift costumes to friends, new team-ups, and a bunch of adjustments. You can check out the video for specifics!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is a more powerful console than the Nintendo Switch, but, according to Nvidia, it’ll feature ten times the graphics power of the original.</p>



<p>In a post on its website going over Nintendo’s latest console, Nvidia discussed DLSS and 4K gaming coming to a Nintendo platform for the first time. The post goes over how Tensor Cores will help improve “AI-powered graphics” while adding that RT Cores will “enhance in-game realism with dynamic lighting and natural reflections.” Nvidia also says that variable refresh rate and G-Sync for the console’s screen result in “ultra-smooth, tear-free gameplay.”</p>



<p>These features, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nintendo-switch-2-leveled-up-with-nvidia-ai-powered-dlss-and-4k-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the company says</a>, will give the new system “10x the graphics performance of the Nintendo Switch”, providing “smoother gameplay and sharper visuals.”</p>







<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-features-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features a 1080 LCD screen</a> that supports up to 120 frames per second (FPS) and HDR in handheld mode. When docked, the system supports 4K output at 60 FPS. One game that doesn’t seem to have 60 FPS on the system, however, is CyberPunk 2077 as CD Projekt Red’s RPG <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-on-nintendo-switch-2-runs-at-40-fps-costs-70/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">runs at 40 FPS</a> when docked.</p>

		<p>Where can Mario Kart go after the sublime <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review/">Mario Kart 8</a>? That’s the question that we were wondering for the past 7 years, especially as Nintendo stuffed their deluxe best-seller with more and more tracks. The answer is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, an open-world spin on the traditional karting format that seriously mixes things up.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3pE23YTYEZM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Right off the bat, Mario Kart World feels like putting on a pair of old slippers. It’s an utterly familiar feeling Mario Kart experience from the start, but it doesn’t take long to start spotting the bustle of new additions and extra features.</p>


<p>It starts with the character selector. There’s just a huge number of characters to choose from and their various costumes –&nbsp;these you unlock, it seems, by grabbing food items from roadside diners and then chowing down mid-race, which also transforms your look at that time. Of course you have staples like Mario, Peach, Yoshi, Waluigi, but the character list goes so far down the Mario universe as to just have Cow as a driver, which is as brilliant as it is barmy.</p>
<p>Get on track and you can literally just race it as though it’s Mario Kart 8, but there’s finer details to keep an eye out for. You can still pick up two items at once, but you no longer needing to hold and item behind you for protection as this now happens automatically. You also have the ability to grind on rails, which is trickier than it might look to pull off, wall-ride and more.</p>

<p>There’s some new transformations as well, with the karts all now having a boat or jetski mode to go with the road racing and glider modes.</p>

<p>We’ve played a handful of races with the game’s Grand Prix mode, but it’s not quite like the racing that you know from Mario Karts past. Where the point-to-point races of previous games were rare treats, here that aspect is folded into the main events. The demo build at the hands-on events picked randomly from the Grand Prix side of the game, and each time we found ourselves first racing cross-country until we reached the actual circuit that is home to the race. There’s no new race start at this point, the journey to the race track is as much a part of the race as the actual final circuit, and you might have 1 lap at that circuit, you might have three, or potentially more.</p>
<p>There’s just a huge amount of variety to this new structure, and it will be fascinating to see how it comes together. Will custom races let you get that classic feel? Or will things constantly keep on remixing?</p>

<p>But what if you love those point-to-point races and just want them to be even bigger and more challenging? Knockout Tour is one long cross-country race, with checkpoints to blaze a trail towards and the final four drivers to reach that point being eliminated. From twenty-four racers at the start, it will chop the field down to just four by the time you’re racing for the win. It ramps up the pressure in a very different way, and the sheer number of players, the volume of pickups going off makes for some seriously topsy-turvy moments as you tumble from 5th to 19th and the cusp of getting completely knocked out as you come to the next time gate.</p>
<p>It’s a lot of fun, though, and shows that there’s wide open avenues for Nintendo still to explore with their biggest game franchise. There’s also no doubt tons about this game that is still yet to be revealed, with a Nintendo Direct dedicated to Mario Kart World coming on 17th April.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[South of Midnight Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/south-of-midnight-review.1154532/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In an early chapter of South of Midnight, our protagonist Hazel is coming to grips with her newfound powers - it’s an important tone-setter, because it’s representative of what developer Compulsion Games is trying to do throughout a concise 12-hour runtime. Mythical creatures straight out of folklore from the American South drive a human story that stands as a fantastic example of how the local can be universal, with the grand tapestry of that region's culture and history wrapped around an otherwise fairly straightforward action-adventure game. While there are plenty of aspects of South of Midnight that aren’t necessarily groundbreaking, it’s all uplifted by a clear and well-executed artistic vision that makes it one the more memorable Xbox console exclusives of this generation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hazel’s ability to manipulate the magical threads of an ethereal realm is both the weapon she uses to defeat otherworldly demons in combat and the tool she relies on to piece together the tragic pasts of her neighbors and forebears in her hometown of Prospero. It’s a fictional place, but one that’s deeply rooted in the very real experience of the South – traces of its dark history litter the dilapidated houses after a treacherous flood, contrasting with the remnants of communities that struggled to survive in those harsh conditions. These touches provide the rich context South of Midnight is working within while also unraveling a larger story about the pain, guilt, and trauma many of us experience in our own family lives.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From a gameplay perspective, South of Midnight is rather simple – you’re ushered through fairly linear levels that alternate between platforming and combat encounters, with a few secrets hidden off the beaten path like journal entries from the locals that enrich the story and extra upgrades for your powers and health. If you’ve scaled cliffsides in Uncharted, God of War, or Tomb Raider, its frequent climbing sections will feel pretty familiar – but with the authentic sights and sounds of the American South at the forefront, the detailed vistas, ramshackled towns, or rushing rivers create a strong sense of place. With Hazel’s weaving powers, you’ll zip through air, clear paths forward, or summon ethereal objects depending on what obstacles are in front of you. There isn’t really much to <em>figure out</em> per se, although there is an enjoyable momentum as you’re funneled from one fight to the next, or when you’re trying to outrun evil spirits chasing you down in the lengthy platforming sequences that cap off every major chapter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat itself is contained in distinct arenas across each level, with the idea being that Haints – the demonic manifestations of peoples’ pain and sorrow – plague all of Prospero, and Hazel is the one who can cleanse that corruption. It’s a comfortable, if predictable, cadence that doesn’t really wear thin since it’s judicious about when you actually have to fight. This helps South of Midnight not feel repetitive, and I genuinely looked forward to each combat encounter. Similar to the platforming, these fights aren’t really pushing any boundaries, but Hazel's attack combos and spells have a certain chunkiness that I really enjoyed. That’s especially true when firing off her stun weaves and grappling strand to stack damage, then leaving a burst behind with a perfect dodge. Cycling through a shortlist of fun abilities like that makes the basics satisfying.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s everything around South of Midnight’s competent foundation that makes it truly stand out.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Haints come in various forms that give encounters enough variety. Some are swift and pesky, while others are hulking beasts that tunnel underground and cause massive area-of-effect damage. They’re mixed and matched throughout, and things like Hazel’s puppet named Crouton, who can temporarily control enemies, add an interesting wrinkle when thinking about which targets to prioritize. There are a few boss fights to heighten the stakes with a bit of spectacle as well, but they mostly tend to highlight the formulaic nature of combat by relying on derivative versions of mechanics that are used elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">South of Midnight’s foundation is perfectly competent, but it’s everything else around it that makes it truly stand out, grabbing you with its painterly character designs and striking stop-motion animation style. That unconventional choice helps special moments pop during cutscenes, although it isn’t really noticeable in the action – and if you find it too jarring, you can optionally disable the stop-motion effect altogether. Even without it, the details in characters’ faces, their expressiveness, and the superb voice acting feel like the real reward chapter after chapter. The specific accents and vernacular come across authentically, to the point where I didn’t think twice about them since it all sounded so familiar to me as someone who was born in the region. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Southern gothic folklore hasn’t really been explored in games like this, and South of Midnight showcases how rich it is by bringing these tales to life in ways we rarely see. Mythical creatures embody the pain and suffering of townsfolk, melding broader urban myths with the struggles of specific characters throughout the story. A figure like Florida’s legendary alligator Two-Toed Tom shows up as a boss, while the shapeshifting Rougarou from Cajun tales takes a form I hadn’t heard of before – and Alabama’s Huggin’ Molly has on a fascinating reinterpretation. It’s the sort of amalgamation of folklore that’s wonderful to see as someone who is familiar with some of it, but done in a way that’s still inviting for the uninitiated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">South of Midnight acknowledges the region’s real history in subtle and effective ways as well, recognizing that remnants of slavery and the Reconstruction era persist in our modern world, and that trauma can carry across generations. Passing by abandoned houses along the bayou with eviction notices from greedy landgrabbers reminds you of the rough and unfair economic conditions many of these communities face. It’s woven into its main themes about the complicated dynamics of family – the best and worst parts that can come from blood relations. With her weaving powers, Hazel can peer into the past through visions recreated using the threads that make up The Grand Tapestry – the flow of all life and memory. You’ll see a mother risking life and limb to escape abuse and give their child a fighting chance; A man ashamed of his brother who takes drastic measures to separate himself, only to live with regret forever; A kid who called out to a mythical creature in desperation to escape his abusive father. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It brings Southern folklore to life in ways we rarely see.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From tragic displays of unconditional love to the horrors of the abuse our own kin can inflict on us, South of Midnight focuses on the idea of family being something we either embrace or reckon with, told in a way that’s inseparable from its setting. Through it all, Hazel is desperately chasing any possible thread to find her mother after that devastating flood at the start, but is still willing to lend a helping hand to the spirits that have endured in the afterlife. As you uncover the hard work her mom puts in as a social worker, it shows that a little empathy can go a long way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot I love about the stories in South of Midnight – I do wish they were more elegant or told with more finesse, however. The larger plot is missing some necessary connective tissue at times, and it’s easy to lose track of why Hazel’s journey leads from one thing to another. Characters and narrative threads are sometimes introduced as quickly as they’re resolved through story beats that feel segmented in ways that aren’t entirely clear. There are parts of Hazel’s life I’m still wondering about that get brought up as important pieces to the story, and I wish I could have tied those loose ends together before the credits rolled.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">South of Midnight Review - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It gets the big picture right, though, and in its exploration of a region as wide-ranging as the American South, there’s an earnest interpretation. While it is also a heavily religious place, the story is more interested in the spirituality that gives rise to these folktales. And it’s not all swamps and basins out there, it’s not just Bourbon street in New Orleans, or a politically hostile place for marginalized folks – those are all part of it, for sure. But I like that we have a story that shows that <em>people live there</em>, and they struggle in ways that are both universal and unique to the region. South of Midnight also understands that <em>hurt people hurt people</em>, and knows it’s not an excuse for the terrible things that pain may drive people to do – it’s a bit of a trope when stories talk about mental health nowadays, but there’s still truth to it, and South of Midnight has its own take by focusing on this concept with regards to family. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps my favorite touch, however, is how South of Midnight uses its fantastic soundtrack to tie everything together thematically. With a mix of bluegrass, blues, jazz, and American folk tunes that weave in harmonizing choirs, church organs, or banjos and fiddles, it’s a showcase of how important music has been throughout the region’s history. Big story moments are built up through songs written as if a narrator was walking you through what the characters felt and experienced in their life, and they’re queued up at just the right time to propel you forward as you’re playing. It got me in my feelings at times, because there’s not much I love more than a fantastic soundtrack used as an effective storytelling device.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of us from the South have a complicated relationship with it. Born in Mississippi and adopting parts of the culture and vernacular as my family and I moved throughout the country, it’ll always have a special place in my heart. I appreciate having a game that helped me reconnect with those roots in a way that was whimsical and harrowing in equal measure, and that’s the sort of value South of Midnight has beyond just being a good action-adventure game – it’s worth playing for a little virtual tour of the South you wouldn’t see otherwise.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">South of Midnight is a straightforward but well-executed action-adventure game on the surface, with a simple but satisfying mix of combat and platforming. It’s focused, filling out its 12-hour runtime nicely without ever dragging or relying on unnecessary padding. Beyond those basics, however, is a certain heart and artistry that elevates the whole package, inviting you to peer into the deep American South through its folklore, nature, and culture. It might not be the most profound exploration of family life, but it’s delivered in ways that feel authentic. From its striking art style to the evocative tunes that bring big story moments together, Hazel’s journey is a captivating one no matter where you come from.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At a glance, it's quite similar to the menu you see after hitting the home button on Nintendo Switch.

Some of these icons are very similar to those on Switch 1, specifically the Nintendo Switch Online, Album, Controllers, System Settings, and Sleep Mode ones. The Nintendo eShop icon has been redesigned to a darker shade of orange, and ones that could be for features like Virtual Game Cards, GameChat, and GameShare appear alongside it. There's also an unknown icon represented by a green sheet of paper. This could be a redesigned News icon or something else entirely.</p><p>While there are some small but notable icon changes, the Switch 2's main menu, for the most part, takes most of its cues from the home screen design on Switch 1.
