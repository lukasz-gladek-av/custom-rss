            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-requires-pricey-extra-accessories-and-a-4k-tv-to-fully-complete<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Welcome Tour arrives today alongside the launch of Nintendo's new console, though it cannot be fully completed without also purchasing extra accessories - and a 4K TV.</p>
<p>The minigame collection has already drawn criticism for not being a pack-in game, considering it is designed to show off the capabilities of the Switch 2. Instead, it'll set you back eight quid. Even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/reggie-fils-aime-wades-into-switch-2-pricing-debate-by-subtweeting-nintendo-over-pack-in-games">former Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aime waded in</a> on the debate.</p>
<p>Yet as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aahea/products/soft.html#other">Nintendo has stated on its website</a> (thanks <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-to-require-a-few-accessories-for-100-completion/">Nintendo Soup</a>), some of the 34 minigames and tech demos require peripherals which are sold separately.</p>

<p>One minigame requires a USB camera; another requires the GL/GR buttons on the Switch 2 Pro Controller (although they're also on the Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip with the console); and a 4K TV is required for both a minigame and a tech demo to experience the proper resolution.</p>
<p>Nintendo states that all 12 areas of the game can still be accessed without these accessories, but to 100 percent the game you'll need three medals in every minigame.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Pro Controller will set you back £74.99, an extra Charging Grip costs £29.99, while the Switch 2 Camera costs £58.99 - although a cute Piranha Plant alternative is £34.99 if you don't mind a poor resolution.</p>
<p>As for a 4K TV, that could cost you hundreds, if not thousands of pounds.</p>
<p>Over in the US, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">Nintendo even raised the price of its accessories to combat US tariffs</a> on the console itself.</p>
<p>"From my slightly extended but still brief time with it, it feels like Nintendo has created, if not the most wildly entertaining, at least the most spiritually accurate take on visiting an actual museum dedicated to a games console," wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/welcome-tour-is-the-switch-2s-welcome-surprise-and-might-even-be-worth-your-8-quid">Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell on Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>.</p>
<p>"You read a bit, you play around a bit, you go, 'huh,' and have a little ruminate on what you've learned, and move on. If it weren't for all the Joy-Con waggling I'd ideally play this thing with my arms clasped behind my back, head slightly cocked to one side, assuming the official position of the museum attendee."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Our Bertie has already had some time with The Alters. "It's a glimpse of a game that intrigues me but also leaves me slightly confused," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-war-of-mine-devs-clone-survival-game-the-alters-is-a-curious-blend">Eurogamer's The Alters preview from 2023</a>.</p>
<p>"This War of Mine had a much clearer idea - living as a civilian through war - whereas The Alters seems more speculative and fragmented. Is it a mining game? Is it a survival game? Is it a game about clones? I think it's trying to be all three, but I'm not yet convinced it's managed. But like I say, I've only seen a glimpse, and if it turns out to be anything like This War of Mine, I'll be happy."</p>
<p>As for Control spin-off FBC: Firebreak, our Chris called it a "frantic, electrifying run-based shooter, with difficulties feeling like gambles" following his time with the game earlier this year.</p>
<p>"Its potential is up there with the games other Remedy staff reference in casual chit-chat around the studio's corridors, from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, yes, to Darktide, Payday, Deep Rock Galactic or even Overcooked," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedys-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-has-only-come-together-at-the-last-minute-and-somehow-feels-better-for-it">Eurogamer's FBC: Firebreak preview</a>.</p> <div>

			<p>It's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launch day, a day that's supposed to be exciting for players and developers alike, with a new Nintendo console in the market and hopefully, plenty of new experiences on the horizon.</p>
<p>Some players though, are definitely getting the kind of 'new experience' with their Switch 2 they didn't ask for, and that's the experience of their brand-new console already being broken, before they even opened the box.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-screen-punctures-ruin-launch-day-for-fans-due-to-store-receipts-stapled-into-consoles-box">IGN</a>, some players who went to retail GameStop locations to pick up their Nintendo Switch 2 consoles through midnight launches got home to discover that there were <a href="https://x.com/Rudeboy__NYC/status/1930568461014499667">holes in the console's screen</a>, from <a href="https://x.com/Oadhan/status/1930496875532018128">store employees stapling their receipts to the front of the Nintendo Switch 2 box</a>.</p>
<p>This happened to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1l3rcuu/comment/mw370bi/">number of players</a> who went to the same GameStop in Staten Island, where it seems everyone who was at that location walked away with their receipt stapled to the front of the Switch 2 box.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/app.bsky.feed.post/3lqtrq53olf2p" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigr7gwt2ltcl3r7pyx4vblqsbjeofoz3uiszpux2kk5xsfizqyzlu">
<p lang="en">Apparently one GameStop store used a stapler to attach receipts to Switch 2 boxes and the staple ruined the screen...another person commented their unit and others were affected at the same store www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/c...</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637?ref_src=embed">Wario64 (@wario64.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/post/3lqtrq53olf2p?ref_src=embed">2025-06-05T07:18:39.993Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately for everyone who went to that same GameStop, they will probably have to wait until that store gets its next shipment of Switch 2 consoles, to get their replacements. Though, the reaction online hasn't been all negative towards GameStop alone. Many players on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davefpg.bsky.social/post/3lqua356xqk23">social media</a> have also noted that Nintendo should've packaged the console better, and not have the screen facing up at the top of the box.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if Nintendo repackages the Switch 2 in response to these issues, or if any more reports of retail employees puncturing holes in the screen crop up. Plenty of stores across the globe had midnight launches, including the newly-separated, Canadian-owned <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-canada-has-been-sold-and-acquired-by-mcfarlane-toys-co-owner-stephen-tretrault-will-re-launch-as-eb-games-canada/">EB Games</a>, and more reports of this happening at other stores have yet to be spotted. For now, it looks like this lone Staten Island store is the 'what not to do' example for everyone else.</p>

			<p>Funcom's survival multiplayer sandbox game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-shows-off-its-ever-shifting-deep-desert-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune Awakening</a> launches today for those who have purchased the Deluxe and Ultimate editions and it features NVIDIA DLSS 4 support for maximum performance.</p>
<p>The game includes support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution (available on all RTX GPUs), Frame Generation (available on RTX 40 and 50 Series GPUs), and Multi Frame Generation (available on RTX 50 Series GPUs). According to NVIDIA, performance in Dune Awakening can be enhanced by an average of 4.9X at 4K resolution and max settings while activating all the above with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance mode. The official benchmarks show the RTX 5090 surpassing 338 frames per second, while the RTX 5080 averages 270 FPS, the RTX 5070 Ti 239 FPS, and the RTX 5070 198 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Optionally, users can turn on the NVIDIA app override to improve DLSS quality in the game with the new transformer model. Lastly, Dune Awakening also supports NVIDIA Reflex, which NVIDIA says can reduce system latency by up to 50% in this title. As a reminder, if your PC simply isn't strong enough to run Dune Awakening, you can always <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-dune-awakening-fbc-firebreak-mindseye-and-rematch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play it via GeForce NOW</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, Codemasters launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/f1-25-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA Sports F1 25</a>, this year's edition of the licensed Formula One racing game. This title actually supports the full NVIDIA DLSS 4 suite. On top of the aforementioned DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation, the game also includes Ray Reconstruction, which can be enabled to replace the built-in denoiser to greatly enhance the quality of the ray tracing/<a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-to-support-path-tracing-only-on-pc-improved-facial-animations-with-nvidia-audio2face/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">path tracing</a>. NVIDIA says that enabling all DLSS technologies can multiply performance in F1 25 by an average of 7.9X at 4K with Ultra High settings and path tracing during a race around a wet Bahrain at night with 20 cars. The RTX 5090 breaks 372 frames per second, the RTX 5080 averages 246 FPS, and the RTX 5070 Ti 206 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Lastly, NVIDIA confirmed that the GeForce Summer of RTX promotion <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/contests/summer-of-rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is returning</a>. They encouraged users to follow GeForce and GeForce NOW accounts on social media to stay up to date on prize bundles featuring GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards, GeForce RTX gaming PCs from Falcon Northwest, Maingear, and ORIGIN, and even more prizes coming later this season. Also, they are kicking off a new promotion titled RTX Watch &amp; Win: when new trailers drop during the biggest shows like the upcoming Summer Game Fest, participants have a chance to win Steam gift cards via NVIDIA's social pages.</p>

The pictures showed the receipt stapled to the front of the box, the puncture holes it left in both the cardboard and the plastic wrap, and the ensuing dents in the Switch 2's screen. </p><p>The GameStop in question was reportedly located in Staten Island, New York. Like at most of the company’s stores, the midnight launch brought out tons of Nintendo fans excited to be some of the first in the world to go hands-on with the new hardware. It’s unclear if the stapling was being done by everyone at the store or just one person, and how many people were ultimately affected. Other users who were at the event shared similar horror stories, though. </p><p>“GameStop stapled the receipt for me and my friends Switch 2s to the box, FML,” Oadhan Lynch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Oadhan/status/1930496875532018128&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Oadhan/status/1930496875532018128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on X</a></span>. “Genuinely insane now I’m gonna have to wait 3 months for the restock. And yes we were there for the midnight release so I bet everyone in this line is gonna have this same issue.” Another customer from the same location who faced a similar situation commiserated with them in the comments. </p><p>While stapling anything to a video game console box is unnecessary and lowkey unhinged, anyone working a console midnight launch at GameStop is probably part-time and making barely $15 an hour, especially as store closures and high turnover have continued to hollow out more seasoned staff. For many employees across the company at thousands of locations, this was probably the first console launch they’d ever worked through. It was certainly the biggest. </p><p>Nintendo, on the other hand, has experience not just with launching new consoles but boxing and shipping hundreds of millions of them all around the world. So it should be noted that it’s equally wild that the company known for its meticulous attention to detail would box the Switch 2 with the screen facing up and only covered by 1.5cm of light cardboard. </p><p>I know because I measured. I was surprised by just how exposed the Switch 2 seemed after I unboxed mine last night. The packaging is so thin that even the box falling from a certain height onto the wrong object might be equally damaging. Others were kind of horrified, too. “You’re going to hear about a few damaged screens in the coming days,” one new Switch 2 owner <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AncientArgonaut/status/1930552016545390644&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AncientArgonaut/status/1930552016545390644" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predicted on X</a></span>. “They are at risk just being stacked in shipping.”</p><p>Maybe not. Maybe Nintendo actually did testing on the box layout and found that, for structural reasons not obvious to the naked eye, the Switch 2 remains safe from just about anything that might normally happen to it during transit, except, clearly, someone taking a stapler to it. The consoles can be replaced but the wait will be a pain for those who thought they’d finally gotten their hands on a console that would last them for another eight years. “Totally killed the excitement of the night,” wrote Oadhan Lynch.</p><p> It’s worth noting that at least some Switch 2 consoles ordered directly from Nintendo came packaged in a second, much sturdier outer box, as contributing editor John Walker discovered <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ht7hc64fzee5fhoo456t3t2v/post/3lqu4kjeq7s2w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ht7hc64fzee5fhoo456t3t2v/post/3lqu4kjeq7s2w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">when his arrived earlier today</a></span>. GameStop and Nintendo did not immediately respond to request for comment. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Next month marks the 43rd anniversary of the original Tron movie, but players won't have to wait any longer to reenter the Grid. Ahead of its full release later this month, the demo for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tron-catalysts-shift-to-isometric-action-feels-like-a-nice-change-in-perspective/1100-6531077/" data-ref-id="1100-6531077" data-mce-href="/articles/tron-catalysts-shift-to-isometric-action-feels-like-a-nice-change-in-perspective/1100-6531077/">Tron: Catalyst</a> has debuted on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025590/TRON_Catalyst/" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025590/TRON_Catalyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p><p>According to Tron: Catalyst director <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lqpkd2zztc2l" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lqpkd2zztc2l" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mike Bithell</a>, the demo covers roughly the first hour of the game. Bithell also noted that the game supports ultrawide monitors, which he felt was appropriate for the franchise.</p><p>Catalyst is a departure from Bithell Games' previous title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tron-identity-review-gone-in-60-millicycles/1900-6418054/" data-ref-id="1900-6418054" data-mce-href="/reviews/tron-identity-review-gone-in-60-millicycles/1900-6418054/">Tron: Identity</a>. That game was essentially an interactive cyberpunk novel, while Tron: Catalyst has switched genres to isometric action. Players will be able to utilize their Identity Discs and their Light Cycles while facing The Core, a militant faction that's holding on to power in the Arq Grid.</p><p>It's unclear if Tron himself will make any kind of appearance in the game, as players will be stepping into the role of a new hero named Exo. She's taken it upon herself to carry on Tron's legacy by protecting the Grid and doing everything she can to bring down The Core. Exo can face her enemies with melee moves, but her most versatile weapon remains her disc, which can be used for both offense and defense.</p><p>Tron: Catalyst will launch on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 on June 17. But it won't be the only Tron media coming this year. The next feature film, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-reveals-first-tron-ares-footage-at-d23/1100-6525696/" data-ref-id="1100-6525696" data-mce-href="/articles/disney-reveals-first-tron-ares-footage-at-d23/1100-6525696/">Tron: Ares</a>, will hit theaters on October 10. Last year, the star of that film, Jared Leto, shared his experience at Walt Disney World where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-tron-ares-star-jared-leto-ride-tron-lightcycle-at-disney-world/1100-6526123/" data-ref-id="1100-6526123" data-mce-href="/articles/watch-tron-ares-star-jared-leto-ride-tron-lightcycle-at-disney-world/1100-6526123/">he rode the Tron: Lightcycle ride</a> for the first time.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft's multiplayer shooter XDefiant has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-xdefiant-is-officially-shut-down/1100-6532087/" data-ref-id="1100-6532087">officially closed down</a>, and now game director Mark Rubin has announced he's leaving the games industry overall. He also discussed what he believes went wrong with the game, including claiming that Ubisoft gave the game "little to no marketing" and that Ubisoft didn't give the team enough resources to help it succeed after launch.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1930403826378649786" rel="nofollow ">post on social media</a>, Rubin said, "It's a sad day for fans of XDefiant and for all the passionate devs that worked so hard on this game." He said he thanks fans for playing and promoting it. "Every voice mattered," he said.</p><p>"I would say something remarkable happened with this game in that although we had very little marketing, we still had the fastest acquisition of players in the first few weeks for a Ubisoft title just from you guys all talking about and promoting the game," Rubin said.</p><p>He's likely referring to how XDefiant was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XDefiant/comments/1d2mt2e/8_million_people_played_xdefiant/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported to have reached 8 million players in its first week</a>. That momentum was not sustained, and Rubin blamed this in part on Ubisoft providing "little to no marketing" support, especially after launch.</p><p>Some may question this claim, as Ubisoft regularly promoted XDefiant before and after launch, and the game featured characters based on Ubisoft's biggest franchises, including Far Cry, The Division, Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, Assassin's Creed, and Watch Dogs. On YouTube, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Ubisoft/search?query=xdefiant" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published more than two-dozen XDefiant videos</a> aimed at hyping the game. The game's social media pages had <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hundreds of thousands of followers</a> that received all the newest details as they were announced.</p><p>However, Rubin said XDefiant failed to acquire new users after its big launch, and contributed to the game's downfall.</p><p>Other issues that XDefiant faced included "crippling tech debt" in the form of the XDefiant developers "using an engine that wasn't designed for what we were doing, and we didn't have the engineering resources to ever correct that."</p><p>Rubin went on to question whether or not proprietary game engines make sense anymore. "This tech debt included the dreaded netcode issues that we could just not solve given the architecture we were dealing with," he said. "And so, for many players with solid network connections (in both speed and consistent reliability) the game played well but if your connection had even the smallest amount of inconsistency the engine just couldn't handle it and you would have a bad experience."</p><p>The developer added that his team also struggled to have "the right resources to make content for the game." He said Seasons 4 and 5 would have "completed the game in a way that I felt it should have been for launch," but the team did not have the resources to deliver it.</p><p>He said XDefiant's developers and Ubisoft leadership had their hearts "in the right place," but the game struggled because, "We just didn't have the gas to go the distance for a free-to-play game."</p><p>Some may also wonder about external factors that could have contributed to XDefiant's inability to sustain and grow its audience. It's been reported that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/10-live-service-games-made-up-more-than-40-of-last-months-us-playtime-on-playstation-and-xbox/1100-6529723/" data-ref-id="1100-6529723">huge percentage of total play time in multiplayer games is dominated by only a few titles</a>, making it challenging for new games to break through.</p><p>XDefiant's development team was laid off in 2024, including Rubin, and he's now leaving the gaming industry overall to spend time with his family.</p><p>"So unfortunately you won't be hearing about me making another game. I do care passionately about the shooter space and hope that someone else can pick up the flag that I was trying to carry and make games again that care about the players, treat them with respect and listen to what they have to say," he said.</p><p>Rubin rose to fame in the gaming industry for his work on the Call of Duty series. He was a producer on the hugely popular 2007 game Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, before producing its sequels as well. He left Infinity Ward after Call of Duty: Ghosts came out in 2013.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-force-of-law-warbond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead and Sony have revealed a brand new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, and it's packed with new gear and emotes to make your next battle for Super Earth all the more stylish.</p>

<p>Following on from last month's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond" rel="nofollow">Masters of Ceremony</a> and March's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-borderline-justice-warbond" rel="nofollow">Borderline Justice</a>, the Force of Law Warbond will launch on June 12th. It'll bring new weapons, armor, and patterns, as well as new emotes to communicate with your squad.</p>

<p>Your first new weapon is the AR-32 Pacifier, a high-capacity assault rifle that promises to be an excellent crowd-clearing machine. It's joined by the G-109 Urchin stun grenade, which can attach to enemies and dispense periodic electrical pulses to knock them out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-force-of-law-warbond-g-109.jpg?itok=zVCe863d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-force-of-law-warbond-g-109.jpg?itok=W4Sv07k- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond is here, and it's got an explosive new surprise for you.</figcaption></figure><p>Also being added to the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>arsenal in the Force of Law Warbond is a new Guard Dog drone, the AX/ARC-3 K-9, which dispenses electric arc shots. Like other Guard Dog weapons, it's capable of friendly fire, so don't stand in its way.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a new support weapon in the form of the GL-52 De-Escalator, an appropriately-named grenade launcher that fires arc grenades. You can probably sense a theme emerging here, right?</p>

<p>As with previous&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbonds, new armor will also be added in Force of Law. The BP-20 Correct Officer medium set has "protective padding and roomy pouches", while the BP-32 Jackboot set is a lighter outfit with "an official-looking tailored jacket and sturdy pauldrons".</p>

<p>Both sets will grant you the Ballistic Padding passive, which will reduce chest damage, as well as explosive and bleed damage. No longer will you suddenly bleed out without realizing exactly how you've died (guilty as charged!).</p>




<p>This Warbond comes just a couple of weeks after two major&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>updates; the first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-update-illuminate-weapon-customization" rel="nofollow">introduced new enemies</a> and weapon customization systems, while the second <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update" rel="nofollow">sent you and your squad to Super Earth</a> to defend it from the Illuminate faction.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. The Force of Law Warbond launches on June 12th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/680294/switch-2-gamestop-launch-event-nintendo-america-ceo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’m standing outside the GameStop at Union Square in New York City on a beautiful Wednesday afternoon, with plenty of cars rolling by and people basking in the late spring sun. On the corner of E 14th Street and University Place, a line has formed around the block.</p><p>Tonight is the official launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, a console people have been waiting for years to arrive. Some publications and influencers received theirs one day early, but for the rest of the world, tonight is the first opportunity to play it. And for a lot of the people in this line, that means they’re willing to wait a little longer.</p><p>By 7PM I’ve talked to plenty of people queued up, and the overwhelming sentiment is that everyone is excited for <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Left, Andrea. Right, Kyle.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>“It’s been forever since the last one,” Kyle and Andrea tell me. “It only makes sense to get it now. Might as well.”</p><p>The last version, <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, first launched in 2014 for the Wii U, eventually becoming <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> when it launched on the Nintendo Switch. <em>Mario Kart World</em> is the first truly new console edition in a decade, and fans are eager to start playing.</p><p>Chris has been waiting in line for about four hours and brought his own chair. He tells me that his friends have been working all day, so he’s trying to hold them a spot.</p><p>“These are crazy hard to get. I don’t have a lot to do today, so I’m gonna see if I can save a spot in line for them.”</p><p>Finally, I find one fan who tells me he’s excited for the Switch 2 because of its power. “I had the Switch and then the Switch OLED, and I’m honestly pretty stoked to run this thing at 4k 60fps. It’s a huge jump,” Anthony tells me.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Anthony (left) and his girlfriend, Mary (right)</em>.</figcaption></p></div><p>Inside the store, staff has been working since 11AM, pre-processing customers to make tonight’s launch go smoothly. They take four people at a time from the line outside, check them out with consoles and accessories, and hand them a ticket with a number to come back and claim later. There are still a few hours to go, so most people are walking down the street to grab dinner or drinks.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>A body painter (left) paints a customer’s arm (right).</em></figcaption></p></div><p>To tide over patient customers, GameStop has set up various stations. There’s a body painter giving people Nintendo-themed paint-jobs, a <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> set up, and, of course, <em>Mario Kart</em>. Kids flank the stations while their parents check out, and the store even lined up a DJ to keep people entertained.</p><p>GameStop has completely outfitted the store with <em>Mario</em>-themed ornaments. There are full-sized cardboard cutouts of various characters spread throughout, and a map of <em>Mario Kart World</em> embedded into the floor. It’s clear the retailer knew this would be a massive launch, and it decked out the store to help fans celebrate.</p><p>Around 9PM, Doug Bowser, the CEO of Nintendo of America, makes a surprise appearance. Bowser talks to customers and recites a likely pre-scripted conversation with GameStop staff on camera which will probably appear in a LinkedIn post, then moves to the mural on the wall for a photo with employees.</p><p>I asked Bowser what he was most excited for, and he blasts off a quick speech about <em>Mario Kart</em>. It’s expected at this point — a theme of the night.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Doug Bowser (second from left) makes a surprise entrance</em>.</figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Doug Bowser (center) poses with Gamestop staff.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Doug Bowser (left) poses with a fan (right)</em></figcaption></p></div><p>People start merging back into the line at 11PM, now stretching down the block and around the corner. Earlier in the night, GameStop employees handed out raffle tickets for free games, and they start calling numbers for the winners. If you won, you were graced with a copy of <em>Splatoon 3</em>, a game not currently updated to take advantage of the Switch 2’s superior hardware.</p><p>At 11:55PM I head inside, alongside the first few customers awaiting the midnight release. Dawn is the first to receive his Switch 2 after waiting outside this GameStop since 4:17AM.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Dawn walking away with the first Switch 2 of the night.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>“I can’t really believe I’ve been waiting this long, but it was worth it.” Everyone cheers and the line starts flowing faster. Crowds of people who didn’t pre-pay for the console continue to show up and get in line. They’ll probably be here until morning.</p><p>I left the store about 30 minutes after release, wondering how many instances of anecdotal evidence it would take to make the console a success. But if this store is anything to go by, the Nintendo Switch 2 is already a hit.</p><p><em>Photography by David Imel.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Witcher 4 - Official Cinematic Trailer | State Of Unreal 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>"The Kingdom Come kind of simulation ... there's so many options, you can change the world, it's super great," Badowski continued. "We'd like to follow this trend as well. So these are our next steps for sure, and it's kind of a similar challenge to what we have in The Witcher 3 because of the open world and storytelling here, freedom of choices. But at the same time, we would like to build very fleshy, very well-motivated characters. So it's kind of in contradiction from time to time. That's a great design challenge."</p><p>Badowski doesn't think Larian's D&amp;D blockbuster Baldur's Gate 3 has as much in common with the CDPR style. "It's turn-based so it's a different kind of game, and the way you interact with characters is totally different," Badowski explains. "Because there's freedom of choice in Larian's work, it pushes you to use different tricks than ours. But I think we observe each other, and there are not that many games like that, so ... we see how players react to those tactics."</p><p>CDPR co-CEO also expressed admiration for Baldur's Gate 3, even though it's different from what the studio wants to do with The Witcher and Cyberpunk. "We definitely are not going to make a game like Larian did," Nowakowski said. "That's the kind of game they can make. But a lot of stuff with how the characters can interact with the world and what it does was for sure some inspiration to us."</p><p>CD Projekt Red just released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-wasnt-actually-the-game-says-cd-projekt-red/1100-6532043/" data-ref-id="1100-6532043">gorgeous-looking new tech demo</a> for The Witcher 4 as part of State of Unreal 2025, though the actual game still seems to be a while off.

Like the famed developer's other projects, it looks stylish and <em>weird</em>, but don't expect it to be out for quite a while, as Suda said that it was looking to avoid facing off against some stiff competition. While he didn't name "that game" specifically for the nebulous release window of Romeo Is a Dead Man, there's a good chance that he was alluding to Grand Theft Auto 6.</p><p>"That’s kind of obvious, isn’t it?" Suda51 said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/romeo-is-a-dead-man-hasnt-got-a-firm-release-window-because-every-publisher-wants-to-make-sure-to-steer-clear-of-that-one-games-release-date" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "That one game had its release date announced, right? Every publisher wants to make sure to steer clear of that one game’s release date. But what if we were to flex a little and release it on the same day? Yeah, nope--just thinking about that is way too scary. Alright then, see you later."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Romeo is a Dead Man - Announce Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Several other games are wary of being caught in GTA 6's wake, as the next entry in the series is expected to be a sales juggernaut. The recent delay from 2025 to 2026 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-gta-6-delay-and-switch-2-launch-could-impact-video-games-in-2025-and-beyond/1100-6531553/">could also have a negative impact to the tune of $2.7 billion on the video game industry this year</a>, but analysts have predicted that GTA 6 will contribute to a jump in hardware sales when it's released in May 2026. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick recently commented on the new launch date and expressed confidence that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-suggests-no-more-delays-says-recent-push-is-less-than-6-months/1100-6531629/">another GTA 6 delay is unlikely</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Romeo Is a Dead Man is shaping up to be another memorable adventure from Suda51. The game puts you in the shoes of FBI Space-Time special agent Romeo Stargazer, who travels the universe to hunt down fugitives and bring them to justice by using over-the-top methods. It'll be out--presumably way after GTA 6--on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S next year.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> team is gearing up for the first patch since its release earlier this year. Actually, it is working on two patches at the moment, with those who are part of the Steam Beta getting first dibs.</p>
<p>The first of these two patches will focus on "quests, major bugs and blockers, and quality of life fixes," the developer said. Those on the Beta path will be able to experience these changes from today, 5th June. The rest of us will then follow next week, on 11th June.</p>
<p>A second patch will be released at a later date, though we don't know when just now, and this chap will be focused on Oblivion Remastered's performance.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> may be getting a next gen update alongside a port to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>On YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyhMv3N8UKk&amp;t=597s">Nate the Hate's Xbox Showcase Predictions video</a>, the leaker stated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>' cowboy classic will receive the update and a port to Nintendo's latest console release later this year. It follows reports of a Switch 2 port from last month, adding to its veracity.</p>
<p>Nate the Hate previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest">Switch 2 reveal would be imminent back in January of this year</a>, and also noted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-release-acclaimed-first-party-game-on-another-platform-report-suggests">Xbox would be bringing more of its third-party games to other platforms</a> before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-hi-fi-rush-on-ps5-and-the-xbox-multi-platform-story-so-far">Hi-Fi Rush's departure to the PS5</a>. There's a track record of accuracy there, though given these are still leaks take them with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>He elaborated this Switch 2 port of Red Dead Redemption 2 would come "a few months" following the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, speculating a late summer / early autumn window. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Given that the Switch 2 is out today</a>, that means if this is true the timer starts… Now.</p>
<p>This comes following another report by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/exclusive-red-dead-redemption-2-for-nintendo-switch-2-may-arrive-this-year-1544753/">GameReactor</a>, stating a Switch 2 port will be coming later this year. So this isn't a rumour out of the blue, there are multiple voices stating it'll happen in the near future.</p>
<p>Take Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-reportedly-set-for-switch-2-as-take-two-boss-praises-nintendos-console">recently praised the Switch 2</a>, and the industry giant has multiple other games set to release on the platform including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nba-2k24">NBA 2K</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wwe-2k24">WWE 2K</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven't had a chance to play it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-review-9">Red Dead Redemption 2 is a fantastic open world game</a> that absolutely earned its consumer and critical acclaim since releasing back in 2018. If it does come to the Switch 2, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">it'll join Cyberpunk 2077</a>, which could make the console a grand starting point for a dive into vast open worlds.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-elysium-hands-on-preview-the-skys-the-limit/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Echoes of Elysium doesn't begin the way you'd expect a survival game to begin. At least, you don't physically start where you'd expect to be in a survival game. Mostly, you'd expect to be plopped into a forest of some sort, with nothing but trees and possibilities in front of you.</p>
<p>The possibilities part remains, but instead of trees, you enter into the world of Echoes of Elysium on a ship, floating in the sky, ready for you to get everything moving. Starting high in the sky is jarring, if nothing else, and it immediately sets your relationship with the opening hours of Elysium in a different light than your relationship with the opening hours of most survival games.</p>
<p>That's because it's pretty cool. Your mileage may vary on how much you like that, but at least when I first looked around at a big blue sky, with flying islands on the horizon and crafting materials floating upwards through the air, I thought it was a cool way to kick off a survival game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Echoes-of-Elysium-Preview-2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I also have a sense that any game that starts you off with a jetpack can't be that bad, but this whole opening, while cool, is where the issues with its setting immediately appear.</p>
<p>As part of its inclusion in the June 2025 Steam Next Fest, I got to check out the demo for Echoes of Elysium ahead of the demo's release. I want to say off the top that there is plenty I like about Echoes of Elysium, and I know that this is just a slice of a game that, when it does arrive, will launch into early access.</p>
<p>It's not going to be finished, it's going to evolve and change, and everything I might have a problem with could be gone from the game in a year. Also, the version I've been playing in this demo is specifically focused on building and crafting, so there's not much to do beyond exploring, gathering resources, and building your ship.</p>
<p>That said, as jarring and exciting as it is to begin your journey already in the sky, it's just as jarring when I started to feel the pain points with being anchored entirely to your ship, with the game's current pacing structure.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Echoes-of-Elysium-Preview-3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>You can't go anywhere. At least, at the beginning, you can't. Your ship has no fuel, so you need to go through a multistep process to make fuel, and then you can fly around, and still get nowhere. Your ship moves so slowly when you start that it might as well not be moving. And when you get to the islands, at least in this demo, there isn't much to do.</p>
<p>The saving grace is the fact that you can perform this bunny-hop with the jetpack, by using it to gain some distance and then cutting it to rebuild stamina while you fall for a short time, and then activating your jetpack again. Executed correctly, you'll never run out of stamina and can travel longer distances than you probably should be capable of without a ship. But at least it's faster than your ship.</p>
<p>There is a benefit to being slow, which is the fact that the game is easy on the eyes. The art style reminds me of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-falconeer-stuck-holding-pattern/">The Falconeer</a>, a game I loved playing primarily because it was nice to just calmly fly around and take in the sights. I can still appreciate that in Echoes of Elysium, but it would also be nice to get somewhere, even in the demo, just to see a glimpse even, of what it looks like to be tens or even hundreds of hours in, with a more complete ship and everything else the game has to offer.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Echoes-of-Elysium-Preview-4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>It sounds like I'm complaining a lot, and maybe I am, but the truth is that nothing I've played so far in Echoes of Elysium has me extremely worried, or thinking that the game is bad. I just think even with this version of the game that's just focused on building and crafting, it's too slow to start, and that developer Loric Games will need some time to build it and work out pacing issues.</p>
<p>I think it has a very strong foundation and is already shaping up to be a pretty good game, to be clear, that has a strong setting and a good art style. On a conceptual level, I appreciate that you're anchored to your ship and that your experience in the game depends almost entirely on how much time you put into making your ship exactly the way you want it.</p>
<p>Everything funnels into making your ship, or (eventually) ships, exactly how you want them. It's nice to immediately have a connection to your base of operations in that way, and I felt immediately engaged in wanting to play longer just to build up my ship, rather than explore more of the narrative or do plenty of quests. Not that there's a lot of that in this demo, or any, from what I saw, but my time with the demo was perpetually looped within its opening hours.</p>

<figure></figure>


<p>I hit several bugs that soft-locked my progression and made me restart my game, which didn't always fix them, a couple of freezes, and a hard crash back out to my desktop. Things like enemies and resources clipping into the ground on islands, my ship clipping into the bottom of an island, which meant I couldn't reach it when I jumped off of it (I also couldn't pilot it out). Location-based text that did not disappear from the middle of the screen, well after I had left the location; these were all issues that happened at least twice, but nothing bothered me too much. It's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2644050/Echoes_of_Elysium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an early access title</a>, it's not going to be perfect, and while I saw all these issues, they weren't ruining gameplay sessions by happening constantly in the time I put into the demo.</p>

<p>If you like MMO survival crafting games and a bit of ship building, then it's worth your time to check out the demo when it's available, but for now, the sky being the only limit to Echoes of Elysium is both a bit of a blessing and a curse. Hopefully, one day it's just a blessing.</p>

There are four of them: magic, fire, lightning, and holy. When Recluse hits an enemy with a Magic attack, a Magic elemental residue will appear around the enemy. You can tell which kind of residue an enemy has by the color of your targeting reticle. Blue is magic, red is fire, yellow is lightning and gold is holy.</p><figure id="" data-id="53bf5a0e7222bdabc2b65d5ff528c71c" data-recommend-id="image://53bf5a0e7222bdabc2b65d5ff528c71c" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Recluse attacks enemies while standing amongst rubble." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Recluse attacks enemies while standing amongst rubble." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="53bf5a0e7222bdabc2b65d5ff528c71c" data-recommend-id="image://53bf5a0e7222bdabc2b65d5ff528c71c" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Recluse attacks enemies while standing amongst rubble." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Residues can also be collected from teammates as well</strong>. If they get hit with a fire attack, they’ll accumulate fire residues. Elemental Defense works in tandem with Recluse’s Character Skill called Magic Cocktail, as it augments her offensive power and helps restore FP.</p><h2 id="h97647"><a id="2"></a>Ability: Magic Cocktail</h2><p>Recluse’s character skill is Magic Cocktail. Here, she absorbs the residues to create a unique spell that doesn’t cost FP to unleash on enemies or give support to allies. The cocktail’s composition is entirely dependent on the combination of three residues absorbed. You can tell which residues you have by the three smaller icons on top of the character Skill icon.</p><p>For example, two fire residues and a holy one creates a torch that raises max HP and reduces status ailment buildup in allies. Having three separate elemental residues results in the most powerful cocktails. For example, a Magic/Fire/Lightning cocktail creates a giant gravity orb that pulls in enemies before exploding, dealing massive damage.</p><figure id="" data-id="33dfff0ca684a14fd8ccd6a637b28b35" data-recommend-id="image://33dfff0ca684a14fd8ccd6a637b28b35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1073" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Recluse attacks an enemy in a courtyard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Recluse attacks an enemy in a courtyard." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="33dfff0ca684a14fd8ccd6a637b28b35" data-recommend-id="image://33dfff0ca684a14fd8ccd6a637b28b35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1073" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Recluse attacks an enemy in a courtyard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You don’t necessarily always have control of which elemental residues appear. However, it can be manipulated through coordination with your teammates. If your entire squad is decked out with fire elemental weapons, then you’ll be able to cast fire elemental cocktails frequently. But if one of your allies has a holy weapon, then you’ll sometimes absorb holy residues from enemies, leading to some variations on what cocktails you’ll create.</p><p>This ability is also the key way of restoring FP in the middle of a fight. Every time Recluse absorbs residues, she’ll replenish her FP. This keeps her from becoming a sitting duck and lets her keep the offensive pressure on. You will still need to manage your FP carefully, however, as running out completely means you’re going to have to use a consumable item or wait for an ally to get hit so that you can absorb their residue.</p><h2 id="h97648"><a id="3"></a>Ultimate Art: Soulblood Song</h2><p>Recluse’s Ultimate Art is Soulblood Song, which causes her to create a red sigil with blood runes on the ground. While in the sigil, you and your allies will restore HP and FP by attacking any enemies within its range. This will help increase your squad’s survivability.</p><figure id="" data-id="e709906dfc88da5751cb5af6c9cfc057" data-recommend-id="image://e709906dfc88da5751cb5af6c9cfc057" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Blood surounds Recluse and her enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Blood surounds Recluse and her enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->cc</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e709906dfc88da5751cb5af6c9cfc057" data-recommend-id="image://e709906dfc88da5751cb5af6c9cfc057" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Blood surounds Recluse and her enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The most opportune time to use Soulblood Song against a boss is when its stance is about to break and it doubles over, leaving it vulnerable to critical hits. This allows Recluse to maximize the amount of time Soulbood Song is out on the field while the boss is briefly incapacitated. This attack can also be augmented with other effects through passive buffs dropped by bosses, such as increasing Recluse’s max HP.</p><h2 id="h97649"><a id="4"></a>A look at Recluse’s attributes</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>HP</strong>: D</li><li><strong>FP</strong>: A</li><li><strong>Stamina</strong>: C</li><li><strong>Strength</strong>: D</li><li><strong>Dexterity</strong>: C</li><li><strong>Intelligence</strong>: S</li><li><strong>Faith</strong>: S</li><li><strong>Arcane</strong>: C</li></ul><p>As expected, Recluse’s FP and intelligence are her highest stats, which makes sense since she’s a magic-based character. Her best weapons include staves which scale perfectly with her high intelligence.</p><p>Since her HP and stamina stats are low in comparison, she heavily relies on her teammates to distract enemies while she builds up elemental residues and casts spells. Additionally, Recluse should take full advantage of consumable and throwable items like Starlight Shards and elemental pots. The former lets her replenish FP in a pinch while the latter like Fire Pots and Lightning Pots let her create residues to mix Magic Cocktails and restore FP.</p><hr><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Could he do that? Was that even allowed? To quote a future MITB winner, “YES!”</p><p>Edge speared what was left of Cena, and Cena kicked out because, well, did I mention the Super Cena thing? He then speared him a second time and captured his first WWE title.</p><p>We’re desensitized to this type of MITB moment now because it’s the norm, but at the time, the WWE Universe hadn’t experienced anything like it. It broke their collective brain.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="90edc99c952f4f83161aa62c4089346c" data-recommend-id="image://90edc99c952f4f83161aa62c4089346c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1068" data-height="710" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rob Van Dam celebrating his win" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rob Van Dam celebrating his win" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="90edc99c952f4f83161aa62c4089346c" data-recommend-id="image://90edc99c952f4f83161aa62c4089346c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1068" data-height="710" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rob Van Dam celebrating his win" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>From 2003 – early 2025, John Cena was the consummate good guy… save for one night in 2006.</p><p>Rob Van Dam elected to cash in his MITB briefcase at ECW One Night Stand and had the ultimate home court advantage.

They threatened to riot if Cena won.</p><p>At first, visibly shaken by the vitriol, Cena started to embrace it as the match went on, wrestling as a villain. He beat down the underdog RVD for a majority of the contest (a role reversal for Cena) and nailed him in the head with steel steps. He even knocked out the referee.</p><p>This wasn’t Super Cena. This was Lex Luther. Edge slid out from under the ring and speared Big Match John through a table. As fans chanted “Thank you, Edge,” RVD frog-splashed Cena, and Paul Heyman counted the pinfall.</p><p>Plankton had a better shot of stealing the Krabby Patty secret formula than John Cena did of losing in 2006.

Barrett was granted a rematch, and as “The Viper” made his way to the ring, the Nexus jumped him, badly injuring his knee.</p><p>Still, the match went on as scheduled, and as Barrett closed in on a win, Cena returned to interfere, and a hobbled Orton hit Barrett with an RKO to retain.</p><p>Night over. All is good in the world. Right? Wrong.</p><p>Shortly after commentator Jerry “The King” Lawler remarked, “Awesome, awesome,” on Randy Orton’s heroic title defense, The Awesome One’s music hit and he cashed in his briefcase, much to the chagrin of the WWE Universe. Miz targeted Randy’s knee and pulled off one of the smoothest finisher reversals you’ll ever see, countering an attempted RKO into a silky Skull-Crushing Finale.</p><p>The storytelling beats in just one evening amounted to an electrifying, heat-generating cash-in.

A DQ finish meant the champion retained, cementing the first instance that a MITB winner was unsuccessful in their cash-in attempt. Punk’s actions afterwards made the moment even more stunning.</p><p>As Show attacked Cena, the champ slinked into the corner and watched, agonizing over whether he should help. Amid the hesitation, The Rock’s music hit, and he made the save. Before he could hit the People’s Elbow on Show, Punk clotheslined and then GTS’d The Great One.</p><p>Punk turned heel, something he hadn’t been since his infamous pipe bomb promo.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f01ce8e8c16bca0c50dbb9607341b89b" data-recommend-id="image://f01ce8e8c16bca0c50dbb9607341b89b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Randy Orton (right) celebrating his WWE title win with Triple H (right)" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Randy Orton (right) celebrating his WWE title win with Triple H (right)" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f01ce8e8c16bca0c50dbb9607341b89b" data-recommend-id="image://f01ce8e8c16bca0c50dbb9607341b89b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Randy Orton (right) celebrating his WWE title win with Triple H (right)" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Nelson Mandela. Betty White. 2013 Daniel Bryan. What do these three have in common? Untouchable approval ratings.</p><p>John Cena (after this slide, I promise you won’t see him again) hand-picked the leader of the YES! Movement to be his SummerSlam opponent for the WWE title. After an entertaining contest, Bryan won! Vanquishing Cena clean—sans shenanigans—is no easy feat, but the real shocker came post-match.</p><p>The MITB briefcase holder Randy Orton walked down the ramp, teasing a cash-in. Before he could make a move, special guest referee Triple H shockingly pedigreed Bryan, turning heel and allowing Orton to pin an incapacitated Bryan to steal the WWE Championship minutes after he’d won it.</p><p>The Game’s actions led to the formation of The Authority. Of course, the group’s relentless mission to prevent Bryan from ever becoming champion culminated in a WrestleMania 30 payoff for the ages, and it all started from one MITB cash-in.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="444b3fbff39d6d16cf49fdf29b992f98" data-recommend-id="image://444b3fbff39d6d16cf49fdf29b992f98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Seth Rollins Staring At The Championship" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Seth Rollins Staring At The Championship" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="444b3fbff39d6d16cf49fdf29b992f98" data-recommend-id="image://444b3fbff39d6d16cf49fdf29b992f98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Seth Rollins Staring At The Championship" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>WWE fans can smell a forced babyface push from a mile away. That’s why they couldn’t bear the stench of a Roman Reigns victory at WrestleMania 31. The not-yet Tribal Chief would challenge his toughest opponent yet; Brock Lesnar, a man who ended The Undertaker’s undefeated streak at WrestleMania a year prior and six months earlier squashed John Cena to win the WWE Championship.</p><p>Given Roman’s recent Royal Rumble triumph, awkward co-sign from The Rock, and defeat of mega face Daniel Bryan at FastLane, it was a foregone conclusion that this was Roman’s time. He was WWE brass’s chosen one.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http://kotaku.com/wwe-seth-rollins-captain-america-marvel-1851737016&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://kotaku.com/wwe-seth-rollins-captain-america-marvel-1851737016">Seth Rollins</a></span> had other plans.</p><p>About 15 minutes into Lesnar and Reigns’ slugfest, Rollins ran to the ring and cashed in, turning the main event bout into a Triple Threat match. Seth curb stomped his former Shield brother, pinned him, and ran away with the title—the first of his career—in jaw-dropping fashion. The “heist” denied Reigns the same accomplishment, much to the delight of the WWE Universe.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="25ab8b179ea47edb4b383caf6cfcb876" data-recommend-id="image://25ab8b179ea47edb4b383caf6cfcb876" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tiffany Stratton winning the WWE Women's Title" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tiffany Stratton winning the WWE Women's Title" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="25ab8b179ea47edb4b383caf6cfcb876" data-recommend-id="image://25ab8b179ea47edb4b383caf6cfcb876" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tiffany Stratton winning the WWE Women's Title" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s not a coincidence that we’re fast-forwarding 10 years into the future to reach our next moment on the list. Before it was Tiffy’s time to cash in her Money In The Bank briefcase, 37 other superstars had done the same. There are only so many new ways to shock the WWE Universe, but Tiffany Stratton did just that.</p><p>On the January 3 episode of Smackdown, Tiffy’s friend Nia Jax defended her WWE Women’s Championship in a match against Naomi. As the contest was coming to a head, Stratton’s music hit, and she ran down to the ring holding her briefcase in one hand and the ref’s hand in another.</p><p>Despite the telltale signs of a cash-in, Tiffy instead hit Naomi in the head with her briefcase, aiding Jax to victory as she’d done several times previously.</p><p>We were swerved. And then, we were swerved again. As Bianca Belair went to check on Naomi, Jax attacked Belair and set her up for The Annihilator. Before she could execute it, Stratton whacked Jax with the briefcase, Belair followed up with a massive Kiss of Death and Tiffy took advantage, landing the Prettiest Moonsault Ever on Jax for the 1-2-3.</p><p>Betraying a friend—who was also the champion—with a cash-in is something we’d never seen. The soft face turn and exuberant crowd reaction helped solidify the moment in MITB lore.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Ubisoft gave its Call of duty rival just four months before confirming it would discontinue support. <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-au/article/1EywTnGrZdDqCoxKs2zNhZ/ubisoft-discontinues-development-on-xdefiant" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Almost half the team lost their jobs</u></a> as Ubisoft made a swath of cuts across its San Francisco and Osaka studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Producer Mark Rubin, who led development fo the game having previously worked on the Call of Duty series at Activision, called it a "sad day" in a lengthy statement posted to <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1930403826378649786" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>X/Twitter</u></a> earlier today. After thanking his co-workers for making a "really fun and terrific game," he announced he's decided to "leave the industry" for good.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"In case everyone doesn’t know, the team behind XDefiant was all let go at the end of last year and I know many people have moved on to other studios, which is great, and I hope that for all of those still looking, that they find something quickly," Rubin wrote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As for me, I’ve decided to leave the industry and spend more time with my family so unfortunately you won’t be hearing about me making another game. I do care passionately about the shooter space and hope that someone else can pick up the flag that I was trying to carry and make games again that care about the players, treat them with respect and listen to what they have to say."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rubin said the team made "remarkable" progress despite "very little marketing," claiming that despite a lack of advertising, XDefiant "still had the fastest acquisition of players in the first few weeks for a Ubisoft title" just from word-of-mouth promotion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But unfortunately, with little to no marketing, especially after launch, we weren’t acquiring new players after the initial launch," he added, before claiming Ubisoft's in-house game engine "wasn't designed for what [XDefiant] was doing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We had other issues, though, as well that we tried to be transparent about. For one we had crippling tech debt using an engine that wasn’t designed for what we were doing, and we didn’t have the engineering resources to ever correct that. I do personally think that in-house engines are not the valuable investment that they used to be, and they are often doomed to fall behind big engines like Unreal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This tech debt included the dreaded netcode issues that we could just not solve given the architecture we were dealing with," he added. "And so, for many players with solid network connections (in both speed and consistent reliability) the game played well but if your connection had even the smallest amount of inconsistency the engine just couldn’t handle it and you would have a bad experience. Normally, you should be able to weather those bad moments on your network. But this was a major issue with XDefiant."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">XDefiant Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rubin also lamented the lack of resources to make content. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Another issue we had was having the right resources to make content for the game. What we saw at Season 3 wasn’t even enough content in my mind for launch. There were some really cool features coming later in Season 4 or even 5 that would have completed the game in a way that I felt it should have been for launch. I can say everyone’s (devs, HQ leadership, etc.) heart was in the right place, but we just didn’t have the gas to go the distance for a free-to-play game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xdefiant-dev-says-we-have-done-very-little-marketing-so-yes-our-numbers-are-down-denies-support-could-end-after-season-4-if-player-count-doesnt-improve"><u>Ubisoft insisted it wasn't shutting XDefiant down</u></a>, then announced it would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled"><u>shutting XDefiant down just a few weeks later</u></a>.

There are bugs and glitches in Oblivion Remastered just as there are in almost every video game upon release, particularly Bethesda games. Now, Betheda is sharing the first update for the game to address some of these issues.</p><p>Through the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2623190/view/536603447519088660" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Steam page</a>, Bethesda laid out the contents of Oblivion Remastered's Update 1.1. This is the first of two separate updates that Bethesda plans to launch in the near future, although the second one doesn't have a date attached to it yet. Update 1.1 and its follow-up will be released on the Steam Beta first before being shared with Oblivion Remastered's console counterparts.</p><p>Update 1.1 is out today, June 5, on Oblivion Remastered's Steam Beta, and the wider rollout of the update will begin on June 11. The initial update is intended to tackle the major bugs that have come up, although some of the glitches addressed--including the disappearance of Vincente Valtieri's hair and High Chancellor Ocato's immobile arms--are unintentionally funny. The second planned update will concentrate on improving the game's performance.

He's known for his roles in The Tudors, Shadow and Bone, and Tolkien. Most recently, he played a young Dexter Morgan on the Dexter prequel series Original Sin. Indeed, Gibson certainly looks the part. But anything is possible.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/GameRoll_/status/1930385920907227230" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The new James Bond is 100% played by Patrick Gibson.<br>He’s an Irish actor who I know as playing Dexter in Dexter: Original Sin.<br>He’s a PHENOMENAL actor and I’m sure he’ll be GREAT as Bond! <a href="https://t.co/q58Cn0eQE7" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/q58Cn0eQE7</a></p>  — GameRoll (@GameRoll_) <a href="https://twitter.com/GameRoll_/status/1930385920907227230?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>As of yet, however, IO Interactive has yet to announce who is playing Bond in First Light.

This is a brand-new character, but some of the Bond series veterans like M, Q, and Moneypenny will appear in First Light as well.</p><p>Like Bond himself, actors playing those roles have yet to be confirmed, nor do we know who's playing the mysterious character Isola or any of the "whole new cast of villains."</p><p>First Light tells the story of how James Bond became 007, picking up with Bond when he was a 26-year-old recruit from the Royal Navy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/after-working-its-magic-on-zelda-and-splatoon-it-turns-out-monolith-soft-also-aided-development-of-mario-kart-world<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Monolith Soft has officially announced the company helped with the development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>The developer, which previously assisted with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon-2">Splatoon 2</a> <a href="https://x.com/MONOLITHSOFT/status/1930459571275084157">has stated on social media</a> it developed the "fields and character designs" for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Nintendo Switch 2</a> racing game.</p>
<p>The studio has a history of open world video game development, becoming something of an expert in that particular area given the time spent on recent Zelda titles as well as its own Xenoblade releases. As such it makes sense why Nintendo would bring Monolith Soft over for Mario Kart World given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">the games' shift to a non-linear format</a>.</p>

<p>In 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-now-fully-owns-xenoblade-studio-monolith-soft">Nintendo became the sole owner of Monolith Soft</a> after years of holding roughly 80 percent of the company since 2007. In 2011, Nintendo would increase its stake to 97 percent of the company, after which those working there contributed to popular Nintendo series like Animal Crossing, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon">Splatoon</a>, and Zelda.</p>
<p>In recent years, Monolith Soft has largely been known for its ongoing Xenoblade series. In 2022 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a> was released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-3-review-a-jrpg-masterpiece">to high critical praise</a>, and would continue this trend in 2025 with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>.</p>
<p>The original version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> was something of a technical marvel in the Wii U, and its Switch version brought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch-tech-review">that same quality packaged with various visual updates</a>, dynamic resolution scaling, and greater environment detail among other tweaks and improvements.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last night, we got our first good look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>'s upcoming James Bond game, 007: First Light. While the developer has said that First Light - or as it was previously known, Project 007 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-a-fresh-faced-whipper-snapper-of-a-james-bond-in-007-first-light">will serve as an origin story for the spy</a>, and not be a "gamification" of any of the films that have come before, last night's trailer still had a fair few nods to Bonds of the past.</p>
<p>Please note, I will be talking about events from the James Bond series generally below, <strong>so please be aware of potential spoilers for the films and books if you haven't already enjoyed them for yourself</strong>.</p>

<p>First up, there is this Bond's facial scar. As you can see in the trailer above, this young Bond may be fresh faced when it comes to life as an agent, but he has clearly had a few scrapes already, earning himself a long thin scar down his cheek.</p>
<p>While the Bonds in the films have not boasted a scar like this, the book version of Bond did. Ian Flemming wrote that Bond had a three-inch long, thin vertical scar running down his right cheek. You can see some artwork of this book-based Bond below.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Meanwhile, given his overall look in the game, many have surmised that the actor playing James Bond in First Light is Patrick Gibson from Dexter: Original Sin (I have asked IO if they can confirm this).</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paramount</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In addition to this physical trait, there are also multiple other nods to the James Bond book and film series scattered throughout First Light's trailer that hint to the story, such as Bond's parents dying in a climbing-related accident.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the trailer says 009 is a "master manipulator", which made me think this was a little tease for him being a bit of a bad egg that fooled and betrayed his country a la Sean Bean's 006 from GoldenEye. A little number flip there from IO?</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>On the cars and gadget side of things, because of course Bond is going to have cars and gadgets, First Light again is honouring the series that has come before.</p>
<p>In IO's trailer, Bond can be seen entering Q branch, where he selects one from a number of watches. This watch obviously does more than tell the time, and triggers a blast from a nearby motorbike, which again is in keeping with Bond's watches from the series.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>IO</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While in the Sean Connory era, Bond often sported a Rolex Submariner, in many of the later films he changed things up a bit, with the agent wearing watches such as a Pulsar LED digital and a Seiko 0674 LC at times. </p>
<p>In 2006's Casino Royale, which marked Daniel Craig's first outing as the MI6 agent, Vesper Lynd commented on Bond's watch: "Rolex?" she asks. "Omega," he replies. Bond's watches are a big deal, and in First Light, <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/1930380893811610084">IO has partnered with Omega</a> once again.</p>

<p>Speaking of partnering with a known Bond-brand again, of course we will see the agent in an Aston Martin in First Light.</p>
<figure>

<p>This vehicle is slicker than Moore's bus from Live and Let Die, but it is the same as the actors' yellow Aston Martin DBS from The Persauders, so another little nod to the series' legacy.</p>

<p>Additionally, we can see IO's Bond chasing down a red sports car in the First Light trailer, which reminded me a bit of the playful chase between Pierce Brosnan's Bond and Xenia Onatopp in GoldenEye.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>MGM</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Setting the scene further, then, we also saw a chess game being played during last night's trailer. Now, we don't clearly see <em>who </em>is playing chess here, so it could be Bond flexing his prowess like he often does at cards. And is that a martini, shaken not stirred?</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>IO</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That said, in From Russia with Love, there is a scene where Bond baddy Kronsteen plays chess, so as soon as I saw this moment in the First Light trailer, I thought of that. Essentially, baddies play chess, right?</p>

<p>There is a clip towards the end of the trailer where a speed boat zips through some islands very much like those from The Man With the Golden Gun (Khao Phing Kan, but known also as James Bond Island, no less). This is one of my favourite James Bond locations, so I was pleased to see this pop up. </p>
<figure>

<p>Also, the Junks in this scene are much like those of Scaramanger's.</p>

<p>Last up for this piece (I am sure I will be doing more, because guys, it's Bond!), the music played over the trailer was the theme from On Her Majesty's Secret Service. You can have a listen to it below. </p>
