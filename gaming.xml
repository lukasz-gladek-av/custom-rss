<p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2026-01-05T19:35:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Mon 5th Jan 2026, 7:35pm</time>]:</strong> After the initial tease way back in April last year, publisher Electric Airship has finally confirmed that Kasey Ozymy's fantastic surreal RPG, Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass, is coming to Switch on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Heavily inspired by SNES RPGs while putting its own unique dreamlike twist on the genre, Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass' console port is more than just that, with the brand new trailer (up top) teasing "new never-before-seen levels!", new enemies, enhanced visuals, a CRT filter, new fonts, and even more.</p>
<p>Blending horror elements with all of those classic retro RPG tropes, Jimmy's adventures in his dreams promise to be memorable and emotional.</p>
<p>For more info, check out this summary from the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/706560/Jimmy_and_the_Pulsating_Mass/">Steam page</a> and check out our original story from last year below...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass</em> is a Japanese-style RPG made by a guy from Texas. It was very much influenced by SNES-era jRPGs, particularly <em>Earthbound</em>, <em>Final Fantasy 5</em>, and the <em>Breath of Fire</em> series, among others. It was also heavily influenced by <em>Yume Nikki</em>.</p>
<p>The game takes place in the dream of an eight-year-old boy. When an alien entity appears and threatens his family and the stability of the dream world itself, Jimmy sets out on an adventure to save his family and eradicate the threat of the Pulsating Mass. Along the way, Jimmy will have to work with his family, confront his own shortcomings, and brave the creeping nightmares of his subconscious.</p>
<p><strong>Features:<br></strong>-Full-length Japanese-style RPG.<br>
-Classic turn-based combat with some modern sensibilities.<br>
-A big emphasis on exploration.<br>
-As an empathetic kid, Jimmy gains the ability to imagine himself as several of the monsters he meets, allowing him to interact with the world in new ways.<br>
-These different transformations can also be leveled up, granting Jimmy higher stats and new abilities.<br>
-A story for adults delivered from the perspective of a child.<br>
-Jokes.<br>
-Unspeakable horrors.</p>
</blockquote><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> <strong>Wed 16th Apr, 2025 19:30 BST</strong>: We all know just how influential <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/earthbound">EarthBound</a> is at this point. Despite initially underselling and putting people off with weird marketing campaigns, the game (and, in turn, series) is one of the most beloved games on the SNES. So it's no wonder that EarthBound-inspired games are a dime a dozen.</p>
<p>Here's one that may have flown under the radar for many, however — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/jimmy_and_the_pulsating_mass">Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass</a> from solo developer Kasey Ozymy, a "guy from Texas" who loves Japanese and Japanese-style RPGs. His debut game, made entirely in RPG Maker, launched on Steam and itch.io in August 2018. And now, Ozymy's studio, Starseed Games, is partnering with publisher Electric Airship to bring the turn-based RPG to all consoles, including Switch.</p>
<p>We don't have a date yet, or anything else besides a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/electricairship.com/post/3lmrjrnqbzh26">Bluesky</a> from Electric Airship stating "we are working with Starseed Games". But it's something.</p>

<p>With fewer than <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/706560/Jimmy_and_the_Pulsating_Mass/">500 Steam reviews</a>, and only a handful of mostly-glowing reviews from smaller outlets such as <a href="https://gamingtrend.com/reviews/jimmy-and-the-pulsating-mass-review-a-work-of-genius-and-empathy-makes-this-jrpg-a-new-classic-that-should-not-be-ignored/">Gaming Trend</a>, <a href="https://www.cubed3.com/">Cubed3</a>, and <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/review/jimmy-and-the-pulsating-mass/">RPGFan</a> (where, full disclosure, the author of this news article is a former writer at RPGFan), not many people are talking about it. YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAAXdU8SZw0&amp;ab_channel=NitroRad">Nitro Rad also produced a video</a> on the game prior to release. And, from what we've heard, this sounds like a must-play for fans of EarthBound.</p>
<p>Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass isn't just inspired by Nintendo's subversive American-set RPG; it also takes cues from the <strong>Breath of Fire</strong> series, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/final_fantasy_v">Final Fantasy V</a>, and horror indie hit <strong>Yume Nikke</strong>. Boasting over 40 hours of content, the entire game takes place inside the dream of an eight-year-old boy called Jimmy.</p>
<p>It's got first-person turn-based combat just like Dragon Quest, but you have the ability to actually transform into some foes — as long as they're not controlled by the game's big bad, the titular Pulsating Mass. There are horrifying nightmarish dungeons, tons of sidequests, and a beautiful story at the centre of it all.</p>

<p>So, we'll be keeping an eye out for this one, then. In the meantime, you can sign up to the <a href="https://airport.electricairship.com/jimmy/">publisher's website</a> to get more details on Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass' console release and other indie RPGs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ series finale continues to be a lightning rod for controversy. While plenty of people were fine with how the Netflix horror series wrapped up after a decade, there’s a loud subset of fans who are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><span>taking to the digital streets</span></a><span> to tear it down, say awful things about the people who worked on it, and declare it the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>next </span><i><span>Game of Thrones</span></i><span>-level failure</span></a><span>. Another fraction of that group, however, is holding onto a bizarre sliver of hope with the belief that perhaps the disappointing conclusion is not all it seems. The movement, which is calling itself Conformity Gate, has gathered “evidence” indicating that the events depicted in the finale are actually an illusion and that there is still a battle left to fight, which will play out in a secret episode that’s not available on Netflix right now.</span></p>  <p><span>Obviously, we’ll be discussing the fifth season of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> here, so if you want to stay spoiler free, you should leave now. (Really, you probably shouldn’t have opened this article to begin with.) But the tl;dr of the theory is that the sterile and rushed nature of the finale is an intentional creative choice meant to reflect that it takes place in a distorted reality created by Vecna and everyone in the show is “conforming” to it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Admittedly, I fully planned to just roll my eyes at all this pretty wild speculation because I lived through the </span><i><span>Mass Effect 3 </span></i><span>ending controversy and the Indoctrination Theory, which fans believed explained that game’s finale as a hallucination but was really just a way for them to cope with not liking the way things turned out. But, I don’t know, there’s </span><i><span>some </span></i><span>compelling evidence in the theory, both based on what’s in the show and on how Netflix and show creators the Duffer Brothers have talked about it since.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Many of these details are subtle, such as the way that characters sit during the graduation scene resembling how villain Vecna sits at other points in the series, whereas others seem to be pretty overt, like Max calling out Mike’s </span><i><span>D&amp;D </span></i><span>epilogue for being too comforting, as if something is off. Here’s one of the quicker rundowns I could find, by @meechski on TikTok, but you can also find </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWAQbdjjaJk&amp;pp=ygUfY29uZm9ybWl0eSBnYXRlIHN0cmFuZ2VyIHRoaW5ncw%3D%3D"><span>much lengthier breakdowns on YouTube</span></a><span>.</span></p>

   <p><span>Also, as someone in the comments of that video points out, if you search “conformity gate” or “fake ending” on Netflix, </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>is the only search result for the latter, and one of two for the former alongside </span><i><span>Emily in Paris</span></i><span>. Make of that what you will.</span></p>

 <p><span>I don’t know that any one thing made me a full-blown believer, but taken all together, it was enough for me to at least become interested in seeing if it actually pans out. Conspiracy theories usually have at least </span><i><span>some</span></i><span> shred of plausibility that allows them to gain some traction, but they also tend to be made up of a lot of square pegs shoved into round holes. All these pieces of evidence could just be coincidences born of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-5-bad-dialogue-clips-video-will-mike-2000651378"><span>bad writing</span></a><span> and desperation.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">guys… notice how all of them are reading WHITE scripts when shawn levy confirmed the finale was printed on RED scripts… they are trying to confuse us with that trailer. i AM sure <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/confirmitygate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#confirmitygate</a> <a href="https://t.co/Pje0LF13dm">pic.twitter.com/Pje0LF13dm</a></p> <p>— ʅǝɯ | ੈ✩‧₊˚ (@melinastapes) <a href="https://twitter.com/melinastapes/status/2008186236830421086?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Luckily, we won’t really have to wait long for these hopes to be shattered, as the entire theory hinges on this hypothetical secret finale premiering on January 7, when Netflix is </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfaW74zJlmk"><span>planning to announce something about its 2026 programming</span></a><span>. Of course, I don’t want any </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fans to have to suffer a worse ending than the one they’d hoped for, but after witnessing the behavior of some members of the community in the wake of a disappointing finale, I’m also wondering if those who have said some truly heinous things about the people who worked on this show even deserve a better ending.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hytale-vampire-survivors-mod-early-access-steam-minecraft-2000656708</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Hypixel Studios, developer of the </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>-inspired survival game </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>, has shown the sandbox game’s modding capabilities with a </span><i><span>Vampire Survivors-</span></i><span>like prototype that has fans excited ahead of the game’s Early Access launch later this month. In a </span><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2007888131350212658"><span>social media post</span></a><span> over the weekend, Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme shared a 40-second gameplay clip showcasing a character fending off voxel-based hordes of enemies in a top-down view arena.</span></p> <p><span>According to Collins-Laflamme, the video shows a </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span> mod created by a team member in their spare time, and it’s intended as a proof-of-concept demo for “how different genres” could be realized within the game by fans and modders.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The following video showcases a server-side Hytale mod created by a Hytale team member in their spare time. It’s intended purely as inspiration for how different genres could be realized within Hytale! </p> <p>The gameplay shown represents only a small subset of our modding… <a href="https://t.co/YaszQv9kDb">pic.twitter.com/YaszQv9kDb</a></p> <p>— Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2007888131350212658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“The gameplay shown represents only a small subset of our modding capabilities and was used to build a simple, survivor-like experience,” Collins-Laflamme wrote. While the mod is not planned for release as part of the game, Hypixel “may publish it – or similar examples – as reference material for the community.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The video comes less than two months after Hypixel </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-hypixel-riot-canceled-revived-gameplay-minecraft-2000645466"><span>reacquired the rights</span></a><span> to</span><i><span> Hytale </span></i><span>from </span><i><span>League of Legends</span></i><span> maker Riot Games, which had previously canceled the project in June of last year. The team released a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-riot-price-low-minecraft-hypixel-2000646230"><span>16-minute gameplay trailer shortly afterwards</span></a><span>, but the latest clip is focused on </span><i><span>Hytale’s</span></i><span> potential to be a springboard for user-generated content like the Mojang hit that inspired it.</span></p>

 <h2>Hytale is gearing up for Early Access</h2> <p><span>“My prediction is, it will do very well initially and then it will slow down until the modders / servers and us start to release some major content and then it will keep growing for years to come. Especially as we add more modding tools and options,” Collins-Laflamme </span><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2006936928026026273"><span>wrote on X</span></a><span>, responding to a user who suggested that </span><i><span>Hytale’s</span></i><span> release “will probably be something huge.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The reply came from a larger thread in which the co-founder expressed feeling “anger” as the studio gets closer to the early access launch of this new version of </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>, which is slated for January 13. According to Collins-Laflamme, that’s due to pouring four years of engineering into rebuilding the game’s engine rather than working on gameplay features. In his eyes, that leaves the team with a “four-year gap and a lot of catching up to do,” alongside a rebuilt engine that is “never gonna be used.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As previously </span><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq"><span>stated by the developer in a FAQ</span></a><span>, the sandbox won’t be available on Steam at launch in order to focus on its existing community. That’s to avoid chasing “a flood of cold first impressions that could overcorrect the game’s direction.” Hypixel explained that while it doesn’t shy away from “honest, negative criticism,” the team is more interested in feedback from players who are already familiar with the game’s development background.</span></p>

 <p><span>Most importantly, the FAQ notes that Steam “currently doesn’t support” some of </span><i><span>Hytale’s</span></i><span> modding features, and that the developer “will be in contact with Valve in the near future” to try and fix that. Otherwise it might be a while before Steam users get to recreate the platform’s latest hits inside</span><i><span> Hytale</span></i><span>. </span></p>

			<p>2025 was <strong>an explosive year for shooter games</strong>. The schedule of the new year is also quite juicy, mostly thanks to <strong>Xbox Studios</strong> releasing two games based on its heavy-hitting shooter franchises in the same year: Halo Campaign Evolved and Gears of War E-Day. <span>Those two, plus Bungie's Marathon, are arguably the&nbsp;<strong>most anticipated shooter games of 2026</strong>&nbsp;based on what we currently know, but history has shown there can always be interesting surprises throughout the year.</span> Scroll down below to read our full shortlist and the honorable mentions, too.</p>

<h2 id="h-highguard-january-26-2026-pc-ps5-xss-xsx">Highguard (January 26, 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS/XSX)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Highguard-Key-Art-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Out of all the shooter games on this list, <strong>Highguard</strong> was the one <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced most recently</a>, and yet it is also going to be the first to hit the market. It was the final reveal at <strong>Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards 2025</strong> event, and that didn't do it any favors, as many viewers complained the show should have ended on a higher note.</p>



<p>Still, that doesn't mean Highguard won't be fun. The game is being developed by a new studio called <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong>, a remote-first company founded by former developers who worked on <strong>Apex Legends</strong>, <strong>Titanfall</strong>, and <strong>Call of Duty</strong>. The game is a competitive 'raid shooter' where the player characters, called <strong>Wardens</strong>, who are arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent. Players will fight rival Warden crews for control of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure victory. The gameplay footage demonstrated fairly large maps where players will also ride mounts like horses, panthers, and bears. There's definitely a bit of a fantasy vibe, with several characters showcasing magic skills. Whether that will be enough to make it unique remains to be seen.</p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-march-2026-pc-ps5-xss-xsx">Marathon (March 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS/XSX)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Marathon-Art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Bungie</strong>'s first new project since 2014's <strong>Destiny</strong> uses one of its historical franchises, <strong>Marathon</strong>. The upcoming installment launches thirty years after the previous entry, <strong>Marathon Infinity</strong>. This new game is fundamentally different, though: it's modeled after the increasingly popular <strong>extraction shooter</strong>. </p>



<p>Bungie plans to differentiate Marathon from existing extraction shooters by replacing generic characters with the so-called <strong>Runner Shells</strong>, bio-cybernetic hero archetypes like <strong>Stealth,</strong> <strong>Medic</strong>, and <strong>Destroyer</strong>, each possessing unique tactical abilities. The gameplay loop incorporates high-stakes, "raid-like" endgame scenarios on the <strong>UESC Marathon ship</strong>, where players must navigate security measures to claim high-tier artifacts.</p>



<p>The title emphasizes a persistent narrative through seasonal faction progression and <strong>The Codex</strong>, a system that tracks player achievements and non-linear story discoveries. There's also a dedicated <strong>Rook</strong> mode for solo players to scavenge in matches already in progress. Bungie also promised a player-friendly live-service model featuring <strong>non-expiring battle passes</strong> and a <strong>$39.99</strong> price point. </p>



<p>After several delays, we are now only around two months away from the game's launch. You can learn more about it <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungies-marathon-launches-march-2026-developers-provide-updated-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our report based on the latest official ViDoc</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved-tba-2026-pc-ps5-xss-xsx">Halo: Campaign Evolved (TBA 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS, XSX)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Halo_CampaignEvolved_Wallpaper-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>While Bungie, the original creator of the <strong>Halo </strong>series, readies its new Marathon game, the current caretakers of the Halo IP are remaking the game that made Bungie popular in the first place. Originally known as <strong>Halo: Combat Evolved</strong>, the 2001 release was the killer application of the first Xbox platform, as well as the first-person shooter that revolutionized the genre on consoles.</p>



<p>Following several rumors, <strong>Halo Studios</strong> (formerly known as <strong>343 Industries</strong>) has <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the existence of <strong>Halo: Campaign Evolved</strong>, a remake that focuses exclusively on the story mode, eliminating the multiplayer modes. Just like Oblivion Remastered, the game's visuals will run on Unreal Engine 5<span>, while the original engine (<strong>Blam</strong>) will</span> handle the rest. Several changes have been confirmed, including the addition of vehicle hijacking, weapon zooming, a redesigned 4-man Warthog, the optional addition of sprinting, and several level design changes that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-designer-likens-remake-to-dance-remix-classic-song-straight-to-chorus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the original level designer didn't take kindly to</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Still, Halo: Campaign Evolved <strong>will introduce the series to PlayStation users for the first time</strong>. It could be a way to revive its popularity after several games in a row that received mixed reactions from the gaming community.</p>



<h2 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day-tba-2026-pc-xbox-series-s-and-x">Gears of War: E-Day (TBA 2026 - PC, Xbox Series S and X)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gears-of-war-e-day-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Apart from last year's <strong>Gears of War: Reloaded</strong>, fans of the third-person shooter franchise originally created by <strong>Epic Games</strong> haven't received a new mainline installment since <strong>2019's Gears 5</strong>. With <strong>Gears of War: E-Day</strong>, though, developer <strong>The Coalition</strong> (which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-is-being-co-developed-by-people-can-fly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaborating with <strong>People Can Fly</strong></a>, a studio that previously worked on <strong>Gears of War Judgment</strong>, on this project) is ditching the semi-open world elements to tell a linear story once again.</p>



<p>Even so, the studio has <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-is-being-co-developed-by-people-can-fly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boasted</a> that this one will be <strong>their most ambitious game yet</strong>. E-Day, as the title itself confirms, is set <strong>fourteen years before the events seen in the first Gears of War</strong>, on the day that the <strong>Locust Horde</strong> emerged on the surface of the planet <strong>Sera</strong>. The story will feature the two young COG soldiers, <strong>Marcus Fenix</strong> and <strong>Dom Santiago</strong>, as they attempt to survive the invasion in the city of Kalona (a brand new location never before seen in previous games).</p>



<h2 id="h-witchfire-tba-2026-pc">Witchfire (TBA 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/WITCHFIRE_KEY_ART_17_Cut_withLogo_4K-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Polish indie developer <strong>The Astronauts</strong> is taking a very, very long time to make <strong>Witchfire</strong>. The studio's previous game, <strong>The Vanishing of Ethan Carter</strong>, was released in 2014, and their new project was <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-dark-fantasy-fps-astronauts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> over eight years ago at <strong>The Game Awards 2017</strong>.</p>



<p>That said, The Astronauts is a very small team, and Witchfire is a lot more ambitious than their previous adventure game. A dark fantasy shooter with <strong>roguelite</strong> elements, the game delayed its early access debut to <strong>September 2023</strong> to add <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-dark-fantasy-fps-is-delayed-to-2023-to-add-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open world maps</a>. The game was initially available only on the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> due to <strong>a timed exclusivity deal</strong> signed with Epic; the <strong>Steam</strong> early access version <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-comes-to-steam-early-access-later-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was launched exactly one year later</a>. Recently, the development team <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-surpasses-500k-units-sold-gets-reckoning-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a major update</a> called '<strong>The Reckoning</strong>' and confirmed that the game has surpassed <strong>500K units sold</strong>. However, as with most early access games, the vast majority of gamers are still waiting for the final version, slated to launch in 2026, to play.</p>

According to a post they made early on January 5, Nvidia seems poised to bring back the RTX 3060 in the first quarter of 2026.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/hongxing2020/status/2008043115308065078" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">01.05update<br>rtx3060 Q1 come back… 🥲</p>  — hongxing2020 (@hongxing2020) <a href="https://twitter.com/hongxing2020/status/2008043115308065078?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The back half of 2025 saw GPU prices sharply rise as tech companies voted to go all in on AI. In short, many of these companies need more raw computing power, which means that companies like Nvidia are now dedicating massive amounts of their own consumer stock to these ends. What little is left for consumers looking to build PCs has now risen in value, and you've likely seen as much if you've spent the last few months shopping around for the right parts for a gaming PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Just days into 2026, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amd-and-nvidia-will-reportedly-raise-gpu-prices-significantly-in-2026" rel="nofollow ">reported</a> that both AMD and Nvidia , two of the most reputable names in the business, would be raising the prices of their consumer GPUs quite heavily this year. Some of the estimates being floated sound <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/memory-crisis/" rel="nofollow ">preposterous</a>, but regardless, you better get used to the idea of paying a lot of money--more than usual, at least--for memory as we wade deeper into 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">That is, unless the rumors prove true and Nvidia does really bring back the RTX 3060, which is still one of the most<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> popular graphics cards</a> around despite being phased out for the newer (and more expensive) 40 and 50 series GPUs.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/" data-ref-id="5000-565525">Resident Evil 4 Remake's</a> opening moments could have played out much differently if Capcom had not opted to cut an opening referred to as "Chapter 0," in which players would have controlled Ashley and witnessed her kidnapping at the hands of the Los Illuminados. At least, that's according to datamined files spotted by an eagle-eyed fan.</p><p dir="ltr">Using leftover pieces from "Chapter 0" found in the game's files, YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXI-MrzgZXU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thekempy</a> has pieced together what the game's lost opening might have looked like in a recent video. Players would have controlled Ashley alone in a forest at night as she encountered a Los Illuminados ritual, something which can actually be briefly seen in a story trailer for the game released in October 2022.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXI-MrzgZXU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nXI-MrzgZXU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">After witnessing the sacrifice, Ashley would have made her way to the center of the game's village, potentially having to use the light of her phone to navigate and sneak past deadly enemies like the Ganado. Her running would become more frantic as the chapter continued, eventually witnessing a Ganado kidnapping another character, Luis Serra.</p><p dir="ltr">While the cutscenes for the cut chapter aren't found in the Resident Evil 4 remake's files, there are some leftover enemy spawn locations, scripted events triggers, auto-save locations, and even off-limit areas that help give an idea of what the chapter would have looked like.</p><p dir="ltr">It's unclear why this opening chapter, something that doesn't exist in the original Resident Evil 4, was cut prior to launch. Thekempy speculates Capcom's decision may have been related to pacing, as an opening chapter focusing on Ashley hiding and sneaking would have slowed down a game known for its non-stop action.</p><p dir="ltr">Capcom is far from finished remaking Resident Evil games. Reports have indicated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-are-the-next-remakes-for-the-franchise-report/1100-6523753/" data-ref-id="1100-6523753">remakes of Resident Evil Zero and Code Veronica</a> may be coming in the next few years, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-resident-evil-0-remake-will-flesh-out-originals-story-report/1100-6535568/" data-ref-id="1100-6535568">Resident Evil 0 remake reportedly looking to further flesh out</a> characters and plot details only alluded to in the original game.</p><p dir="ltr">The next mainline entry in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6532378/" data-ref-id="1100-6532378">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, will bring back <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leon-kennedy-is-back-in-resident-evil-requiem-and-now-he-has-a-chainsaw/1100-6536786/" data-ref-id="1100-6536786">Resident Evil 4's Leon S.

                <p>Steam hit a major milestone already this year, setting a new record for concurrent users. According to SteamDB, the platform peaked at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">41,816,052 users online at the same time</a> actively playing games. Not only that, but a new record for actively gaming users was also set, with that figure reaching <a href="https://mein-mmo.de/en/steam-starts-in-2026-in-the-best-way-already-breaking-a-record-after-4-days,1544545/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">almost 13.4 million</a> as compared to March's 13.2 million record.</p><p>The timing of the record is likely no coincidence.<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-winter-sale-2025-game-deals/2900-7360/#g2a_2025_1694524" data-ref-id="2900-7360"> Steam's annual Winter Sale</a>, which wraps up later today, offered steep discounts on a wide range of popular titles, along with more modest deals on newer releases. Sales events have long been a reliable driver of traffic on Steam, pulling in both longtime users and players returning to pick up games they missed throughout the year.</p><p>Steam's growth has been steady for well over a decade, but it has accelerated sharply in recent years. A notable spike occurred in early 2020, when COVID-19 lockdowns pushed concurrent users past 23 million, later climbing to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-passes-28-million-concurrent-users-setting-new-record/1100-6499464/" data-ref-id="1100-6499464">28 million just a couple of years later</a>. The company even offered a bundle of games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-covid-19-bundle-has-4-fantastic-indie-games-/1100-6475753/" data-ref-id="1100-6475753">which went to COVID relief at the time</a>. Since then, the rise of live-service games and consistently strong seasonal sales have helped keep players logged in, especially during holidays. Games like Arc Riders continue to grow, hitting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">over 3 million concurrent players this week</a>.</p><p>While Steam reached this new peak after nearly 17 years of expansion, the pace of growth has been especially fast over the past six years, with peak user counts nearly doubling in that time. The achievement comes during a mixed period for Valve, which has faced criticism over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-horses-ban-reflects-the-gaming-industrys-double-standards-and-emotional-immaturity/1100-6537012/" data-ref-id="1100-6537012">inconsistent content moderation and censorship decisions</a>.</p><p>It'll be interesting to see how these numbers change <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-release-date-price-everything-we-know/1100-6536286/" data-ref-id="1100-6536286">once the Steam Machine comes into play</a> later this year.</p>

            <p>
The best <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> games are often the ones where the thing you actually do is dead simple, with the challenge coming from an intricately woven path of twists and turns on doing said thing. Like, for example, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baba-is-you">Baba is You</a>. You (Baba) are a rabbity thing that pushes wordy blocks around, changing the very fabric of reality as you (Baba) do so. And here we are, with one last big update for the game.
</p>
<p>
Said update, as described in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/736260/view/500593045099514415?l=english">Steam post</a>, "most probably be the final large update for BIY." For the most part the post is just patch notes as to what the update contains, seemingly mostly focused on providing new ways for custom level makers to, well, make even more custom levels, alongside some other general fixes and mod support additions.
</p>
<p>
There's a small treasure trove of new objects you (not Baba) can be in place of Baba, like a hotdog, a brain, a cactus, a yes or a no, and most sweetly, a fox. You'll find a handful of new words like become, facedby, hold, happy, and angry. What the last two states of emotions may do in the context of puzzles, I don't know, but I ask that you do not make Baba is Angry, because that would make me quite sad.
</p>
<p>
In terms of bug fixes and adjustments, while searching through custom levels you can skip five pages at a time, some ambient loops have been added into the music selection, typos and other miscellaneous mishaps were fixed. On the modding front, that's all a bit too technical for me, but if it's your kind of bag then it'll surely be helpful.
</p>
<p>
It's a touch sad to see this as the more-or-less end of Baba is You, but nothing can last forever! If you've never checked Baba is You out, it's available to pick up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/">Steam</a> right this second.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After over a decade in the shadows, QPAD is back with a range of new products to sift through, including the new Loop TKL Model 3 Keyboard and Glass Superglide Mouse Mat.</p>



<p>Gamers have an embarrassment of riches when it comes to choosing accessories and peripherals to accompany their PC, and it’s easy to overlook keyboards and mouse mats to complete their build.</p>







<p>With controllers, headsets, microphones, cameras, and more to think about, it’s tempting not to put too much focus on a keyboard and mouse mat when gearing up your PC, and that’s exactly what I did. However, QPAD has made me change my ways, particularly with the Flux 65 Keyboard.</p>



<h2 id="h-change-i-never-knew-i-needed">Change I Never Knew I Needed</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Having grown up as a predominantly console player, for years my PC and accessories were bread and butter, and, when I finally got a gaming PC, my focus was on components, screens, and the bigger parts of the build. In fact, I couldn’t even tell you what the basic keyboard I had was. </p>



<p>I didn’t see the need to change my keyboard unless it broke, and it was doing me fine. However, after swapping it out for the QPAD Flux 65 Keyboard, it’s safe to say I am never going back.</p>



<p>The biggest change I’ve had to adjust to is the smaller size, which, as a writer, was daunting at first, as I was worried it would mess up my typing. While there was small teething issues initially, they were soon put to rest, and now I can enjoy even more space on my desk to work with.</p>







<p>The keys are not silent, but they’re also not extremely loud, and it’s a much better experience than before.</p>



<p>As for the Edge Mouse Mat, it was another expense I initially thought was unnecessary. The main mat I have on my desk is a Pokémon TCG playmat, which I have for aesthistics rather than use. This lives under my keyboard and, until the Superglide Mouse Mat, my mouse was straight on the desk.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, this has resulted in many scuffs and marks on my aging desk, along with frustrating moments where the most didn’t quite track to where I wanted it to. Now, though, I don’t have that problem at all.</p>



<p>It comes with a hefty price-tag though, with a current sale price at Currys of £59.99. While I don’t feel comfortable enough saying it’s definitely worth that outlay, it’s certainly been a benefit to my set-up.</p>



<p>All in all, both devices have changed my PC set-up significantly and will be staying put for my day-to-day usage, and I’ve certainly learned the benefit of putting extra attention into these sorts of accessories.</p>

            <guid>1397551</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You’ll do well to find a more intriguing shooter than Highguard in 2026. The game’s skeleton features work from former Respawn Entertainment and Apex Legends devs, and Highguard’s release date serves as one of 2026’s curtain openers.</p>



<p>Needless to say, everyone was shocked when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-dead-on-arrival-gamers-fear-a-flop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> was given the honor of closing out The Game Awards 2025, where game announcements and trailers were concerned. However, when you take a step back and assess, it’s a new IP, and the team behind it has some experienced heads, it would be fair to say.</p>



<p>If you’re keen to give Highguard a chance, read on for launch details.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-highguard-coming-out">When Is Highguard Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There’s no denying how good it looks. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment, Inc.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Wildlight Entertainment’s Highguard has an official release date of January 26, making it one of 2026’s first huge AAA titles.</strong></p>



<p>This means it’s barely a one-month turnaround from Highguard being revealed to the world at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TGA 2025</a> for the first time and launching globally! Logically, Wildlight Entertainment has to be confident in the game and believe it’s more than ready to go.</p>



<p>It’s been in development for over <em>four </em>years, and its reveal trailer boasts some incredible-looking gameplay.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-highguard-from-former-respawn-entertainment-amp-apex-devs">What Is Highguard From Former Respawn Entertainment &amp; Apex Devs?</h2>



<p><strong>Highguard is a high-intensity PvP shooter featuring the signature Apex Legends and Titanfall brands of fast-paced action, an emphasis on mobility, powers and abilities, and the curveball of horseback combat.</strong></p>



<p>The FPS title is literally a mix of Apex and Titanfall, with new ideas thrown into the melting pot. Highguard is a delicate hybrid, factoring in ability-based gameplay, precision shooting mechanics, and the idea of traversing the environment efficiently.</p>



<p>Highguard literally embraces its heritage, even on the official website: “From the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall, comes Highguard.”</p>



<p>Wildlight Entertainment’s main leaders include the following, with a look at what they did previously:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Chad Grenier:</strong> 12 years at Respawn, including as a game director.</li>



<li><strong>Dusty Welch:</strong> COO of Respawn Entertainment &amp; GM of the Apex Legends dev team. </li>



<li><strong>Jason McCord:</strong> Design director on Apex Legends and former level designer for Call of Duty.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you have doubts, there are years of senior-level experience behind Highguard. The game might not be everyone’s cup of tea, but it would be foolish to write off its hype until you’ve had a chance to play. The jury is out for now.</p>

<figure data-uuid="b3a627534bfee"><a title="Belkin 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b3a627534bfee/belkin-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Accessory manufacturer Belkin has added a new Switch 2 case to its catalogue, and this one looks like a doozy. The Charging Case Pro retails for <strong>$99.99</strong>, which certainly sounds like a lot for a case, but you're also getting a lot with this one.</p>
<p>The new Pro model comes with an LED indicator so you can quickly see how much charge the 10,000 mAH power bank has, allowing you to charge the Switch 2 up to 1.5 times while on the go. The console itself can be docked into the case and used in table-top mode whilst it's charging, and you can store up to 12 <del>Game-Key Cards</del> game cartridges in the included sleeves.</p>
<p>Naturally, the case has also been built with durable materials to ensure your Switch 2 is always adequately protected against the occasional drop, and you can also store any relevant cables, cleaning cloths, and more in the interior mesh pocket. Finally, if you're somewhat prone to losing your possessions, there's a discreet interior pocket designed to hold Smart Trackers like the Apple AirTag or Moto Tag.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mini-review-belkin-charging-case-for-switch-2-a-great-idea-with-middling-execution">We weren't overly keen</a> on Belkin's previous Charging Case for the Switch 2, noting that it had good ideas, but the execution itself wasn't quite on point. The new Pro looks to be a big improvement, though it's price may be a bit on the steep side for some.</p>

<p>Belkin has confirmed that the Charging Case Pro will start shipping in mid-January.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>If you've been noticing that recent matches of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> are ending in a lot more PvP skirmishes than usual, there's a high likelihood that you might've had it coming.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent interview</a> with GamesBeat's Dean Takahashi, the CEO of Embark Studios, Patrick Söderlund, confirmed that the popular extraction shooter has recently been employing a kind of "aggression-based matchmaking" to group up more like-minded players.</p><p>During an inquiry about the studio's approach to matchmaking, Söderlund said, "Since a week ago or so, we introduced a system where we also matchmake based on how prone you are to PvP or PvE. So if your preference is to do PvE, and have less conflict with players, you'll get more matched up."</p><p>The news seems to confirm what many players in the Arc Raiders community have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ptzhmr/why_do_people_suddenly_believe_in_aggression/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">suspected</a> for a while now. In the last few weeks alone, there has been a steady increase in fervor around the notion of an aggression-based matchmaking system, especially as players found that they were running into more competitive lobbies. This is especially notable given the fact that much of the conversation around Arc Raiders at launch seemed to focus on how welcoming its playerbase was compared to the communities of other, more hostile extraction shooters, like Escape From Tarkov.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-interview-embark-talks-behavior-based-matchmaking-map-updates-and-playing-nice-with-strangers/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview with PC Gamer</a> in December also yielded comments about "behavior-based matchmaking" which seemed to rile up players who felt justified in their theories.</p><p>Now though, it's all out in the open, though it isn't just as simple as matchmaking based on your kill count. As Söderlund is quick to clarify, there are several different levels of matchmaking going on at the same time in any Arc Raiders match. "First, it's skill-based, of course. Then, you have solos, duos, and trios, "Söderlund claimed. Then after that, Arc Raiders matches you based on how likely you are to engage in fights with fellow players.</p><p>The way Söderlund talks about it, it sounds like team always figured that as the game grew in size it'd need to deploy measures like this to more fairly group the differently segments of the game community.</p><p>At least this way, players who want to maintain the more cooperative ambiance of those early Arc Raiders days can maintain that for longer, while the bloodthirsty looters of the Rust Belt are free to pick each other clean in their own lobbies.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How Rainbow Six Siege Defied An Industry</p>
      </div>
<p>Content creator VarsityGaming, who's been <a href="https://x.com/VarsityGamingTV/status/2007933363332731017" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">memeing the hack</a> since it happened on January 4, corroborated the 67-day ban on their social media, suggesting that Siege may be down for two more days.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/AllAbtGaming/status/2008155122912620631" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Rainbow servers are still experiencing problems after 16 hours of the hacking incident happening, AGAIN.<br>Varsitygaming, the streamer who got the "67" day ban explains on the situation on how he can still matchmake even though he has supposedly been "banned".<br>At this point, it… <a href="https://t.co/9Ee0C396qX" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/9Ee0C396qX</a></p>  — AllAboutGaming (@AllAbtGaming) <a href="https://twitter.com/AllAbtGaming/status/2008155122912620631?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">status page for Rainbow Six Siege</a> also underscores the unfortunate situation. At the time of this writing, every platform is experiencing "unplanned issues," impacting the game's connectivity, in-game store, and matchmaking. The website claims that some of these issues are being investigated, with the publisher thanking players for their patience during this weird time.</p><p>While 67 days seems like an absurd amount of time--and in the case of VarsityGaming, it was "<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTGPYamkcRA/#" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">67676767 days</a>"--the number is really a reference to the 6-7 meme. Originating in March 2025 in part by rapper Skrilla (and their December 2024 song "Doot Doot (6 7)") and point guard LaMelo Ball (who's six-feet-seven-inches tall), the two numbers together went viral on social media largely thanks to someone named Maverick Trevillian, who became known as the "67 Kid." An absurdist inside joke that has no emotional, political, or sexual connotation, 6-7 literally means nothing and is the epitome of brain rot. And because it means nothing, that's why it's so popular; it's just another way for kids to get under adults' skin.</p><p>This hack comes nearly two weeks after Rainbow Six Siege went down for two days after the Christmas holiday. According to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ep8ykky0ro" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The BBC</a>, the game's servers were taken offline between December 27 and 28 following the marketplace being flooded with in-game currency that was reportedly worth millions of dollars. Ubisoft said at the time that "investigations and corrections" were going to be made over the next two weeks. It's unclear if this current hack is at all related to this previous hack.</p><p>Rainbow Six Siege went through a major rebrand in the middle of last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-gets-most-transformative-update-ever-today-with-siege-x-launch/1100-6532322/" data-ref-id="1100-6532322">becoming Rainbow Six Siege X</a>. This transformation, which introduced tons of improvements and changes to the tactical shooter, brought in a huge swath of new and returning players, reaching 142,000 concurrents on Steam on June 10, 2025. That's not quite the all-time peak of 201,933 it achieved on May 17, 2024, but for a 10-year-old game, that's still an impressive accomplishment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Code Vein II</strong> is set to launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-set-january-30-2026-debut/"> January 30, 2026</a></strong>, but you can start playing it a week early when the Character Creator Demo launches on January 23, 2026. The news of the demo arrived alongside a new eight-minute gameplay walkthrough trailer and the release of several previews for the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-hands-on-preview-kill-the-past/">including one from Wccftech</a>. </p>



<p>The gameplay walkthrough trailer is a solid showcase of what to expect when Code Vein II <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-announced-with-new-cinematic-trailer-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/">arrives at the end of the month</a>. It goes through new elements of the combat, like the new dual blades, allowing for agile and deadly combos, or the tried-and-true halbred making its Code Vein debut. </p>



<p>It also shows off Sunken Pylon, a new area in Code Vein II that players will explore as they search for the key to purifying the Sunken City. The trailer also introduces another new combat mechanic for Code Vein II, Forma. These new special skills are broken down into three categories: weapons, defensive, and bequeathed, which consume a resource called Icor.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="CODE VEIN II - Walkthrough Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/11mZY1UAqLo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>You'll gain Icor when attacking enemies, and when you have enough, you can use one of your Forma skills to unleash fatal and devastating attacks. The trailer also shows how you can switch between summoning and assimilation. Summoning allows your partner to fight alongside you, while assimilation fuses them to you and boosts your own health and stats. </p>



<p>The whole video is a good breakdown of what to expect in Code Vein II, but if you want to hear more about the game, then you should <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-hands-on-preview-kill-the-past/">check out Kai Tatsumoto's preview</a>, where they talked about several aspects of the game, including its combat, saying, "<em>Defensive tech works a bit differently in Code Vein II than what players might expect. It all comes down to the defensive forma that players equip and set to the L1 button. One allows for blocking, another allows for timed parries. They’re each situational, but with enemy attacks being well telegraphed, the parry forma should be the perfect fit for Soulslike veterans</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>On the other hand, combat skills and weapon forma are much like their counterparts from the first game. Players can set a palette of four different weapon skills between active attacks and passive temporary boosts, each with their own resource cost. Attacking and using a special drain attack both recharge this resource, allowing players to pull off vicious combos if they’ve accumulated enough stocked resources.</em>"</p>



<p>And of course, if you're keen to dive in, then be sure to download the demo when it arrives on January 23, 2026. The character you create can be transferred into the full game, meaning you can get a head start on your playthrough and start getting a feel for the game a week ahead of launch.</p>

            <guid>1397500</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Major hardware player 8BitDo has announced a brand new device ahead of this month's CES showcase, which begins tomorrow, and if you've ever wanted to play games on your phone vertically rather than horizontally, the FlipPad is for you.</p><p>As spotted by the appropriately-named <a href="https://retrohandhelds.gg/8bitdo-announces-controller-built-for-vertical-mobile-gaming/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Retro Handhelds</a>, the FlipPad was revealed by 8BitDo over on <a href="https://x.com/8BitDo/status/2007844470444933384" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">social media</a>. The company describes the controller as "a flip-style gamepad designed for mobile gaming", and it'll be compatible with both iOS and Android phones.</p><p>8BitDo has earmarked the FlipPad for a summer release, but if you're lucky enough to be attending CES 2026, then you'll be able to experience the controller at 8BitDo's booth. Be sure to put it through its paces if that's you!</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The 8BitDo FlipPad wants to be your vertical mobile gaming controller of choice.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As shown in the video clip accompanying the FlipPad's design, the controller connects to the USB-C port of your phone and can be flipped upwards to cover the bottom part of your screen. You can then swivel the FlipPad downwards when it's not in use.</p><p>Aesthetic-wise, as Retro Handhelds notes, the FlipPad bears more than a passing resemblance to one of the most iconic color schemes sported by the Nintendo Game Boy, which I can't imagine is an accidental choice.</p><p>Of course, since the FlipPad connects via your phone's charging port, you'll likely be able to use it just as you would any other regular controller, although you should bear in mind that it doesn't feature analog sticks, so this is very much a retro-focused device.</p><p>The FlipPad joins a mobile controller market that also includes heavyweights like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/backbone-pro-announcement" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="15935167-00e8-49bb-b367-3dba4b827098" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the Backbone Pro</a> and offerings from companies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/gamevice-is-smartphone-controller-worth-looking-into" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3002d824-ec13-462e-a34c-e7a6d3d44724" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">like Gamevice</a>, although it's fair to say 8BitDo's new offering is trying to serve a different niche than those venerable devices.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The mobile controller field is very competitive indeed.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Perhaps of greater interest to 8BitDo in this case are handhelds like GameSir's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/843605/gamesir-pocket-1-smartphone-android-wireless-bluetooth-controller" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">recently-announced Pocket 1</a>, which I'm sure the company will be keeping an eye on.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> blocks up in early access this month, having swiftly gone from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">thing in need of ressurection</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-early-access-release-date-set-in-stone-for-january-2026-but-its-devs-admit-the-first-impression-will-be-rough">thing that's coming out</a>. As such, the team of devs led by original Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme are firmly in promo mode, with the world generation mechanics they've just posted a deep dive into clearly being an aspect of the game they think'll be key to its appeal.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"As I mentioned publicly a few days ago, this new approach to world generation will redefine the block-game genre," reads the first line of Collins-Laflamme's outro to this <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/the-future-of-world-generation">world gen explainer</a>, which is otherwise penned by an engineer and designer duo called Dan and Amber. That's pretty eye-catching verbiage from a lead who's otherwise generally been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-gets-a-cheap-price-point-all-because-its-devs-dont-think-the-game-is-good-yet">keen to couch any hype-talk</a> in more realistic chat about the game currently having plenty of warts which'll need ironing out in the long run.</p>
<p>So, what makes Hytale's biome creation tech worth shouting about? "For the first time, artists and game designers can take full ownership of world generation, with complete control over the final result," Collins-Laflamme summarises. "This is a fundamental shift away from a world shaped almost solely by programmers."</p>
<p>The rest of the post delves a lot deeper into gritty details. The artist and designer-first focus is so important, so say Hytale's devs, because it'll allow the game to feel "curated and procedural". Basically, the aim's to have their cake and eat it, with the game boasting both the sort of expansiveness often only achievable without endless work by employing some procedural generation and the handcrafted feel that's long been the biggest strength of smaller environments totally pieced together by developers.</p><p>It's a very tough line to tread if you've got a foot in both camps - just ask Bethesda how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> went. What's clear is that creative offerings of the second of the two versions of Hytale world generator that the team are working with will be key to pulling this off. That newer version's viewed as the game's future and will be what it gradually shifts to over time, after initially  launching on the first iteration of the world generator. That older version, developed between 2016 to 2020, "already has many biomes and content ready to go".</p>
<p>The second version's still currently a work-in-progress, but is planned to take over down the line with the old one gradually being phased out - though worlds built with it will endure. During the transition between those two states, it sounds like you'll be able to peek through special "gateways" which allow you to try out bits being built in the second world generator. And breathe. That seems a lot of moving parts to me, but the devs certainly project being confident it's a landing they can stick.</p>
<p>In other fresh Hytale news, the Minecrafty sandbox's early access launch on January 13th <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-will-launch-with-native-linux-support-though-the-steam-deck-is-not-officially-recommended">will come with native Linux support</a>, but it isn't guarunteed to work seamlessly on the Steam Deck right out of the gate.</p>

              <p>The rising cost of PC parts is getting so bad that Nvidia is reportedly going to start making RTX 3060s again, so people have something to buy in the future while all the new shiny tech gets consumed by the AI industry.</p> <p>You’ve likely already noticed that in 2025, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-biggest-gaming-disappointments-worst-news-game-key-cards-gta-6-delay-2000655356#:~:text=Playing%20Video%20Games%20Is%20Becoming%20A%20Very%20Expensive%20Hobby">it became more expensive to build or upgrade a PC</a>. Thanks to hyperscalers and <a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">AI-focused tech companies gobbling up PC parts to build datacenters</a>, it’s becoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803">quite pricey and challenging</a> for your average person to buy PC RAM and graphics cards. Even the prices on prebuilt PCs from companies like HP, Dell, and Asus will increase by 15 to 20 percent, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3021660/computer-prices-could-go-up-by-20-due-to-ram-shortage-pc-makers-warn.html">according to <em>PC World.</em></a> Not great! This will also lead to PC handhelds getting more expensive, and experts expect consoles will undergo price increases too, thanks to growing demand for specific parts.&nbsp; And Nvidia, a company that is making billions from all of this, has a solution to provide PC players with a somewhat affordable GPU in 2026: Start making and selling its old RTX 3060 again.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">01.05update<br>rtx3060  Q1 come back… 🥲</p> <p>— hongxing2020 (@hongxing2020) <a href="https://twitter.com/hongxing2020/status/2008043115308065078?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>As recently reported by reliable Nvidia leaker Hongxing2020 and spotted by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-to-bring-back-geforce-rtx-3060-q1-2026-tackle-memory-shortages/"><em>Wccftech</em></a>, Nvidia is seemingly planning to restart production on the RTX 3060 in Q1 of this year. The card first launched in 2021 and is still one of the most popular gaming GPUs around, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/">according to data from Steam</a>.</p>

 <p>In 2024, Nvidia began retiring the card as it moved on to the 40 and 50 series of GPUs. However, due to DRAM being rapidly consumed for data centers, it has become harder and more expensive to procure the GDDR7 needed to produce the newer, more powerful RTX 5060. (Sidenote: <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-enshittifinancial-crisis/#the-upcoming-data-center-disaster:~:text=Now%2C%20you%E2%80%99ve%20probably,generation%20of%20GPUs.">Basically, every datacenter built or being built will be out of date in the near future, meaning the billions invested in them will be basically a waste!</a>)</p>

 <p>So it seems like the plan is for Nvidia to start producing 3060s again, using cheaper, easier-to-acquire components that aren’t top of the line and therefore aren’t being sought after by AI tech giants for their massive datacenters. If that is the case, hopefully Nvidia at least prices the new 3060s at $200 or less, as the only market for these cards will be gamers looking to upgrade a PC from an older GPU to something (somewhat) modern. But greed is a nasty thing and has infected all tech companies, including Nvidia, so I wouldn’t hold my breath on a sub-$200 price point despite the 3060 entering its fifth year in 2026.</p>

Sandfall Interactive was a new developer with a lot of industry talent on its roster, but it wasn’t yet a storied studio with a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-video-games-of-2025-2000656161"><span>Game of the Year-winning debut</span></a><span> to live up to.

 <p><span>“Creatively, we’ve always let our North Star be our own personal taste in terms of what we think is cool, what it is we enjoy and want to see,” she said. “I’ve seen too many TV shows and books be swayed trying to please a lot of people, and in the process you end up losing the heart of what’s there. So [we] feel like we need to trust our instincts and continue to trust the vision behind the studio.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Sandfall has been upfront about wanting to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sequel-sandfall-interactive-2000620688"><span>make another </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>game</span></a><span>, and fans are already clamoring for it to explore some of </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span>’s unsolved mysteries, especially regarding </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kffyby/painters_vs_writers/"><span>some of the major reveals in the RPG’s third act</span></a><span>. But it sounds like the stuff that fans are latching onto isn’t going to guide Sandfall’s creative decisions, so it’s possible the next game may be about something entirely different. It’ll be exciting to see what the studio comes up with, even if it’s not exactly what we’re hoping for. You already know they’re capable of making something great, so why not stay open to what it wants to do next?</span></p>

<p>It seems Rainbow Six Siege players are being banned again; what’s more, the ban is for 67 days, inspired by the viral ’67’ meme. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Rainbow Six Siege servers shut down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-hack-servers-shut-down-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after a massive hack</a> late last month, which led to multiple developer-only skins, billions of credits, and bans. Siege and the Marketplace were intentionally shut down while the team resolved the issue; however, it appears Ubisoft hasn’t yet reached a solution. </p>







<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-siege-hands-out-67-day-bans-inspired-by-viral-67-meme">Rainbow Six Siege Hands Out 67-Day Bans, Inspired by Viral “67” Meme</h2>



<p>If you haven’t heard about the viral ‘6-7’ trend, then you are better off not knowing about it; however, it has somehow made its way into Rainbow Six Siege in the most surprising way possible, with several players reportedly receiving 67-day bans. The cause for these bans is unclear; however, a screenshot posted by vxunderground on <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/2007891913425531290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) via <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/rainbow-six/rainbow-six-siege-hacked-again-as-breach-triggers-67-day-bans-3300391/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a> reveals that these 67-day bans are being handed out “due to harassment”. Additionally, if players head to the Rainbow Six Siege <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">status</a> page, they will see “4 unplanned issues” across every platform the game is available on. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ubisoft's Rainbow Six Siege has been compromised (again). Social media is filled with players complaining about being banned for "67 days", a reference to the "Six Seven" meme. <a href="https://t.co/1gYvvoU3WT">pic.twitter.com/1gYvvoU3WT</a></p>— vx-underground (@vxunderground) <a href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/2007891913425531290?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Due to the appearance of the viral meme number 67, players believe Rainbow Six Siege has been hacked again. However, Ubisoft has yet to officially confirm it. To fix the earlier issue, Ubisoft had begun a “rollback of all transactions” that occurred after the hack, followed by extensive quality control tests “to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes.”</p>







<p>In other news, Rainbow Six Mobile will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-mobile-releasing-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release globally in February 2026</a>. Players in Canada, France, Poland, and LATAM can download and play the test version of the game now. What are your thoughts on Rainbow Six Siege players receiving viral ’67’ meme-inspired bans?

    <div>
        
<p>CES 2026 is here and that means another keynote speech from Nvidia. While, usually, CEO Jensen Huant takes the stag and reveals a brand new graphics card for players, that won’t be the case this year.</p>



<p>Shortly before the company’s scheduled keynote on Monday, Nvidia confirmed that no new GPUs will be announced during the event. There also won’t be any sort of GPU announcement during Nvidia’s <a href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGeForce/status/2008176911747371438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2008176911747371438%7Ctwgr%5E4123a5ccd62e9a05d4cd884725a5b1bd7c63d3e5%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fvideocardz.com%2Fnewz%2Fnvidia-confirms-no-rtx-50-super-gpus-at-ces-2026-but-promises-updates-for-gamers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GeForce On community update</a> broadcast on Monday night.</p>







<p>That means that the rumored RTX 50 Super graphics card isn’t coming just yet. As far as what is coming, Nvidia is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-to-reveal-dlss-4-5-at-ces-2026/">expected to unveil DLSS 4.5</a> during the annual event. The major update to the technology will include newer Super Resolution paths as well as the ability for RTX 50 series cards to generate up to six times the number of frames. </p>



<p>While no new graphics cards might be disappointing to some, it doesn’t feel like much of a surprise. The consumer electronics industry, specifically PCs, is going through a tumultuous time. The continued rise of AI and Data Centers have made components like storage, memory, and others in scarce supply. That’s led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-costs-more-than-new-graphics-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extreme price increases</a>, leaving regular enthusiasts out in the cold. </p>

                <p>A new controller from 8BitDo has been announced for smartphones, and this add-on will make your phone resemble a next-gen Game Boy. At CES 2026, 8BitDo showed off the FlipPad, a gamepad that connects to a smartphone via its USB-C port. Details on the FlipPad are scarce for now, but 8BitDo says it will support both iOS and Android devices.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/8BitDo/status/2007844470444933384" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Where mobile play unfolds.<br>Introducing 8BitDo FlipPad — a flip-style gamepad designed for mobile gaming.<br>Compatible with iOS and Android devices. Officially supported by Apple.<br>Coming Summer 2026.<br>Experience it first at <a href="https://twitter.com/CES?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CES</a> 2026.<br>LVCC Central Hall · Booth #15641<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FlipPad?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FlipPad</a>… <a href="https://t.co/snddY5OaMx" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/snddY5OaMx</a></p>  — 8BitDo (@8BitDo) <a href="https://twitter.com/8BitDo/status/2007844470444933384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p>A closer look at the FlipPad reveals a few Nintendo-inspired design choices. The controller has a classic D-pad on the left and 12 face buttons, including the traditional four-button layout found on modern controllers. This could make the FlipPad ideal for retro-inspired games and emulators, and 8BitDo says it'll reveal more details ahead of its Summer 2026 release.</p><p>This isn't the company's first dive into smartphone controllers; it currently sells the Xbox-licensed 8BitDdo Ultimate Mobile controller for Android and iOS. Similar to its Ultimate controllers for PC and console, these smartphone controller cradles are officially licensed and offer an impressive amount of features for their budget-friendly price.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4629323-8bitdophonecontroller.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629323" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4629323-8bitdophonecontroller.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629323"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4629323-8bitdophonecontroller.png"></figure><p>These have Hall Effect sticks, face buttons, a retro-style D-pad, and contoured tactile handles. As you'd expect, you can also customize them through 8BitDo's software, and they fit smartphones measuring 100-170mm (3.93-6.69in) in length. You can grab the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Officially-Smartphone/dp/B0F9L7L7CJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white Xbox model</a> for $46 or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Officially-Smartphone/dp/B0F9L7Q3VG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">black version</a> for its standard price of $50.</p><p>It can connect wirelessly to your device via Bluetooth, so you can also use it with Android tablets, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and even the Apple Vision Pro. As for battery life, 8BitDo claims the 300 mAh battery can deliver up to 13 hours on a full charge.</p>

A nice, juicy nine-minute-long <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a> gameplay trailer has been plucked from the tree of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> games today. Juicy in the sense that nine minutes is plenty of time to help ascertain whether a game looks like it could be fun, yet if we're sticking with this metaphor this is one of those apples that's really good but has a nasty bruise on it you have to avoid.
</p>
<p>
First, the good part. This is a pretty neat looking stealth game! The trailer paints a much clearer picture of what you'll be getting up to, showing off a mission in which you broach a very tall fortress you need to make your way up to get some quartz, a valuable resource that also helps the titular goblin Styx pull off some of his magical tricks.

He can turn himself invisible, sneak under bits of flooring, poison a drinks pot to take down an enemy that's too big for him to outright kill, melting him afterwards to hide the evidence. Styx also has these sort of monkey-esque creatures that can kill enemies for or alongside him. Even stealth games can't escape being Breath of the Wildified, as the green goblin also has a paraglider at his disposal which he can use to glide about the place, alongside a grappling hook that lets him zip about.

According to a press release, Blades of Greed follows a metroidvania style structure, allowing you to explore new areas in places you've previously visited when you unlock more abilities. A fun approach for a stealth game that sounds like it could keep things fresh!
</p>
<p>
And here's where the bruise comes in. I get that Styx as a character is meant to have these zippy, quippy one liners, but yeesh are they laid on thick. Admittedly at points he's vocally reactive in a way that feels surprisingly quick, to the point I can't tell if it was added in the edit for the trailer. He also never shuts up, even outlining the different options you can take, so I do hope it is a trailer-only thing. I mean come on, he references Scarface at one point, who does that any more?
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's not all that long until Styx: Blades of Greed launches, as it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/styx-blades-of-greed-isnt-releasing-in-2025-after-all-but-thats-okay-because-its-got-a-firm-release-date-now">currently slated for release</a> next month on February 19th.
