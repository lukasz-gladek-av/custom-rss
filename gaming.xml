            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-worth-it-how-long-beat-1851784828<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has a history of packing in tutorial games with some of their hardware, so players were reasonably frustrated to find that <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> would run them $10. But while this tutorial-focused title should’ve probably just been included with the Nintendo Switch 2, it may still be worth buying for certain folks who will benefit from learning more about their new system. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Whether you’re a long-time gamer or new to the hobby, you’re probably curious about how long <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> will take to beat and whether it’s even worth that price tag. Let’s take a look.</p><h2 id="h245425"><a id=""></a>How long is <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>, and is it worth buying?</h2><p>Alright, let’s get real for a second. Much of <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> is just reading and following prompts or engaging in simplistic mini-games, so it’s more of an interactive exhibit than a game you “beat.” But if your goal is to check off plenty of tutorial segments and get some of the medals in the mini-games, <strong>you’ll be able to squeeze a few hours of fun out of this strange little game</strong>.</p><p>For the $10 price tag, <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> provides a pretty solid look at all of the Nintendo Switch 2's unique features. There’s a whole lot of useful stuff you can learn here, and it’s delivered in a bright and colorful package that certainly feels very “Nintendo” in design. But at the end of the day, it’s a glorified tutorial, meaning that its worth will be largely determined by whether you feel like you need help learning how everything works.</p><p>With this in mind, gaming enthusiasts who likely knew how every feature works on the Switch 2 before they even got their hands on one aren’t likely to benefit greatly from the information in <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>—though it’s worth noting that some of the mini-games can be fun. Younger or less experienced players may enjoy learning how to make the most of their new hardware, especially things like Joy-Con functionality and attachment, or even general safety.</p><p>We don’t want kids trying to eat the Joy-Cons, after all. They taste terrible anyway. Or so I hear. I wouldn’t know, of course. Can we move on?</p><p>Anyway, the bottom line is that <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> would have made a great pack-in title, but it still may be worth the $10 for particular demographics. So, just make your decision based on your gaming experience and whether you enjoy quirky mini-games. As for me, I think I’ll be ripping some <em>Mario Kart World</em> instead.</p><p>If <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> sounds like a worthwhile purchase for you, it’s available now exclusively for, well, Nintendo Switch 2. It’s literally in the name. Don’t be weird.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/possessors-gives-you-demon-magic-legs-and-plenty-of-fast-action-to-enjoy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Wield a computer mouse like a whip.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since developer Heart Machine burst onto the scene with its hyper-stylized 2D action game Hyper Light Drifter, every effort from the studio comes with the promise of visual splendor and tight gameplay, and Possessor(s) is no different. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If Hyper Light Drifter is Zelda-like, then Possessor(s) is the team’s take on the Metroidvania. Although their dev team will probably get mad at me for calling it that, as they prefer the original genre term of “search-action.” Regardless of which label you prefer, you’ll find the genre’s familiar hallmarks here. Possessor(s) drops you in a big open map full of powerful demon enemies and branching paths that aren’t all open to you just yet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike Heart Machine’s past games with stylized, but masked or hooded, heroes, Possessor(s) is led by a cast of beautifully hand-drawn characters whose stories I’m curious to learn more of. Set in a fictional, Japan-inspired, city, the player controls Luca, who survives a devastating, apocalyptic event. But only just barely. She awakens to find herself without her legs, which were damaged during the attack. Luckily (or not), she makes contact with a demon named Rehm, who offers her the classic devil’s bargain. She can get her legs back, but only if she helps him get revenge on some unnamed but powerful demonic forces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, Possessor(s) feels heavily inspired by urban fantasy anime. Shows like Jujutsu Kaisen come quickly to mind as Luca and Rehm explore a ruined metropolitan city and fight off demon-possessed everyday objects like haunted searchlights and demon fridges. This extends to Luca as well. While she’s now powered by demon-magic legs, her weapons are also everyday objects. Things like kitchen knives or even a computer mouse she can wield like a whip.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this combines into a fast-paced action-adventure. Combat feels rapid-fast, which is great because there are a lot of enemies to cut through. And running through the devastated city, or jumping and grappling over obstacles, also feels fast and great, which is a plus because I get the sense this is a pretty big game. The portion of the map I played already felt quite large and I only played a 20-minute demo.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Possessor(s) Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"> Mechanically, I wouldn’t say Possessor(s) upends the search-action genre, or at the very least not in the early portion of the game I saw. But both narratively and in the design there’s tons more that I’m interested in learning more of. Possessor(s) has moments where the camera pans out into the ruined city, highlighting a cinematic sense of scale that Heart Machine has explored before in games like Solar Ash. And even in my short hands-on time there was a lot of dialogue and exposition between Luca and Rehm. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also likely more to the RPG element that I haven’t discovered yet. Luca’s character menu seemed to show empty slots for a variety of weapons and upgrades – way more than the couple I found during my demo. And having only been given a glimpse of the map, which was primarily a lot of abandoned and destroyed office buildings, there’s clearly a lot more under the hood in Possessor(s) than what I saw. I’ll be keeping an eye on this one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Lies of P patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing bug fixes as well as some major changes that make it easier to access the Overture DLC from the second playthrough.</p>
<p>The 1.9.0.0 patch changes how the Overture DLC is accessed from the second playthrough. Instead of essentially having to play through the vast majority of the game again, players can now access the DLC campaign from Chapter 5 at the "Path of the Pilgrim." The patch also introduces some difficulty changes, reducing monster difficulty in repeat playthroughs and adjusting stats for certain regular monsters in the first playthrough of the Overture DLC.</p>
<p>Besides making these changes, the Lies of P new patch addresses a variety of bugs, including issues that prevented benefit items from being properly delivered, some progression blockers, and more. The full patch notes can be found<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1627720/view/519716851054280776?l=english"> here.</a></p>
<p>The difficulty changes introduced by the Lies of P 1.9.0.0 patch are personally quite welcome, as I found the difficulty of regular enemies a bit overtuned during my first playthrough of the Overture DLC. Thankfully, it was easy to look past balancing issues, as the expansion is just as good as the main campaign, if not even more, for those interested in the game's setting and lore who wanted to learn more about it, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review.</a></p>
<p>Lies of P is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-33-release-date" rel="nofollow">May's Version 3.3</a>, the new update will see you stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Phainon "at the crossroads of destiny" in order to "take a decisive step that may ignite the dawn of the Era Nova".</p>

<p>Since this is a&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>update, you can, of course, also look forward to brand new characters, and this time around, you're getting three, although two of them are guests from another franchise altogether.</p>

As you can probably imagine, he's a pretty reliable damage-dealer, so take him if you need some destruction in your lineup.</p>

<p>Your other two characters in this update are both visitors from the&nbsp;<em>Fate/stay night&nbsp;</em>franchise, namely Archer and Saber. Archer will be available for free once the crossover event begins, as will Saber. The latter will be a five-star fighter as well, so she'll be a valuable addition to your team.</p>

<p>This update will also bring reruns for&nbsp;Tribbie, Sunday, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-introduces-new-character-sparkle-and-she-goes-from-cute-to-crazy" rel="nofollow">Sparkle</a>, while in the second half, you'll get another chance to add&nbsp;Firefly, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-teases-new-character-jingliu-ahead-of-14-ps5-release" rel="nofollow">Jingliu</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-showcases-its-edgiest-character-blade-launches-flappy-birds-clone" rel="nofollow">Blade</a> to your team.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.4 right here. It gives a flavor of what you'll be doing when you begin your adventure next month.</p>




<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.4 lands on July 2nd across <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all platforms</a>. The game is currently available on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices running both major operating systems.</p>

It’s just the flavoring helping you immerse yourself in the sprawling landscape. In <em>Dune Awakening</em>, the story takes a high seat at the table, but it’s still not the center of attention. But don’t worry. If your ultimate goal is to contend with sandworms, fight the Harkonnen, and fly an Ornithopter while dive-bombing your buddy, you’re in for quite the adventure!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197527" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Part 2 Is Short, Shocking, And Strangely Satisfying" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="169" data-playlist="197527,197586,197585" data-current="197527"><div><p>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Part 2 Is Short, Shocking, And Strangely Satisfying</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197527/197527_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197527/197527_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197527/197527_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23057.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Rushing through the main story missions and beats in <em>Dune Awakening</em> shouldn’t take too long for an open-world survival game of this nature.

He actually ended up being one of the easier boss fights for my squad, thanks in part to multiple ranged weapons forcing him to spit out teammates anytime he gobbled them up and started crunching. The new Everdark Sovereign version, however, takes the encounter to 11 the entire time. </p><p>He almost never stops moving, constantly shooting out lightning blasts and ground AOE bursts. At one point he summons a giant whirlwind storm, and players have to use jumping pads to hop over top if they don’t want to immediately get downed. One particularly nasty lightning attack happens in a spherical AOE with barely any lead-up or attack animation to signal that you’ve got less than three seconds to get the hell out of dodge. “I’ve gotten comfortable dodging his attacks at least,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lftg11/maybe_solo_is_the_way_lol/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lftg11/maybe_solo_is_the_way_lol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared</a></span> one player on the subreddit. “But once people start going down it’s chaos.”</p><p>The Everdark Sovereign version of Gaping Jaw, who’s also known as Adel, Baron of the Night, appeared late on Wednesday out of nowhere, with no mention of him in the extremely <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1013&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1013" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">barebones patch notes this week</a></span>.

As I write this, over 54,000 people are playing Rematch on Steam. That's a strong start for the launch window of a new multiplayer game.

Sloclap's animation prowess from Sifu is also on full display here, which makes Rematch an enjoyable game to watch and play. Considering how popular soccer is around the world, it's not too surprising that a refreshing and fun take on the soccer game formula like Rematch is finding success.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rematch/" data-ref-id="5000-654961">Rematch</a> is available now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

Set during the final years of China's Tang Dynasty, Blood Message is an action-adventure game being developed in Unreal Engine 5 by 24 Entertainment. There's no word on when it's coming out, but it's due on consoles and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>NetEase says Blood Message puts players in control of a nameless messenger and his young son during a critical uprising in Dunhuang. "Caught in the crossfire of a righteous uprising and driven by loyalty to both family and country, players will embark on a perilous eastward journey to deliver a message that holds the fate of their war-torn homeland," a press release reads. "Amidst the shifting sands of history, they will etch a final tale of loyalty."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out the Blood Message reveal trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6IwsMWTVGI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6IwsMWTVGI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As this nameless messenger, players will embark on a 1000-mile odyssey back to Chang'an, the heart of the Tang Empire. To do so, they'll cross lethal landscapes like desolate deserts and the wilderness of East and Central Asia while surviving brutal sieges, unforgiving terrain, and more. NetEase says the game's setting in the last years of the Tang Dynasty "provides a cultural landmark of Chinese history that frames the story with customs, culture, and rich history of the era."&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding gameplay, NetEase describes Blood Message as narrative-driven and anchored in cinematic storytelling with "visceral, realistic combat blending stealth and survival mechanics."&nbsp;</p><p>"As our first completely single-player focused experience from NetEase Games, after two decades of deep dedication to the gaming industry, we are prepared to deliver a truly epic and cinematic experience for our players around the world," NetEase executive vice president Zhipeng Hu writes in a press release.</p><p><strong>For another look at Blood Message, check out the screenshots below:&nbsp;</strong></p><hr><p><em>What do you think of Blood Message's first showing?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-combat-radar<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> will include an optional combat radar, following intense pleas from the community.</p>
<p>In a lengthy social media thread by Randy Pitchford, the Gearbox CEO broke down the thought process behind the navigation and combat design in Borderlands 4, concluding the thread by revealing the team managed to add in a combat radar last week.</p>
<p>Pitchford wrote: "The feature will be *off* by default at launch. And, it didn't come on-line early enough to make it into our branch for the build we're bringing to the Borderlands Fan Fest this weekend. But it is now officially in the game!".</p>

<p>Pitchford elaborated: "This happened because of the best elements of our community. I'm talking about the real fans who sincerely want the best for the game and gave constructive notes and made reasonable arguments. You know who you are and you rock! You made this happen!".</p>
<p>The whole thread is worth reading for those interested in the game design process. It offers a lot of insight into the thought process behind the new movement and navigation mechanics, the costs of adding a combat radar to Borderlands 4, and how a recent press tour provided feedback that ultimately convinced the developers a combat radar would be a good idea.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 creative director Graeme Timmins added their own thoughts on the reveal, noting: "Props to Jason Brown, Justin Dooley, and Ray Peña who went incredibly fast when I told them - 'If we're doing this, I want it for launch.' This is just how committed we are here guys; we're doing everything to make BL4 the definitive Borderlands."</p>
<p>A combat radar was an ever-present feature of previous installments in the Borderlands series, and offered quick and reliable information as to where immediate dangers were at any one time. This wouldn't be a huge deal at first, but as you proceeded to more challenging content it became vastly more important.</p>
<p>As such, its absence <em>was</em> noteworthy. In response to this news Borderlands fans celebrated on social media, with user furt1v3ly writing: "Oh heck yeah. I didn't need the mini-map but that radar beats the compass system hands-down. And being able to turn it off for screenshots or for extra frame rate should be a bigger win. This is the best choice."</p>
<p>It's a moment of good PR for Gearbox, at a time when it's sorely needed. Gearbox recently revealed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/randy-pitchford-stoked-about-borderlands-4s-70-price-point-confirms-tonne-of-dlc-on-the-way">$70 retail price of Borderlands 4, which Pitchford was publically "stoked" about</a>. This came after Pitchford stated on social media that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment">"real fans" would get a copy regardless of its price</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Switch 1 Game Cases" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ed1c42242f520/switch-1-game-cases.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>There's always been a little bit of contention over the design of physical game cases and their box art on Switch consoles, with most of the hate pointed towards the rather ugly way that the spines can sometimes present unevenly whilst sat on shelving, and at the printed disclaimers that take up some premium space on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> cases in particular.</p>
<p>For those who have an issue, for whatever reason, there's now another avenue to walk(man) down when it comes to displaying your precious physical games. Indeed, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/culture/607422/switch-2-cassette-case-how-to-make-cover-art-spine">as reported by Polygon</a>, some clever persons have been creating very funky-looking cassette case covers which you can actually purchase online, should you like the look of them.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SwitchSpines/">u/SwitchSpines</a>, one creator by the name of Eridyon has been showing off cassette case designs that they've made and they've got us coming over all Art Attack, in honesty. We're feeling a little bit Neil Buchanan all of a sudden. Yes, as you can see, some of these case designs are really slick, and what's more, they're smaller, so you can have more of them, meaning more games. Or at least that's what this writer shall be telling his wife.</p>
<p>Speaking to Polygon, Eridyon said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This originally started as a way for me to display my digital indie games that never got physical releases, and I have always wanted to be a cover art designer, but had never done any graphic design work before...I loved designing them that it quickly went to making a goal for making a case for all of my games!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, according to Eridyon, they have over 600 Switch games and they'd actually shelved doing the designs. With the arrival of Switch 2, though, this creator is back to making them with gusto.</p>
<p>In order to make your own cases, well, you can simply jump onto any online retailer (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sleevie-Wonder-Cassette-Tape-Cases/dp/B0CQRZJ98B?tag=nlife-20" rel="sponsored noopener">Amazon's got them)</a>, to pick up some cheap empty cassette cases firstly. Then you'll need a 3D Printer, but only if you insist on having <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6144618">the snug little cart holder</a> to place on the inside of your cases. Otherwise, it's a pack of empty cases and your imagination (or the work of somebody else - with permission, of course), printed out and stuck in for display.</p>

<p>There's a whole bunch of very cool designs over at the Switch Spines subreddit, too, so make sure to check them out for inspiration if you fancy any of this. It's also just a very good stop for getting lots of handy info on how to make, design, or simply just download some new art or ideas, with some users even providing templates.</p>
<p>Once you've done all this, make sure to send us in a picture too, and any we show on the site will get a Blue Peter bagd...oh wait, sorry, we're having a flashback to the '90s here. Must be all this cassette patter.</p>

                <p>In early 2023, Wizards of the Coast canceled at least <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-publisher-wizards-of-the-coast-cancels-at-least-five-video-games/1100-6510284/" data-ref-id="1100-6510284">five video games that were in development</a>, including an unfinished Dungeons &amp; Dragons open-world action RPG by Hidden Path Entertainment. Now, nearly eight minutes of footage from that game have been leaked online, and while the title was far from finished, it shows real promise.</p><p>The footage originated from one of the music supervisors of the game (via <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/look-into-dungeons-dragons-cancelled-open-world-rpg-project-dante-gameplay-concept-art" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>), which was known internally as Project Dante. Given the source of the video, it shouldn't be surprising that it puts a spotlight on some of the game's music. The video notes that the score was composed to seamlessly flow from the open-world theme to more specific tracks, including an ethereal theme for a temple and more forbidding notes as the heroes approached a Troll cave. A band of bards even performs an entire song while the main characters listen.</p><p>Project Dante's world looks enticing even in this early state, but the combat was clearly a work-in-progress at the time that this footage was made. There's enough here to see that this game had real potential, but it's never going to officially see the light of day.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-update-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-terraria-update-arrives-next-week-new-animated-trailer-released.1223958/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-update-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has revealed when we can expect the&nbsp;<em>Palworld Terraria&nbsp;</em>crossover to land, and we're just a few days away from the creature-collecting survival game's first ever collaboration.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer, you can expect&nbsp;the appropriately-named "Tides of Terraria" update to arrive on June 25th, and it sounds like you can look forward to a new dungeon to explore, new enemies to fight, and perhaps even some sweet gear to net yourself.</p>

<p>According to Pocketpair, the <i>Terraria&nbsp;</i>bosses Eye of Cthulhu and Moon Lord will both be appearing in the crossover as well, so if you haven't had your fill of fighting those enemies in&nbsp;<em>Terraria</em>, you're in luck.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-terraria-update-release-date-shock.jpg?itok=oYBA9FKt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-terraria-update-release-date-shock.jpg?itok=Va1ltcsk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld</em>'s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Terraria&nbsp;</em>update lands next week.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Palworld Terraria&nbsp;</em>crossover was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-crossover-2025" rel="nofollow">all the way back in November</a>, so Pocketpair and&nbsp;<em>Terraria&nbsp;</em>studio Re-Logic have been cooking this one up for quite some time.</p>

<p>It'll serve as&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s first crossover, but it likely won't be the game's last; in the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>roadmap <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-roadmap-january-2025" rel="nofollow">released in January</a>, Pocketpair teased "game collaborations (including&nbsp;<em>Terraria</em>)", which would indicate that more crossovers are on the way later down the line.</p>

<p>For now, though, you'll have to content yourself with this one, as well as all the other stuff&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>has going on. Back in March, for instance, Pocketpair released an update for the game that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-crossplay-update-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">introduced crossplay</a>, allowing you to team up with your friends to take on challenges and raise Pals (or exploit them, if such is your wont).</p>

<p>It's not all fun and games, though. In May, it was revealed that some of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mechanics-changing-nintendo-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">mechanics have changed</a> because of an ongoing lawsuit brought against the game and its developer by Nintendo. As you've probably guessed, the lawsuit alleges legally spurious similarities between&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>




<p>In any case, the&nbsp;<em>Palworld Terraria&nbsp;</em>collaboration launches on June 26th. You can check the former out right now (albeit in Early Access) on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/palworld/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9nkv34xdw014" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

		<p><em>Most of Remap, aka everyone not named Janet, is a little on the older side. We have to pick our battles when it comes to games we play, especially games we finish. I mean, who could possibly finish Despelote? </em></p><p><em>But in all seriousness, even when our jobs demand us to play games in unorthodox and rushed ways, the reality is that if our jobs were to disappear overnight, we'd probably still have many of the same struggles.</em></p><p><em>Patrick decided to return to a spring favorite, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and found the experience to be a combination of frustration, excitement, and clarity. Plus, he asks Rob if he's broken any bones. </em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> A few times over this past year, Rob, I’ve noticed myself spending 10-15 hours with a video game, yapping on the podcast about the great time I’m having, and then moving onto the next one. While it’s true that our jobs require and reward spending a little time with a game instead of a lot, it’s not as though I don’t have any free time to spend as I please. I could have kept playing <em>Avowed</em> if I wanted, I could have found time for more <em>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Those are both games that I would have said, in reductive terms, I’m enjoying 8/10. That’s enough to spend more time, to see what else might be hiding in the world. To have enough conversation for a podcast requires far less than 15 hours, yet I put that and more into both.</p><p>It would be say I’ll find time for them again later this year, but in reality, I probably won’t.</p><p>The game I refuse to let this happen to, however, is <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. I dropped 20 hours into that one by the time I allowed its grip on me to release, freeing me to try games like <em>Deliver at all Costs </em>and <em>Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</em>, but <em>Clair Obscur </em>was different. <em>Clair Obscur</em> was not an 8/10 that I could see myself spending more time with, it was 10/10. <em>Special</em>.</p><p>A few nights back, I booted up <em>Deliver at All Costs</em>, which—look, brief tangent. You cannot predict where the story goes in that game. It has so much story. It has so much story! At a certain point, it seems to forget that its core appeal is being a fun physics-driven driving game! It leaves all that behind to tell, of all things, a sci-fi story! Even though I’ve spoiled that bit for you, there is no chance you have any idea where that story tries to go before the credits begin to roll!</p><p>Anyway, I’m not sure if I’m endorsing that people play that game. But I’m glad I did.</p><p>The point is that credits rolled way faster than I was expecting, leaving me with an hour to play something else. We’d just recorded the podcast, so it was a moment to indulge my own whims, so why not return to <em>Clair Obscur</em>? Well, because that means returning to a video game with some pretty damn intricate systems while being more than a month removed from using them.</p><p>When I shattered my collarbone, I entered physical therapy a few months later. The therapist asked me to lie down and try to lift some small weights. They warned that lifting weights with my previously injured arm would be difficult—but it’s normal. 20lb weight? Couldn’t move it. 10lb weight? Couldn’t budge it. 5lb weight? Buddy, I’m staring at this thing trying to use the Force and nothing’s happening. My atrophy was bad but, again, still normal. It took months of hard, annoying work to get things back into shape. You know, much like grinding one does in a JRPG.</p><p>I knew I wanted to love <em>Clair Obscur </em>again, but it also meant putting in <em>work</em> to love <em>Clair Obscur</em> again. Where was I at in the story? What style of play was I leaning into with this character? Rather than worry about all that, I just started playing. I barely knew what I was doing, but in time, memory matched reality. I haven’t found the enthusiasm to dip into the most annoying parts of that game, aka the equipping and unequipping of skills, but I’ll get there.</p><p>The nice part is knowing it’ll be worth it. Janet’s finished the game and is ready to scream about it from the top of a mountain. Our tastes are basically aligned, which helps give me the motivation, much like a physical therapist, to put in the time and <em>work</em> to get back into things.</p><p>Still, it’s weird to view this as “work.” How have you handled similar situations?</p><p>P.S.

No. But I tore my ACL playing football in high school. We were doing a tackle drill, third practice of the day, everyone was tired. I was sluggish and didn’t get as low as I should have to absorb the hit, the guy tackling me didn’t really use any form he just kind of hurled himself at my shoulders. If I hadn’t been wearing such nice new cleats I might have been fine, but my lower left leg stayed planted while the rest of me arced down to the left from my waist. The pain was instant and unlike anything I’d experienced before. For a beat, I couldn’t see. Was literally blinded for a long second or two, probably just from complete sensory overload.</p><p>It was a stupid way to get hurt, though there are times I also wonder how many programs are still doing full contact practices for six or seven hours a day. I was in the absolute best shape of my life at that moment, the guy who hit me was also in terrific shape. We were just tired because it was the final twenty minutes of our third practice of the day.</p>

Curiosities.” These are five games, two of which are crosswords that have been running for years, one is a bought-in game called <em>Bracket City</em>, and two are brand new, called <em>Stacks</em> and <em>Fluxis</em>. They’re all word games, presumably launching now to try to keep some momentum after the magazine lucked out in March of this year by having its editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, added to a group chat in which the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/18/hegseth-senate-hearing-los-angeles-troop-deployment&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/18/hegseth-senate-hearing-los-angeles-troop-deployment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still-in-his-job</a></span> Pete Hegseth was sharing top-secret attack plans.</p><figure id="" data-id="1467b5bfe4b48e150196d9527c0910ee" data-recommend-id="image://1467b5bfe4b48e150196d9527c0910ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="976" data-height="549" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Atlantic's promo image for its new games." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Atlantic's promo image for its new games." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Atlantic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1467b5bfe4b48e150196d9527c0910ee" data-recommend-id="image://1467b5bfe4b48e150196d9527c0910ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="976" data-height="549" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Atlantic's promo image for its new games." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now it seems that online encyclopedia (and one of humanity’s most extraordinary achievements) Wikipedia is getting in on the action. Yesterday, when having coffee with a friend, I opened the app to try to remember what it was that the director of the extraordinary sci-fi film <em>Primer</em> had done that meant he wouldn’t be working again. (Accrued repeated accusations of domestic violence, if you’re wondering.) But before I could, I was asked by Wikipedia if I would like to play a game. Um, sure! So my chum and I were entirely sidetracked into playing <em>Which Came First</em>, an incredibly simple concept in which the app gives two short descriptions of historical events, plus sometimes a small picture clue, and asks you which happened first. That’s it. It’s great!</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Which came first?</p><p>Deputies of the French Third Estate take the Tennis Court Oath.</p><p>The U.S. vessel SS Savannah arrives at Liverpool, United Kingdom. It is the first steam-propelled vessel to cross the Atlantic, although most of the journey is made under sail.</p></blockquote><p>That’s the first question of today’s edition. I haven’t the faintest idea! I didn’t have a clue about any of the five questions yesterday, either. My historical knowledge is, without question, <em>atrocious</em>. Thankfully, Paul’s a far more rounded, smarter man than me, and was able to make educated or even informed guesses, and “we” got four out of five! Woo!</p><p>OK, so obviously this isn’t the most groundbreaking of puzzle ideas. But actually, it’s a perfect addition to Wikipedia, because it’s entirely about <em>finding out something new</em>. I may be sitting here wondering literally which century we’re in with that above question, but I’m also dying to know more about the “Tennis Court Oath” now! It’s also wild to realize that the United States Congress adopted the Great Seal around the same era King Louis XVI was trying to flee the French Revolution. I mean, you may say “Duh,” and deeply worry about the standard of British education in the ‘80s and ‘90s, and you’d likely be right to. If my dad were alive to hear my ignorance, he’d be immediately dead again. But, and this is a lifelong philosophy of mine, you never mock someone for not knowing something if they’re willing to learn it <em>now</em>.</p><p>And, with respect to that, Wikipedia’s little game offers direct routes toward some knowledge. At the end of the five questions you’re given your score and streak as you’d expect, but also a nicely presented list of all the articles relevant to the questions you were asked, and indeed dictionary definitions for specific words and terms. Today’s has an excellent 34 boxes to click on for more information, as general as “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Holocaust</a></span>” and as specific as “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimierz_Piechowski&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimierz_Piechowski" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kazimierz Piechowski</a></span>.” And indeed, I’m pleased to say, a tile for the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_Court_Oath&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_Court_Oath" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tennis Court Oath</a></span>.</p><figure id="" data-id="9c1c63a6866d55e076cf9eae7f043b31" data-recommend-id="image://9c1c63a6866d55e076cf9eae7f043b31" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The results page for today's game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The results page for today's game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wikimedia Foundation / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9c1c63a6866d55e076cf9eae7f043b31" data-recommend-id="image://9c1c63a6866d55e076cf9eae7f043b31" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The results page for today's game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When trying to find out more information about Wikipedia’s game, not least whether I’m embarrassingly late to discovering it or one of the first to be offered it, I find there’s the weirdest lack of information out there. When I Googled the term “wikipedia games ‘which came first’,” the second result was, inexplicably, the Wikipedia page for explosive Pokémon <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltorb&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltorb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Voltorb</a></span>.

In fact, the game’s own <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://m.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/Team/Android/TriviaGame&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://m.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/Team/Android/TriviaGame" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“more info” link</a></span> goes to an empty page! (I have, of course, reached out to Wikipedia to ask all about it.) However, I <em>have</em> discovered that it began on May 20, 2025, because that’s how far back the archive of daily games goes. So a month today! Hopefully you can now find it yourself by opening the updated version of the Wikipedia app on your phone. And hopefully it’ll catch on and become a whole section within the app.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Following a recent wave of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/">Borderlands 4</a> previews, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has confirmed that one fan-requested feature will be in the game when it launches in September. While a mini-map won't be in the looter-shooter, a radar will, making situational awareness of a battlefield much easier.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1935803698976022970" rel="nofollow ">In a lengthy thread</a>, Pitchford spoke about how fans had been asking Gearbox to add this feature to the game--many people from the European, US, and Asian preview tours were advocating for it, Pitchford said--and the studio managed to make this happen.</p><p>"As me and head of dev, Steve Jones--and some of the other guys--were poking around with producers trying to figure out what it would take to add these features and if we could make it in time to ship or not, something awesome happened," Pitchford explained. "In classic Gearbox style, where we have an ethos of 'they who builds it, wins,' some developers got together and found some time in the margins of their schedules. Some Gearbox heroes did what Gearbox heroes do!"</p><p>Several Gearbox employees "splintered off" to work on the radar, and Pitchford says they managed to squeeze it into the game before it undergoes some QA testing ahead of its launch. The radar will be off by default when the game launches, and it won't be in the current build of Borderlands 4 on the Borderlands Fan Fest showfloor this weekend. Here's what it looks like in action:</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-adds-long-requested-features-like-mission-replay-and-a-seamless-world/1100-6532503/">Borderlands 4 will also have a few other fan-requested features when it launches</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-is-happy-the-game-is-not-80-and-has-no-paid-early-access/1100-6532526/">base version of the game has an MSRP of $70</a>. "This feels like a Borderlands game through and through where enough has changed for me to feel like this is an improvement over Borderlands 3, but it's not so different that I can expect huge and sweeping changes," Jordan Ramée said in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-continues-the-trend-of-making-sirens-the-most-fun-to-play/1100-6532501/">Borderlands 4 preview</a>.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch 2 version arriving at a later date.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-is-owlcats-first-stab-at-third-person-action-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of The Expanse: Osiris Reborn was undoubtedly one of my personal highlights of this year's Summer Game Fest season.</p>
<p>The Expanse is one of my favorite sci-fi settings, and I've devoured all the books and the seasons of the great TV series adaptation on Prime Video. A couple of years ago, Telltale <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-expanse-a-telltale-series-gets-nearly-10-minutes-of-gameplay-with-developer-commentary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a game based on the show, but its genre and its scope weren't exactly thrilling.</p>
<p>This project, on the other hand, is a third-person shooter RPG inspired by the likes of Mass Effect, powered by Unreal Engine 5, and developed by Owlcat Games, one of the best cRPG studios of the last few years between the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-depth-beyond-all-measure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathfinder titles</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader</a>.</p>
<p>It's a combo that got me, and a lot of RPG and/or The Expanse fans, very, very excited. Moreover, even though it will feature its own characters and stories, it looks much more closely linked to the main narrative of the series. So, as soon as I got the chance, I reached out to Owlcat Games to set up an interview and bombard them with as many questions as they would answer at this time. Check out the full transcript of my conversation with Creative Director Alexander Mishulin and Head of Publishing Andrey Tsvetkov below.</p>
<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn will be released for PC and consoles at an unspecified time. Pre-orders are already available <a href="https://osirisreborn.owlcat.games/#editions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through the official website</a>.</p>

<p><strong> When did you decide to make this game, and how did you contact the license holder?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin:</strong> With all our projects, it's quite a similar story because, internally, we had a group of friends who came out with an internal pitch for the game. We discussed it. We loved it. We talked a lot about how we could make this game, how it could be different and interesting.</p>
<p>The Expanse IP is a very good match for us because of the stories we would like to tell. It's grounded, with many choices and consequences, and all about people and companions. The Expense is all about how humanity, while being more advanced in 300 years from now, is still very much human with all its genius traits, flaws and everything. When we had an internal pitch that we loved and we understood that we could make it happen, we started working out the business side of the details. We approached Alcon with our idea and they were as excited as we were, so the project began and we started to work on pre-production.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. Is the game still in pre-production, or have you moved to production?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>The development started in 2021. We spent almost a year doing prototypes, transitioning between the genres because the game we are making is not quite similar to the games we have done previously. So we established new processes, established new approaches, and made sure that everything is working well, the shooting parts are working well, and of course, established all the new processes to make content. After that, we started making our vertical slices, and now we are full in production.</p>
<p><strong>As you mentioned, The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is a big change for you because you have been making cRPGs, a very different genre. Honestly, I thought that maybe the next step for you would be to make a cRPG still, but with a higher budget, like Baldur's Gate 3 for example, or perhaps Baldur's Gate 4, rather. But no, seriously, it was surprising to see you go with this. I also love Mass Effect, so I'm totally in. But I am curious - did you just go directly for the third person shooter pitch, or did you at some point consider making it a cRPG?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishuli </strong>No. From the first pitch, it was all about making a third person game because The Expanse is about people. We want you to connect more with the characters, the protagonist and the companions, and we want you to be immersed in this very grounded, realistic, sci-fi world.</p>
<p>We wanted to show you that, and for that, we needed to change perspective and make things more realistic and cinematic. Because of that, we transitioned to the third person, and yes, we were a little bit afraid at the beginning. We started prototyping and made several combat and exploration arenas.</p>
<p>We experimented with different approaches, how we wanted our cover system to work, how we wanted our enemies to work. Just for combat arenas, we had six prototypes in the beginning just to make the combat basics feel right. But for the narrative part, it's very much still the same Owlcat game with all the different options for you to choose when you're playing new characters, to embrace them, to feel the consequences of those choices, with all the politics and web of intrigue happening in The Expanse universe. It's very much the same approach to narrative we had in previous games, apart from the dialogue being more cinematic, more in line with the genre.</p>
<p><strong>You also changed the engine, since you are using the Unreal Engine 5 this time. Was it harder or easier than you thought?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>Yeah, it was part of the process when we were in pre-production. We had to establish different processes. It's not difficult or something very special or an unusual transition; it's just a new process to make a new game. Also, we expanded our team for this project. We welcomed new team members from companies that have already done similar games, especially from CD Projekt, so we built not only upon our own expertise and knowledge but also upon our new colleagues' knowledge, which helped us quite a lot.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We have more than 450 people within the studio. We can totally ensure our fans that working on several projects simultaneously wouldn't impact the quality of each of them. There won't be a situation where The Expanse: Osiris Reborn damages Dark Heresy in any way or vice versa.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Can you share how much of the team is working on The Expanse: Osiris Reborn? I know you have a lot going on. There's a new Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader DLC on the way, and there's the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-dark-heresy-is-owlcats-next-inquisition-themed-crpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</a> game in development. Can you say how much of the team is working on this one?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrey Tsvetkov:</strong> I can briefly jump in here. Sure, we have several projects going on, and right now, we have more than 450 people within the studio. We are very fortunate to have grown to this point with the support of our players. I don't think we'd like to share the exact number of the actual teams just because it's not fixed, right? At specific points of the developer process, some developers join the team to help at a specific moment just because of more tasks within production and everything. And then, when it's needed, some people move forward to other projects as well.</p>
<p>But I can say that we can totally ensure our fans that working on several projects simultaneously wouldn't impact the quality of each of them. There won't be a situation where The Expanse: Osiris Reborn damages Dark Heresy in any way or vice versa. We would never jump into this kind of situation if we had the feeling that one of our beloved projects would actually get hurt in this way and fail to deliver the experience we want to our fans.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us which of the two new games is launching first?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrey Tsvetkov:</strong> Not at this point, I'm afraid.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We want our game to be very realistic, cinematic, and approachable. Usually, those are hallmarks of AAA experiences. That said, we are not making it specifically to be AAA. We are making it in such a way that we imagine a great immersive The Expanse experience.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Okay, fair enough. Sticking with The Expanse, do you consider it to be a triple-A game in your ambition and scope?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>In terms of production and approaches, we want our game to be very realistic, cinematic, and approachable. Usually, those are hallmarks of AAA experiences. That said, we are not making it specifically to be AAA.</p>
<p>We are making it in such a way that we imagine a great immersive The Expanse experience, allowing all the players, be them fans of deep narrative games with choice and consequences or fans of action RPGs or just fans of The Expanse to join in, experience the game, and feel very much at home within the game. As much as The Expanse allows you to feel at home, because it's not really a very cozy universe, but still, this is our approach for this game.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of the timeline, when does this game start in the narrative we know?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>The game is happening between the first and the second book, or, if we are talking about the show's seasons, from the first season to the second season and a half. We are telling our own story happening in the universe. When we approached Alcon and talked about the project, they told us that they wanted to expand the universe, to tell more stories, and our vision was the same. We are telling a new story that is happening simultaneously with all the events of the books and the show.</p>
<p>So, you'll be feeling the repercussions of the destruction of the Canterbury and the events on Eros. You will see some of the events with your own eyes, but for most of the adventure, you will understand how this universe, how the whole solar system responds to what's happening, and to the adventures of Holden and his team.</p>
<p><strong>I think you teased that some characters may appear in some form, right? I guess it's too early to share who those might be, though.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrey Tsvetkov: </strong>We would really love to share it. It's tempting, but we won't be doing that now. Unfortunately, it's too early for us to speak about it. But yeah, we'll certainly uncover this at some point in the future.</p>
<p><strong>You've said that players will create their own character. Character, right? Usually, in most RPGs, making the character also means choosing between different races, each with its own attributes and abilities. Of course, in The Expanse, they're all humans, except for minor differences, like Belters having a body that cannot bear the full weight of Earth's gravity due to generations of living in space. But, in RPG terms, will there be any differences in the game depending on your choice of Earther, Martian, or Belter?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>When you start the game and create the character, you select your origin, and that is a huge choice, not only in terms of RPG elements but also in terms of storyline. It's your origin story, how you came to be, and many choices and consequences in the game will react to you being from a certain faction. For example, when you visit Ceres after all the events surrounding the Canterbury, the Belt is agitated towards Earthers and Martians. So, if you are not a Belter, you will encounter some forms of aggression towards you. If you are playing with a Belter character, you will feel more at home.</p>
<p>Additionally, some of the choices and some of the options available to you will be different. The same goes for all the origins. They all have different choices and parts of unique content that they will access as the start of their story. And then when the story takes shape, you'll start to forge your own path, dabble in politics, and probably choose some other faction you want to support, not necessarily your own. Maybe I'm playing a Martian, but I feel that I want to help the Belters, and I want to become friends with this faction, so I build a relationship with them in such a way that I'm supporting their cause and their reaction towards me will slowly change to reflect that.</p>
<p><strong>In the original narrative, Holden and his crew eventually earn the favor of most of the factions. However, sometimes RPGs have mechanics where you must choose between factions and befriending one automatically makes another hostile. What's your approach here? Can you be a very diplomatic character in good standing with several factions at once?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>I will not answer directly because, first of all, this system and this narrative part are still very much in development. But our vision is that we want you to experience all the political powers and the power plays in the universe. We want you to be able to join a certain faction, try to forge your own path, or try to ignore the factions for most of your decisions. We are trying to provide you with as many roleplaying choices as we possibly can in this regard. Of course, for all those choices, we want you to see the consequences of your actions, whereas a faction will like you or dislike you, or you manage to play one faction against another.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also some light mechanics supporting it. I will not delve into details, but we want the game to be a whole experience, not too narrative-focused or too mechanics-focused. It's a balanced experience. When discussing character creation earlier, I focused more on narrative, which is part of the character creation, but there is also a mechanical part supporting the narrative. The same goes here.</p>
<p><strong>Companions are going to be a big part of the game, right? Can you say how many there will be?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>I couldn't tell you the exact number of companions, sorry. But as for the approach, we want the companions to be front and center of all our games, but this time around, we are trying to give them an even bigger spotlight. You are going on a mission with two companions, but the rest of the team is not left behind on the ship. They can still help you fulfill your mission objectives in many different ways.</p>
<p>Probably somebody will stay on the ship and help you with the ship throughout the mission, or some of the companions can go fulfill their own objectives, or they can form a second team that goes through the mission on a different path. Sometimes you're meeting them, helping them out, or they're helping you out and you're progressing through those missions. It's not like every mission has a similar pattern, so every time it is different. Sometimes it's more focused on a couple of companions. Sometimes it's more your own personal story. But overall, we are bringing companions to the missions as much as we can.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We want the companions to be front and center of all our games, but this time around, we are trying to give them an even bigger spotlight.

Overall, we are bringing companions to the missions as much as we can.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Okay. I know you confirmed that there will be romance, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>What differences, if any, will there be with the romances seen in your most recent game, Rogue Trader?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>When we're approaching romances in our games, we try to make it interesting, both in terms of decisions and in terms of how you approach certain characters through romances and how romances show the characters from a different perspective. The same goes here. It'll be deep narrative experiences that allow you to understand your character better, understand the companion better, and go through this story in the way you like.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of combat, can you share how many active abilities you are targeting? I would wager less than in a CRPG.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>We want our players to have a lot of freedom in how they play the game. You can select a character that is more weapons-focused, and then you will be relying more on weapons, on shooting and your targeting skills, but you can also create a character that has more focus on abilities and playing from abilities' perspective and building your gameplay and your choices to support your abilities depending on that or a mix between the gunplay and abilities. You will feel the difference and you can build your character to support the play style you want.</p>
<p>To do that, we are trying to make a game that is accessible, perhaps not with all the building options like in Pathfinder or Rogue Trader, but there are still a lot of synergies to find and a lot of perks to choose from, so you can rely on that. We want all the players familiar with cover shooters, with action RPGs and, of course, with Mass Effect to feel at home.</p>
<p><strong>Ranged combat obviously plays a significant role given the setting, but can you make a melee-focused character?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>You can create a character focused on close-range combat, using weapons like shotguns. Also, you saw in the trailer that one of the characters was carrying a shield and had a shoulder cannon, so you can go into close-range combat with a more defensive stance. So, if you favor this approach, there are some options that will be available for you in the game.</p>
<p><strong>As you have noted, The Expanse is quite grounded compared to other sci-fi settings.&nbsp;I've read some comments on places like the Steam forums, where some people feel that it might be duller to make a game in this setting compared to, say, Star Wars or Star Trek. What's your response to this concern?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>The Expanse is grounded, but it's still over three hundred years in the future. And if you just look at some weapon prototypes available to the military, they already feel like futuristic technology. It's just not a common place.</p>
<p>We're also providing our players with different devices for their abilities. Some of them are very much grounded, but others are a little bit more futuristic. There are also drones that are becoming the staple of modern combat. There are still a lot of things to choose from, even if we are talking about realistic combat right now, and we are, of course, pushing forward because 300 years have passed and allowing players to choose more grounded sci-fi abilities as well, especially for the characters that are more focused on ability use.</p>
<p>Right now, when we play our internal builds, we feel a lot of differences in those play styles. We are making very different builds and have a lot of options to choose from. We are hoping our players will share our experience as well.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Right now, when we play our internal builds, we feel a lot of differences in those play styles. We are making very different builds and have a lot of options to choose from. We are hoping our players will share our experience as well.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Will there be ship combat in The Expanse: Osiris Reborn?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>There is no huge mini-game that allows you to play ship combat as a mini-game, but traveling on a spaceship is very much part of The Expanse and we want you to feel that. So there is no full-fledged mechanic, but there are some surprises regarding this in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. I guess we'll have to wait and see. Thank you for your time!</strong></p>

            <p>To suddenly make a leviathan 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/victoria-3">Victoria 3</a> free to play the day before the weekend is either an act of historic generosity or a masterstroke of cruelty. My dear friends at Paradox Interactive, I have literally just sent Nic my contributions to this weekend's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/playing-this-weekend">What Are We All Playing</a> round-up. And now, sirs and madams, you would have me reckon with approximately a century's worth of densely tabulated imperialism, optional child labour and people called Leopold. </p>
<p>Not only have I popped my monocle, sirs and madams, but my top hat has gone off like a volcano and my handlebar mustache has twisted itself into a pair of propellers, which are now flying me away into the sunset. I bid you good evening, sirs and madams! I say again: good evening and good night!</p> <!--more-->
<p>The giveaway <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/529340/view/550115608635644077?l=english">runs till 23rd June on Steam</a>, and only applies to Victoria 3's base game. You will need to buy the whole thing if you want to play beyond that window. It coincides with the launch of the Chambers Of Commerce DLC. Yes, this is the familiar Paradox gambit of enticing punters with a timed freebie, then burying them in paid expansions, like, I don't know, Queen Victoria shoving Gladstone's head down the toilet for proposing universal male suffrage.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">had words with the publishers last year</a> about the often-heard claim that Paradox are in the habit of releasing games 'unfinished', then charging for expansions that add key mechanics. They said they were "trying to find a middle ground", while acknowledging that it was a "fail" to release Victoria 3, specifically, without a proper warfare system.</p>
<p>Even in the absence of a chunky military component, Victoria 3 appears to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/victoria-3-review">solid work</a>. Back in 2022, our reviewer Caelyn Ellis called it "a warts and all take on a tumultuous period in history" and "a surprisingly thought-provoking experience", not least for how it handles the whole British Empire thing. OK, Paradox, I have talked myself into trying it now. Witness me returning from the sky, whiskers whirring, exploded top hat held penitentially in one hand.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
