            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PlayStation has been sued in the Netherlands over the high prices of digital games and in-game content, which the company can force upon users with its dominant position in the market.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-playstation-sued-in-the-netherlands-in-class-action-lawsuit-over-artificially-high-playstation-prices.1226472/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument, a Dutch non-profit consumer foundation representing large groups of consumers in class action lawsuits, confirmed today on its<a href="https://www.massaschadeconsument.nl/nieuws/2025-06-24-sony-gedagvaard-in-collectieve-rechtszaak-om-kunstmatig-hoge-playstation-prijzen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> official website</a> that it has summoned Sony in a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Dutch PlayStation players over the company exploiting its dominant position in the console market, and denying potential app stores access to its gaming systems. The class action lawsuit is the culmination of the Fair PlayStation campaign launched back in February, which highlighted how, in the PlayStation 5 generation, consumers are being pushed more and more towards digital-only consoles, where games and in-game content can only be purchased exclusively via the PlayStation Store. This dominant position led to the establishment of the so-called Sony tax, artificially high prices that make gamers pay much more for digital games and in-game content than they would in a free market.</p>
<p>In its summons, the Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument foundation accuses PlayStation of excluding competition and exploiting consumers and game developers, utilizing its dominant position in the market. By removing consumers' and third-party publishers' choice, Sony greatly profits from the situation, making more than twice as much margin on digital sales as on retail copies. As such, the advantages of digital distribution go entirely to the Japanese company. Since 2013, the damage to Dutch consumers has amounted to 435 million euros.</p>
<p>The next step in this class action lawsuit will be the first hearing, which may already take place this year. The Dutch court will evaluate its jurisdiction on the matter and the admissibility of the foundation. If the court grants the claim, the foundation expects Sony to be forced to open the market for selling digital PlayStation content to other providers, which is extremely unlikely to happen, at least not directly via PlayStation consoles.</p>
<p>With the pricing of digital games on PlayStation 5 being extremely high and the market being pushed more and more towards an all-digital future, there's definitely some merit to the Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument class action lawsuit. Hopefully, this will lead to some much-needed changes, especially at a time when gaming is becoming an increasingly more expensive hobby, with prices of <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">consoles</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">games</a> rising across the board.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Six or so years on from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hypixels-riot-backed-hytale-announced">an announcement trailer</a> that made it clear people had an appetite for their game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y building and survival shenanigans (it's got 61 million views to date), Hypixel Studios have announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> has been cancelled. On top of that, the studio themselves are gearing up for closure.</p>
<p>Hytale's development kicked off all the way back in 2015, with its devs being the folks behind the huge <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecraft-biggest-servers">Hypixel Minecraft server</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> publisher Riot Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-have-bought-hytale-developers-hypixel-studios">bought the studio</a> in 2020, not long after we learned that Hytale would have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-will-have-undead-chickens">undead chickens</a>, and not long before the game's target release year started being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-wont-be-launching-until-2023-at-the-earliest">pushed</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-devs-are-redeveloping-its-engine-say-no-release-in-2023">back</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This is not the outcome any of us - at Hypixel or at Riot - wanted," Hypixel co-founder Noxy wrote in <a href="https://www.hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale">an update post</a> on the studio's website, "But after years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn’t bring Hytale to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise."</p>
<p>He went on to paint a picture of feature creep lining the road to the game's demise, explaining:</p>
<blockquote>Over time, as our vision evolved and the genre matured around us, the bar kept rising. Our technical ambitions grew more complex, and even after a major reboot of the game engine, the team found that Hytale still wasn’t as far along as it needed to be. It became clear we’d need a lot more time to get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision for the game. We looked at reducing scope, adjusting timelines, and finding new angles to keep moving forward. But each of those options would have meant compromising on what made Hytale special in the first place. It wouldn’t have been the game we set out to make. And it wouldn’t have been the game you deserve.</blockquote>
<p>Noxy added that the studio did try to seek out "investors or acquirers who could continue to help carry Hytale forward" once Riot had made the call to pull its backing, but this looks to have come to nought. With Hypixel Studios now "winding down", the co-founder thanked the publisher for providing "generous severance and resources" to staff who're being laid off.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that Hypixel's Minecraft server will continue to run as normal despite the cancellation and impending closure.</p>
<p>It's a really unfortunate end for Hytale, assuming the game isn't able to be resurrected in some way further down the line, especially given the decade Hypixel put into developing it. "We’re proud of what we built, and we’ll carry those lessons forward into whatever comes next," Noxy wrote to close out his post.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafty-sandbox-game-hytale-cancelled-after-a-decade-in-development-as-hypixel-studios-prepare-to-close]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a massive improvement over the original in terms of visuals and a very effective showcase of the Decima Engine.</p>
<p>A new video shared on YouTube by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Nick930" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nick930</a> puts the second entry in the series side-by-side with the Director's Cut release of the first entry in the franchise by Hideo Kojima running on PlayStation 5 Pro, comparing character models, environments, animations, and more. By all metrics, the new entry in the series is a massive improvement over its predecessor, and a great showcase of what can be achieved using the Decima Engine, so much so that the two games don't feel like they are only five years apart.</p>
<p><iframe title="Death Stranding 2: On the Beach vs Original | Direct Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nyMDgwTET2Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach doesn't just look better than its predecessor, but it's also a better game, and the culmination of Hideo Kojima's best and worst ideas, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">review-in-progress</a>.</p>
<p><em>As impossible to describe as the first, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a culmination of some of Kojima's best (and worst) ideas all in one package that's more cohesive and less coherent than anything his team has done so far.</em></p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach launches on PlayStation 5 on June 26th worldwide. Owners of the Deluxe Edition can play the game already, thanks to the included 48-hour early access perk.</p>

Hypixel Studios, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21223667/riot-games-league-of-legends-hypixel-studios-minecraft-hytale">Riot acquired in 2020</a> for an undisclosed sum, is shutting down “over the next few months,” according to Hypixel CEO Aaron “Noxy” Donaghey.</p><p>“After years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn’t bring <em>Hytale </em>to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise,“ says Donaghey in a <a href="https://x.com/noxywoxy/status/1937180229031940439?s=46">post on X</a>. ”This is a painful decision.

A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o77MzDQT1cg">trailer was released</a> in late 2018, and Hypixel was supposed to deliver a beta of <em>Hytale</em> in 2021 following the Riot acquisition a year prior.

Our goal is not to force PvE players to interact with a PvP system that they may have no interest in. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We still believe in the core concept of the Deep Desert — an endlessly renewing location that resets every week and creates an activity loop for great rewards. The tension of heading out there, head on a swivel, eyes peeled for foes as you enter the most dangerous part of the most dangerous planet in the universe, Our wish was that players would embrace this loop, forming guilds to work together to overcome the bleakness of the Deep Desert. But as Stephen King says, 'Wish in one hand, sh*t in the other, see which one fills up first.' One of my hands is overflowing right now and sadly not with wishes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bylos admitted that the "extremely competitive nature" of the Deep Desert was forcing players to engage when they may prefer PvP, and consequently, some areas of the Deep Desert will now be flagged as "Partial Warfare (PvE)" where players can grab rare resources without getting ambushed. The largest spice fields, shipwrecks and Landsraad control points will remain "War of Assassins (PvP)" as "high reward, high risk" areas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, the whole game is balanced around guilds and groups, so if you prefer to be a lone wolf, you can expect it to be "grindy if [you] play solo."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Orni griefing? "Thopters will always be incredibly important for crossing the desert, but they shouldn’t also be the dominant force in actual battles," Bylos said, adding that the following will be implemented "shortly": </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Scout Ornithopters with rocket launchers attached will have their speed maneuverability reduced</li><li>Rockets fired from Scout Ornithopters will have increased heat generation</li><li>Thrusters will provide a max speed bonus regardless of wings, ensuring that thruster equipped scouts will be the fastest vehicles in the game </li><li>A new T5 infantry rocket launcher will be added to help improve the dynamics of vehicle/ground combat </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the Landsraad. Bylos defines it as "an umbrella for all endgame activities," such as dungeons, contracts, and "more specialized delivery tasks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As a system it is an activity driver that is designed to promote the conflict between the factions, internal politics between the guilds, while providing goal thresholds for individuals and groups to work towards getting personal rewards," the director explained. "And the Landsraad should be doing that for everyone who wants to participate in the elder game, be they PvEer or PvPer. The Landsraad should be giving you things to do every day and every week. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s nothing new, from a design perspective, we’ve seen daily/weekly quest systems in games for a long time. Our approach was to try and frame this system around the greater politics of the Dune universe, by having players engage in activities to earn the votes of the various Landsraad houses." Consequently, Funcom will shortly be addressing "key flaws" in the Landsraad design, too, including stockpiling, which is currently rewarded but was not designed to be that way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Once a live game launches, it becomes a collaborative effort between the developers and the players to make it something amazing," Bylos concluded. "We appreciate your feedback on what we hope is the beginning of a long journey together. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Bear with us — our intention is to be clear and open in our communications and to make Dune: Awakening a game that everybody can enjoy."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dune: Awakening Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-dev-working-on-pvp-and-deep-desert-issues-as-new-concurrent-user-peak-record-is-set"><u>Dune: Awakening a Great 8/10 in our review</u></a>, writing: "Dune: Awakening is an excellent survival MMO that captures Frank Herbet’s sci-fi world incredibly well, mostly to its advantage and occasionally to its detriment.

                <p>Unlike Sony or Microsoft, Nintendo doesn't appear to be interested in bringing its games to anything other than a Nintendo console. That hasn't stopped fans from unofficially porting some of Nintendo's older games to PC. Now, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-64/" data-ref-id="5000-1330">Mario Kart 64</a> is the latest classic title to make the leap to PC.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fan-made-mario-kart-64-pc-port-released-with-track-editor-and-ultrawide-support/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, the fan programming team known as Harbour Masters has shared its Mario Kart 64 port, which has been dubbed SpaghettiKart. Harbour Masters and its "vast number of contributors" reverse-engineered Mario Kart 64's original code and added modern graphics options including support for ultrawide screens, 4k resolution, and higher frame rates.</p><p>SpaghettiKart also has new features including the ability to create customized race courses and increasing the difficulty of the CPU drivers. Harbour Masters has previously created PC ports for Star Fox 64, The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. These games have "clean codes" that don't borrow or use any of the original code from the original N64 games. However, these PC ports still require players to have legally-sourced ROMs in order to use them.</p><p>Earlier this year, a separate fan-created project brought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-64-mod-brings-minecraft-to-the-mushroom-kingdom/1100-6531772/" data-ref-id="1100-6531772">Minecraft to Super Mario 64</a>, both for a PC emulator and it even works on Nintendo 64 consoles with some limitations. The most recent game in the Mario Kart series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-world-review/1900-6418371/" data-ref-id="1900-6418371">Mario Kart World</a>, was released earlier this month as a launch title for Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<figure><a title="System Shock 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e7f90c57e69c2/system-shock-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nightdive Studios</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nightdive Studios has announced that it has delayed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2</a> on the Switch, with the game now targeting a console release within "the first two weeks of July".</p>
<p>In a statement released on social media, the remaster wizards stated that the team simply "encountered issues" that prevented it from releasing the game on its originally intended launch date of 26th June. If you happen to be playing on PC, get your chisel out, because this date is still locked in – it's just the console release that's affected.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mkuqps&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>It doesn't sound like we'll be waiting <em>too</em> long for the game, however, though it's important to keep in mind that the current July estimate is exactly that – an estimate – and is just as prone to a further delay should the team deem it necessary.</p>
<p>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster is an enhanced release of the original 1999 classic from co-developers Irrational Games and Looking Glass Studios. It was one of the first projects from creator Ken Levine and is considered a spiritual precursor to the <strong>Bioshock</strong> series.</p>
<p>A full-blown <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/system_shock">remake of the original System Shock</a> was released on PC and consoles, but skipped the Switch when it cropped up in 2024. We wouldn't be surprised, however, to see it ported over to the Switch 2 in the near future to take full advantage of the console's extra power.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes The Deep</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> developers The Chinese Room have laid off a number of staff, seemingly as part of parent company Sumo Digital's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-look-likely-at-sumo-digital-as-company-ditches-plans-to-work-on-its-own-ip">wider strategic decision in February 2025</a> to move away from original game creation and "focus exclusively on development services for partners".</p>
<p>As originally reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-still-wakes-the-deep-developer-the-chinese-room-is-making-layoffs">Game Developer</a>, several Chinese Room devs took to LinkedIn last week to post about leaving the studio.</p>
<p>VFX artist Jamie Berry <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341430185805680640/">writes</a> that "the scourge of redundancy has struck". Technical producer Pascal Siddons <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pascal-siddons-9aa255133_we-are-none-of-us-safe-from-the-headsmans-activity-7341109140871639040-X1eh/">adds</a> that "we are none of us safe from the headsman's axe when redundancy time comes around". 3D animator Bradly Adams and senior environment artist Adam Sharp <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341127507061956608/">both</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341437875885903873/">observe</a> less colourfully that "my current role and many others have been affected by recent events".</p>
<p>The Chinese Room have yet to give a comment on the situation, but Game Developer have confirmed with Sumo Group that several members of the company's Content &amp; Communications team have been affected by the company's recently announced change of direction. Sumo haven't shared a timeframe or any other details about these departures.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/bloodlines-2-developer-the-chinese-room-has-laid-off-employees-but-paradox-says-the-game-is-still-coming-in-october/">PCGamer</a>, meanwhile, have picked up a statement from Bloodlines 2 publishers Paradox Interactive, who insist that all this redundancy rigmarole will not affect the game's planned October release. "Development on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is unaffected by the recent staffing changes at The Chinese Room; the game is still scheduled for an October release," a Paradox representative told the site. "We wish those affected the best of luck on their future endeavors."</p>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been delayed so often it may well be subject to some kind of ancient curse. Once in the hands of Hardsuit Labs, it was transferred to The Chinese Room in 2021, becoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">more "spiritual successor" than sequel</a> in the process. Still, this week's revelations are more about Sumo than vampires and their masquerades.</p>
<p>Founded back in 2003 and acquired by Tencent in 2021, Sumo have a long history of work-for-hire projects, including many spells as lead dev on games like the fairly smashing Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing. They had recently been experimenting with original games such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathsprint-66">Deathsprint 66</a> via their own publishing label, Secret Mode, but the last couple of years have been rocky. Sumo <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/still-wakes-the-deep-warhammer-40000-boltgun-and-deathsprint-66-makers-to-lay-off-hundreds-off-staff">cut hundreds of staff</a> in June 2024 while closing Canadian studio Timbre Games (<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/timbre-games-is-going-indie-after-being-shuttered-by-sumo-group">who have since resurfaced as an indie</a>).</p>
<p>In February this year, the company <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2025/sumo-group-update/">announced</a> that "we must balance our creative ambitions and the commercial realities to ensure the long-term stability and success of our business", acknowledging that "unavoidably this transition will have an impact on our studios and people." Best of luck to all the everyday humans impacted by these rebalancings.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/layoffs-at-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-studio-as-paradox-promise-rpg-will-still-release-in-october]]></content:encoded>

<p>Seen as a means of keeping the playing field (relatively) level, this item targets the player in first place, and has been the cause of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/02/mario_kart_8_deluxe_world_record_attempt_fittingly_destroyed_by_blue_shell">much frustration over the decades</a>—to the point where some people argue it's actually a <em>disadvantage</em> to be in first position for much of each Mario Kart race.</p>
<p>It would seem that Sega has been aware of this issue when designing its Mario Kart rival <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, which is coming to Switch, Switch 2, PS4, PS5, PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S later this year.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog/veteran-sonic-producer-says-sonic-racing-crossworlds-team-completely-removed-items-from-the-game-if-they-were-too-stressful-or-let-players-win-all-the-time/">GamesRadar+</a>, Sonic series producer Takashi Iizuka reveals that when developing the game, there was a focus on making the racing "balanced" and "fair", even going as far as to design the circuits <em>before</em> thinking about adding items to the mix.</p>
<p>"They wanted to make sure the racing itself without any items was fair and fun," says Iizuka. "The dev team really took things down to the base level, and wanted to have that fun, competitive racing mechanic."</p>

<p>Even when items were in place, Iizuka explains that a multitude of playtests took place in order to ensure that the experience remained fair. "Anything that was very stressful for players, anything that always allowed people to come back from behind and win all the time needed to be removed from the concept," he says, throwing some subtle shade on Mario Kart's most feared item.</p>
<p>If you're worried that Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is sounding too sterile and safe, don't be—Iizuka admits that the development team eventually hit a balance which was just "the right amount of chaotic" while remaining "fair to the racers."</p>
<p>We'll see if this balance is successful when the game launches on September 25th. The Switch 2 version is expected at a later date.</p>

            <p>Carcinisation comes for us all, in time. Today, it is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>'s turn. The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3455990749">crustacean nation mod</a> adds four legendary lords, heroes, 27 crabulous units, new spells, plus custom tech and building trees for a complete crab-paign experience. It would have been shellfish of me not to share, if not downright altruistic to avoid any and all crab puns.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I played a few turns as King Crab, who appears have to appropriated Greasus Goldtooth's crown and sceptre, and I'd be lying if I said it didn't suit him. You start on the eastern coast of the Empire, at war with a Marienburger lord named "Simon Crab-Hunter' and some Norscans. Your unique campaign mechanic here is a resource named Gleaming Shells, which you'll spend on commands similar to Karl Franz's - refresh army movement range ("scuttle onward"), make yourself immune to trespassing penalties, and so on. You also start with two units of crab knights, which are crabs riding bigger crabs.</p>
<p>The mod is by <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023503085/myworkshopfiles/?appid=1142710">Pegaz</a>, who's made several others for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>, such as some unique <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3412700662">Ogre Maneaters</a>. As with most custom faction mods, you'll need <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2859968660">Mixu's unlocker</a> to use it.</p>

<p>We're still awaiting the reveal of the final official faction set to join Norsca and Slaanesh for the next DLC, Tides Of Torment. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-fans-reckon-theyve-already-guessed-which-faction-is-coming-next-in-tides-of-torment">The current favourite is the high elves</a>, specifically naval commander Sea Lord Aislinn. Preferably with massive <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/shop/high-elf-realms-merwyrm-2025">Merwyrms</a> in tow, mainly so I can shout "That's not your wyrm, it's Merwrym!" at my stunned and jealous enemies. The reveal should be coming next month.</p>
<p>There's also a good chance we'll be hearing some news about the fabled Total Warty Thousand by the end of the year, say I. Although even if that doesn't end up happening, Creative Assembly have announced the announcement, announcedly, of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-anniversary-event-showing-off-new-games-this-december">new Total War games this December</a> as part of an anniversary showcase. I crab not wait. Pincer me, I'm dreaming. It's Lobster get excited about. I shell go sit in the corner and think about what I've done now.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-entire-crab-army-comes-to-total-war-warhammer-3-in-the-crustacean-nation-mod]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Fatshark announced the release of the first paid DLC for <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-patch-13-preview-and-qa-class-system-overhaul-xbox-specs-and-pc-performance-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K Darktide</a>. Priced at $11.99 for the Standard Edition and at $18.99 for the Deluxe Edition, the DLC provides access to a new class, the Adeptus Arbites, who can rely on a Cyber-Mastiff companion, which players can customize in name and looks. The Cyber-Mastiff has its own Passive target selection, which it will use to help players against anything that comes too close. The Cyber-Mastiff can also be commanded to attack a specific target, which will override any behavior of its own. To command the Cyber-Mastiff, double-tap the Tag Input on any enemy eligible to be Tagged.</p>
<p>Arbites have plenty of options to customize their playstyle, with Talent Tree sections like Elite Killing and Cyber-Mastiff Handling, Hybrid Combat and Supportive Utility, and Crowd Control and Melee. Those who don't enjoy having a companion can even grab the Lone-Wolf talent, which removes access to the Cyber-Mastiff but provides +15% Toughness Damage Reduction, +10% Attack Speed, +10% Damage, +1 increased Charges on your Blitz Abilities, and replenishes a charge of Blitz Ability every 60 seconds.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Arbites Class | Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GVaGC0xXUVg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alongside the Arbites DLC, Warhammer 40K Darktide was also updated with a free patch titled The Battle for Tertium. The core player experience has been overhauled to provide a clearer narrative focus on the Battle for Tertium. Players will now experience a linear campaign featuring new mission debriefs and embedded cinematics. This new progression path is designed to make it easier for new players to get started and gradually unlock features previously restricted by character level. Previously, each new player's experience was completely random. However, the Battle for Tertium narrative presents maps, enemies, and characters in a specific order, enabling players to discover all aspects of the game at a much better pace.</p>
<p>Fatshark has even introduced a new mission board system. Missions will no longer be tied to a specific difficulty, meaning you can select a mission and then choose your desired difficulty. This effectively increases the number of mission options available to players of all levels.</p>
<p>Additionally, the difficulty system in Warhammer 40K Darktide has been completely revamped. Rather than leveling up your characters, you now unlock new difficulties by completing missions. You must prove your skills at your current maximum difficulty to unlock access to the next difficulty. The studio believes it will motivate new players to master the game step by step and give veteran players confidence that their teammates have earned their place.</p>
<p>There's also a new Inferno in-game event running until July 7, and a new Havoc campaign. Lastly, the maximum number of Operatives was increased to 8, and the maximum number of weapon loadouts received the same treatment. Players will also hear around 900 new banter conversations between characters.</p>

<figure><a title="GameCube Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/46e951e621e03/gamecube-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's online service has made GameCube games available for the Switch 2 and if you're wondering whether it's worth paying the extra money to experience these retro titles but aren't so sure after Nintendo's history with emulation of <em>other</em> legacy systems, this video might be worth a look.</p>
<p>Game developer and YouTuber <a href="https://youtu.be/A3ylCAr0dbs">Modern Vintage Gamer</a>, who has an extensive history in the field of video game emulation, has taken a look at the Switch Online's latest "classic" library and while he finds the experience to be "decent" enough, he can't help but feel there are some underlying issues "Nintendo desperately needs to fix" – drawing a comparison to Switch Online's emulation of Nintendo 64 games, and how the Japanese firm eventually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/02/nintendo-appears-to-have-improved-switch-onlines-n64-emulation">got on top of these problems</a>.</p>
<p>While the initial first impressions of the GameCube library are "very good", there are apparently some "obvious" differences to the real experience – with the video below highlighting input lag issues, analog sensitivity and calibration, and online performance and networking also causing some problems. Of course, these aren't necessarily going to be a big deal to anyone who is simply seeking a quick nostalgic fix, but if you're a retro purist it may not live up to expectations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>MVG:</strong> "If you're a casual player you may not even realise some of these issues...but if you're a hardcore F-Zero gamer, you may be feeling a little more frustrated with how the game plays."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can get the full rundown in MVG's video below and check out more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ModernVintageGamer">Switch 2 videos on his YouTube channel</a> (he's worked on projects like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/video_mvg_explains_how_the_original_shantae_game_was_ported_to_switch">Shantae port for Switch</a> as well). The tech experts at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/digital-foundry-is-happy-with-switch-2-but-feels-the-screen-is-problematic">Digital Foundry</a> have also shared an analysis of Nintendo's new hybrid system calling it a "satisfying upgrade" despite some "problematic" display issues.</p>

Longtime fans and anyone who loves tricky platformers will be pleased to know the original difficulty setting are still present. But this release also has the modified, more forgiving settings introduced in the 2013 Nintendo 3DS port.

The local co-op mode is a blast and makes the experience more approachable for novices and youngsters.</p><p>Though it's too small for the Switch 2, it's worth noting that RDS Industries released an officially licensed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Traveler-Deluxe-Country-Returns-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DTJ98T8Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Donkey Kong Country Returns Nintendo Switch carrying case</a> alongside the game earlier this year.

It's the only other modern side-scroller in the franchise, and it (thankfully) feels quite similar to Donkey Kong Country Returns in motion. Overall, there's more variety and playfulness on hand in Tropical Freeze's 63 levels. That may sound like a big drop in level count, but many of the levels take longer to complete, so the games feel roughly the same length in the end.</p><p>Like most of the Wii U's best games, Tropical Freeze got a second chance at life on Switch. It's not quite as challenging as its predecessor, so we'd actually recommend starting here if you're new to the series. Tropical Freeze also has more playable characters. Beyond Donkey and Diddy Kong, you can play as Cranky, Dixie, or Funky. Each character has their own unique moves and feels different enough to warrant multiple playthroughs. </p><p>Though Tropical Freeze is basically the same game on Switch and Wii U, the addition of Funky Kong essentially created an assist mode similar to Nabbit and Toadette in New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe. Funky Kong can double jump and hover, and his surfboard lets him stand on spikes.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>

DKC platformers above. Instead, this remake of the Game Boy Advance classic lets Donkey Kong return to his days as a villain. Essentially a spiritual successor to Donkey Kong on Game Boy--which itself is an homage to the classic arcade game--Mario vs. Donkey Kong is a puzzle-platformer that favors quick wits rather than reflexes.</p><p>After Donkey Kong steals a bunch of Mini-Mario toys, you have to get them back by completing a wide assortment of room-based challenges. Mario vs. Donkey Kong has more than 130 levels in all. Most levels are bite-sized and can be completed in a few minutes, but it also has some clever boss fights and cool optional challenges.</p><p>Just be aware that even though this is technically a platformer, Mario moves much slower than he does in the mainline Super Mario series. There's a weightiness to the movement system that emphasizes the methodical puzzle focus.</p><p>If Woot sells out of the $40 deal, you can get a region-free European import from Amazon for $44.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>As a reminder, these Switch games are also compatible with the Switch 2, and they all have the full game on the cartridge, just in case you aren't a fan of Nintendo's Game-Key Card system.

<figure><a title="Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cdfc4f3f7d5ae/switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Many libraries offer services where you can experience and even borrow video games. Unfortunately, a 45-year-old Oakland man named Jamal Reed-Obafumi has been arrested after being accused of stealing "approximately $10,000 worth" of Nintendo Switch video games from Marin County Libraries, located in Northern California.</p>
<p>Marin County's Sheriff's Detectives arrested Reed-Obafumi last week after he was "connected to a string of at least seven different burglaries of Marin County Libraries". This took place between April and June 2025 across multiple branches.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mkuqps&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The Sheriff's Office further notes how he has been "booked" into the Marin County Jail and is currently facing 12 felony charges, including multiple counts of burglary and committing a felony while out on bail. It's further noted how libraries "must be safeguarded for everyone to enjoy" as they are a pillar of the community.</p>
<p>According to GameSpot, the Marin County Library <a href="https://marinlibrary.bibliocommons.com/v2/search?query=Switch&amp;searchType=keyword&amp;f_FORMAT=VIDEO_GAME">reportedly has a catalog of over "200 Switch games available to borrow"</a>. It's not mentioned if any of the games have been recovered. This follows a story last week about more than 2,800 Switch 2 consoles being stolen from a semi-truck in Texas. You can find out more about this in our previous story.</p>

<p>This 11-year sponsorship marks the end of "one of the longest partnerships" in esports history, as detailed by Sports Illustrated. According to the same source, Aghren banned Marquez from all of his future events for "multiple inappropriate actions towards other creators, including multiple women" while intoxicated.</p>
<p>Cloud9 followed this with an "internal evaluation" and has now released the following statement about how it maintains a "zero-tolerance stance regarding harassment or any other form of inappropriate conduct" and would be immediately releasing Marquez.</p>

<p>Marquez responded to this in a post on social media acknowledging how he had "no one to blame" but himself, and never thought he could "hit this low" while apologising to "everyone" at the same time. He also mentioned how this will "probably" get him banned from future tournaments, although there's no official update about this right now.</p>
<p>"Beerio Kart" is described as a drinking game where players drink alcohol and race in Mario Kart. Aghren's event was unofficial and was not endorsed by Nintendo.</p>
<p>Marquez has won multiple major Smash Bros. tournaments over the years and is considered to be one of the greatest <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_smash_bros_melee">Super Smash Bros.

That's a good sign for anyone looking to pick up a few chase cards standalone rather than ripping open more packs than your bank account can handle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRB6b?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lightning, Army of One</a>, for example. Her Borderless variant was sitting around $90, but has now dropped to around $50. Will it climb again? It’s hard to say, but we’ll keep an eye on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/92x2ZE?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rhystic Study, dubbed ‘Stay with Me’</a> and featuring gorgeous full-art of Tidus and Yuna is also down to around $100, having been over $230 not long ago. It's one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-through-the-ages-most-expensive-cards">most popular cards from the "Through the Ages" collection</a>, so well worth keeping an eye on right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Borderless version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObj5n?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cloud, Midgar Mercenary</a> is also down to around $50 now, a drop of around $60 from launch week. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w6D5?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivi is also still <strong>rising</strong> in value this week</a>, but it’s still a sharp drop from the $100 market demand last time we looked at him. He can be found for around $55-60 right now, so keep an eye on this one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z624d3?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sephiroth, Fallen Hero’s Extended Art version</a> has crash-landed from around $100 to just $7 since the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-selling-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">pre-release day pricing</a>, that's a big ol' drop, and a good example as why it's good to wait and see on how the market will fall post-release of a big set like this.</p><p id="climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Climbers">Magic: The Gathering - Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/climbers-june-23-mtg-3-1750680503265.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Wizards of the Coast / IGN</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As we covered recently, Final Fantasy’s cards have bizarrely given some syngizing Doctor Who cards a mega boost in value. For starters, Danny Pink’s ability to draw cards from counters makes him an ideal pickup for your Tidus Commander Deck, but the price has climbed steeply from <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAg8Jw?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$4 to over $12 already</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, Barbara Wright might not be the first card you think of when playing Final Fantasy cards, but her Read Ahead ability means she can manipulate Summons from the new set to get to the best effects more quickly. <a href="https://zdcs.link/a037rA?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">She’s still going for around $4</a>, so she isn’t as pricey as Danny, but she was a dollar not long ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Tidus synergy, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRn7RE?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tekuthal, Inquiry Dominus</a> is a Phyrexian Horror that, admittedly, wouldn’t look out of place in a Final Fantasy battle. He can double your proliferation of counters, which is ideal for Tidus’ deck. He’s gone from $6 not long ago to over $14 now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from our Blitzball star, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w6D5?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivi Ornitier</a> is getting plenty of love from players (I packed one myself, hooray!). One card that works well with him is the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoGJjl?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Flame of Anor</a>, an instant with a trio of effects you can pick one of. If you control a Wizard (like our adorable friend), then you can pick two. It’s up to around $3, with the foil going for over $4. Not big numbers, sure, but not long ago it was a $2 card and it could climb yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve ever wanted to upset pals in a casual game of Commander, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWY6rx?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mesmeric Orb</a> can pair nicely with either Final Fantasy’s The Water Crystal or if someone at your table is playing the Mothman Fallout deck. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first of those combos will get your friends milling themselves endlessly, while the latter can spread so many Rad counters that it could end up being the shortest game of Commander in history. Mesmeric Orb just hit $24 and could climb higher, a $7 increase week-on-week.</p><p id="sealed-sets"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sealed Sets">MTG Sealed Sets</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything else Final Fantasy is pretty hot right now, so if you manage to find anything in stock, it might be worth picking up ASAP to avoid disapointment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for more TCG discussion and market watch?

In case you're not familiar with it, it's basically Mario Kart's take on the battle royale genre, where it's the last kart standing as racers are eliminated after each section of the course.</p>
<p>It's now almost been one month since the new entry hit the track and it's got us wondering how much success our community has had so far in this new mode. Have you won a race yet? Have you been on the cusp of greatness but denied by a blue shell at the last minute? <em>Vote in our poll and let us know in the comments below.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For well over 20 years the website Adventure Gamers was home to all kinds of writing and discussions about a genre that, while having enjoyed something of a renaissance in this "bring back all the old games" era we're living through now, also went through one hell of a drought in the 2000s.</p><p>Whether it was news, reviews or just being home to a popular forum, Adventure Gamers was for many a cozy little internet hangout, whether you were talking about the classics (Sierra and Lucasarts) or more modern series like Telltale's efforts. While the website still technically exists, I'm using past tense for a reason here, because in recent weeks the whole thing has basically gone to shit.</p><p>Earlier this month the site's forums, and its decades of history, were wiped without notice, along with AG's user reviews of games. While some of the content has been saved in web archives, to delete that past at all, let alone without warning, is an extremely shitty move from the site's owners.</p><figure></figure><p>Or, should I say new owners, because while there is scant public information about a recent sale,<a href="https://exagforumites.freeforums.net/thread/2/start" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> discussions among the community suggest that the site has recently been sold</a>, appears to be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuregames/comments/1lat2la/comment/mxnfu97/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publishing</a> AI-generated content (all bylines have been removed from the site’s articles) and that former writers have been<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuregames/comments/1lat2la/adventure_gamers_is_a_gambling_site_now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> asking</a> to have their names removed from AG's masthead, to no avail.</p><p>No sooner had the forums and archives been deleted than the site began leaning hard into online betting, with four of the six menu items at the top of the page leading to stuff like "Online Casinos" and "Poker Sites".</p><figure></figure><p>Also the site's "About Us" page has <a href="https://adventuregamers.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently been edited to read</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About Us</strong></p><p>Adventure Gamers&nbsp;has long been recognized as the largest English-language website dedicated to the adventure game genre.

<figure><a title="Deltarune" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/062dc13500b56/deltarune.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>One of the many games to launch alongside the Switch 2 earlier this month was Toby Fox's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> game.</p>
<p>Although there's still more to come, a new patch update has now been rolled out for Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 on Nintendo's new hardware. This also includes fixes for the Switch version. It's noted how this update "mostly includes fixes from PC hotfixes 1.01A and 1.01B.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are some softlock fixes, some crashes have been resolved, and there are some Switch and Switch 2-specific changes.
