            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-scadutree-blessings-are-the-answer-to-elden-ring-dlcs-difficulty<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Blessings of the Shadow Realm Upon Ye</h2></div><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</a> has only been out for a few days, and many players are already finding that their character — who became the Elden Lord of the Lands Between — is barely a match for the first chakram blade-wielding weirdo you can run into. These early punishing fights are merely a prelude for the raw aggression of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_Boss_Guides">DLC bosses</a>, who are able to turn you into a bloody smear on the ground with just a few attacks. Even worse, this difficulty ramp-up spares no one — regardless of your level, the weapons you wield, or the armor you equip.</p><p>The key to salvation in the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC">Realm of Shadow</a> lies within a brand new <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/How_to_Use_the_Shadow_Realm_Blessing_in_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree">Shadow Realm Blessing system</a>, but if you aren't paying attention you may just miss out on how it works.</p><p>With a bit of exploring, you're likely to find at least one <strong>Scadutree Fragment</strong>, which gives a short tooltip:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It can be easy to overlook this tip in the thick of battle or when distracted by distant points of interest, but it's safe to say Shadow of the Erdtree may be underselling just how important your Scadutree Blessing really is. Simply put, it can quickly become the difference between victory and defeat in almost every encounter, and it's barely even comparable to Elden Ring's normal leveling system.</p><p>The reason for this is because Shadow of the Erdtree has to account for a wide variety of players looking for a challenge in this DLC realm: Fights have to be difficult enough for a level 500 player on New Game+ 7, but also winnable for someone who just beat <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Mohg,_Lord_of_Blood_Location_and_Boss_Fight_Guide">Mohg</a> for the first time the other day. The solution: Make everything hit extremely hard, with incredibly high health pools, but introduce a new item to rapidly raise your own abilities to deal and negate damage.</p><p>Using just one Scadutree Fragment to increase your Shadow Realm Blessing to Level 1 will raise your armaments damage AND your damage negation to all sources by around 5%, and there are many more fragments to find just in the first region alone.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/23/edlc-blackgaolknight1-1719101483621.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>That's a nice health bar you've got, would be a shame if someone removed it.</figcaption></figure></output><p>As a test case, let's use an early enemy many players are likely to get a rude awakening from: The <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Blackgaol_Knight">Blackgaol Knight of the Nameless Western Mausoleum</a>. His <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Greatsword_of_Solitude">Greatsword of Solitude</a> seems to hit harder than <em>the</em> <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Radagon_of_the_Golden_Order">Radagon</a> himself, and leave players wondering if any amount of leveling up can even the odds.</p><p>For my level 162 character with 50 Vigor and 50 Strength, my <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Blasphemous_Blade">Blasphemous Blade</a> had 795 attack power; and my armor and other stats were giving me 157 Defense Power with 44.355% physical damage negation as a multiplier.</p><p>Facing down the Blackgaol Knight, my basic one-handed swing was only dealing 398 damage to his 525, which I was only able to meet with a jumping attack that did 550. His did... a lot more.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/23/edlc-blackgaolknight3-1719101672616.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>However, with just one Scadutree Blessing level, my attack power was boosted to 834, and my physical damage negation to 47.004%. This increase had me dealing 416 while only taking 496 in return, which was roughly a 4.9% increase in damage given and 5.5% damage taken.</p><p>Even if that sounds small — I then grabbed every Scadutree Fragment in the Gravesite Plain, raising my Scadutree Blessing to Level 4. Now my attack power shot up to 954 and damage negation to 53.629%, which meant my hits were now doing 20% more damage that were hitting harder than the Blackgaol Knight's, which was reduced by around 17.3%!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/23/eldentest-1719104015409.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>As you can see from the table above, each blessing can increase your powers by a substantial amount, and with a maximum of 20 Scadutree Blessings that you can obtain over the course of the game, you'll be dealing a LOT more damage by the end than when you first entered the Realm of Shadow.</p><p>But what about regular leveling? My table also includes spending enough Runes to put four points in Strength vs four Scadutree Blessings. At 50+ Strength, the returns barely resulted in a measly percent of damage increased, and the flat Defense Power increase instead of damage negation from all sources meant I was losing roughly the same amount of HP per hit. This is an important aspect to note, because it means since all players will be in and endgame setting, you can't overcome bosses just by spending runes. However, it's still worth adding a few points here and there anyway, especially to increase your HP pool with Vigor, add more stamina with Endurance, or hit a requirement to equip a new weapon.</p><p>So where can you find more Scadutree Fragments? You can check our guide to <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_Scadutree_Fragment_Locations"><strong>track down every last Scadutree Fragment</strong>,</a> but if you prefer to explore on your own, here are some tips to keep in mind:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/23/edlc-southcampfragment-1719104058298.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><ul data-cy="list"><li>Scadutree Fragments most often appear in front of statues of Marika, like those found in churches or soldier camps.</li><li>You're also guaranteed to find one at every <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Miquella%27s_Cross_Locations">Cross of Miquella</a> that the demigod has left behind marking their journey to important locations in the Shadow Realm.</li><li>Certain areas like ruins or destroyed towns can sometimes include a Shadow Undead holding a sparkling pot.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-review-perfect-starter-set<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unless you've been living in a Skaven gnawhole this year, you're likely aware that there's a new 4th edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a>! We were lucky enough to get a preview copy of the new Starter Box, <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar&nbsp;Skaventide</em>, sent to us&nbsp;by Games Workshop - so follow along for our initial thoughts on the box, what's included, a quick review of some of the most impactful new rules, and a glance at Spearhead - <em>Age of Sigmar'</em>s new quick-play format.</p>
<h2><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar Skaventide - </em>What's In The Box?</h2>
<p>First, let's start off by taking a look at everything included in the new launch box for 4th Edition. This may be one of the largest Starter Boxes (it was certainly one of the heaviest), and includes:</p>
<ul><li>272-page&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar Core Book</em></li>
<li>144-page&nbsp;<em>Spearhead: Fire and Jade</em>&nbsp;rulebook</li>
<li>1 double-sided game board</li>
<li>36-card&nbsp;<em>Spearhead&nbsp;</em>deck</li>
<li>17&nbsp;<em>General's Handbook&nbsp;</em>cards</li>
<li>4 terrain features</li>
<li>50 Skaven Miniatures (Including Grey Seer, Warplock Jezzails, and so many Clanrats - among others)</li>
<li>24 Stormcast Eternals Miniatures (Including Lord-Vigilant on Gryph-stalker, Reclusians, Liberators and more)</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-product-box-contents.jpeg.jpg?itok=gIjHEzX_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-product-box-contents.jpeg.jpg?itok=RhaSeX6w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's so much value crammed into this starter set!</figcaption></figure><p>What this all means is that, in addition to the core rules of the game, and two very robust armies, you're also getting terrain to begin your collection, a <em>second</em>&nbsp;rulebook and special cards to play <em>Spearhead</em>&nbsp;(which we'll touch on more in a moment), and a 17-card general's handbook deck of cards to help with your more serious Matched Play games.</p>
<p>Though it will likely carry a hefty price tag, in my opinion there's no getting around the sheer value on display in this box. Core rules, two of the largest armies (especially the Skaven) we've seen in one of these new edition sets from Games Workshop, a new way to play the game (you'll have all the models you need to play both Spearhead armies)... It's a lot to work through, but it's also a lot of game!</p>
<h2>Our Favorite 4th Edition New Rule Highlights</h2>
<p>While much of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em>&nbsp;remains the same between 3rd and 4th edition, there are definitely some new rules worth highlighting. First, characters now have a specific Control stat, and this applies to each model in the unit. Previously, models had a control value based on their Wounds characteristic, but now it's all here on the character sheet - replacing a Bravery skill.</p>
<p>I really like how this changes a very core mechanic of the game - there are no longer any kind of Bravery or "battleshock" tests required at the end of a round. While some people might have liked the tactical nuance this provided, I've always preferred game systems where that's not an issue on the field.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-rat-ogor.jpg?itok=R8zjZ-G4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-rat-ogor.jpg?itok=cIcDc-yL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>These Rat Ogors would be prime candidates for the new Power Through command!</figcaption></figure><p>There are also several fun new command abilities that players can use, which allow you to shoot a target out in the open (not just one charging toward you), and even charge during your opponent's charge phase! Wizards and Priests also have the ability to spend a command point to cast a spell during your opponent's command phase.</p>
<p>Add to that the very tricky "Power Through" command which - if you're locked in combat with a unit with a lower Health characteristic than you - will dish out D3 mortal wounds and allow you to move a distance up to your unit's Move characteristic. This is wild to me, the fact that for 1 command point you can just auto deal D3 mortal, then keep on trucking through them? Game changing.</p>
<p>I won't spend too much time getting into the nitty gritty here, as I really just wanted to highlight a few rules that all speak to a larger feeling I get playing new games of&nbsp;<em>Age of Sigmar</em>. And that's this: this game is slightly faster, and way,&nbsp;<em>way</em>&nbsp;more interactive. You almost always have something interesting to do during your opponent's turn, and you'll be desperate to spend those command points to make an interrupting impact.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-lord-vigilant-on-gryph-stalker.jpg?itok=v4th1OX5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-lord-vigilant-on-gryph-stalker.jpg?itok=0AI6GnxW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Lord-Vigilant on Gryph-Stalker leads the charge for the Stormcast Eternals contained in this box.</figcaption></figure><p>It's this source of interactivity that I feel is really going to continue the work of opening up and making more accessible&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em>. In much the same way the tweaks to the latest edition of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000</em>&nbsp;helped sand down some rough edges, this edition of <em>AoS</em>&nbsp;is doing the same.</p>

<p>Sigmar bless push fit models! While I know this is a very niche concern, for the busy Tabletop Editor who needs to get this box built as soon as possible, not having to mess with any glue has been an absolute godsend! And while I (mostly) joke about my&nbsp;<em>specific</em>&nbsp;appreciation for push fit models, I do think this mode of model construction -- where every piece is designed to snap into place with each other on a model, is great for newcomers.</p>
<p>I timed myself while building Clanrats (most are two-piece builds), and with an hour of focused snipping, pressing pieces into place, and affixing to bases, I was able to build 30 Clanrats. Sure, I was in the zone, and I never waste time filing or being precise with my snips (much to my playgroup's horror - but hey, I've got deadlines to hit!), but still goes to show how easy it is to put this massive box together - relatively speaking.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-size-comparison.jpg?itok=UzZ6uCmd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-size-comparison.jpg?itok=oOruikaS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I love the size-comparison on these models! Look at those lil' Clanrats!</figcaption></figure><p>It's hard enough that you still have to snip these models from their sprues before assembling, but to have, essentially, a glue-free box of 74 miniatures is huge for introducing people to the hobby. Design wise, I like the look of a lot of these models, though we're not breaking any major new ground. The Stormcast Eternals have their dignified, removed look, and the Skaven are doing their ratty thing.</p>
<p>I do wish, however, that the design would have been pushed a little bit further. Even the Skaven Rat Ogors don't look as twisted up with warpstone power as I'd hoped, and I think a new edition would have been a great chance to take a new look at the Stormcast Eternals and find ways to make the models stand out a bit more.</p>
<h2>What is <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar&nbsp;Spearhead</em>?</h2>
<p>Finally, I wanted to take a brief moment to speak about&nbsp;<em>Spearhead</em>&nbsp;here, the newest, fastest way to play&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em>. These small-scale battles are meant to be quick, while still full of tactical nuance. This isn't&nbsp;<em>Warcry</em>, where there's a whole new rulebook and a completely different way to play the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-stormcast-eternals-spearhead.jpg?itok=mHGb1Ug1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-stormcast-eternals-spearhead.jpg?itok=2LmSWMhq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Though there are more miniatures than these contained in the box, this is the Stormcast Eternals Spearhead you can assemble and play with from this set.</figcaption></figure><p>Instead, with&nbsp;<em>Spearhead</em>, command points are replaced with tactics cards, and the game is played on a board with pre-set points of interest on it.</p>
<p>Tactics cards add a lot of rich flavor to the game, as each card tempts the player with two different options: you can use it as a way to score a victory point, or you can use the bottom half of the card as though it were a command ability.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-spearhead-cards.jpg?itok=RckliFwJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-spearhead-cards.jpg?itok=pofz5Zi6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two different twists depending on which "realm" you play on, and two dual-purpose battle tactics cards!</figcaption></figure><h3>Are&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Vanguard box sets the same as Spearhead?</h3>
<p>Essentially yes! Whether you see a box set of <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar&nbsp;</em>miniatures called&nbsp;<em>Vanguard</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Spearhead</em>, we're talking about the same thing here - a pre-determined batch of miniatures specifically designed and balanced for this game mode.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Fire and Jade</em>&nbsp;book included in the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar Skaventide</em>&nbsp;starter box includes 25 different&nbsp;<em>Spearhead</em>&nbsp;army lists (including two different ones for Stormcast and two different ones for Skaven).</p>
<h2><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar Skaventide - </em>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>As I've mentioned throughout my review, this box set is really impressive in the way it introduces new players to the game, the way it incorporates a lot more interactivity, and the sheer amount of product you get in this box.</p>
<p>And while this could have been a big moment for the design team to push the envelope with their miniatures, the fact that they're push-fit also does wonders for new players.</p>
<p>But this isn't&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;a box set for newcomers -- if you're a long-time fan of the game and somehow don't already have enough Clanrats, you can't do much better than this box - no matter how much it costs where you live!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-skaven-spearhead.jpg?itok=ToER9Mmj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-skaven-spearhead.jpg?itok=puhUFJ97 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Again, though there are many more skaven to be found in the box, this is the included Spearhead!</figcaption></figure><h2>Should I Buy&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar Skaventide</em>?</h2>
<p>If you and a friend are looking to get into&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em>, or you're willing to foot the bill on this hefty Starter Set, you&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;absolutely get your money's worth. If, however, the price point is too much to take on - I would wait for either the core rules to be released alone, or pick up the&nbsp;<em>Spearhead</em>&nbsp;rules when they become available. Either way, you should definitely get into&nbsp;the newest edition of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em>, it's just a personal question you'll have to answer for yourself as to&nbsp;<em>when</em>&nbsp;you want to jump in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-allegations-twitch-journalism<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the grand tradition of the Friday night news dump, a <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676?s=46&amp;t=Rn7xcNFl_Ef44gaalMlwdA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet from a former Twitch employee </a>has set the internet alight with speculation that, at long last, we’ve finally found out why streamer <a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-bans-dr-disrespect-1844182541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guy “Dr Disrespect” Beahm was banned from Twitch in 2020</a>. Have we? No. Why not? It’s complicated.</p><p>It’s worth pointing out that people have run with who they think the tweet is referring to without the tweet ever referring to anyone by name. Cody Connors, previously a strategic partnerships account director at Twitch, wrote, seemingly out of the blue, “He got banned because got caught sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch whispers product. He was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon. The powers that be could read in plain text.” Speculation that the “he” here referred to Disrespect ran wild over Twitter. Disrespect <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804337822415097955" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a> to one quote tweet of Connors by writing, “I get it, it’s a hot topic but this has been settled, no wrongdoing was acknowledged and they paid out the whole contract,” which only fueled the speculation. </p><p>Earlier today, Disrespect responded further to the rumors, <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804577136998776878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeting</a>, "Listen, I’m obviously tied to legal obligations from the settlement with Twitch but I just need to say what I can say since this is the fucking internet. I didn’t do anything wrong, all this has been probed and settled, nothing illegal, no wrongdoing was found, and I was paid." </p><p>It must be stressed, for reasons I’ll get to, that nothing that's happened serves as actual confirmation of why Disrespect was banned from Twitch, and that this whole conversation is rumors and conjecture. In my corner of Twitter, the response was less one of shocked revelation and more a sigh of relief. <a href="https://x.com/LeaderGrev/status/1804314349516763335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journalists</a> and games industry <a href="https://x.com/Slasher/status/1804321712219013293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">figures</a>, including Aftermath’s <a href="https://x.com/Vahn16/status/1804316401491952089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nathan</a>, seemed to agree that they’d heard similar things, but no one had reported on it. As my Launcher colleague Mikhail Klimentov wrote in his <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/dr-disrespect-is-allegedly-not-like-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very good newsletter</a> on the topic, “The responses from journalists, industry insiders and gadflies also seemed to suggest that behind the scenes, some kind of alleged impropriety relating to a minor had been the going theory for some time.”&nbsp;</p><p>This response, of course, led to some asking the fair question: If so many people seemed to know about this, why did no one say anything? Mikhail does an excellent job breaking down the why across his newsletter:</p><blockquote><p>The truth is that inasmuch as it may seem that the story has advanced, we’re really still on square one. There’s a reason what we <em>think</em> we know came in the form of a vaguepost. Every journalist wants to be the one to nail this story — <em>if it’s true.</em> But not a single one has gathered the requisite sourcing to make it happen.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Mikhail enumerates the requirements: identifying more than one first-hand source inside Twitch, and then getting them to talk to you in the face of the legal and professional risks, and how “one ambiguous tweet falls far short of the standard journalists aspire to.” Nathan tweeted a more personal insight into this, <a href="https://x.com/Vahn16/status/1804317246472303072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writing</a>, “All of the sources I spoke to were secondhand. They were not in the room when it happened, nor could they provide documentation. In other words, this is NOT confirmation. Until somebody who actually pulled the trigger either comes forward or talks to a reporter, we will not necessarily have the full or true story.”</p><p>If you’re a journalist, this all makes sense to you: you know what goes into a story being publishable, and you’ve probably had stories yourself that, for one reason or another, couldn’t clear that bar. But if you’re not a journalist, these “open secret” vibes might hit differently. One response has been <a href="https://x.com/TheOtherFrost/status/1804526417834623082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outrage</a> over the possibility that journalists were more concerned with capital-J Journalism than protecting a minor; another has been the <a href="https://x.com/JaymesEpsilon/status/1804402551976047012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insinuation</a> or <a href="https://x.com/LeenaVanD/status/1804570587119141225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential perception</a> that journalists in the know could have been protecting Twitch or Disrespect’s reputation through their silence.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re a journalist, or an avid newsreader, these accusations probably sound ridiculous. And in games, a space where relationships between journalists, content creators, and audiences are <a href="https://defector.com/a-former-video-game-journalist-lays-out-the-power-dynamics-in-the-review-process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hostile</a> at the best of times, it’s easy to shrug off such ideas as just more of the bullshit we’ve been dealing with since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150212130552/https://deadspin.com/the-future-of-the-culture-wars-is-here-and-its-gamerga-1646145844/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2014</a>. But on <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1804556359712837739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, and now here, I take a more generous stance: I don’t know that I’d expect your average person, who reads games news and followed the Disrespect story but otherwise lives a life outside the news cycle, to look at all these people who seemed to be silently familiar with the rumor and say, “yeah, seems fair.” This surge of raised hands can read like braggadocio or bandwagoning, even if, as Mikhail writes, journalists “aren’t showing off. If anything, their knowing should be treated as a statement of humility (even if it doesn’t look like one at first blush).”&nbsp;</p><p>I think these feelings are–at their deepest core if not their surface–fair, because journalism is <em>fucking weird</em>. It plays by standards very different than those you employ in your everyday life when telling other people about things. It uses language in arcane ways–”<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/ask-propublica-illinois-vetting-anonymous-sources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anonymous</a>” doesn’t mean what you think it means; there’s an entire ritual around the concept of “<a href="https://www.poynter.org/commentary/2021/what-does-off-the-record-mean-the-latest-journalism-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on” or “off” the record</a>; and none of us even have the same definition of what “<a href="https://www.cjr.org/opinion/tech-journalism-on-background.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">background</a>” is. Concepts like “<a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/a-test-of-the-news-wesley-lowery-objectivity.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">objectivity</a>” or “<a href="https://defector.com/journalism-is-activism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">journalists aren’t activists</a>” further muddy the waters, alienating readers (see: <a href="https://www.discourseblog.com/p/the-new-york-times-rules-about-its" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a>) and gatekeeping journalism itself, keeping diverse journalists out of the field when they can’t or won’t play by standards created by old, wealthy white men. While waning <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-final-fantasy-helldivers-politics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">media literacy</a> certainly plays a role in the hostility between journalists and readers, journalism as an institution isn’t doing itself any favors. It’s a tendency we try to counteract here at <a href="https://aftermath.site/category/inside-baseball" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath</a>, alongside other reporters and outlets who are transparent about their processes. But we have a long way to go before journalism is truly accessible to more people, both on and off the page. </p><p>This problem is compounded in a very particular way in games, where <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-druckmann-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">companies</a>, influencers, and content creators insert themselves between readers and the news and fan the flames of distrust. For every <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/06/07/people-make-games-roblox-indie-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People Make Games</a> out there, there are countless more drama YouTubers or social media personalities who aren’t beholden to journalism’s standards. Many of these people have drummed up the idea that they’re more trustworthy than established journalists and outlets; while they are not, they can be more personable and move faster than journalists do, which can make them feel more relatable and exciting than an article full of dry “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191101195735/https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/against-allegedly-1819703365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegedly</a>”s and “did not reply to request for comment”s. A personality might say or print something journalists won’t, creating the impression that they’re braver or more honest, or that journalists’ silence indicates an agenda. This is made more complicated by the fact that, in games, people frequently switch roles between journalist and <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-game-development-ign-kotaku" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PR</a> and content creator, or exist in some middle space between them all. Journalists coming out of the woodwork to hold up the rules of their field can feel confusing when it’s hard to even tell what game everyone is playing.</p><p>And this is to say nothing of the universe of straight-up hatemongers and grifters out there, both in the past and right now, drumming up <a href="https://hard-drive.net/news-games/kotakus-alyssa-mercante-will-not-be-scared-off-the-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hate campaigns</a> and <a href="https://x.com/tha_rami/status/1798734537041616956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">red-stringing conspiracy theories</a> to discredit anyone they don’t like, whether that’s journalists, developers, or players. These aren’t folks who are going to be reached by journalism explainers or swayed by arguments about sourcing. But even if a reader isn’t in their camp, the distrust and hostility they sow hangs in the air. It might be obvious that you shouldn’t trust <em>them</em>, but the sheer noise and chaos they create might make it hard to know if you can trust <em>anyone</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>On Twitter, game developer Leena van Deventer raised to me <a href="https://x.com/LeenaVanD/status/1804570510933803480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the very good point</a> that, journalism’s weirdness aside, it’s harder than ever to trust it in the wake of global news coverage like Palestine, where seemingly reputable outlets like <a href="https://www.discourseblog.com/p/cnns-disgraceful-propaganda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a> and <a href="https://newyorkwarcrimes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a> tout objectivity and spout bias in the same breath. Why does it seem like journalists will print and defend <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/02/28/new-york-times-anat-schwartz-october-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">questionable stories</a> about the October 7 attacks, but act extra careful not to get it wrong when it comes to some streamer? I honestly can’t say I have a good answer to that one, besides the fact that journalists and outlets aren’t a monolith, that we’re dealing in different beats with different audiences and different pressures and different editors with different priorities calling the shots. But the question points to a truth: these days, in more and more instances, you <em>can’t</em> trust the news, even news you <em>thought</em> you could trust. How do you figure out how to trust a journalist explaining why they didn’t report something when it can be so hard to trust them when they do?</p><p>We’ve gotten pretty far from a bunch of tweets about Dr Disrespect. I am satisfied by the explanations of why no one’s published anything about this rumor it might feel like everyone but you has heard, but I <em>would</em> be: I’m a journalism editor, who has been the manager of people pursuing this story, and have been party to decisions of what to run or not. I would not run a news story based off Connors’ tweet, though <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=69cfad268fdf2bdc&amp;sca_upv=1&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIL6mh0gff_7TA_a8XGhWyY5avQrWg:1719091088239&amp;q=dr+disrespect&amp;tbm=nws&amp;source=lnms&amp;fbs=AEQNm0DEwqyWp6C7zVHcaokBijLVdBtzDL6-ir6rNQxPLrS6aUNFmoF-hQ1tJoNChV0-JgjwwzopxORPhh-v5eDgaS7G50Hwv9d5haHWnAXjBGFsKV514EzV3Egm2xmCy-WjFEfkWT8CDp6bmpBqRUlg-OCpCfi0p0bfjAWnfVfPzRBJrOKNTKo8YmkxPA29nlokzHz3PwEWigXFnfvVMqXHM0cFv4mbFQ&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwijp5qtkfCGAxWcD1kFHf4dAu4Q0pQJegQICxAB&amp;biw=1431&amp;bih=660&amp;dpr=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other outlets</a> have, couching their headlines with all the words journalists use as talismans in hopes of not getting sued. (The piece you're reading now is <em>not</em> a news story, another very journalism distinction with its own unique form in games, in one guise of hostile readers calling everything a "review.") At the least, I’m sure Connors’ tweet has redoubled the efforts of journalists pursuing this story to keep pursuing it, though that’s no guarantee it will ever see print.&nbsp;</p><p>But I wouldn’t fault a reader for feeling baffled or frustrated by all this. I’d hope that you trust whatever journalists and outlets you go to for your news to do the right thing the right way. I hope that if they one day break that trust, they are transparent about the circumstances and that you hold them to account. (That goes for us at Aftermath, too!) The deeper issue, particularly in games, is bigger than “poor media literacy” or “journalists can’t be trusted.” It’s bigger than some tweets about a streamer, and it’s going to take all of us to solve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, though, he's called Promised Consort Radahn, as he's revealed to be Miquella's most loyal companion. You'll battle him in a legacy dungeon called Enir-Ilim, which you'll gain access to upon <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/shadow-of-the-erdtree-belurat-tower-shadow-elden-ring/2900-5507/" data-ref-id="2900-5507"><strong>burning the Sealing Tree</strong></a>.</p><p>There are some similarities between Mr. Starscourge and Mr. Promised Consort, most notably the use of massive dual greatswords and a penchant for dive-bombing you like a meteor. The key difference, now, is that the fight takes place in a smaller arena and not a desert island, so don't worry about Radahn galloping around on a tiny horse.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4323497-final-boss-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-promised-consort-radahn-guide-0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4323497" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4323497-final-boss-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-promised-consort-radahn-guide-0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4323497"></a><figcaption>Promised Consort Radahn makes his grand entrance without his tiny horse.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4323497-final-boss-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-promised-consort-radahn-guide-0.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Preparing_for_the_Promised_Consort_Radahn_boss_fight">Preparing for the Promised Consort Radahn boss fight</h3><p>Make no mistake, the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Promised Consort Radahn boss battle is one of the hardest in the entire game (not just the DLC). We feel that he's more difficult than Malenia. As such, you need to be well-prepared. We suggest the following:</p><ul><li>Boost your character's capabilities and summons by collecting more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragments/2900-5485/" data-ref-id="2900-5485"><strong>Scadutree Fragments</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-revered-spirit-ash-locations-guide/2900-5486/" data-ref-id="2900-5486"><strong>Revered Spirit Ashes</strong></a>. We defeated the final boss when our Shadow Realm Blessings were at level 17 and level 9, respectively.</li><li>Speaking of summons, a single summon like the Mimic Tear or Banished Knight Oleg will not be enough. You might need help from NPC allies. You can call on both Thiollier and Ansbach if you complete their quests. We've got all the details for you in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/shadow-of-the-erdtree-thiollier-st-trina-elden-ring/2900-5501/" data-ref-id="2900-5501"><strong>Thiollier quest guide</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/shadow-of-the-erdtree-ansbach-freyja-leda-elden-ring/2900-5515/" data-ref-id="2900-5515"><strong>Ansbach quest guide</strong></a>.</li><li>Golden Braid talisman - You can find this in the Shaman Village once you access the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/shadow-of-the-erdtree-northeast-region-map-elden-ring/2900-5505/" data-ref-id="2900-5505"><strong>secret northeast area (Scaduview)</strong></a>. It boosts holy damage resistance by the utmost.</li><li>Dragoncrest Shield Talisman +2 - Found in Crumblign Farum Azula in the base game. This helps mitigate physical damage.</li><li>Armors with high resistance to holy damage.</li><li>For those who prefer bleed builds, the new Red Bear's Claw is a viable option. It comes from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-nameless-mausoleum/2900-5491/" data-ref-id="2900-5491"><strong>Northern Nameless Mausoleum</strong></a>.</li><li>Base game options, such as Blasphemous Blade and Dark Moon Greatsword, are still viable. You can also choose the Staff of Loss or other spellcasting weapons.</li><li>The ground in the arena has a bright color. You should have as few runes as possible in case of deaths. It's going to be hard to see the marker where you dropped your runes, and you don't want to run around looking for your XP/currency.</li><li>Lastly, you'll want to have high Vigor (at least 60). You'll need all the HP you can get.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4323498-final-boss-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-promised-consort-radahn-guide-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4323498" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4323498-final-boss-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-promised-consort-radahn-guide-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4323498"></a><figcaption>Having NPC allies certainly helps.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4323498-final-boss-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-promised-consort-radahn-guide-1.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Phase_1__Promised_Consort_Radahn">Phase 1: Promised Consort Radahn</h3><p>What makes Promised Consort Radahn so dangerous is that his combo sequences have multiple swings (sometimes up to five or six strikes), and these have rather fast animation speeds. He also has the following abilities during the first phase of the encounter:</p><ul><li>Meteor Dive - Radahn will always start the encounter by jumping into the air and dive-bombing your location. Do not spend these first few seconds casting or summoning. Just dodge the initial dive-bomb to be safe.</li><li>Meteor Rain - Radahn will jump and spawn half a dozen rocks in mid-air. These will crash one by one at your location.</li><li>Gravity Pull - The boss will pull you if you're too far away, followed by a stomp that causes a quake. Dodge the eruption as it's about to occur.</li><li>Melee combos - Ideally, you should dodge <em>toward</em> the boss instead of sideways or backwards. His swings have follow-ups that can reach you even if you avoid the first few blows.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4323499-final-boss-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-promised-consort-radahn-guide-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4323499" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4323499-final-boss-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-promised-consort-radahn-guide-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4323499"></a><figcaption>Radahn's Meteor Dive must be avoided at all costs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4323499-final-boss-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-promised-consort-radahn-guide-2.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Phase_2__Radahn_Consort_of_Miquella">Phase 2: Radahn Consort of Miquella</h3><p>The second phase against Promised Consort Radahn in Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is where things get extremely hectic. At roughly 60% HP, a cutscene will play and Miquella will make an appearance. He'll then piggyback off Radahn, like a creepy angelic backpack of sorts, causing Radahn's attacks to be infused with holy damage. This is why it's important to boost your holy resistance as much as possible, since the boss' melee attacks are usually followed by holy-based area-of-effect (AoE) damage.</p><p>Likewise, Radahn will retain several abilities from the first phase, and you need to watch out for some new tricks such as:</p><ul><li>Holy Bombardment - The second phase will always begin with Radahn casting a spell that causes multiple beams to strike your location. Remove lock-on immediately and sprint to the side until the beams are gone.</li><li>Lightspeed Slash - Radahn will start flashing, then he'll rush and slice you multiple times.</li><li>Heavenly Eruption - When the ground starts to glow, a massive eruption is about to occur. This will likely deplete a chunk of your HP.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC has fallen to a "mixed" user rating on Steam after players logged their disappointment with difficulty and the PC version's performance issues.</p>
<p>An aggregate score of almost 15,000 players has seen the critically acclaimed DLC stumble on PC, and whilst most players comment favourably on the game's stunning presentation and world building, others take issue with the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ilmyr/recommended/2778580/">capped FPS, stuttering</a>, and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/turbek666/recommended/2778580/">"bosses with jerky roll-catch movements and a plethora of physically nonsensical moves"</a>.</p>

<p>"I love running for 20 minutes in an open area with absolutely nothing to pick up random consumables that I'll never use against bosses that are insanely tedious to fight. Very miserable experience," said one unhappy <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/sovietspaceship_/recommended/2778580/">Tarnished</a>.</p>
<p>"Game is literally unplayable," added <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199014635665/recommended/2778580/">another</a>. "I've been trying since launch to open the game and I can't no matter what I do. I see many others having the same issue and there are no solid fixes yet just random individual fixes for every different person.Yes I have tried EVERYTHING."</p>
<p>"Kinda just feels like they just put all of the assets from the base game in a blender and hit pulse a few times," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199186324106/recommended/2778580/">opined</a> another disappointed player. "It is still fun overcoming the challenges, but I was hoping for more innovation out of this DLC and it's certainly not worth $40."</p>
<p>After backing up their summary with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198287829136/recommended/2778580/">claims</a> they had "played every other FromSoft souls (and Armored Core VI too) and did multiple playthroughs in every one of them (except Demon Souls) and also got the platinum on Sekiro, DS3, DS1, Bloodborne, Elden Ring and Lies of P too (the best souls not by From)", another player on Steam said, "In the current state of the DLC I can't really recommend it.</p>
<p>"While the world design and colours are really beautiful and a lot of enemy designs too, there's a big problem with balancing. Right now, even with 60 vigor, you get bishotted by nearly every enemy that's not pure fodder (like the classical wandering nobles in the base game) and the Scadutree fragments that should make your damage and defense increase (exclusively while in the DLC) don't help that much and are mostly locked behind bosses.</p>
<p>"You just have to 'git gud'. That normally wouldn't bother me much, but in this case, there's a big problem. It's the enemy (but more specifically, the bosses) design. It seems to follow the philosophy that – especially applied in the later parts of the game to an even greater (and worse) extent – every enemy does a lot of damage, has a ton of health, and has endless combos that leave nearly no openings, to then start all over again with their combos."</p>
<p>If you're having trouble even getting to the DLC, fear not: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-pros-are-offering-to-help-beat-key-bosses-so-all-players-can-access-the-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc">Elden Ring pros are helping players beat two key bosses</a> to enable fellow Tarnished access Shadow of the Erdtree.</p>
<p>As Shadow of the Erdtree isn't accessible until you've taken out both Starscourge Radahn and Mohg, Lord of Blood – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/time-is-running-out-to-prepare-for-elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree">something a surprisingly high number of Elden Ring players have yet to do</a> – Elden Ring experts are offering their time and expertise to fell the great enemies to help players jump into the new content.</p>
<p>FromSoftware's Soulsborne games are notoriously difficult to beat, but creator Hidetaka Miyazaki recently said it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/turning-down-elden-rings-difficulty-would-break-the-game-itself-says-miyazaki">"break the game itself"</a> to turn down the challenge.</p>
<p>"If we really wanted the whole world to play the game, we could just crank the difficulty down more and more. But that wasn't the right approach," he said. "Had we taken that approach, I don't think the game would have done what it did, because the sense of achievement that players gain from overcoming these hurdles is such a fundamental part of the experience. Turning down difficulty would strip the game of that joy - which, in my eyes, would break the game itself."</p>
<p>"I am still impossibly fond of Elden Ring and my time spent in its grasp, but I'm just not sure if I can share the same fullness of warmth with Shadow of the Erdtree," contributor Alexis wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Eurogamer's Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-confirmed-by-obsidian-to-be-very-short-for-an-rpg/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We already knew that Avowed wouldn't be a Skyrim-like behemoth in size, but Game Director Carrie Patel from Obsidian clarified it's going to be fairly short in general for an RPG. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/20/avoweds-creators-on-why-romance-was-considered-but-ultimately-not-included-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to Game Informer</a>, she said players can expect a similar length to the studio's previous game, the sci-fi <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Outer Worlds</a>.</p>
<p><em>The best comparison for Avowed in terms of scope is The Outer Worlds. Players can expect a roughly similar experience, just like The Outer Worlds, depending on what kind of difficulty they play on, and how thoroughly they explore and invest inside content, versus just sticking to the main crit path missions.</em></p>
<p>Patel <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-similar-to-kotor-2-outer-worlds-length-size-open-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made a similar comment last year</a>, comparing Avowed to The Outer Worlds or Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2. The latter would have been preferable in terms of length since it required over 30 hours just for the main story and over 40 hours when including side content.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds, on the other hand, is one of the shortest high-profile RPGs around. The main story can be completed in just over 13 hours, while side content doubles that amount to around 26. For comparison, other non-open world RPGs like The Witcher 2 and Dragon Age II require between 24 and 37 hours to complete. With The Outer Worlds, Obsidian had the excuse of a shoestring budget, having picked Take-Two's indie label Private Division as the publisher.</p>
<p>That can't really fly any longer, though, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/inxile-entertainment-acquired-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Obsidian has been acquired by Microsoft</a> - yes, that Microsoft, the biggest public company in the world by capitalization. While that doesn't necessarily translate into an endless budget, fans were certainly hoping to get meatier games from the studio going forward.</p>
<p>While The Outer Worlds remains Obsidian's comparison for Avowed when it comes to size, the story's tone is going be more similar to another of the studio's titles. Patel said:</p>
<p><em>Tonally, the best comparison is going to be Deadfire, the second Pillars game where you have a very grounded and serious political story. A very kind of weird and esoteric, metaphysical, and divine story beneath that. A lot of moments of seriousness, but also moments of levity to kind of to kind of break that up, and a lot of those things are very character-based. So yeah, I wouldn't compare it tonally to The Outer Worlds.</em></p>
<p>However, unlike <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</a>, Avowed won't feature any romance options with the four companions. On the topic, Patel explained:</p>
<p><em>We decided to forego full romance paths in Avowed. It's something that we thought very hard about, and we talked about it as a narrative team. I think if you're going to invest in romance, everyone who's writing them needs to be absolutely, fully bought in. And the other thing you need to do is make sure that if you're going to provide that path, that you're balancing that with an equally meaningful and well-developed, non-romantic path because you never want players to feel that, "Well, the only way I really get to know this character or really get to form a meaningful bond with them, is if I commit to romancing them, which maybe isn't something I want to do." So, for all of those reasons, we decided to forego romances, specifically in Avowed.</em></p>
<p>The game doesn't have a release date, although a recent Obsidian blog post <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-release-date-revealed-by-obsidians-game-director-but-quickly-gets-pulled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> November 12. It will be released on PC and Xbox Series S|X, being available on Game Pass from day one.</p>

            <p>Embracer reportedly killed a Red Faction: Guerrilla sequel.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-embracers-cuts-killed-a-potential-red-faction-sequel-and-gutted-a-promising-studio">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, which reported this week that several former Fishlabs developers have confirmed that when<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme"> Embracer killed off dozens of studios and projects</a> after an investment deal collapsed, it also killed off a Red Faction sequel, too.</p>

<p>Described as a "safe sequel" "with a familiar emphasis on wrecking buildings", the development team was keen to develop original creator Volition's blueprint with "open-ended play experience" more in keeping with immersive sims, such as Arkane Austin's Dishonored. It's thought the game would have been set a century after the events of Guerrilla, featuring new and reimagined locations. As the female protagonist, players would have led an underground revolution, forging alliances and factions along the way.</p>
<p>RPS reports that whilst Fishlabs had pitched the Red Faction game several times to parent company Plaion, "the most elaborate pitch came in mid-November [2023], and involved an element of cosplay".</p>
<p>"In addition to screening the 'fake trailer', team members posed as characters from the game, with the Red Faction resistance group 'hacking' a presentation given by a sinister corporate agent. Plaion's immediate feedback was positive, and sources say there was wide confidence that the game would be greenlit. But it wasn't to last," RPS news editor and long-time Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell reported.</p>
<p>By the time executives were asked to vote on the project's future in November, however, the 50-50 split saw the game unceremoniously cancelled.</p>
<p>"You could see that both the company chiefs had been crying a lot, and there was a representative from Plaion there as well," an anonymous source from Fishlabs told RPS, recounting the all-hands meeting in which staff were informed of the cancellation. Subsequent cuts were then made across almost all departments, with 50 people laid off from level design, narrative, game design, programming, audio, art, and animation.</p>
<p>Today, most Fishlab devs work "as a cross-dev team" supporting other Embracer endeavours.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we reported that Embracer Group – which has reduced its headcount by 4532 employees in the past financial year – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-says-it-will-have-a-human-centric-approach-to-leveraging-the-potential-of-ai">wants to harness AI to "empower" its staff</a>, saying artificial intelligence "has the capability to massively enhance game development by increasing resource efficiency".</p>
<p>In its latest annual report, Embracer privacy and AI governance head Tomas Hedman stressed it would be a risk if the company didn't use AI, as it would put the firm at a "competitive disadvantage [with] other industry players".</p>
<p>"Certainly, one of the major risks for a company is not to use AI, as this would mean a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis other industry players," Hedman said. "Most companies will move forward on AI integration in different ways. For us, it is the way that we do this that is the most critical element.</p>
<p>"We do not want to replace people with AI, we want to empower them," Hedman added. "This is the core of our human-centric approach to leveraging the potential with AI."</p>

This was supposed to carve a path for games like <em>Fortnite</em> to be able to return to mobile, now they could run in-game purchases without having to use Apple or Google’s own stores, and thus regain 30 percent of every purchase. But it may be the case that the EU thinks Apple still isn’t playing fair, and could start imposing <em>enormous</em> fines. - John Walker <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/apple-ios-epic-fortnite-in-app-purchases-fine-1851549043&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/apple-ios-epic-fortnite-in-app-purchases-fine-1851549043">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a8a48f19e641faffca136db682accfa8" data-recommend-id="image://a8a48f19e641faffca136db682accfa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Nintendo logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Nintendo logo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8a48f19e641faffca136db682accfa8" data-recommend-id="image://a8a48f19e641faffca136db682accfa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Nintendo logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now that most of the industry is done with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/e3-summer-game-fest-2024-roundup-impressions-previews-1851541151&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/e3-summer-game-fest-2024-roundup-impressions-previews-1851541151">Summer Game Fest</a></span> and all its orbiting events, Nintendo is jumping into the summer video game announcement fray with its own Nintendo Direct.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24183429/amazon-boys-antony-starr-homelander-scary-good<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="bT7tf1">One of the hardest things to understand from the outside of any group operating under a cult of personality is just how intoxicating a personality can be. A charismatic presence, given a regular amount of your time — say, every Sunday morning, or even better, every evening after dinner — can be terribly seductive. Television, in its focus on building a relationship with the viewer over time, can use this as a powerful tool in making its point. Sometimes, with the right actor breathing life into the material, it can be a little <em>too</em> good at making its point. Consider, for example: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23802186/cobweb-movie-review-antony-starr-the-boys">Antony Starr</a>’s singular performance on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24176428/the-boys-season-4-review-new"><em>The Boys</em></a> as the super-fascist Homelander. </p>
<p id="YhCE5U">It’s worth taking a moment to consider how difficult a task any actor would have had being Homelander. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/28/20837228/the-boys-superhero-cast-comics-vs-show">Considering the source material</a> — which I would strongly recommend you do not, as it has not aged terribly well in multiple ways — Homelander doesn’t quite seem like a character that <em>could</em> be played by a living human being. He’s basically a caricature, having more in common with political cartoons than the comparatively grounded aesthetic of comics superheroes contemporary to him. There is no humanity in the character as envisioned by writer Garth Ennis and artist Darick Robertson; he’s a means to an (often prurient) end. </p>
<p id="mG4llC">Antony Starr, however, seemed to innately understand the character from the moment he appeared on screen, and how to add dimension to what lay crudely on the comic book page. He knew how to project a smile so radiant you only notice Homelander’s dead eyes behind it if you’re looking for them. He knows how to carry himself with a tension stemming from deep insecurity, or how to purse his lips in a way that underlines how it is more annoying for him to issue a threat than it is to merely repeat himself and let the threat remain implied. If he played a wind instrument, he’d have excellent embouchure.  </p>

<p id="hsLJTB"><em>The Boys</em> doesn’t work without Antony Starr. The New Zealand actor, who had previously starred in the cult-hit action series <em>Banshee</em>, plays a character who could fundamentally end the show’s conflict between the superhumans of The Seven and Billy Butcher’s ragtag resistance of normal humans whenever he wishes, so he must regularly portray a character that believably gets in his own way, or possesses psychological hang-ups that would render an all-powerful man manipulable. </p>
<p id="klXXZY">Starr’s performance, in other words, does one of the most dangerous things you can do in a story about such a patently evil man: It makes him empathetic. Understandable. “Wisdom of the Ages,” the most recent episode of <em>The Boys</em>, picks up a running thread in the character’s backstory, about how he was experimented on as a child and broken down mentally so he could be used as a tool by the megacorporation that made him. It’s heartbreaking stuff that has only backfired as this broken man has found that he now holds sway over a public broken in similar ways, who are looking for a charismatic strongman like himself to empower them to act out violently. </p>

<p id="IQDBZG"><em>The Boys</em>, however,<em> </em>is able to indulge in moments we don’t get to see as often from real-world fascist strongmen, when they are not performing to a crowd of adoring fans. Homelander’s story in “Wisdom of the Ages” involves Homelander taking out his increasing feelings of impotence as head of Vought on the laboratory staff that made him, murdering them all in ways reminiscent of the causal cruelty they displayed toward him when he was just a test subject for them. </p>
<p id="Mh4I5b">In these scenes, Antony Starr threads the needle, conveying the horror of what Homelander suffered when he was a boy named John, and also the more monstrous thing he is now. Starr plays these scenes as a horror movie villain, all cruel appetites and mockery. The ease with which Starr is able to slide into this mode — with which he is able to continually find shades that are pathetic, funny, frustrating, simmering, dangerous — is frankly dazzling. For the viewer that’s able to see the whole picture, Homelander is a villain through and through. But within the fiction of <em>The Boys</em>? That Homelander is just learning the kind of influence he has. And Antony Starr has made me want to see that through to whatever terrible end <em>The Boys</em> has in store. </p>

            <p>Nintendo is keeping tight-lipped on what studio is developing Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership.</p>
<p>When asked by journalist <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/nintendo-direct-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-metroid">Stephen Totilo</a> who was leading the development of the resurrected action RPG series, Nintendo wouldn't confirm who was involved, even though the original studio behind the series, AlphaDream, closed down in 2019.</p>
<p>It did, however, concede that "some of the original developers" were involved.</p>

<p>"Some of the original developers who worked on the franchise are involved in the development of Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership," Nintendo told Totilo (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-wont-reveal-mario-luigis-new-developer-but-says-original-staff-are-invovled/">VGC</a>). "For more information about the developers, please stay tuned to the game credits at release."</p>
<p>Who those "original developers" are remains unclear, although plenty of former AlphaDream devs joined Nintendo-adjacent teams when the studio shuttered.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-luigi-brothership-bringing-the-action-rpg-series-to-switch-this-year">Nintendo unveiled Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> last week, and confirmed it's heading to Switch on 7th November this year.</p>
<p>Brothership marks the Switch debut of Nintendo's long-running action-RPG series, and the first brand-new entry since Mario &amp; Luigi: Paper Jam appeared on 3DS in 2015. The reveal didn't offer much in the way of specifics, but the game is described as a "sea-faring adventure that unfolds across mysterious islands", and there's promise of "evolved moves" for the Mario brothers when it arrives.</p>
