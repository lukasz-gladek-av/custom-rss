But at $700 —&nbsp;plus another $80 if you want to buy the disc drive accessory since the console itself <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24240906/sony-ps5-pro-disc-drive-separate-price">doesn’t have one</a> — a lot of gamers have been left wondering exactly <em>how</em> powerful it needs to be in order to justify the cost. </p><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a><em>,</em> we try to figure out why the PS5 Pro has the specs and price tag it does and what this new console might tell us about the overall state of the gaming business. Around the same time as Sony’s announcement, Microsoft said it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242695/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-650-employees">laying off another 650 Xbox employees</a> — these are two companies with very different ideas about the same business, and it’s not always obvious who’s right.</p><p>After we finish with our PS5 Pro chat, we talk about the other gadget news of the week. We also talk a bit about the reaction to Monday’s Apple event, after briefly forgetting that it happened this week at all. We discuss <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24240700/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-tri-fold-price-launch">Huawei’s Mate XT</a>, the triple-folding smartphone that excited people in all the ways the iPhone 16 didn’t.

And we consider two simultaneous Google stories: the excellent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24239115/google-pixel-watch-3-review-smartwatch-wear-os-wearable">Pixel Watch 3</a> and the potentially company-shaking <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24240386/google-doj-ad-tech-antitrust-trial-court-day-one">ad tech trial</a>.

            <p>After <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator's</a> jet to success, it was inevitable, really. Whitethorn Games and North Star Video Games have only come out with a rival: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spray-paint-simulator">Spray Paint Simulator</a>. In it, you get out your spray painter and "shshshshshs" different colours of paint onto various surfaces. For whatever reason, the universe this takes place in doesn't seem to value brushes or those rolly mops. "No", it says, kicking your brush into the sun. "Spray or nay".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Spray Paint Simulator sees you take on the role of a disembodied hand with a spray gun, a hero who must save the folks of Splatterville from the villainy of raw undecorated surfaces. In its story mode, you must spray away, completing jobs for clients to grow your painting business. As is the case with PowerWash Sim, you can upgrade your "tools, vehicles, and equipment", as well as "use an assortment of ladders and scaffolding" to reach those difficult spots.</p>

<p>The devs want this to be a stress free experience, "without time limits" or "complex game mechanics". There's a Free Spray mode to support your creative endeavours, too, if you want to explore the entire town of Splatterville and paint in any way you want. Again, all of the same school as PowerWash Sim, which is very much a meditative experience.</p>
<p>Alice Bell (RPS in peace) loved a bit of PowerWash Sim, especially the fact it takes you to clean up some zany spots and has a tonne of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-did-no-one-tell-me-powerwash-sim-has-actual-lore">lore to back it all up</a>. Here's hoping Spray Paint Simulator has a similarly playful take on your career trajectory as Paint Person. Or that it fully embraces its rivalry with PowerWash Simulator in the form of cross-game PVP, as Edwin points out in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-11">The Maw</a>.</p>
<p>Spray Paint Simulator hasn't got a release date just yet, but is due sometime on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1811340/Spray_Paint_Simulator/">Steam</a> in 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Communications Workers of America union (CWA) has denounced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">Microsoft's decision to lay off an additional 650 video game workers yesterday</a> as "extremely disappointing".</p>
<p>In a statement, the CWA said that as one of the world's "largest and most profitable corporations", Microsoft could have achieved its goals for "long-term success without destroying the livelihoods of 650 of our colleagues".</p>

<p>Whilst the union acknowledges that organising does not "always protect against layoffs", "collective bargaining does give workers a voice in the policies that affect them, including how layoffs are handled".</p>
<p>The statement then blasted former Sony boss Chris Deering's "callous suggestion" that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-not-the-result-of-corporate-greed-and-those-affected-should-drive-an-uber-says-ex-sony-president">layoffs are not the result of corporate greed and those affected by industry cuts should "drive an Uber"</a>.</p>
<p>"Every worker deserves a voice on the job and a say over the impact of job cuts," said Samuel Cooper, senior producer at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> and member of WoWGG-CWA.</p>
<p>"While we would hope that a company like Microsoft with $88 billion in profits last year could achieve 'long term success' without destroying the livelihoods of 650 of our colleagues, heartless layoffs like these have become all too common. We stand in solidarity with everyone who lost their job [yesterday] and encourage all video game workers to join with us and form unions so we can protect each other."</p>
<p>Microsoft laid off a further 650 Xbox staff yesterday, though no games have been cancelled or studios have been closed this time.</p>
<p>The news was shared by CEO of Microsoft Gaming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> in an internal memo in which Spencer said the cuts were necessary to "organise our business for long term success". The layoffs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">follow the 1900 people who lost their jobs at the company in January</a> this year. It means Microsoft has now laid off 2,550 staff in the last year alone.</p>
<p>For those keeping track, with one quarter still to go, 2024 has seen almost 13,000 developers and publishers lose their jobs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Plus a dozen other recommendations against misleading microtransaction practices</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
A European consumer advocacy group have published an open letter to the European Union Commission expressing their concerns about video games that make use of premium in-game currencies - aka, make-believe money you can buy with real money, such as Minecoins in Minecraft's Bedrock Edition. 
</p>
<p>
The group in question are the Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs, or BEUC, who represent 44 non-governmental consumer organisations from 31 countries, and have been around since 1962. They're accusing the publishers of Fortnite, EA Sports FC 24, Minecraft, Clash of Clans and others of misleading people -  specifically children - with their in-game premium currencies, and breaching European Union consumer protection laws. On <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/game-over#the-action">a press site</a> that summarises the results of various longer studies, they offer the below broad complaints about the practice.
</p><!--more-->
<blockquote><p>

Consumers cannot see the real cost of digital items, leading to overspending: the lack of price transparency of premium in-game currencies and the need to buy extra currency in bundles pushes consumers to spend more. 
</p>
<p>
Companies' claims that gamers prefer in-game premium currencies are wrong. 
</p>
<p>
Consumers are often denied their rights when using premium in-game currencies, tied to unfair terms favouring game developers. 
</p>
<p>
Children are even more vulnerable to these manipulative tactics. Data shows that children in Europe are spending on average €39 per month on in-game purchases. While they are among the ones playing the most, they have limited financial literacy and are easily swayed by virtual currencies. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Drawing on European Parliament surveys, Statistia and Steam data, the BEUC note that "more than half of EU consumers regularly play video games", including 84% of those aged 11-14, and that "in-game purchases generated more than US$50 billion globally (approx. €46 billion), representing about one-quarter of revenues in the video game market". They add that of the 50 most-played games on Steam in 2023, 21 featured in-game premium currencies, and of those 21, eight had an age rating of 12 years or lower.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/sites/default/files/publications/BEUC-X-2024-061_Monetising_play_Regulating_in_game_and_in_app_premium_currencies.pdf">the full 35-page write-up</a> of their investigation and complaint, the BEUC make a series of recommendations. I've packed them down and reworded them a little for easier digestion:
</p>
<p>
- The EU should consider banning the use of premium currencies in games and apps, pending the results of the Digital Fairness Fitness Check, an on-going investigation of current EU consumer laws. Or at least, the EU should prohibit their sale to people under 18
</p>
<p>
- The EU should amend consumer law to introduce stricter transparency requirements. In particular, what an in-game currency is worth in real money "should be shown clearly to consumers before each transaction made with the premium in-game or in-app currencies, for example using the same font type and size"
</p>
<p>
- If in-game and in-app premium currencies aren't banned, the EU Commission should conduct a study to determine which means of displaying them is most "efficient" for consumers and especially kids
</p>
<p>
- EU Consumer Law should be amended to oblige publishers to deactivate in-game payment mechanisms by default, rendering them "opt-in"
</p>
<p>
- People should receive notifications about and be asked to validate every in-game transaction, and should be required to set a password to stop unwanted transactions
</p>
<p>
- Games should have their strictest privacy settings active "by default" so that people can play games "without having their economic behaviour be influenced algorithmically"
</p>
<p>
- The European Commission should clarify by law that consumers have the same rights with regard to in-game transactions using in-game premium currencies as for purchases with real money
</p>
<p>
- Specifically, the Commission should amend the Annex of the Unfair Contract Terms (UCTD) Directive to state that discarding refund claims for in-game and in-app premium currencies is "presumably unfair"
</p>
<p>
- People should be able to decide exactly how much premium in-game currency they want to buy, rather than buying fixed wodges of it decided by the publisher
</p>
<p>
- EU consumer law should "mandate the separation" of premium in-game currencies and currencies earned in-game, so that "consumers fully understand how much they are spending in-game"
</p>
<p>
- Existing consumer laws should be more consistently enforced with regard to in-game purchases, and enforcement groups for different sectors such as data protection or financial services should collaborate more
</p>
<p>
- Investigating authorities should use the "vulnerable consumer" benchmark of increased professional diligence established in the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (UCPD), because many of those exposed to in-game purchases are kids under the age of 16
</p>
<p>
My brief take: while I distrust the Theresa Lovejoy-esque air of moral panic that informs some of the BEUC's wording, I agree that in-game premium currency systems are essentially misleading, and should be properly regulated. Many of the above arguments have been presented by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/uk-advertising-authority-set-guidance-for-in-game-purchases">other groups and authorities in the past</a>, and individual examples of publishers doing cheeky things with premium currencies <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overwatch-2-accused-of-deliberately-misleading-players-with-the-newest-battle-pass">aren't</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-players-are-narked-about-the-games-monetisation">hard</a> to find.</p>
<p>Going by previous experience of consumer group advocacy, I doubt many of the BEUC's recommendations will be implemented, but they're an opportunity for discussion, and the more we talk about these things the less we'll be deceived by them.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-insiders/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-does-%E2%80%98insider-information%E2%80%99-work-and-who-can-you-trust.980151/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-insiders/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>2024 has been a weird year for video game insiders. One user named ‘Midori’, who claimed to be a Japanese woman, confessed that he wasn’t a woman, nor Japanese, and lost all credibility overnight. Another popular leaker, who goes by the X (formerly Twitter) handle ‘Pyoro,’ also went dark after <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-21/rumors-go-dark-as-video-game-leakers-face-a-reckoning?srnd=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he revealed</a> to one of the industry’s most prominent investigative journalists, Jason Schreier, that his source worked for Nintendo. In early June, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-youtube-leaks-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I reported how YouTube employees were cashing in</a> on their unrestricted access to private and unlisted videos to leak major video game announcements<span>. It kickstarted another major investigation at Google, resulting in video game publishers across the industry,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-says-it-is-working-to-stop-leaks-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including Nintendo,</a>&nbsp;implementing better processes ahead of their</span> game announcements. And just last week, the gaming community was once again in an uproar about yet another baseless GTA 6 cancellation rumor, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/has-gta-6-been-delayed-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was soon squashed</a>.</p>



<p>The gaming leaks and rumors side of the industry continues to grow, and beyond just the stories and headlines, I often see many different questions surrounding how it all works. How does someone obtain and source insider information? Can that person be trusted with their reporting? Why do people leak to journalists or insiders? What are the ethics behind reporting? These are just a few of the questions I want to cover, and hopefully, by the end of reading, you’ll have a better understanding of how it all works.</p>



<p>First, let’s discuss the fundamentals of where information comes from, how it’s obtained, and how to know if someone is reliable.</p>



<h4 id="h-sources">Sources</h4>



<p>When it comes to reporting leaks, there are three main types of sources. Jason Schreier has already done a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1c1fo93/schreier_an_explanation_of_rumorsreportingsourcing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fantastic breakdown of this on Reddit</a>, but the TL;DR is that the three main types of sources are primary, secondary, and documentation.</p>



<ul>
<li>A <strong>Primary source</strong> has firsthand knowledge of the information they are disclosing to someone.</li>



<li>A <strong>Secondary source</strong> has secondhand knowledge of the information they disclose to someone (for example, a source may say, “I heard <em>X information</em> about <em>X company</em> from <em>X person</em>“).</li>



<li><strong>Documentation</strong> includes images, video, audio, emails, etc., that can back up or prove disclosed information and is also considered a <strong>primary source</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="h-obtaining-information">Obtaining Information</h4>



<p>Obtaining information happens in many different ways and has changed significantly from the traditional way of speaking to sources. Now, more than ever, more leaks and rumors tend to occur because of how easily accessible information is thanks to the internet and people’s capabilities and understanding of technology and social media.</p>



<p>We’re now in the ‘information age’, and if you know where to look and have the right skills, a lot of information that could be considered secret is easily accessible. These are the most common ways people use technology to obtain insider information, which would fall under ‘Documentation’ sourcing.</p>



<ul>
<li>Datamining game code</li>



<li>Trademarks &amp; Patents</li>



<li>Casting calls &amp; Job Listings</li>



<li>Social Media Profiles (especially LinkedIn)</li>



<li>JSON Sniffing (becoming increasingly popular)</li>
</ul>



<p>As previously mentioned, the more “traditional” way of obtaining information is just by speaking to others. However, inaccurate or incomplete information usually originates here from insiders/reporters because of the lack of verification/corroboration between sources.</p>



<h4 id="h-reliability">Reliability </h4>



<p>Regarding rumors, leaks, and reports, the reliability of the person reporting the news is often a major topic of discussion and discourse. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours</a> subreddit has over 444,000 members and has even resorted to a ‘credibility list’ to determine the most reliable leakers, insiders, and reporters. But it’s a little more complex than just banding everyone under the same rules regarding credibility because of how the information is obtained.</p>



<p>Typically, a report from the most reputable reporters will rely on multiple primary sources and documentation to back up any claims. The number of sources needed for a report can vary depending on the reporter or outlet, but three to four sources for a scoop on a topic like a game cancellation, a new product, or industry layoffs is a good rule of thumb. For the more significant investigative stories, such as those about bad studio culture, a reporter could expect to speak to dozens of primary and secondary sources before a report is published. While this is arguably the cream of the crop when it comes to reporting, the reality is that it’s not 2004 anymore. Not everyone with insider knowledge is a journalist with training and a degree that follows the same rules and ethics.</p>



<p>Information is everywhere, and almost anyone can get ‘insider information’ with a few hours of research and some luck. This loops back to Documentation Sourcing, and while this information can usually be right on the money, it’s always worth considering where that information originated and whether it is consistent with that person’s past reporting. For example, if a Call of Duty dataminer leaks that GTA 6 has been delayed, ask yourself where did that information come from. Why did a source pick them to leak it to? Did they corroborate the information with other sources? Did they reach out to the publisher for comment/verification? Is anyone reputable corroborating the claim? That person might be 100% correct on Call of Duty info as they leak it via datamining, but such a big story on GTA 6 being delayed might be less believable. </p>



<p>Here are a few more examples of how to determine reliability:</p>



<p><strong><em>Example:</em></strong> Microsoft is to lay off 650 employees. This is a recent story that I woke up to read<span> in the morning; Stephen Totilo from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-xbox-650" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game File</a>&nbsp;reported that approximately 650 employees from Microsoft’s gaming division will be losing th</span>eir jobs. </p>



<p>I know that Totilo is a reputable journalist, and the information is almost certainly correct. However, I still checked my own emails and DMs to find that three primary sources, alongside two forwarded emails, have told me the same news. This story now has three primary sources and two documentation sources I’ve seen firsthand, which is enough for me to corroborate and independently verify Totilo’s report publicly.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong><em>Example:</em></strong> A Twitter account with no track record said GTA 6 has been delayed to 2026. This is a massive story, but how does this person know? Why is no one reputable verifying these claims?</p>



<p>This person has likely been lied to, lied themselves, or hasn’t verified the information with multiple people. Remember, if someone publicly claims they have the information from multiple sources, it’s almost a guarantee that they are not the only person with sources who have spoken out.</p>



<p><strong><em>Example: </em></strong>Someone who leaks information through JSON Sniffing websites has leaked a new controller scheduled to be announced in five days. This person has a solid track record of doing similar reports in the past, so it’s very likely to be correct this time as well because the information is probably uploaded to the backend of a website somewhere for the announcement. </p>



<p><strong>Why do People Leak to Insiders?</strong></p>



<p>This is a pretty open-ended question that can have many different answers and get pretty complicated. The simple answer is that the source probably wants whatever information they are telling (or leaking) to the insider to go public. This can generally be harmless information, like a new game announcement, and is often shared between sources and insiders because of friendship. Conversely, someone could be leaking maliciously to hurt a specific person or company, and that is why corroboration between multiple sources is essential ethically and for an accurate report. </p>



<p>But generally speaking, regardless of any intentions, the sources trust the insider or reporter, be that because they are friends or trust their previous reporting.</p>



<p><strong>Corroboration</strong></p>



<p>Once again, most insiders get stuck and report incomplete or inaccurate information because they can not corroborate information between multiple sources. This is when the training and ethics of a reputable reporter may result in a potential story being left on the back burner until their particular requirements to run a story can be met. This can often mean that stories could take weeks or months to be reported on unless someone else with more sources or fewer standards reports on it first. It’s not uncommon for even some of the biggest stories to take well over six months because of the hundreds of emails, calls, etc., needed to ensure accurate information.</p>



<p>But, of course, the never-ending need to report on a story first isn’t a new concept. After all, the first to report on something is the most likely to get the most clicks and that all-important clout, right? This is where mistakes happen and the less experienced reporters/insiders end up with egg on their face after a more reputable reporter has done their own due diligence, or official information has been released. The need to be first has created a unique phenomenon that is becoming more prevalent in the industry, which I will call the “Insider Phenomenon.” This is where insiders end up falsely corroborating a story between themselves.</p>



<p>Remember earlier in the year when almost everyone with a podcast seemingly had inside knowledge about different first-party Xbox games coming to PlayStation? Yeah, that was the Insider Phenomenon. You see, we’re a community, and most insiders, journalists, podcasters, content creators etc. talk to each other behind the scenes, and because it’s not ethical to reveal sources, be that public or private, you can quickly see how inexperienced people can soon get a false sense of corroboration.</p>



<div><p>I won’t dive into the whole Xbox thing too much, but let’s just say, theoretically, an Xbox employee is disgruntled that the company is changing its strategy to bring its first-party games to PlayStation. That employee now leaks information to several different insiders, telling them different things in a flurry of frustration and with the intent to hurt the company. But, because those insiders do not have multiple sources, they speak to one another behind the scenes, quickly verifying information between themselves based on the same source. </p><p><strong><em>Example</em></strong>: a disgruntled employee who doesn’t know the exact facts has leaked to five insiders, and “Insider 1” wants to be the first to report on it but has no other Xbox employees as sources to corroborate. </p></div>



<p><em>Disgruntled Employee (Primary Source) to Insider 1 – Hey, “Game 1” is coming to PlayStation.<br>Disgruntled Employee (Primary Source) to Insider 2 – Hey, “Game 1” is coming to PlayStation.<br>Disgruntled Employee (Primary Source) to Insider 3 – Hey, “Game 2” is coming to PlayStation.<br>Disgruntled Employee (Primary Source) to Insider 4 – Hey, “Game 1” + Game 2 is coming to PlayStation.<br>Disgruntled Employee (Primary Source) to Insider 5 – Hey, “Game 1” + Game 2 + Game 3 is coming to PlayStation.</em></p>



<p><em>Insider 1 (Secondary Source) to Insider 2 (Secondary Source) – Have you heard “Game 1” is coming to PlayStation?<br>Insider 2 (Secondary Source) to Insider 1 (Secondary Source) – Yes!</em></p>



<div><p><em>Insider 1 (Secondary Source) to Insider 3 (Secondary Source) – Have you heard “Game 1” is coming to PlayStation?<br>Insider 3 (Secondary Source) to Insider 1 (Secondary Source) – No, but weirdly I heard about “Game 2”.</em></p><p><em>Insider 1 (Secondary Source) to Insider 2 (Secondary Source) – Have you heard “Game 1” is coming to PlayStation?<br>Insider 4 (Secondary Source) to Insider 1 (Secondary Source) – Yes, have you?!</em></p></div>



<p><em>Insider 1 (Secondary Source) to Insider 2 (Secondary Source) – Have you heard “Game 1” is coming to PlayStation?<br>Insider 2 (Secondary Source) to Insider 5 (Secondary Source) – Yes, I also heard about “Game 2” and “Game 3”</em></p>



<p>You can see how Insider 1 got a false sense of corroboration, verifying claims with three Secondary Sources that all come from the same Primary Source. In this example, Insider 5 may have also corroborated with Insider 3 and Insider 4 on Game 2, giving them a sense that Game 3 is also correct, which they can be the first to report on it. While this is a very basic example, it shows how quickly things can spiral out of control and why the correct ways of corroborating a story are needed. </p>



<p><strong>Educated Guesses </strong></p>



<p>In recent years, it’s become increasingly common to see people passing off educated guesses as leaks or insider information. Usually, this information is a ways away from being officially announced, so ask yourself: Does that person know about a specific product or game that is coming, or is it just an incredibly vague and educated guess? What specific information have they given to back up their claims if it does come to fruition? How much do they fall back on “things change”, or brag about it when they get right? </p>



<p>You see, it’s not difficult to pass off an educated guess as a leak these days. So, for fun, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/let-me-know-5-educated-guesses-that-will-happen-in-the-next-2-years.163/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">visit our community forum</a> and give us five educated guesses of things that you think will happen in the next two years (but don’t worry—if it doesn’t happen, things change!). For example, Death Stranding 2 will be at The Game Awards in December ( a guess based on Geoff and Kojima’s love).</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>The gaming leaks and rumors scene is constantly changing. While the lines have been blurred between traditional journalists and insiders, it’s not too difficult to look from the outside in to determine whether someone is reliable or not. The truth is that information can now come from anywhere and anyone, but it takes a considerable amount of time to report on some of the industry’s biggest stories accurately.</p>



<p>Reports, tweets, and videos based on leaks will never go away; in fact, they will probably become more prevalent in the coming years, but it’s up to you on who to believe.</p>



<p>And remember, always take leaks with a pinch of salt! </p>

"We are thrilled to team up and bring our combined expertise to work on an original game set in an incredibly fun new universe."</p><p>Absurd calls itself a general entertainment studio and is making more than just games--the studio is also producing the American Caper comic and graphic novel series. More projects will be announced later, spanning games, books, and scripted podcasts.</p><p>Given its low sales, Immortals of Aveum seems unlikely to get a sequel, but some found a lot to like about the game. If you're curious, Immortals of Aveum is available now on Game Pass Ultimate.</p><p>Absurd Ventures was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-co-founder-and-former-gta-boss-dan-houser-is-apparently-starting-a-new-company/1100-6493538/">created in 2021</a>, a year after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-games-boss-dan-houser-leaving-the-gta-and/1100-6473383/#:~:text=Dan%20Houser%2C%20the%20vice%20president,--is%20leaving%20the%20company.&amp;text=A%20brief%20statement%20reveals%20Houser,final%20day%20with%20the%20studio." data-ref-id="1100-6473383">Houser left Rockstar</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hobbit-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-delayed-to-early-2025.980130/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-the-shire-delayed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Wētā Workshop and publisher Private Division have announced a&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>delay, with the cozy hobbit game now set to launch sometime early next year.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1834336184639820240" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), the two studios say that the game needs a little extra time to cook, and so it's being pushed back to early 2025. It was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-gameplay-announce-pc-consoles">originally due to arrive sometime this year</a>.</p>
<p>Wētā and Private Division's reasoning is pretty standard stuff in video game delay terms;&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>needs to be "everything you're hoping for", and the extra time is to ensure the developers can "deliver that vision" of a cozy hobbit life sim.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-delayed-watering.jpg?itok=Y0q_PrLN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-delayed-watering.jpg?itok=VUqu4e6c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sorry, hobbit fans, but&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>is going to take a bit longer than you thought.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not all bad news, though. A new&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>release date will be announced during the Hobbit Day Showcase, which will be held on September 22nd and which will also contain new info about the game.</p>
<p>If you're not sure exactly what <i>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</i>is, it's a&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>game in which you <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cozy-hobbit-game-tales-of-shire-announed">take control of a hobbit</a> and build a life for yourself in the small hobbit village of Bywater.</p>
<p>You'll be able to do all the stuff you'd expect from a life sim; create your own hobbit, interact with the locals and get to know them, and grow crops and plants in your garden. You'll also be able to fish, forage for fruit, and trade with other hobbits around town.</p>
<p>Unlike many other&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>games out there right now,&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>isn't really interested in giving you a grand adventure; it's more about letting you live a chilled-out life in a cozy corner of Middle-earth.</p>

<p>You'll be able to pick up&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016460/Tales_of_the_Shire_A_The_Lord_of_The_Rings_Game/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010195" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game/9pkkjbvpp4gw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> sometime next year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-mulls-going-free-to-play-live-service-or-sticking-with-pay-to-play-as-ps5-tgs-rumors-swirl<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The developer of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> has revealed a conundrum it faces as it looks to the future: take the game free-to-play and live service, or stick with its current pay-to-play model.</p><p>Palworld is the phenomenally successful multiplayer survival crafting game that's been dubbed ‘Pokemon with guns’ for its inclusion of creatures called Pals. It launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC earlier this year, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Japanese developer Pocketpair has said the game was so popular, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-massive-profits-are-too-big-for-a-studio-with-our-size-to-handle">it couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-addresses-dead-game-debate-who-cares-if-theres-only-five-people-playing">While player numbers have declined somewhat since Palworld’s explosive launch</a>, it remains one of the most-played games on Steam (Microsoft does not make Windows PC and Xbox player numbers public), sitting comfortably in the top 100. But for Pocketpair CEO Takuro Mizobe, thoughts are now turning to the future, and whether to make Palworld free-to-play and embrace the live service model so many other games have adopted.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Palworld vs. Pokémon Comparison</h3></div></output><p>In an interview with <a href="https://ascii.jp/elem/000/004/220/4220741/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASCII Japan</a>, translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-faces-the-difficult-choice-of-whether-to-become-a-live-service-game-or-stay-buy-to-play-pocketpairs-ceo-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>, Mizobe said Pocketpair needs to make a decision between the two business models.</p><p>“When you think about it from a business perspective, making (Palworld) a live-service game would extend its lifespan and make it more stable in terms of profitability,” Mizobe said. “However, the game was not initially designed with that approach in mind, so there would be many challenges involved in taking it down the live-service path.”</p><p>One of those challenges would be turning Palworld from a pay-to-play game into a free-to-play game, which would in turn crank up the monetization. “It is common for live-service games to be F2P with paid elements such as skins and battle passes, but Palworld is a B2P game, so it’s difficult to turn it into a live-service game from the ground up,” Mizobe explained.</p><p>While there are examples of games that have successfully made the switch from premium to free (Fall Guys and PUBG are two), doing so requires a great deal of effort and much risk. “Both (games) took several years to make the shift," Mizobe added. "While I understand that the live-service model is good for business, it’s not that easy.”</p><p>It sounds like a decision has yet to be made, and Pocketpair is keenly aware of a potential backlash from players who have already paid $30 to play Palworld. But it’s worth keeping in mind that Palworld launched in early access form just over half a year ago, so it’s early days yet.</p><p>Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip">signing a deal with Sony</a> to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP.</p><p>This is not a publishing deal for Palworld the video game, or an acquisition by Sony, rather an attempt to make the most of the game’s huge popularity with non-video game products, such as merchandise and music. The newly formed business, headed up by Pocketpair CEO Takuro Mizobe, is responsible for global licensing and merchandising activities associated with Palworld.</p><p>Speaking of Sony, Palworld is heavily rumored to be set for a PlayStation launch announcement at this month’s Tokyo Game Show, after the game popped up on a schedule. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/looks-like-palworld-is-coming-to-playstation">Pocketpair had teased a PlayStation release back in June</a>, so this would come as little surprise. TGS runs from September 26 to 29.</p><p>While Palworld is one of the biggest game launches ever, it’s also one of the most controversial. Pocketpair has said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-devs-says-they-have-received-death-threats-amid-pokmon-rip-off-claims"><u>its staff has received death threats amid Pokémon "rip-off" claims</u></a>, which it has denied. Soon after launch, Nintendo moved quickly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/modder-who-put-pokmon-into-palword-says-nintendo-has-come-for-me"><u>to remove an eye-catching Pokémon mod</u></a>, then <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pokemon-company-makes-an-official-statement-on-palworld-we-intend-to-investigate"><u>The Pokemon Company issued a statement</u></a>, saying: "We intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to Pokémon." <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-palworld-blows-up-could-nintendo-successfully-sue-the-controversial-pokemon-with-guns-game"><u>IGN asked lawyers whether Nintendo could successfully sue</u></a>.</p><p>If you're playing, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/maps/palworld/palpagos-islands"><u>IGN's interactive Palworld map</u></a>, or how you can create a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-palworld-server-hosting"><u>dedicated Palworld server with your friends</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    <p><span>Traverse the barren Outer Ring with the Sons of Calydon.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 1.2 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Tour de Inferno,” will launch on September 25, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [173 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-914326"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Proxies will expand their journey in New Eridu to the desolate outskirts known as the Outer Ring while hopping on a passionate motorcycle ride with Caesar, Burnice and other members from the Sons of Calydon. Meanwhile, the brand-new <a title="Genres > Arcade [61 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade game</a> “Bizarre Brigade” at Godfinger and various events including “Overlord’s Feast” will offer players more entertaining ways to enjoy the game. With optimizations for the TV mode, squad preset, time and stamina systems being implemented in this version update, <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is aiming to keep providing its players with a better gaming experience.</p><p>Serving as the main stage for the upcoming chapter of the story, Outer Ring is an undeveloped and barren area located out of downtown, New Eridu. Despite the desolation, the area is affluent in fuel resources which sometimes leads to simmering tensions and competition among different groups. In Version 1.2, Proxies will work with Caesar, Burnice, and other members from the Sons of Calydon for a showdown with their rival, The Vanquishers, and Overlord Pompey. Players will also be able to explore New Eridu as Caesar and Burnice in the new version.</p><p>As a faction active in the Outer Ring, the Sons of Calydon operates a logistics company known as “Leaps and Bounds” and transports resources through Hollows. Caesar, the leader of the Sons of Calydon, is an S-Rank Physical Defense Agent. Besides providing allies with a shield buff, she can also deal massive damage with her shield and debuff enemies once Perfect Block or Defensive Assist is triggered. The other new character, Burnice, is an S-Rank Fire Anomaly Agent who can deal an impressive amount of Fire damage and quickly accumulate Anomaly Buildup to Burn enemies with two flamethrowers. In the meantime, the Sons of Calydon’s S-Rank Bangboo Red Moccus is also eager to join the combat with a customized Bangboo motorcycle.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_914325"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Additionally, a time-limited <a title="Genres > Survival [319 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> shooting arcade game called “Bizarre Brigade” will be available at Godfinger. By advancing through this <a title="Genres > Roguelike [252 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike game</a>, players can unlock different characters and use them to complete challenges. Players will also get an opportunity to practice their combat skills with characters from different factions for free, level up their Agents faster, and obtain rewards via a new gameplay called Investigator Training Course at HIA.</p><p>Beyond content updates, <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> will optimize several in-game mechanics and features to offer Proxies a better and more seamless game experience. Starting from Version 1.2, players can automatically acquire all Observation Data and rewards on the TV board with the help of FAIRY once finishing exploring the board for the first time. The presentation of the TV board including certain animations will also be improved and accelerated while players will enjoy the story and combat more directly and consistently in the new Chapter 4. Moreover, players will be able to preset their lineups for the combat and switch the time freely, and a Backup Battery Charge will be provided to offer players more stamina in the game.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,917 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> via <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009763" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [21,213 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a></p><p>Watch the version 1.2 trailer and special program below.

There’s something about the juxtaposition between their tiny innocence and their menacing actions that is very unsettling—whether they are possessed by something supernatural or just born that way. </p><p>There are many well-known little devils in the classic horror canon, like Damien from <em>The Omen</em> and Regan in <em>The Exorcist</em>, but to kick off spooky season this year, we thought we’d turn our eye to more contemporary horror and select some of the creepiest children in modern cinema. These kiddos rightfully earn their place amongst the other horror movie legends whose sweet, youthful demeanors mask sinister intentions. But be warned, the kids are not alright.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="21aa95334b99bb2971ccb66385944c38" data-recommend-id="image://21aa95334b99bb2971ccb66385944c38" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Samuel holds a toy.

His scariness lies in how challenging it is to take care of him, especially as a single parent, which his mother, Amelia, is. He has a very big and rambunctious personality and creative imagination, which result in ear-splitting tantrums, violent outbursts, and the hyperactive creation of homemade weapons. Since <em>The Babadook</em> puts us in the mindset of a mother who is dealing with grief, every little thing about Samuel makes the viewer want to explode in anger or frustration. The prospect of raising a child like him is terrifying; no matter how much love you might have for him, the way he constantly bounces off the wall would be a never-ending nightmare.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="874f5fc1c5cd23ea082b0874a1a30b9d" data-recommend-id="image://874f5fc1c5cd23ea082b0874a1a30b9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Charlie stands in front of a tree." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Charlie stands in front of a tree." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->A24</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="874f5fc1c5cd23ea082b0874a1a30b9d" data-recommend-id="image://874f5fc1c5cd23ea082b0874a1a30b9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Charlie stands in front of a tree." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Charlie from <em>Hereditary </em>is a misunderstood girl who keeps to herself, wears oversized sweatshirts, and always has a dazed and confused look on her face. She enjoys drawing, cutting the head off a pigeon, creating dolls out of twigs and branches, and making peculiar clucking noises. She seems bizarre yet harmless, but the bleak revelations at the end of the film make us see Charlie in a more ominous light. </p><p>It turns out that her body is not truly hers but is inhabited by the soul of King Paimon–-an all-powerful ruler of hell–- who is scared and out-of-place in a female form (LOL). Charlie emphasizes what makes <em>Hereditary </em>such a devastating horror film: The characters are powerless, their destinies already decided by the malevolent cult. Charlie’s unsettling behavior is a reflection of her true self trapped, screaming on the inside, completely overtaken by a demon and stripped of her autonomy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8ec63b8afcb696753623091a0a939660" data-recommend-id="image://8ec63b8afcb696753623091a0a939660" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Megan looks into the camera.

While her loyalty runs deep, M3GAN’s casual and extremely calculated ways of inflicting harm are terrifying. She’ll do a sassy dance number before murdering you because that’s how little she cares and how much fun she’s having. </p><p><em>M3GAN </em>not only makes us afraid of preteens but also the growing danger of AI becoming increasingly autonomous and human-like while retaining its cold, mechanical nature. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7e9682b06fe43d52c8b59f1af957fc55" data-recommend-id="image://7e9682b06fe43d52c8b59f1af957fc55" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Esther sits in a chair.

She wears doll-like dresses, Peter Pan Collars, bows in her pigtails, and ribbons around her neck. Her well-mannered behavior and painting talents make her an immediate choice to be adopted by an American family. She exhibits strange behaviors—such as observing her adopted parents in intimate moments or pushing her sibling off a playground. They become worse as the film goes on until we learn the source of all her violent frustrations: Esther is actually a grown, 33-year-old woman who looks like a 9-year-old girl, and she’s taking her rage out on everyone for not being able to enjoy life as a normal adult. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="68fb91c47bd7bb43e1da9ba039a5f903" data-recommend-id="image://68fb91c47bd7bb43e1da9ba039a5f903" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Elias and Lukas stand and look scary." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Elias and Lukas stand and look scary." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon MGM Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="68fb91c47bd7bb43e1da9ba039a5f903" data-recommend-id="image://68fb91c47bd7bb43e1da9ba039a5f903" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Elias and Lukas stand and look scary." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Goodnight Mommy</em> features double trouble—not just one creepy kid, but two.

They tie her to the bed, Super Glue her lips shut, put cockroaches on her, and even set fire to the lavish family home. <em>Goodnight Mommy</em> delivers twice the evil to show how deep sibling bonds can run, often causing them to influence one another in the worst ways. A child’s boundless imagination can be used for bad ideas just as much as good. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cbf3be669dcaad7c2eb97c9654198638" data-recommend-id="image://cbf3be669dcaad7c2eb97c9654198638" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Brandon stands wearing a ski mask." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Brandon stands wearing a ski mask." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cbf3be669dcaad7c2eb97c9654198638" data-recommend-id="image://cbf3be669dcaad7c2eb97c9654198638" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Brandon stands wearing a ski mask." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Brightburn </em>has a bold concept: What if a child with Superman-like powers wanted to use those powers for evil? Much like Superman, Brandon’s parents discover him after a spaceship crash.

He kills without any remorse or concern. Brandon’s outfit—a threadbare ski mask tied with a shoelace, a ratty cape, and a striped t-shirt—blends the everyday look of a child with a makeshift superhero costume. <em>Brightburn </em>mixes elements of sci-fi, comic book mythology, and horror to create one of the scariest kids ever. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="220e8a0d0515b456a2f5a9d2398ca3ca" data-recommend-id="image://220e8a0d0515b456a2f5a9d2398ca3ca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Samara walks out of a well.

It took me years to stop having nightmares about her, and she still gives me chills to this day. She has the power to psychically imprint macabre images into people’s minds and takes pleasure in torturing her adoptive parents and the horses that live on their farm with them. Eventually her mother, Anna, abandons her in a well where Samara manages to live for seven days. </p><p>Everything about the way Samara looks is nightmare fuel: her long, stringy black hair covers her decaying, angry face and her plain, ragged dress is drenched in dirty well-water, and she seemingly can’t be escaped. In her quest for vengeance, she spreads a haunted VHS tape filled with her nihilistic visions across the world and literally breaks through the television to kill you. She murders her victims in a gruesome way that makes them understand the torment she experienced at the bottom of the well. They are left with faces twisted and frozen in a permanent scream, horrifying images that burn into your brain forever. <br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Epic Games, Electronic Arts, Roblox, Microsoft, Activision Blizzard, Mojang Studios, Supercell, and Ubisoft are the target of a new mobile-gaming consumer complaint filed by The European Consumer Organization (BEUC) with the European Commission and the European Network of Consumer Authorities. In short, BEUC is accusing the companies of tricking players into spending money on in-app purchases with misleading marketing tactics.</p><p>As part of the complaint, BEUC released <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/sites/default/files/publications/BEUC-X-2024-061_Monetising_play_Regulating_in_game_and_in_app_premium_currencies.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a 36-page report</a> detailing its allegations. The report accuses the video game companies of using "harmful commercial practices" including loot boxes, deceptive designs, in-game premium currency, and aggressive marketing to fool players--especially children-- into making in-app purchases.</p><p>"BEUC's members have identified numerous cases where gamers are misled into spending money," said BEUC Director General Agustin Reyna in a statement. "Regulators must act, making it clear that even though the gaming world is virtual, it still needs to abide by real-world rules. Today, premium in-game currencies are purposefully tricking consumers and take a big toll on children. Companies are well aware of children's vulnerability and use tricks to lure younger consumers into spending more."</p><p>Via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/12/bad-credits-consumer-group-files-eu-suit-over-manipulative-payments-in-games-like-fortnite-and-minecraft-calls-for-a-ban/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TechCrunch</a>, Video Games Europe--which represents many of the video game companies in the EU--blasted the complaint in its own statement. The coalition also noted that the mobile games can be played without spending money.</p><p>"The purchase of in-game currencies is a well-established practice, and well understood by players. Our members always respect European consumer laws in how they offer these purchases... Video Games Europe and its members support and promote fair and transparent principles for purchases of in-game content, including for in-game currency."</p><p>BEUC is a consumer group, and thus can't make any rules for its member states. But its report does suggest potential legal remedies, including a ban on in-game and in-app purchases made by underage players as well as a ban on in-game premium currencies. Whether the European Network of Consumer Authorities will follow any of these recommendations remains to be seen.</p>

            <p>The proposed sales of Metro studio 4A Games, as well as that of Pinball developer Zen Studios, has been cancelled, Embracer announced today.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embattled-publisher-embracer-sells-off-saber-assets-withdraws-from-russia">March of this year</a>, Embracer announced the sale of more of its assets, including large portions of Saber Interactive, for the price of $247m. At this time, <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1768216189661024581">Saber's new CEO Matt Karch</a> stated the company had decided to take 4A and Zen with it, despite initial messaging from Embracer suggesting the Swedish conglomerate may retain the two studios.</p>
<p>Now, however, the potential sale of both studios has been cancelled, and 4A and Zen will remain within Embracer.</p>

<p>"We are satisfied with the conclusion of this transaction and very glad to see the great teams and assets of 4A Games and Zen Studios remain within Embracer. They will be important building blocks in our continued journey," Lars Wingefors, co-founder and CEO of Embracer, said in a <a href="https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Embracer-Group-receives-early-payment-for-sale-of-Saber-assets.-4A-Games-and-Zen-Studios-will-remain-within-Embracer-Group-240913.pdf">press release</a> accompanying today's news.</p>
<p>The exec added 4A currently has "two AAA titles under development", which the company is looking forward to announcing.</p>
<p>"I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Matthew Karch for his contributions over the years, and at the same time congratulate the Saber team on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/space-marine-2-most-successful-steam-launch-for-warhammer-40k-series">successful release of the iconic Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, that will make a great start in their new structure," Wingefors closed.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, Karch told Bloomberg's Jason Schreier "it was always [Saber's] intention to exercise on 4A" but the company "thought it would be better for all parties" the studio stays with Embracer.</p>

<p>After a huge acquisition spree, Embracer subsequently shed thousands of staff and shuttered studios such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-closed-down-effective-immediately">Saints Row developer Volition Games</a>, after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-shares-plummet-after-proposed-2bn-partnership-collapses">major $2bn investment fell through</a>.</p>
<p>Most recently, Embracer-owned studio Lost Boys Interactive announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-owned-studio-lost-boys-interactive-impacted-by-another-round-of-layoffs">implementing another round of layoffs</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-leaked-benchmark-increased-resolution-max-settings/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A PlayStation 5 Pro leaked benchmark shared online a few hours ago provides a good overview of how games will be improved when running on the soon-to-be-released new console.</p>
<p>An unspecified developer that was consulted on previous leaks sent Moore's Law is Dead early testing footage of one of their games that compares it running on base and Pro models side-by-side, complete with displayed framerates. According to the footage, this game uses a 1080p-1600p dynamic resolution range with a mix of medium and high settings and runs between 45 and 60 FPS on the base model. The same game, on PlayStation 5 Pro, uses a higher dynamic resolution range, 1600p-2160p, with no PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, maximum settings, and runs at locked 60 frames per second without any drop. The developer is looking into trying 4K resolution and 120 Hz modes in the future.</p>
<p>Besides providing the early test footage, the unnamed developer also provided some additional information on the PlayStation 5 Pro. The console adds an option for 8K, which has only been confirmed to be available for Gran Turismo 7 as of now, and has access to an extra 1.2 GB of RAM due to a Memory System Efficiency system. According to the documentation provided by Sony, the console, in practice, exceeds a 28% bandwidth increase as well. High CPU Frequency Mode will also offer 10% more CPU performance for just lower than 1.5% GPU performance, providing developers with more options as required.</p>
<p>Things seem to be looking up for the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler as well. The PlayStation 5 Pro AI-driven upscaler was recently updated to version 9.4, which improves the image quality over version 9.0 and uses only 250MB of RAM. The available memory doesn't seem to be an issue for the system as well, as Sony added just enough usable RAM, according to this developer.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro Benchmark Leak, AMD Zen 5 Sales Update, RADEON UDNA, Intel Arrow Lake | August Loose Ends" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-nhZJ1RTTsM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While definitely exciting, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/">PlayStation 5 Pro technical presentation</a> did not go as in-depth as this leaked benchmark does. Hopefully, Sony will provide better information on how the console will improve games in the near future, as the shared footage doesn't look <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-early-comparison-minimal-improvements/">too impressive</a>. The console's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-low-volume-product-sell-much/">high price</a> will still be unjustified for most players, but more may be willing to make the jump to the system with better information that properly highlights what the console's increased specs and PSSR upscaler can do.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches worldwide on November 7th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-layoffs-hit-call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-which-didnt-hit-as-big-as-hoped<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Microsoft’s shock gaming layoffs have reportedly hit the Activision Blizzard teams behind mobile games <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile">Call of Duty Warzone Mobile</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/warcraft-rumble">Warcraft Rumble</a>.</p><p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff">Xbox boss Phil Spencer sent a memo to staff</a>, verified by IGN, that outlined a further 650 layoffs at Microsoft’s gaming business. These layoffs follow the 1,900 made earlier this year, and bring the total up to an eye-watering 2,550 since Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year.</p><p>While Spencer insisted no games were canceled or studios closed this time, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-xbox-650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game File</a> reports that Activision Blizzard’s development teams for Call of Duty Warzone Mobile and Warcraft Rumble were hit.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Call of Duty Warzone Mobile launched in March on iOS and Android as a Warzone-specific Call of Duty mobile experience that offers battle royale for up to 120 players, as well as cross-progression with the PC and console Warzone, Modern Warfare 2 and 3, and the upcoming Black Ops 6. IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-review">Call of Duty Warzone Mobile review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: "Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile includes all the best elements of Warzone, while speeding up and streamlining matches and using cross-progression to make this a meaningful extension of the traditional experience."</p><p>Activision’s hope was that Warzone Mobile would make a splash in the competitive mobile shooter market, where the hugely successful Call of Duty Mobile, developed by Tencent-owned TiMi Studio Group, is already established. With Call of Duty Mobile, which has seen 650 million downloads since launch, revenue is shared between Activision and Tencent. Call of Duty Warzone Mobile, on the other hand, is developed entirely in-house at Activision, and so the company gets a bigger slice of the money pie every time a player drops cash on a battle pass or a cosmetic.</p><p>It sounds like Call of Duty Warzone Mobile hasn’t met Activision’s expectations, however. <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1834348582498963532" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game File’s Stephen Totilo said</a> that Warzone Mobile “didn't hit as big as hoped,” and that while it will remain online, its team “is being scaled down.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>Spencer referenced Warzone Mobile’s struggle in his memo, without namechecking the game itself: “Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games.”</p><p>Similarly, Blizzard’s Warcraft Rumble team is affected by the layoffs. Warcraft Rumble launched as a free-to-play mobile tower defense game in 2023 across iOS and Android and while it started strong, interest appears to have tailed off. Warcraft Rumble is now moving from launch to post-launch live ops, but will remain online.</p><p>Activision Blizzard’s recent mobile struggles call into question Microsoft’s acquisition of the company itself, given Spencer has made no secret that the decision to buy the company was in part motivated by Xbox’s lofty mobile ambitions (Activision Blizzard owns King, the maker of phenomenally popular mobile game Candy Crush). Indeed, Microsoft plans to launch an app store of its own, taking on Apple and Google in the lucrative mobile game space.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-hardware-revenue-down-42-from-last-year-as-activision-acquisition-continues-to-boost-content-sales"><u>Xbox hardware sales were way down again in Microsoft's Q4</u></a>, the latest financial quarter we have figures for, while gaming content sales skyrocketed again thanks to Activision Blizzard. Gaming revenue overall appears to be doing more than fine in terms of year-on-year comparisons, even setting quarterly records, but this was largely due to the boost offered by Activision Blizzard (it wasn't there to make money for the company last year, now it is, so the numbers have gone up).</p><p>Gaming revenue was up 44% year-over-year, but with 48 points of net impact from the acquisition, which indicates that Xbox's not-Activision Blizzard-related business isn't doing as well as it was last year. Xbox content and services revenue fared better, up 61% year-over-year, with 58 points of net impact from the acquisition.</p><p>Overall, Microsoft's More Personal Computing division (which includes Xbox as well as other segments such as Windows) brought in $15.9 billion in revenue, up 14% year-over-year, during Q4.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games.</p></div><p>Speaking in August, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-decision-to-launch-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5"><u>Spencer said that Xbox’s controversial multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business</u></a> — with the pressure now on to deliver following Microsoft’s acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.</p><p>“And we run a business,” Spencer said. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.</p><p>“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”</p><p>Microsoft is set to launch Activision's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</u></a> in October as the first mainline Call of Duty game to hit its Game Pass subscription service day-one.

            <p>There are reports the upcoming Nintendo Switch release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> has leaked.</p>
<p>It appears a link to a rom containing the entire game has started making its way online.  Nintendo-focused YouTuber Nintendo Prime said they "have confirmed" it is real.</p>
<p>In a separate YouTube video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaoF0C0YsC8">Nintendo Prime</a> stated they checked the link they had been sent, and it was "the rom for Echoes of Wisdom". The YouTuber - who has not shared any of the leaked footage, stating they are <a href="https://x.com/NintyPrime/status/1834312441838121190">not distributing</a> the rom as it's "illegal and career ending to do so" - said Echoes of Wisdom is now playable on emulators.</p>

<p>Officially, Echoes of Wisdom is set to debut later this month, on 26th September.</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's launch, fans have been busy trying to work out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-react-to-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-reveal-with-timeline-speculation-and-adorable-artwork">where in the series' timeline Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom sits</a>.

			<p>Earlier this year, Warhorse Studios finally satisfied the many fans of its debut title with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-out-this-year-and-its-looking-great-not-to-mention-twice-as-large/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. The Czech developer had been quiet for a very long time but came out of the shadows promising a 2024 launch and a bigger, better game in every respect.</p>
<p>The release had to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> a little beyond the original plan to February 11, 2025, but the rest of the promises remain intact, as testified by Chris's recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview</a>. At Gamescom 2024, I also got my hands on the game, although the session was much shorter than the one available at the dedicated press event.</p>
<p>A game like Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 doesn't lend itself well to a quick 45-minute demonstration. The combat system is similar to that in the first game and remains highly unique, taking a bit of time to get used to after all these years (I finished Kingdom Come Deliverance at launch, so over six years ago).&nbsp; Even so, some of the improvements were obvious from the get-go, such as better movement animations and facial animations. It was also great to experiment with the 'chat system' that allows Henry to seamlessly interact with passersby NPCs without entering the classic dialogue window, in a fashion that reminded me of Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>
<p>The visuals looked amazing, too, and the game already ran smoothly, which is very promising for the full game's optimization. After the demo, I interviewed Warhorse Executive Producer Martin Klima to dive deeper into what we can expect from Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 when it launches in less than five months.</p>

<p><strong>When did you start working on Kingdom Come Deliverance 2? Was it immediately after the launch of the base game, or did you wait until the release of the final DLC?</strong></p>
<p>It's hard to say, as developing a game is a complex process. I think we gradually shifted from supporting Kingdom Come Deliverance, and I would say that only after the release of the last DLC and the last update were we able to focus on the sequel.</p>
<p><strong>I know that you've kept the CryENGINE. Did you consider any other engine early on?</strong></p>
<p>When we finished KCD, we took a look at the technology we were using and were considering our options, but we decided that keeping CryENGINE made the most sense for us because we spent a lot of time customizing it for our needs and I think we are very happy. I'm quite proud of the performance we have now.</p>
<p><strong>Did you get the latest version from Crytek or are you still using your own from the first installment?</strong></p>
<p>We have access to the latest version of the engine. Of course, we also wanted to keep our customization. In the end, although the engine that we have is not quite the same engine that Crytek uses for Hunt: Showdown, it is very close.</p>
<p><strong>Do you support hardware ray tracing and/or multiple upscalers in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</strong></p>
<p>We support upscaling tech, both NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR. We are not using hardware ray tracing; CryENGINE has very good software ray tracing. <strong><em>[After the interview, I learned from Warhorse that the game actually uses Sparse Voxel Octree Global Illumination, or SVOGI. It was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-gets-svogi-onoff-comparison-performance-hit-is-minimal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured</a> in the first game, although it has since been improved]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>I know the game is a lot bigger than the first one. What was the main challenge?</strong></p>
<p>It was a challenge in terms of production. We had to increase the team to deliver the content, not to mention the amount of effort that was required to improve certain aspects, such as facial animation and dialogue animation. We had those in the first as well, but we wanted them to be much better. In terms of performance, the larger size is not much of an issue when you have a good streaming engine. We put a lot of effort into improving the performance since that can influence the perception of the game, and we wanted to have a smoother experience.</p>
<p><strong>I remember the first Kingdom Come Deliverance to be quite heavy on PCs.</strong></p>
<p>It was. There were a lot of things that we were doing just by brute force, and I think this additional time we had in the development for this sequel allowed us to optimize a lot, parallelize, and utilize CPUs better. Of course, hardware is faster now, and the consoles have more memory and better performance.</p>
<p><strong>Will the game run at 60 FPS on consoles?</strong></p>
<p>60FPS is something that's not out of reach for us.</p>
<p><strong>I know that Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has two maps. Can you move from one to the other at any point in the story, or is it gated by certain events?</strong></p>
<p>It's gated by the story. You will start in a certain situation, which gives you a limited amount of possibilities. At a certain point, you will travel to the second map, and from that point onward, you can move freely.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Travel between maps is initially gated by the story. You will start in a certain situation, which gives you a limited amount of possibilities. At a certain point, you will travel to the second map, and from that point onward, you can move freely.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>During the presentation, we were told that you strived to make combat more accessible. How did you achieve this?</strong></p>
<p>I think it's a confluence of several decisions that we made. We wanted to streamline the way you control combat. Previously, we used three buttons: one for slashing, one for stabbing, and one for blocking. It felt too cumbersome, so we streamlined that, and now we have just one button for attacking and another for blocking.</p>
<p>The attack zone determines whether you are stabbing or slashing (provided you have a weapon capable of doing so, as blunt weapons cannot). Currently, we have four attack zones. Because we limited the number of attack zones, we were also able to limit the number of guards, leading to a much smoother transition between attacks and blocks. Combat looks much clearer and more natural than before.</p>
<p>We were also able to hire more people to guide us through the true medieval fencing techniques and we employed more people for motion capture. Each weapon has a more distinct style to it. Also, enemies won't repeat the same animation like in a synchronized swimming competition, making combat look more realistic.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We are introducing polearms and firearms, which obviously is the biggest change. We are also adding crossbows. Bows have a higher rate of fire and are more difficult to aim, and usually, they deal lower damage, though not necessarily. Crossbows take a lot of time to load but are much easier to aim and can deal high damage. Firearms are also really difficult to load and can be inaccurate, but they are really powerful, so if you happen to hit something, the damage will be substantial.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>I know you are introducing new weapons in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. Can you talk about them?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We are introducing polearms and firearms, which obviously is the biggest change. We are also adding crossbows, which is something that's typical of the time period. Polearms were actually there in the first game, but they were too cumbersome and you couldn't put them in your inventory, so they were kinda useless.</p>
<p><strong>I guess they have very different use cases.</strong></p>
<p>Definitely. Bows have a higher rate of fire and are more difficult to aim, and usually, they deal lower damage, though not necessarily. Crossbows take a lot of time to load but are much easier to aim and can deal high damage. Firearms are also really difficult to load and can be inaccurate, but they are really powerful, so if you happen to hit something, the damage will be substantial.</p>
<p><strong>Can it malfunction?</strong></p>
<p>I won't comment on this.</p>
<p><strong>Can you craft your own bullets for the firearms?</strong></p>
<p>No, not really. But we have introduced a certain level of crafting to the game, so you can create your own weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Is it possible to craft armor as well?</strong></p>
<p>No, only weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Alright. Talking about character progression, did you make any notable changes in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</strong></p>
<p>The skill tree is, I would say, not completely different but quite different from what you know, even like the basic skills, but the core principle that you improve by doing stuff stays the same. So, if you ride a horse, you will get better at horse riding; if you fight a lot, you will improve at using weapons, and so on.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'It was always our ambition to create a living world where NPCs have their routines rather than just standing there and waiting for the player to go talk to them. I think we improved on this a lot in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. We were able to create a world that I think behaves more believably and reacts to player actions in a more nuanced way.'</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>I know one of the big changes with the sequel is also the lively world enabled by more dynamic NPCs. Can you talk about those improvements?</strong></p>
<p>It was always our ambition to create a living world where NPCs have their routines rather than just standing there and waiting for the player to go talk to them. I think we improved on this a lot in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. We were able to create a world that I think behaves more believably and reacts to player actions in a more nuanced way.</p>
<p>To give you an example, we have been recording <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-more-dialogue-than-baldurs-gate-3-half-of-all-wheel-of-time-books-combined/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a huge number of dialogue lines</a>, and almost half of that is not related to the game story at all. They are NPC reactions to the player's actions, such as when you steal something, when you enter an area where you shouldn't be, when an NPC finds a body, or when they open their chest and realize it's been emptied. It is very nuanced; even depending on what was stolen, you might get different reactions.</p>
<p><strong>You also have a reputation system in place.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. That was in the first game as well, but it underwent a certain evolution. It's a little bit more fine-grained here.</p>
<p><strong>I noticed that you can also briefly interact with the passing NPCs in a way I've only ever seen before in Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption 2. Was that the inspiration?</strong></p>
<p>It is a new feature we added to the game. In Kingdom Come Deliverance, you could only talk to NPCs through the dialogue system, which also switched the camera and stopped whatever the NPC was doing. It's really good for those story-based moments dialogues so that you get this movie-like experience of different camera angles and custom animation created for that dialogue. But we also wanted a more lightweight method for interacting with NPCs where you don't switch to another camera angle, and the animation just keeps doing what they are doing.</p>
<p><strong>It's more seamless that way.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, and this is what we call the chat system. It was originally developed for those moments in the story where you just need to tell somebody something, or somebody asks you something, and you answer just yes or no, without launching the whole heavy dialogue system. Once we had it, we realized that we could do a lot more with that. Greeting passersby was the natural expansion of this system. I don't think it was a conscious reaction to Red Dead Redemption 2. Of course, we are gamers, all of us play other people's games. I am sure some 70 percent of the team probably played Red Dead Redemption 2 so it would be silly to deny that it might have been even subconsciously influenced by them, but then, we are influenced by every game we play.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah. It's just that when I first saw it in that game, I thought many games would borrow the system, as it added a lot to the interactivity, but actually they didn't. Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is the first game I've played since that really has something similar.</strong></p>
<p>True. Again, though, I don't think it was a conscious decision.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 now supports AMD FSR 3.0 officially, which brings performance improvements with frame generation but still leaves a lot to be desired in terms of image quality.</p>
<p>New comparison videos based on the game's latest version shared online highlight how implementing an outdated version of AMD's upscaler wasn't the best of choices, as visual quality is outright bad on multiple system configurations and at different resolutions, essentially negating the performance improvements brought by frame generation, which cannot be used with any other upscaler in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cyberpunk 2077 Official FSR 3 Update - DLSS 3.7 vs FSR 3 Frame Generation Comparison | RTX 3080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9tMoPwblkvA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Besides introducing AMD FSR 3.0 support, the new Cyberpunk 2077 <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/50818/patch-2-13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.13 patch</a>, which was only released for PC, also brings Intel XeSS 1.3 support, enables the usage of both DLAA and DLSS Ray Reconstruction at the same time, and introduces some other unspecified stability and visual fixes. Hopefully, this won't be the last patch CDPR puts out for the game, as introducing support for the much better AMD FSR 3.1 would be rather welcome.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. The Phantom Liberty expansion, released last year, is only available on PC and current generation consoles. You can learn more about it and the big 3.0 patch which introduces important gameplay and progression changes in Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">review.</a></p>

            <p>Bungie has "resolved" a plagiarism accusation after an artist accused the studio of lifting their alternative design of an "iconic" <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> weapon.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Bungie <a href="https://x.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1833596360840376515">revealed</a> a physical Nerf LMTD blaster based upon Cayde-6's hand cannon, Ace of Spades.</p>
<p>Shortly after the blaster was revealed, artist Tofu_Rabbit called out the developer on Twitter/X, stating the Nerf design was not merely "similar" to a design they did back in 2015, but essentially a carbon copy, down to the "same brush strokes and scratches/smudges".</p>

<p>Bungie dropped a statement shortly thereafter, saying it was "currently investigating internally and with our partner. We are in contact with the artist and will share more on what next steps we are taking once we have gathered more information".</p>
<p>Whilst there's been nothing further from Bungie about the issue, earlier today (13th September), Tofu_Rabbit updated their thread to confirm that the issue has now been resolved, although they stopped short of confirming any of the details or if compensation was offered.</p>
<p>"Just wanted to give one last final update, the situation with Bungie is resolved!" they announced.</p>

<p>A month after Bungie acknowledged player "uncertainty surrounding the future of Destiny" following mass layoffs at the studio, the developer has announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-announces-major-changes-for-destiny-2-two-medium-expansions-coming-a-year">"major changes for the future" of its live-service shooter</a>, which will now receive multiple paid expansions a year.</p>
<p>More specifically, Destiny 2's overhauled release model, announced to coincide with the series' tenth anniversary, will see two "medium-sized" paid expansions release annually, alongside four "major" free content updates. All this will form a "new multi-year saga" (the first since Destiny 2's Light and Darkness saga concluded with its The Final Shape expansion earlier this year) promising new characters, factions, twists, and more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Humanity’s last bastion, The City of Numbers, has been destroyed. Not just a little bit destroyed either, we’re talking overrun by evil creatures and corrupted by decay. Without a home, the human race sought sanctuary in the Belfry, an immense tower, but the spread of evil attempted to follow them. Humanity needs protectors – known as Aces – warriors tasked with protecting the last inhabitants. This is where you come in.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towerborne Dev Diary #3" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pcZ3l5-ZETM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Towerborne is a scrolling beat em’up – or is that sword ‘em up? – where you and your friends can come together and face off against the denizens of the wilderness who seem set on getting rid of every last human. While it’s a complete change of pace from their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/26/the-banner-saga-3-review/">The Banner Saga trilogy</a>, Stoic’s pedigree is clear and it’s a gorgeous-looking game. It might also only just be entering into Early Access, but there’s already a lot for budding Aces to get their sword into.</p>


<p>Towerborne’s character creation tool is excellent, which is all the more impressive when you’re likely to have a helmet on that stops you seeing your character’s face most of the time. The Facial Features setting is particularly expansive, offering a batch of freckles, birthmarks, pigmentations and other details, just about stopping short of being able to place specific moles. There’s a vast array of hairstyles, noses and ears too, meaning you’ll be able to make a character that’s absolutely your own.</p>


<p>Combat starts out as you’d expect, with light and heavy attacks, launchers, and then special skills called Focus Attacks. However, each class has its own Class Mechanic that uses your Weapon Meter. You build Weapon Meter by dishing out damage or taking it. In the case of the shield-toting Sentinel, your Class Mechanic allows you to block and parry enemy attacks.</p>
<p>Once through the tutorial you encounter the other available classes, from the explosive Warclub-wielding Pyroclast to the dual-blade toting Shadowstriker. You can change your class at any time, with each levelling up individually alongside an overarching character level, meaning you’re not tied into your earlier choices, and can concoct a blend of playstyles when buddying up with other players. That goes for your appearance too, so you can change things up whenever you feel the need.</p>
<p>You also gain an Umbra, an entity from the spirit realm that accompanies you in battle. They have their own special abilites and attacks that further add to your loadout, letting you customise your character that bit further, and being a cute reward for certain milestones in the world.</p>
<p>You can effectively combo attacks into one another and it all flows together really effectively. There’s obvious overtones of classic sword ‘em ups like Golden Axe and Guardian Heroes, but there’s much more depth to the combat system, giving you a variety of options and ways to tackle the gruesome creatures in front of you.</p>

<p>Grotesque they may be, but Towerborne is still a lovely-looking game, brimming with Ghibli-esque charm. The Belfry in particular, looks like something straight out of Howl’s Moving Castle, and it carries that sense of excitement and wonder that a social hub needs, playing host to blacksmiths, mission givers and training areas to continue to improve your skills.</p>
<p>This is where you set off on missions, and selecting the world map sees the Belfry at the centre, with a hexagonal grid overlayed across it. You expand your area of influence by completing missions in adjacent tiles, and as you move further across the map you come across boss characters which stand as a major challenge to overcome. There’s danger levels that will block you from going too far before you’re powerful enough – you have to beat a solo challenge to progress – but if you want, you can ramp up the difficulty of missions closer to the Belfry to keep the challenge up.</p>

<p>Towerborne is surprisingly tough. You have to be very aware of being overwhelmed by groups of enemies, learning to split them apart or tackle them as a group. You absolutely need to use all of your skills and abilities, dodging in particular proving immensely useful throughout. It feels more like Monster Hunter than I was expecting, and button-mashing just won’t be rewarded at all. There’s enough options available to you that it never feels one-note, and while its fundamentally an old-school framed adventure, it has the trappings of a modern RPG/multiplayer game with class progression, new skills and plenty of loot to deck your character out with.</p>
<p>Towerborne comes into its own when you play with others, with co-op for up to four players in both online and couch co-op. Thankfully, there’s a good bit of leeway and flexibility with how the overworld is structured, so that you can join and be carried along by higher-levelled players – helpful if you want to buff up a little used character class, as there’s no background uplift for any you’re not playing as – and any progress you make on the map together is fed back into each individual player’s progression. Given how you might all have set off in opposite directions on the map, this can reveal little puddles of tiles that might lure you to clear the fog of war in a new region.</p>

<p>Right now the online matchmaking doesn’t seem to draw anyone in that you aren’t friends with. I’m sure there’ll be the option soon though, and this is one of the few clear signs that the game is in Early Access, as you wistfully watch other players disappear off on missions from the Belfry that you’d have liked to join them for. Still, it’s great as a single player experience too, and slaying goblins soon cheers you up.</p>
<p>Towerborne is a lovely old-school treat, with gorgeous art, an interesting and exciting world, and chunky, enjoyable combat. Stoic has ambitious plans for this as an evolving game, with Seasons that will continue the story, add new regions to discover and enemies to battle, new abilities and more. I can’t wait to play more through Early Access and see how it grows from here.</p>

            <p>I could have described the multiplayer racing game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/faaast-penguin">Faaast Penguin</a> a lot of ways. It is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a> meets Snowboard Kids. It is Diddy Kong Racing but all the courses are water slides. It's Cool Runnings but there are 40 penguins instead of four Jamaicans. Okay, that last one is a bit of a stretch. But basically, yes, this brightly coloured free-to-play knockout racer feels like that one Super Mario 64 level where you <a href="https://youtu.be/S858wXaD2pk?feature=shared&amp;t=23">race the big penguin down a slide</a>, only this time there are a ton of other players trying to beat you to the secret shortcut. It's coming out next week.</p>

<p>Taking inspiration from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmPXJc7EuBs">squabbling ruthlessness</a> of real world penguins, players are encouraged to attack each other. By bouncing off your opponent's rubbery body you'll be launched into the air, gaining the height needed to reach some handy shortcuts. You'll also be able to activate a paraglider at some point (hello Mario Kart) and ride an Orca for a violent boost. "The outcome of the race remains uncertain until the very end!" say developers Historia. </p>
<p>You can play as a party of four, and there's crossplay with other platforms. I make the comparison to mass obstacle course knockout game Fall Guys mostly because these cartoonish flightless birds seem to have the same dinky, enthusiastic glee to them. That, and you can dress up your penguin in a bunch of different costumes, plus unlock emotes, which I'm guessing is the way this free-to-play racer aims to make money. </p>
<p>It comes out September 19th. "New courses and costumes will be added each season," say the developers, though it's not clear how long those seasons will last. They also add one last proviso: "An Epic Games account is required to play the game." An instant annoyance for some, I bet. But not a dealbreaker for me, I love penguins, and would never do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnOjolF0E3k">anything to harm them</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last night, the industry was shocked to learn the entire staff at indie video game publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> had resigned. This exodus followed after negotiations with Annapurna owner Megan Ellison met an impass.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">As Matt reported last night</a>, these departures caused "chaos" among Annapurna Interactive's game developer partners. An Annapurna spokesperson confirmed all existing games and projects will remain with the company, while new president Hector Sanchez reportedly told developers all contracts will be honoured and that all Annapurna Interactive staff will be replaced.</p>
<p>In the time since, many developers have taken to social media to assure their communities of the status of various projects tied to the publisher.</p>

<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> creator <a href="https://x.com/HelloCakebread/status/1834371275168653465">Davey Wreden</a> said the team working on his upcoming project Wanderstop is "100 percent okay", in a post on X.</p>
<p>"Nothing's gonna stop us from getting Wanderstop out the door very soon."</p>
<p>Wanderstop studio Ivy Road affirmed Wreden's post. Calling the resignations at Annapurna a "bump in the road" it hadn't anticipated, it wanted to make sure the community knew "the tea is still brewing, and we're still working hard on Wanderstop!"</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299460/Wanderstop/">Wanderstop</a> is described as a "a narrative-centric cosy game about change and tea", and is set to release "soon".</p>

<p>Matt Newell's Lushfoil Photography Sim also looks to be ok, with the team stating it can "assume at this stage" the publisher's change in circumstances will not impact the game's release.</p>
<p>"But this news is definitely a loss," Lushfoil Photography Sim's social media account posted. "The Annapurna Interactive team were great to work with and gave the project a lot of love."</p>
<p>We got a look at Lushfoil Photography Sim last year, during Annapurna Interactive's showcase. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blade-runner-2033-and-everything-else-from-annapurnas-latest-showcase">As Matt wrote at the time</a>, the upcoming release lives up to its name, arming players with a camera then setting them loose across stunning landscapes, from snowy mountaintops and misty glades to craggy beaches and rainy streets.</p>

<p>Thomas Puha from Control and Alan Wake's Remedy equally assured his followers that the recent change will not affect the studio's partnership with Annapurna, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-and-control-film-and-television-rights-acquired-by-annapurna">this deal was with the 'Pictures' arm of the company</a>.</p>
<p>"Many of you are reaching out about the news around Annapurna (sorry to see what is going on to all involved ) Interactive. Thank you for your care," Puha wrote. He furthered Remedy is self-publishing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a>.</p>

<p>Beethoven and Dinosaur's Mixtape - one of Annapurna Interactive's most high-profile games - is also ok. "Appreciate all those who reached out," the team wrote, before adding:  "Mixtape continues."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-artful-escape-developers-next-is-teen-drama-mixtape">Mixtape was revealed earlier this year</a>, introducing us to a coming-of-age action adventure game with a soundtrack featuring DEVO, Roxy Music, Lush, The Smashing Pumpkins, Iggy Pop, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, and more.</p>
<p>It is set to release in 2025.</p>

<p>Also still on Annapurna Interacitve's upcoming roster of games is No Code's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>. However, the developer is yet to make a comment on last night's news.</p>
<p>In a statement last night, Annapurna owner Megan Ellison said the company's "top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition".</p>
<p>Said Ellison: "We're committed to not only our existing slate of games but also expanding our presence in the interactive space as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, gaming, and theatre."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We're having a bit of an indie freebie morning, it seems. My humble contribution is 50/50, a downloadable or browser-based game which I suspect will fill some of you with the deepest aggravation. As the name suggests, it's about cutting things in half - specifically food items, such as fried eggs (easy enough) and candy canes (WTF). You draw a line down each object with your mouse, then click or hit space bar to perform a slice. Then, the game calculates a percentage.  If it's bang-on or very close to 50/50, you'll pass. If not, you'll have to start over. I know: this is how entire days are wasted. Sorry.</p><!--more-->
<p>Whomst amongst us has not known the surpassing irritation, the abiding frenzy of not <em>quite</em> cutting an item exactly in half in a video game? I have terrible memories of playing Metal Gear Revengeance and trying to bisect a guard and argh argh argh, NOT RIGHT NOT RIGHT. Sorry Desperado soldiers, let's take this from the top.</p>
<p>It's not your fault. Few video game control schemes and interfaces are precise enough for such feats of delicacy, which is why many games with object-slicing mechanics only pretend you've performed a perfect 50/50 cut (it also saves computational resources versus actually simulating an object's division). But even as the signpost or tree trunk or whatever parts under your blade you know, in your heart of hearts, that you have failed. The game isn't helping you, it's mocking you. I see you laughing at me, <a href="https://playfruitninja.com/">Fruit Ninja</a>.</p>
<p>Find <a href="https://theshelfman.itch.io/fiftyfifty">50/50 on Itch.io</a>. Little tip: you don't have to draw a line in one go while playing 50/50 - you can fill in the cut square by square. Thanks to <a href="https://warpdoor.com/2024/09/11/50-50/">Warpdoor</a> for passing this on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
