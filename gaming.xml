</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ubisoft says it has postponed several of its "biggest productions" currently in development in order to grant them more time in the oven, after previously delaying <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> in order to provide further polish. 
</p>
<p>
Exactly which games these are was not named by Ubisoft during its financial results broadcast today, though in an investor call listened to by Eurogamer, Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot suggested the impacted titles came from the publisher's top five brands - Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, Rainbow Six, The Division and Ghost Recon.
</p>
<p>
Guillemot said Shadows' delay had been a "good decision to deliver a really strong quality" and that the delayed projects would now launch beyond the current financial year ending 31st March 2026, in either the following year ending March 2027, or the year after ending March 2028.
</p>
<p>
"After a review of our pipeline, we have decided to provide additional development time to some of our biggest productions in order to create the best conditions for success," Guillemot said today in a statement. "As a consequence, FY2026-27 and FY2027-28 will see significant content coming from our largest brands."
</p>
<p>
What's coming this year then? Ubisoft lists Anno 117: Pax Romana, its long-delayed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake, Rainbow Six Mobile and The Division spin-off Resurgence, as well as "other titles" to be announced at a later stage. Assassin's Creed Shadows will get is first major expansion later this year, while Rainbow Six Siege gets its big X update in June. (There's no mention at all of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2.)
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, Ubisoft has commented further on Assassin's Creed Shadows' launch, its plans for a new subsidary backed by Chinese publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, and ongoing push to cut costs and headcount.
</p>
<p>
The company's latest financial results show it earned a "slightly below objective" €1.85bn (£1.56m) for the year ending 31st March, a miss it blamed on "lower than expected partnerships, notably due to a timing impact". 
</p>
<p>
Of course, Ubisoft's biggest launch of the year was Assassin's Creed Shadows, which finally arrived in March after a notable delay from last year. Ubisoft avoided providing a new sales figure for the game today, though said its financial performance "reaffirms the strength and resilience" of the brand.
</p>
<p>
As previously announced, Shadows had the second-highest day one sales revenue for the series - behind the lockdown-era launch of Valhalla. Today, Ubisoft said Shadows had now recorded 160m gameplay hours across all players to date. How many players? Ubisoft isn't saying, and hasn't provided a fresh figure since the game passed 3 million players a week after launch.
</p>
<p>
The Assassin's Creed brand as a whole had "around 30 million unique players" for the fourth consecutive year, Ubisoft said, the same as Rainbow Six. Ubisoft's third pillar, Far Cry, had "around 20 million" meanwhile.
</p>
<p>
On Ubisoft's continued mission to cut costs - and employees - the company said it had succeeded in trimming €200m from its fixed costs ahead of time, with a lowered headcount now at 17,782 people. That's a decrease of 3000 people from September 2022, due to layoffs and reduced recruitment.
</p>
<p>
"This year has been a challenging one for Ubisoft, with mixed dynamics across our portfolio, amid intense industry competition," Guillemot continued. "Despite these headwinds, Ubisoft managed to deliver positive free cash flow generation over the fiscal year, reflecting the discipline applied across the Group.
</p>
<p>
"Aware of the challenges ahead, we took decisive steps to continue strengthening the company's future," Guillemot continued. "The launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows was a defining moment. It reaffirmed the power of the Assassin's Creed brand, with a highly favorable community response from long-time fans and new players alike. We also completed our initial cost savings program ahead of schedule. We are committed to going further, with additional savings of at least €100m over the next two years to drive structural efficiencies and reinforce the foundations of our organisation."
</p>
<p>
Further details of Ubisoft's plan to launch a new subsidiary with Tencent that will house the company's biggest three brands - Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six and Far Cry - will be laid out later this year, Ubisoft said. 
</p>
<p>
That said, Ubisoft said today that this new group will focus on "improving the quality of narrative-driven solo experiences", "expanding live service offerings with richer multiplayer features and more frequent content updates", and targeting "underpenetrated markets such as mobile and China".
</p>
<p>
And in other news, Ubisoft's film and television division has announced a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/riders-republic">Riders Republic</a> movie, with Bad Boys for Life directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah signed up to work on the project.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sour-patch-kids-ranked.1189278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sour-patch-kids-flavor-rankings<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Three years ago, Sonic (the drive-in fast food restaurant, not the blue hedgehog) started selling Sour Patch Kids ice cream floats — a sour watermelon-flavored slushie, soft serve vanilla ice cream, and sprinkles of chopped up Sour Patch Kids on top. Sonic itself sucks, but the Sour Patch Kids float is perfect. I’ve been chasing the pure happiness I felt after my first sip for years.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve loved Sour Patch Kids for a long time, but the float kicked that into overdrive. I actively started seeking out new varieties and flavored items, something to fill the hole the Sour Patch Kids float left in my heart. The bad news is that nothing has ever come close. The good news is that I still got to eat a lot of Sour Patch Kids. Most are good. Some were awful.</p><p>Through years of research, this is where I’ve landed:</p><ol><li><span>Sonic’s Sour Patch Kids ice cream float</span></li><li><span>Lemonade Fest</span></li><li><span>Original Sour Patch Kids (from the Mexico factory, which I think are denser and more delicious)</span></li><li><span>Ghost’s Sour Patch Kids electrolyte powder</span></li><li><span>Peach&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Heads (the heads are a different flavor from the body)</span></li><li><span>Watermelon</span></li><li><span>Sour Patch Kids Glow Ups (they have glow in the dark confetti and are strawberry watermelon flavored)</span></li><li><span>Trident’s Sour Patch Kids gum</span></li><li><span>Big Sour Patch Kids</span></li><li><span>Strawberry&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Grape&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Apple&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Tropical&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Sour Patch Kids Oreos</span></li><li><span>Cola&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Original Sour Patch Kids (when they are too soft)</span></li></ol><p>And if we’re ranking the original flavors:</p><ol><li><span>Red Raspberry</span></li><li><span>Blue Raspberry</span></li><li><span>Lemon</span></li><li><span>Lime</span></li><li><span>Orange</span></li></ol><p>I’m also convinced that Sour Patch Kids quality varies heavily depending on where the candy is made. I have not done the research to determine which factory I like the best, but Sour Patch Kids can be downright awful or life-changing. Mexico <em>typically</em> has the best texture; bonus points if they’re a little stale. There are a bunch of varieties of the candies that I haven’t tried yet, but one tormets me: Sour Patch Kids Gamerz. I can’t really tell if the flavors are different, but they are gamer-shaped and, unfortunately, only available in Australia.</p><p>The last thing is that a new sour candy has actually overtaken Sour Patch Kids as my number one: the AirHeads Xtremes Rainbow Berry Sour Belts. Please note, though, that the AirHeads Xtremes Rainbow Berry Sour <em>Bites</em> are absolute trash.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hbo-max-warner"><h3>HBO, Which Was Always HBO, Is HBO Again</h3></a><p>If I owned HBO I would just tell everyone I owned HBO, but I guess I'm built different</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/thunderbolts-marvel-avengers-cube-escape-room"><h3>Thunderbolts* Could Have Been Marvel’s Cube</h3></a><p>It could have been an escape room movie starring Florence Pugh, but we got New Avengers instead

Maybe months. When you finally have some free time again, download all the updates you missed, and boot up the game once more, you realize you have no idea what you were doing or why.

Eventually you give up and just go scroll TikTok for an hour. </p><p>I have no data to back this up, by it certainly feels like this experience is becoming more and more prevalent. In part, that’s because games are getting way more complex than they were in the PS1 or even the Xbox 360 days.

The main character would forget information and abilities the longer you stay away from the game. They might not know their role in the story, or even how to fire a gun. Abandon the game for long enough and the character wouldn’t be able to move at all. “Players would have to take a week off work or school to play it,” Kojima said. </p><p>As many have pointed out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/IGN/status/1922630747497677243/quotes&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/IGN/status/1922630747497677243/quotes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this is just real life for lots of us now</a></span>. Most modern games now essentially have a “forgetting mode” on by default, though some attempt to remedy the issue by providing optional recaps on what players were recently doing, or ongoing tutorials they can easily return to if they forget how to play. Often the friction remains, however. I can’t even imagine how bad it would be if my character was just as lost as I was. We’d be the gaming equivalent of lotus eaters, idly listening to the ambient soundtrack while the clock ticked by. </p><p>It’s hardly the first time Kojima has wanted to mess around with the real-world passage of time inside of one of his games. He explained in the latest podcast that he had thought of making Sam Porter’s hair grow in <em>Death Stranding 2</em> when players are logged off, but didn’t want to make a “big star” like Norman Reedus “look uncool.” Fans of <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>, meanwhile, will recall the fight with sniper The End. It’s a tough encounter players can completely bypass if they just wait several days in the real world until the enemy dies of old age. It’ll be interesting to see how it’s captured in the <em>Delta</em> remake coming this summer. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The studio is warning against issues with fake merch sales around him, but also teasing an official plush Esquie that's in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1922603248415908078" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a> from the official Expedition 33 account, Sandfall Interactive said it has seen a number of "suspicious" websites pop up selling Esquie plushies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To be clear: any third-party websites selling Esquie plushies are NOT officially licensed," the studio said. "Many of them are using AI-generated artwork to advertise, and we strongly recommend against purchasing from these sources. They could be scams."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To balance out the wheee with the whooo though, as Esquie might say, Sandfall confirms it is looking into making official Esquie plushies, and wants to get them out as soon as it can. "In the meantime, please be patient — and don’t get scammed!" the studio said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who have played the game probably get why an Esquie plushie might be in high demand. If you haven't gone on Expedition 33 yet, Esquie is a giant helper you meet in Act 1 of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 who becomes both a traveling companion and overworld travel method. He's got the same vibe as Big Hero 6's Baymax.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that in mind, it's easy to see how an Esquie plush might garner some interest, so it's good to know Sandfall is working on an official solution. A cursory search on Google pulled up both an unofficial site, and a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kh8sug/esquie_plush_scam/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">few threads</a> asking about Esquie plush peddlers. If you want the real thing from Sandfall and Kepler, you'll have to wait a bit. No news on whether the real-life plushie will also be filled with wine, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-patch-123-is-a-big-one-nerfs-maelles-game-breaking-stendahl-build">Sandfall Interactive released patch 1.2.3</a> for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, addressing some balance tweaks around Maelle's Stendhal ability.

A second category of players might find the perceived time sink to be too enormous and simply play something else instead.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FBC: Firebreak – Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>FBC aims to be a game that people can pick up and play in short bursts, at a modest price point ($40). The game is also included in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-may-2025/1100-6531161/" data-ref-id="1100-6531161">PlayStation Plus</a> from day one, which in theory should help it reach a potentially larger audience.</p><p>"The game is made by middle-aged dads for middle-aged dads," Remedy's Anssi Hyytiäinen told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/with-fbc-firebreak-remedy-says-its-made-a-control-shooter-for-dads/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>. "That was something that we talked about a lot. We wanted to make the game easy to pick up and throw yourself in there and have fun with your friends."</p><p>Kayatta, meanwhile, said FBC's session lengths were deliberately designed to be played in as little as five minutes. Even for a completionist, the game might take 30 or 40 hours to play as opposed to "thousands of hours."</p><p>"So we're not like Monster Hunter for sure. And that's been conscious decision also in that this we don't want it to be like almost predatory design practices of trying to suck all of your time out of your life," he said.</p><p>Kayatta told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fomo-has-infected-modern-games-says-remedy-director-of-fbc-firebreak" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that FOMO design concepts have "infected a lot of modern games," and that Remedy intentionally tried to reduce FOMO with FBC.</p><p>On the subject of FOMO, former Call of Duty veteran developer Mark Rubin recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-cod-dev-laments-the-series-leaning-so-heavily-into-fomo/1100-6531275/" data-ref-id="1100-6531275">Activision is resorting to manipulation tactics</a>, including FOMO, to encourage people to play Call of Duty.</p><p>FBC releases on June 17 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Ubisoft describes the movie as “poised to be an electrifying action movie, delivering non-stop thrills, humor, and spectacular stunts on the snowy slopes of the Alps."</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bD0HSMRtxMM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bD0HSMRtxMM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>So far, that’s all Ubisoft has revealed about the Riders Republic movie, which is based on the 2021 game of the same name that more than 10 million people have played. Players can do all kinds of extreme sports in the game, including biking, snowboarding, skiing, wingsuit flying, and more. Given the movie’s logline features the snowy slopes of the Alps, it seems the film will be centered on winter sports.</p><p>While waiting to learn more about the movie, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/riders-republic/riders-republic-review-a-missed-opportunity"><em>Game Informer’s</em> Riders Republic review</a>.</p><p>Are you excited about a Riders Republic movie?

            <p>Sony has revealed the next round of additions to its PS Plus Catalogue for subscribers, which will be added on 20th May.</p>
<p>The following games will be available later this month for Premium and Extra subscribers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sand Land | PS4, PS5</li>
<li>Soul Hackers 2 | PS5</li>
<li>Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted - Full Time Edition | PS4, PS5</li>
<li>Battlefield 5 | PS4</li>
<li>STALKER: Legends of the Zone Trilogy | PS4, PS5</li>
<li>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising | PS4, PS5</li>
<li>Humankind | PS4, PS5</li>
<li>Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life | PS5</li>
<li>Gloomhaven Mercenaries Edition | PS4, PS5</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Premium subscribers will get access to PS2 classic Battle Engine Aquila on PS4 and PS5.</p>
<p>Action-RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sand-land">Sand Land</a> was released last year and features designs from Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama - this was his last game before he passed away. He <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-ball-creator-akira-toriyama-gives-posthumous-praise-for-sand-land-game">posthumously praised the game</a> in a statement shared after his death: "I haven't watched through all of the gameplay yet," he said. "However, it greatly expands the worldview of the original manga with many new exciting elements. It is high-quality as a stand alone game and I can tell it is a highly satisfying action-RPG game!"</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-stalker-trilogy-getting-an-enhanced-edition-upgrade-on-ps5-series-xs-and-pc">GSC Game World announced a free Enhanced Edition upgrade for Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy</a>, which combines the first three games in the series. It includes a visual upgrade and other improvements, but it's unclear if PS Plus subscribers will have access following its inclusion here in the subscription.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Soul Hackers 2 is a 2022 RPG from Persona-maker Atlus that, confusingly, is the fifth installment in the Devil Summoner series, which is part of the Megami Tensei franchise. If you like anime RPGs, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/granblue-fantasy-versus">Granblue Fantasy Versus</a>: Rising is probably also worth a shot, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/story-of-seasons-a-wonderful-life">Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life</a> is a more relaxed farming experience.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Are you excited to play any of these? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These Catalogue games are in addition to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-your-playstation-plus-games-for-may">free monthly games also available this month</a> to those on the Essential tier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ark: Survival Ascended | PS5</li>
<li>Balatro | PS5, PS4</li>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun | PS5, PS4</li>
</ul>
<p>New additions mean some games will likely be leaving the service this month too, we'll update once we know more.</p>
<p>More details on this month's games can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/14/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-may-sand-land-soul-hackers-2-five-nights-at-freddys-help-wanted-battlefield-v-and-more/">PlayStation Blog</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/666867/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-canceled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Square Enix has announced that it is cancelling the mobile spinoff <em>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link</em>. In <a href="https://www.kingdomhearts.com/missinglink/">a statement on the game’s website</a>, Square Enix apologized to fans who were anticipating the game. The announcement also mentioned that Square was still hard at work on <em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em> perhaps to allay fears that this cancellation might indicate problems for other games in the sprawling Disney video game series.</p><p><em>Kingdom Hearts: Missing-Link</em> <a href="http://v/">was announced in 2022 alongside <em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em></a><em>.</em> It was billed as a mobile action game that made use of GPS technology to give players the ability to “travel the world without stepping outside,” according to one trailer. However, apparently that goal was a bit too lofty as Square Enix wrote, “We determined that it would be difficult for us to offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time, leading us to the decision to cancel development.”</p><p>Square Enix’s statement provided insight as to the reason for a game’s cancellation – something most game studios do not often offer. And while making any game is a miracle, making a successful live-service game is like asking for lightning to strike the head of a pin in a forest. After all, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">how</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312584/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-refunds">many</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317407/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-final-season-offline-mode">live-service games</a> (some of them <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/foamstars-season-pass-ends-with-ironically-titled-party-goes-on">even made by Square Enix itself</a>) were released only to die shortly thereafter while the concurrent player counts for <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, and <em>Call of Duty</em> remain largely unmoved. So it’s a rare and refreshing bit of honesty, especially in an industry as opaque as game development, that Square Enix was willing to name the reason for cancelling <em>Missing-Link</em> and I hope more studios follow suit in the future. </p><p>But it’s not all bad news for Square Enix. As reported by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/square-enix-and-tbs-television-announce-collaboration-to-develop-original-ip-game"><em>Gematsu</em></a>, Square has also started a new partnership with the Tokyo Broadcasting System Television. Known as TBS, it’s a Japanese TV and media company which produced <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/shopping/article/takeshis-castle-reboot-amazon-prime-17048691.php"><em>Takeshi’s Castle</em></a> – an internationally popular physical competition show known in the US as <em>Most Extreme Elimination Challenge</em> or <em>MXC</em>. TBS started its own games division in 2023 and with Square Enix, the two companies will work on a new gaming property.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' first "special collaboration" will be a crossover with survival horror game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>, set to arrive on 27th May. 
</p>
<p>
"Step into The Fog," reads a post on social media by the Assassin's Creed account this afternoon. "A new Dead by Daylight quest begins. Slip through the shadows. Survive the ordeal."
</p>
<p>
An accompanying teaser video shows Naoe and Yasuke resting by a campfire, while a figure with glowing red flames around their arms and feet faces them. Exact details on what the crossover will contain are presumably set to arrive at a later date.
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-features-regular-new-story-missions-parkour-updates-new-game-plus">Assassin's Creed publisher Ubisoft revealed that Shadows would get multiple "special collaboration" updates as part of its free post-launch content roadmap</a>. 
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Today's announcement appears to put a date on Shadows' next big update, in which this first collaboration is included. Other additions expected on 27th May include improvements to the game's photo mode and additional flashy parkour moves.
</p>
<p>
This update will then be followed by at least one further update in June, where a second free story mission will be added. This will feature a new ally that can come hang out at your homebase. June's update is also set to feature new difficulty options, and the ability to wear headgear in cutscenes (a highly requested feature by fans).
</p>
<p>
Beyond June, Ubisoft has said it has plans to add a New Game Plus Mode, additional story missions, and more "special collaborations". 
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Assassin's Creed has provided optional post-launch content crossing over with other games, of course. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-assassins-creed-origins-will-get-a-chocobo-horse">Final Fantasy's Chocobo turned up in Assassin's Creed Origins</a>, while multiple Assassin's Creed heroes have themselves crossed over into the world of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Assassin's Creed Shadows honours the beauty of feudal Japan," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>, "even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists."

Fun fact: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/12/23673475/warner-bros-discovery-max-new-name-hbo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/12/23673475/warner-bros-discovery-max-new-name-hbo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Back in 2023</a></span>, after dropping HBO from the brand, the reason given was because they wanted people to not assume it was just premium adult content. Anyway, here’s some corpo blabble that will make you roll your eyes so hard they might fall out of your head. </p><p>“Returning the HBO brand into HBO Max will further drive the service forward and amplify the uniqueness that subscribers can expect from the offering. It is also a testament to WBD’s willingness to keep boldly iterating its strategy and approach—leaning heavily on consumer data and insights—to best position itself for success.”</p><p>Ahh, yes, what a bold strategy! Taking a name that was popular, recognized, liked, and successful, and tossing it into the bin because you completed a big merger and suddenly had new execs wanting to shake things up and be a part of the process. Then, after that new name flopped and everyone mostly igorned it anyway, you sneak back out to the garbage, clean up the old name, and bring it back with a big press release that touts how HBO is a brand connected to quality and prestige. Makes you wonder why you ditched it to begin with? </p><p>Now, let’s all think about how much money was spent on this stupid process and how the richest people in the world running these companies aren’t good at their jobs. Welcome back, HBO Max. You shouldn’t have been killed in the first place. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I am told, by just about every single person in my life, that I should be using a mechanical keyboard, with removable switches, clickity-clackity sounds, and probably enough neon lighting to open a nightclub. I do not. I use a Microsoft MultiMedia Keyboard 1.0A, with a blob of Blu-Tac over the Num Lock LED, and I have done so for as long as I can remember. And as of today, I’m down to my last one. When this one goes, that’s it. I’m done.</p><figure id="" data-id="e919d42bb401a06493cea7a3fded7e08" data-recommend-id="image://e919d42bb401a06493cea7a3fded7e08" data-format="jpg" data-width="967" data-height="544" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dead keyboard, lying on its belly on a towel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A dead keyboard, lying on its belly on a towel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->John Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e919d42bb401a06493cea7a3fded7e08" data-recommend-id="image://e919d42bb401a06493cea7a3fded7e08" data-format="jpg" data-width="967" data-height="544" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dead keyboard, lying on its belly on a towel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’m not ashamed, and you’re not going to make me ashamed. The Microsoft MultiMedia Keyboard 1.0A is the best keyboard ever made. First created in 1997, its keys press with a whisper-quiet “shddd” and that is perfection. Yes, it has the most ludicrous array of “media” buttons across the top in a fancy arch, and no, I’ve never pressed one of them once in the twenty-ish years I’ve been using this keyboard. And no, this isn’t the “Natural” ergonomic version, it’s the regular-shaped one. I’m not a sicko.</p><p>I have had friends and co-workers react with genuine horror upon hearing of my use of this device. To not be part of the mechanical cult is, apparently, shun-worthy, and I accept that you too, reader, are now thinking even less of me. But worry not, for of the pile of six of these keyboards I bought when I heard they were no longer going to be manufactured, the one I’ve attached via its PS/2 cord to my PC today is my last. And after this one dies, I feel like retirement is my only option.</p><p>You know those authors who say that they write their books out long-hand, using the fountain pen they inherited from their great-great grandmother, and then some poor lackey has to type them up for the publisher? Or the writers who insist on using a 1930s Royal P typewriter, because they’re incapable of composing their prose on anything else? That’s me. Pretentious, dumbass me. The magic’s not in my heart, it’s in the Microsoft MultiMedia 1.0A.</p><p>(Look, I know, there’s controversy here that I’m not addressing. The official Microsoft data sheet for the keyboard calls it a “1.0a,” but the device itself says “1.0A,” and I won’t be budged from that capitalization. Sorry, you’ll just have to be offended.)</p><p>This is the keyboard on which I’ve composed my greatest works. It was on these squidgy keys that I wrote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/videogame-article-1847125006?_gl=1*ikyk4d*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcyMzIxNjAkbzU4JGcwJHQxNzQ3MjMyMTYwJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/videogame-article-1847125006?_gl=1*ikyk4d*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcyMzIxNjAkbzU4JGcwJHQxNzQ3MjMyMTYwJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">this extraordinary piece of games journalism</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/project-freezercube-part-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/project-freezercube-part-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chronicled my art</a></span>.</p><p>Hell, this is the keyboard I’ve used for&nbsp;all my most beloved games, from <em>Dragon Age: Origins </em>to <em>Prey</em>, <em>Half-Life 2</em> to <em>City of Heroes</em>. It’s the keyboard on which I finished <em>Dishonored 2</em>, and the means by which I conquered <em>Titanfall 2</em>. I’m far better at <em>Fortnite</em> on these keys than I am on my Xbox. This is how I spent those billions of hours in <em>Skyrim</em>. This keyboard is vital to my gaming life!</p><p>Over the years, I’ve been through so many makes of PCs, mice, monitors and speakers, but the keyboard has always remained the same. For years, I had to use a USB adaptor to plug the PS/2 cable in, although right now (because fate knows best) my current PC actually has a classic purple port right on the motherboard. I have literally no idea why. Surely there’s no one else this stupid?</p><figure id="" data-id="f5a2623becea03076327bdf1913928c4" data-recommend-id="image://f5a2623becea03076327bdf1913928c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1042" data-height="587" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A new keyboard in its cardboard box." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A new keyboard in its cardboard box." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->John Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5a2623becea03076327bdf1913928c4" data-recommend-id="image://f5a2623becea03076327bdf1913928c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1042" data-height="587" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A new keyboard in its cardboard box." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But it feels right! Maybe you have a favorite make of running shoes that you insist on buying, because everything else makes your feet feel funny. (You should try barefoot shoes though, trust me.) Perhaps there’s a cushion you put on the driver’s seat of every car? A favorite pillow without which going to sleep is significantly harder? That’s my 1.0A. It feels exactly the right shape under my fingers, the keys are perfectly spaced apart for my hands, and the wrist rest clips on the front in a way that makes all other keyboards feel like a form of gentle torture.</p><p>Time is certainly not on my side. Despite the mysterious PS/2 port, Windows doesn’t like this keyboard very much any more. The first thing I do each time I crack open a new one (usually because either the one I’m using has become as clickity-clackity as your ghastly mechanical setup, or because—as with today—I’ve murdered the last one with liquid) is fix the crummy delay when holding down a single key. Except, in the ten minutes I spent looking before I started writing this, I have been unable to find the key delay settings in Windows! They’re gone! I just misspelt “They’re” and when I held down Backspace to fix it, it took a near interminable half a second to begin clearing the mistake. I’m searching on Google for a solution, and most of the results are, “Are you OK? Do you need anything?”</p><figure id="" data-id="e5a829273329b1a945225e2f2c0f82b8" data-recommend-id="image://e5a829273329b1a945225e2f2c0f82b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1128" data-height="634" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The new keyboard in all its glory, complete with Blu-Tac over the light." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The new keyboard in all its glory, complete with Blu-Tac over the light." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->John Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e5a829273329b1a945225e2f2c0f82b8" data-recommend-id="image://e5a829273329b1a945225e2f2c0f82b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1128" data-height="634" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The new keyboard in all its glory, complete with Blu-Tac over the light." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“So just buy a new one,” you might say, before realizing that it’ll only encourage me to keep working. Oh, poor sweet fool, if only it were that simple. When these things were new, they cost like $20. They were so gloriously cheap. When I bought that batch of six in 2013, it cost me $40 (plus $25 shipping!). That’s the greatest bargain of my life. Less than $11 a keyboard, and they’ve kept me going for 12 beautiful years. But right now, when I look on eBay, I’m finding <em>used</em> ones for $90! <em>USED! </em>(And to make matters worse, it’s listed as “Vintage.” It’s not fucking vintage! It’s as old as <em>Fight Club</em>. That is not a vintage film.)</p><p>In the last couple of years, when looking to find more back-ups, I’ve never seen a new one on sale for less than $100, which is ludicrous. Today, however, the best price for a new, unused version I’ve found <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/235994418826&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/235994418826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is £32</a></span> ($43) and maybe I have to pay that? What’s that—a quarter of the cheapest mechanical keyboard you’d consider buying? <em>Outrageous</em>. Is my career worth this much?</p><p>OK, fine, I just bought it, alongside a second one I found for $20 that claims to be unused, but I’m suspicious. And with that, I’ve bought <em>all</em> the “new” 1.0As available on UK eBay. (PayPal was so suspicious of this activity that on buying the second one it sent alerts to my phone to make sure my account hadn’t been hacked by a deranged, 150-year-old criminal.) I refuse to believe there aren’t Microsoft warehouses filled with forgotten pallets of these things, lurking in a dark corner behind the crates holding Arks of the Covenant. Honestly, at this point I should be part of some ambassador program, appointed by Microsoft to herald the greatest moment in the company’s history, before it got distracted all over again by being evil.</p><p>And I still don’t care what you think. It’s so lovely to be on a brand new one of these lovely keyboards, the keys especially thuddy, the gaps between them not containing concerning amounts of fluff, and the insides entirely free of coffee and soda. I just need to figure out how to let it let me delete my mistakes more quickly, and I’m a happy boy. Until they’re all gone, that is, although I somewhat suspect that’ll be more than the universe can take, and everything else will go with it.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The latest partnership between McDonald's and Pokémon has launched here in the UK, with a focus on Dragon-type creatures and a return of special Pokémon cards. 
</p>
<p>
A charming animation advertising the fast food promotion shows the silhouette of Dragonite soaring over a city in the Pokémon world, before landing at a McDonald's restaurant. 
</p>
<p>
Is this canon confirmation that McDonald's now exists in the Pokémon world? Perhaps this is the latest mobile branch to roll out, like the one that followed a certain US president to China? Answers to these questions are not forthcoming.

<p>
What can be said for certain, though, is that each Happy Meal includes a handful of Pokémon cards, which have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mcdonalds-uk-happy-meal-pokemon-card-promotion-begins-in-august">historically proven very popular</a> - to the extent that some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/not-even-mcdonalds-pokemon-happy-meals-are-safe-from-scalpers">fans (and scalpers) have bought up huge amounts of stock</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mcdonalds-to-limit-pokemon-happy-meal-toy-purchases-in-uk">prompting some outlets to restrict purchases</a>.
</p>
<p>
Pokémon cards in this latest Dragon-type wave include Charizard, Pikachu, Jigglypuff, Quagsire, Hatenna, and Eevee (none of whom are Dragon-type), as well as Dragonite, Rayquaza, Drampa, Hydreigon, Roaring Moon, Miraidon, Koraidon and Dragapult (which all are).
</p>
<p>
The campaign was previously available in the US earlier this year, and is available now in the UK until 17th June - while stocks last.
