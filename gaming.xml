            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-debuts-new-harry-potter-quidditch-champions-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Warner Bros. Games released a new Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions trailer. This trailer gives those excited for the game an exclusive look into the gameplay, specifically the PvP mode, the customization, skill trees, the various Broom upgrades, Career mode and much more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions - Official Launch Gameplay Walkthrough Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EMJpa5uyugw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The trailer is just over five minutes, giving players glimpses into everything they could possibly need to know about the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-pre-orders-available-now/">Harry Potter game</a>. For those who prefer a solo experience, the career mode starts at the Weasley Burrow in the Garden Cup, where you'll get to face off against familiar faces from the iconic franchise while fully customizing your character to look however you want them to.</p>
<p>You get to represent one of the great three wizarding schools, Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, Durmstrung Institute, or Hogwarts School of Wizardry at the Triwizard Schools Quidditch Cup. If you are successful in your competitions, you'll be able to go on to the ultimate challenge of competing at the Quidditch World Cup.</p>
<p>Compared to other games that are out, the abilities and customization you can unlock in Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions are purely through in-game progression, and none of it can be bought with real-life currency. To unlock new abilities and customization, players will have to work to get skill points that can allow them to access special moves and broom upgrades. The broom upgrades allow players to move faster, gain more agility, and more to help them become a Quidditch champion.</p>
<p>For those who are excited about the PvP element of the game, you can choose your role, which can be either a Chaser, Keeper, Beater, or Seeker, much like the traditional roles that are shown in the movies. While you can choose the role you control, you also have to control an additional Chaser as well.</p>
<p>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions<a href="https://www.quidditchchampions.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> releases on September 3, 2024</a> for the digital editions, which will be available across PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S and PC. For those who want the game's physical edition, you'll have to wait until November 8, 2024. Additionally, the Nintendo Switch version of the game will be released some time during the holiday season, but there isn't a specific set date for it yet.</p>
<p>For those who may be on the fence about purchasing Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, the game will be available to PlayStation Plus members at no additional cost from September 3 through September 30, 2024. Those playing it via PlayStation Plus will also get an additional redeemable cosmetic they can use in-game.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-top-5-improvements-in-the-massive-update-that-introduced-hunt-showdown-1896</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-top-5-improvements-in-the-massive-update-that-introduced-hunt-showdown-1896.967677/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-top-5-improvements-in-the-massive-update-that-introduced-hunt-showdown-1896<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It’s a new era, with better performance and visuals, new content, and more.</h2></div><section><p>The extraction first-person shooter Hunt: Showdown has been going strong for five years and has gotten dozens of patches and updates, but none as big as the one that launched recently. It’s such a significant upgrade that the game itself got a new name — Hunt: Showdown 1896.</p><p>If you’re not familiar with Hunt: Showdown, it’s a multiplayer shooter on PC and console that mixes the supernatural with dark realism. It’s a PvPvE extraction shooter that puts you in the shoes of a bounty hunter. In order to claim your bounties, you need to venture across large maps, kill supernatural creatures, and fend off your fellow hunters to survive long enough to reach the extraction point.</p><p>The game’s recent update might have changed the name, but it’s not a sequel or standalone expansion. So if you purchased the original game, you already have access to Hunt: Showdown 1896 for no additional cost. All you have to do is download the update, and you’ll get upgrades to virtually every part of the gameplay experience. Let’s get into specifically what those improvements are.</p><h2><strong>A New Engine</strong></h2><p>It all starts with the game’s move to CryEngine 5.11. That makes all the rest of the upgrades possible, raising the level of what the dev team at Crytek can accomplish across the board. In addition to improving things like performance and visual fidelity, the new engine will also allow Crytek to make future updates and react to community feedback faster. The central gameplay loop won’t significantly change, but the upgrades will give players on all platforms a more immersive experience.</p><h2><strong>Improved Console Performance</strong></h2><p>Speaking of platforms, the update moves Hunt: Showdown 1896 into the current generation of consoles. It now runs natively on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, and while that means it’s no longer playable on PS4 or Xbox One, it also isn’t held back by the technological limitations of those consoles. It now runs at 60 fps and in HDR on all consoles, with faster loading times and more responsive input, providing smoother gameplay.</p><h2><strong>Better Lighting and Visuals</strong></h2><p>On all platforms, the upgraded engine has allowed devs to improve visual fidelity, including textures, lighting, and animations. With richer blacks and higher quality lighting, interior locations look more realistic and added visibility means more details to spot. Character models have also been improved, while flowing water looks more crisp and realistic. These details may seem small on their own, but they add up to create a more immersive experience.</p><h2><strong>Audio Upgrade</strong></h2><p>The game’s audio mix in general has been fine tuned to provide more clarity and sound definition. The update also adds support for new spatial audio options, such as Dolby Atmos. If you like to play with headphones, you’ll also have access to 3D audio. PC and Xbox players will benefit from Microsoft Sonic for headphones, while PS5 players will get Tempest 3D audio compatibility.</p><h2><strong>New Content</strong></h2><p>While the previous improvements refined what was already there, a new era wouldn’t be complete without brand-new content that really mixes things up. Hunt: Showdown 1896 has that in spades. Up until now, the game has exclusively taken place in the swamps of Louisiana. But the new update features a one-year time skip and a shift in setting to the Colorado Rocky Mountains. </p><p>The new map, Mammon’s Gulch, focuses on verticality, with mountains stretching aboveground and mines burrowing below. It provides unique sight lines and attack angles, adding another strategic layer to gameplay. And if you’re a longtime player and fan of older maps, don’t worry, they’ll be returning in the coming months after getting revamps of their own.</p><p>Mammon Gulch isn’t the only addition. There’s also a new wild target called the Hellborn, as well as an event called Scorched Earth that sees new terrors spill out of fiery oil wells and underground mines.</p><p>The latest update is full of improvements and new content, but it’s just the start of a new era. Crytek will continue to update and fine tune the experience, as they have been for the past five years. Whether you’re a veteran or a newcomer, there’s never been a better time to dive in. Hunt: Showdown 1896 is available for download now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Happy hunting!<br>

But, for some reason, most of the games I’ve been waiting for a good deal on are at their lowest prices ahead of Labor Day weekend. In fact, I'm seeing better Switch deals now than anything I could find during Prime Day earlier this year. If you’re like me and have been waiting to pick up Tears of the Kingdom or the new Mario Kart, now might be the time to go for it. </p><h2>Best Zelda Deals I've Seen This Year</h2><div id="206635" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="eb923770-6acc-4837-b4dc-bffa03159e7f"><p><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3></p></div><div catalogid="eb923770-6acc-4837-b4dc-bffa03159e7f" id="206636"><div id="206636" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h3></p></div><p>Before <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a> drops in September, Walmart has cut prices on the two most recent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-zelda-games-on-nintendo-switch">Zelda games on Switch</a>. Last year's Tears of the Kingdom is at a lower price than it’s <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B097B2YWFX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ever been on Amazon</a>. BotW and TotK were both released to critical acclaim (IGN gave them both 10/10), and it's never been more affordable to explore open-world Hyrule. </p><h2>(Super) Discounts on Mario Games</h2></div><div catalogid="eb923770-6acc-4837-b4dc-bffa03159e7f" id="206630"><div id="206630" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</h3></p></div><p>Pretty much the full spread of modern <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-mario-games-on-nintendo-switch">Mario games for Switch</a> is on sale at one retailer or another. My pick of the bunch is the beloved co-op platformer, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, but Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Super Mario Maker 2, and Mario Party Superstars are all discounted during Walmart's Labor Day sale. If you’re more interested in the other Super Bro., you can get $9 off this year’s Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD. We’ve also found a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-rpg-game-for-nintendo-switch-drops-to-32-at-woot">Woot deal on Super Mario RPG</a>.</p><div data-cy="catalog-view-trigger"><div><p><h3>Super Mario Maker 2</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Mario Party Superstars</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</h3></p></div></div><h2>Animal Crossing: New Horizons Is $10 Off in Rare Sale</h2></div><div catalogid="eb923770-6acc-4837-b4dc-bffa03159e7f" id="206637"><div id="206637" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</h3></p></div><p>The Animal Crossing series is a pillar of the cozy gaming community, but New Horizons is one of those first-party Nintendo titles that almost never goes on sale. In fact, it hasn’t been on sale on Amazon <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B07SL6ZXBL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">since 2022</a>. So $10 off might not seem like the biggest steal, but it’s probably the best AC:NH deal we’ll see this year. If you’ve been wanting to start collecting bugs, decorating your island, and most importantly, paying your dues to Tom Nook, now’s the time. </p><h2>Get 5 Five Night's at Freddy's Games for Under $20</h2></div><div catalogid="eb923770-6acc-4837-b4dc-bffa03159e7f" id="206641"><div id="206641" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Five Nights at Freddy's: The Core Collection</h3></p><div><p>Includes 1-4 + Sister Location</p></div></div><p>If you're looking to add something with a darker tone to your handheld, this collection of the first Five Night's at Freddy's games is 50% off. Start off with trying to survive the night at your new security job, but progressively discover a number of Freddy Fazbear locations while unravelling the secrets of the animatronics they still house. </p><h2>More Discounts on Nintendo Switch Games</h2><p>Plenty more Switch games are on sale going into Labor Day weekend, and I’ll be adding any more deals I find to this list. </p><div data-cy="catalog-view-trigger"><div><p><h3>Super Smash Bros.

Nintendo hasn't confirmed anything about the console, including whether it will backwards-compatible with original Switch games. That said, there's long list of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-upcoming-nintendo-switch-games">Switch games coming out</a> that I personally am still excited for. If you don't have a Switch already, maybe consider holding off for the upgrade (thought <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-lite-deals-labor-day-2024">Walmart has some great deals on Switch consoles</a> for those who can't resist). Otherwise, the current Nintendo console supports great games that will always be worth playing. </p></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 29, 2024 5:00 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you’d rather not wait and see, the standard <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> is currently receiving a rare discount at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BFJWCYTL/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, where you can buy it with blue and red Joy-Con controllers for $267 ($33 off). </p><p>If you like to game on the go, the base Switch remains an excellent handheld, one that can last up to six hours on a single charge. It’s still limited to 32GB of built-in storage — unlike the larger, seven-inch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">Switch OLED</a> — but its built-in microSD card slot means you can always invest in more external storage. That’ll come in handy because the Nintendo eShop is home to a vast library of both first- and third-party titles, particularly in its swan-song era, with many exciting games in the pipeline. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180615/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-nintendo-direct"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180608/mario-and-luigi-brothership-release-date-nintendo-direct"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi:</em></a><em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180608/mario-and-luigi-brothership-release-date-nintendo-direct"><em>Brothership</em></a> are both launching in the fall, for example, along with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24180977/a-new-mario-party-game-is-here-to-ruin-your-family-relationships"><em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em></a>, a remastered <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/27/24229056/mysims-nintendo-switch-remastered-launch"><em>MySims</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/27/24228945/nintendo-indie-partner-direct-news-trailers">much more</a>.</p><p>Granted, the Switch 2 is rumored to feature an eight-inch screen, but the standard model’s 6.2-inch display is still spacious enough in most instances. Besides, if you crave more screen real estate, you can always play it on your TV while in docked mode, unlike the Switch Lite.</p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Read our original Nintendo Switch review</a>.</h5></p><div><p>The Nintendo Switch offers a 6.2-inch touchscreen, three play styles, and a Wi-Fi connection, thus enabling multiplayer gaming (with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription).</p></div><p>If you’re looking for a piece of home decor to spruce up your home or office, few gadgets are as unique as <strong>Samsung’s new Music Frame</strong>.

You can hang the speaker on your wall or rest it on the included stand and even customize it with an <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/business/televisions-home-theater/television-home-theater-accessories/audio-accessories/music-frame-white-bezel-vg-scfd60wtbza/">optional white bezel</a> ($59.99).</p><p>But what’s really neat is that the Music Frame also functions as a wired Bluetooth / Wi-Fi speaker, which is one of the reasons the gadget was one of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24034953/ces-2024-verge-awards-best-tv-laptop-monitor-gaming-car">our favorite audio products from CES 2024</a>.

                <p>Five years ago, Remedy Entertainment made a splash with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/control-review-an-action-packed-paranormal-portal/1900-6417278/" data-ref-id="1900-6417278">Control</a>, but the developer had to go through 505 Games to publish the game. Now, Remedy has struck a deal with Annapurna that will not only bring Control 2 to fruition, but it may also lead to films and TV shows based on the games and Remedy's other signature title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alan-wake-remastered-review/1900-6260843/" data-ref-id="1900-6260843">Alan Wake</a>.</p><p>As announced on <a href="https://www.remedygames.com/article/remedy-and-annapurna-announce-a-strategic-cooperation-agreement" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Remedy's official site</a>, the company's new pact with Annapurna will allow it to co-finance and self-publish Control 2. Remedy also promised that the deal means the company "is able to make Control 2 exactly the game we want it to be, while we now also have an incredible partner to extend our IPs to other mediums." The developer reiterated that Control 2 is in the works, but no further details were revealed.</p><p>As part of the announcement, Annapurna's president of Interactive and New Media, Hector Sanchez, shared his belief that Remedy's titles can go even further into other mediums.</p><p>"This deal with Remedy isn't just about adapting great games--it's about breaking new ground in how companies can collaborate," said Sanchez in a statement. "By backing Remedy's move toward self-publishing, we're putting our faith in their vision. We know from experience that Remedy is a first-class games development partner, and we're excited to share their work with an even wider audience by bringing the Control and Alan Wake universes to film, television and beyond."</p><p>At this stage, there's no word on when the potential Alan Wake or Control adaptations will go forward. Control 2 is currently without a release date, but the announcement reiterated that Remedy is also developing a slate of games beyond that title. Among the games that we know about are remakes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-2-hits-important-milestone-as-max-payne-1-and-2-remakes-go-into-full-production/1100-6525672/" data-ref-id="1100-6525672">Max Payne 1 &amp; 2</a>, as well as a multiplayer spin-off of Control that is codenamed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-2-is-still-a-ways-off-but-spin-off-codename-condor-is-getting-closer/1100-6523034/" data-ref-id="1100-6523034">Condor</a>.</p>

For example, <strong>beginning at $3, you can pick up the HD remaster of the first <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Resident Evil Revelations</em>, and the first episode of <em>Revelations 2</em>.</strong> The first title is obviously a classic that defined the survival horror genre, and gave us some of gaming’s most enduring characters in folks like Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, and Albert Wesker. Though remakes and remasters can be hit or miss, the <em>Resident Evil </em>series actually has one of the most sterling track records in this department, and it all more or less started with this game.<br></p><p>I’ve never gotten around to the <em>Revelations </em>sub-series, which curiously began on the Nintendo 3DS, but I remember hearing at the time that they were a refreshing return to the series’ roots. After some time, the <em>Resident Evil </em>games started to become more synonymous with outrageous plotlines and non-stop action than horror, and while some welcomed the evolution, others missed what made them love the series in the first place. <em>Revelations </em>was a bid to win back that hardcore audience that missed slower, scarier games, and the success of them seemed to pave the way for the mainline games to return to survival horror as well.<br></p><p>Speaking of the screwy path that the <em>Resident Evil </em>franchise eventually found itself on, the next tier of the Humble Bundle packages in a ton more games. <strong>For $7, you can pick up everything I already mentioned, as well the critically beloved </strong><em><strong>Resident Evil 4</strong></em><strong>, its less acclaimed action-centric follow-ups, </strong><em><strong>Resident Evil 5 </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>6 </strong></em><strong>(and their respective DLCs), </strong><em><strong>Resident Evil 0, </strong></em><strong>and all of </strong><em><strong>Revelations 2</strong></em><strong>, which was released piecemeal</strong>. The legacy of <em>4</em> is well-established (and it has a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891">pretty great remake</a></span> from last year) but both <em>5 </em>and <em>6</em> have divided fans for years. Some are in favor of the gung-ho, balls-to-the-wall action of these increasingly ludicrous games, but for others, this is where the series really jumped the shark. I think if you are a person capable of shutting your brain off and being a part of really dumb sequences of events, such as punching a huge boulder, then you can’t really go wrong checking them out.</p><p><em>Resident Evil 0 </em>and <em>Revelations 2</em>, like the first <em>Revelations </em>game, are slower, and far more typical, installments in the franchise, though neither is particularly beloved. If you just want to round out the bases, though, it can’t hurt to pick them up.</p><p><strong>For $20, you get all of the aforementioned titles, <em>Resident Evil 7 biohazard </em>and its DLCs,<em> </em></strong><br><strong>and the recent remakes of <em>Resident Evil 2 </em>and <em>3</em>. </strong>This widely beloved trio of games have more or less ushered the franchise into a renaissance since the late 2010s. The first brought the mainline games back to survival horror but also shook up the formula by putting the action in first-person. This romp through a decrepit manor in the Louisiana bayou was creepy as fuck, and introduced Ethan Winters, the corny catch-phrase spewing protagonist of the game and its immediate sequel. While it’s definitely a little clunky, <em>RE7 </em>is the most atmospheric and unsettling of the modern games, in case you’re looking for the most frightening prospects.</p><p><em>Resident Evil 2 </em>and <em>3</em>, meanwhile, are currently held up as the gold standard of remakes across the industry. They both maintain the spirit of their original iterations while modernizing the controls and visuals in a from-the-ground-up reimagining. Even if people are down on <em>3</em>—which I believe mostly has to do with the fact that people <em>never </em>really liked it as much as <em>2</em> to begin with—you’ve got two absolute bangers here that Capcom managed to develop in tandem and release in back-to-back years.</p><p>Finally, the biggest bundle is the previously mentioned <strong>$30 one that brings everything, including the most recent mainline entry, </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333"><em><strong>Resident Evil Village</strong></em></a></span><strong>, as well as its DLC.</strong> <em>Village</em> maintains the first-person perspective of its horror-focused predecessor, but shifts gears once again. Stylistically, it’s like a first-person <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, and plays a lot of the same hits, like opening in a creepy village in the middle of nowhere, but it also takes some even wilder swings in due time. It is also the game that gave us Lady Dimitrescu, otherwise known as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/you-dont-want-resident-evil-villages-tall-vampire-lady-1846710943&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/you-dont-want-resident-evil-villages-tall-vampire-lady-1846710943">big woman that the internet wanted to step on them</a></span>.</p><p>Even if the ending of the game dragged on a little too long for me, I’m pretty confident that <em>Village </em>is actually my favorite <em>RE </em>game, since it pretty successfully melds all of the disparate things the series has been over the years into something that’s <em>mostly </em>cohesive and, importantly, ludicrously fun.</p><p>For as little as half of a retail game, you can play <em>the </em>most legendary survival horror series in games. Considering that Capcom unceremoniously announced a sequel earlier this year, now’s as good a time as any to jump on in. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-has-exclusivity-deal-with-playstation-its-claimed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>We now seem to know exactly why Black Myth: Wukong isn’t on Xbox consoles yet. According to Forbes reporter Paul Tassi, Black Myth: Wukong has a console exclusivity deal with PlayStation.</p>



<p>“A source with knowledge of the situation has told me that Black Myth: Wukong is not currently on Xbox because of an exclusivity deal, and is not delayed because of any sort of technical issue,” <a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1829211594108350790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>.</p>



<p>Just one week ago <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/an-update-on-black-myth-wukongs-xbox-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tassi reported</a> that the game wasn’t on Xbox due to a “Tech Issue”. This comes based on the statements made from developer Game Science. More on that below.</p>



<p>“The bad news is that once again, Xbox seems to have blundered into a Baldur’s Gate 3 situation,” he said at the time.</p>



<p>In his latest report, however, Tassi references the conflicting statements between Microsoft and Game Science. Game Science has gone on record stating that they were “currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version” to hit quality standards. There has been no mention from the studio of any sort of exclusivity deal with PlayStation. Microsoft, on the other hand, has said in multiple statements that it “can’t comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders”.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">from the start, the statements from Game Science and Microsoft conflicted with each other, with Game Science citing optimization while Microsoft cited "deals with other platform holders." <a href="https://t.co/47Up179ZWh">pic.twitter.com/47Up179ZWh</a></p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1829216520502948098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>For now, no such deal has been confirmed by either developer Game Science or Sony. Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony and Game Science for comment on the report. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article.</p>



<p>Since its release on PC and PlayStation 4, Black Myth: Wukong has sold over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million copies</a>. It’s also become the second-highest played game in Steam history when it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-player-count-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comes to concurrent users</a>. </p>



<p><strong>EDITOR’S NOTE: Paul Tassi has clarified that his original report was based on what Game Science said at the time, as mentioned above. He states that he believes his source regarding an exclusive deal for PlayStation.</strong> <strong>This article has been updated to reflect that.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/iconic-mmo-wizard101-to-be-released-on-console/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Wizard101 is one of the <a href="https://www.wizard101.com/?utm_source=%C3%9CberStrategist+PR+List+-+Leading+Gaming+and+Tech+News+%282023%29&amp;utm_campaign=71122f979a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_08_22_05_15_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-9e9ced9085-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most iconic MMOs</a> out there. It is set to be released on all console platforms, including PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. This release comes after its first release on PC in 2008, making the game a whopping 16 years old.</p>
<p>If you've wanted to get stuck into an <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-is-a-co-op-multiplayer-game-focused-on-mmo-like-dungeon-runs/">MMO</a> that takes you through a magical school with deckbuilding and strategic turn-based combat, Wizard101 is the way to go. There are over 20 magical worlds for players to explore, all with unique traits that make them memorable and special. You get to play as a student wizard, where you'll have to go on your journey, completing quests and meeting new people in bustling worlds full of active players. The game will also be fully voice-acted, giving each quest that personal touch.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you've been wanting to introduce your friends to this MMO but they are all on console, console users will share a server, allowing those on PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch to all play with each other via crossplay.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release of Wizard101 on console, they have released a short 26-second trailer to get dedicated players excited about finally being able to play the game on console, as well as players who don't have access to a PC being able to play it on console for the first time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wizard101 Official Console Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdH0cSINQlA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At the moment, there isn't a set release date for when Wizard101 will be available on console, and KingsIsle Entertainment has yet to announce it. While Wizard101 has been around for a while, it was only added to Steam in 2018, with it being a much more efficient way of running the game.</p>
<p>Even though the game is relatively old, there are still millions of players getting stuck into Wizard101 regularly, and the game is home to over a thousand hours of questing to be done. This doesn't include the battles players can participate in, where they can participate in 1v1 duels or team-based battles to try and get a space on the leaderboard.</p>
<p>This MMO is still home to weekly rewards, praising players for their dedication to the game and rewarding them for their time and effort spent completing challenges set out for them in-game, with the events of Wizard101 rotating weekly to provide as much variety as possible for the players.</p>

<p>The details surrounding crossplay in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 have been announced a week before the game’s launch.</p>



<p>Developer Saber Interactive published their <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/68-august-community-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">August Community Update</a> on Thursday, and with it came everything you need to know about how crossplay will work in Space Marine 2.</p>







<p>From launch day, Space Marine 2 will support “full crossplay” between PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Steam, and Epic Games Store (EGS).</p>



<p>“You will be able to play the Campaign and PvE modes without any restriction,” the developers say. </p>



<p>When it comes to the PvP mode Eternal War, Saber Interactive says that things have to be split for “fairness and balancing purposes.</p>



<p>“[Crossplay] will be split between PC players in one pool (Steam &amp; EGS) and console players in the other one (PlayStation 5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S),” they said.</p>



<p>Lastly, players will have the ability to disable crossplay entirely should they only want to play with those on the same platform.</p>



<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 releases on September 6.</p>

The most concrete part of the news is that Annapurna — which also has an indie game publishing arm — will be funding half of the development budget for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/11/23453049/control-2-sequel-remedy-entertainment">the previously announced <em>Control 2</em></a>.</p><p>Beyond that, there’s the potential for Annapurna to create film and TV adaptations of both <em>Control</em> and <em>Alan Wake</em>, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">just got a long-awaited sequel last year</a>.

<p>Corsair has unveiled its new Ultrawide curved monitor, the XENEON 34 QD-OLED. </p>



<p>Retailing <a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/monitors/CM-9030005-NA/xeneon-34wqhd240-c-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-34-inch-3440-x-1440-wqhd-1800r-curvature-240hz-0-03ms-gtg-displayhdr-true-black-400-1-5m1-contrast-ratio-cm-9030005-na" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for $1,199.99</a>, this new monitor has a 34-inch WQHD screen size featuring an 1800R Curve Quantum Dot OLED Display. It also has a 0.03ms response time with a 240Hz refresh rate.</p>



<p>“QD-OLED enhances response times and refresh rates, making the XENEON 34 QD-OLED an ideal partner for high-speed gameplay, whether it’s racing, FPS, or action games,” Corsair says. “With a refresh rate of up to 240Hz combined with an impressive response time of up to 0.03ms (GtG), the image on screen reacts to inputs faster than you can perceive.”</p>



<p>The monitor also includes support for both Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium.</p>



<p>The rear of the monitor features a number of I/O ports. Those include two HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, USB-C 3.1 DP ALT with 65W PD, USB-C 3.1 DP Upstream with 15W PD, four USB-A 3.1 with KVM, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. As far as on-screen display is concerned, that is activated by placing your hand near the bottom of the monitor.</p>



<p>Lastly, the monitor has burn-in prevention features like “an image retention refresh after eight hours of use and an Orbit feature that shifts the entire image by one pixel every three minutes”. </p>

Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios said on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/3657534571513526776" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> its game totalled "roughly 2,000,000 words" at launch, meaning Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 could be the new champ.</p><p>"Yesterday, we were counting with our lead designer Prokop Jirsa how much we actually wrote for KCD2," Vávra said. "So guess how big the script is? 2,200,000 words! Or 11,000 typical screenwriting pages. That's a 100 scripts for a typical two-hour movie, or about 25 average novels."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Some further context sees Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 come in at almost four times the length of famously long novel War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy, which sits at 587,287 words long, and all the A Song of Ice and Fire books combined, which total 1,736,054 words from A Game of Thrones to A Dance With Dragons.</p><p>All those words seemingly come at a cost, however, as Warhorse recently announced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-delayed-to-february-2025">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has been delayed</a> from 2024 to February 11, 2025.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/17/kingdom-come-deliverance-review">In IGN's 8/10 review of the original</a>, we said: "Kingdom Come: Deliverance is an RPG that does the medieval era right with a refreshingly small-scale story and strong realistic combat."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
