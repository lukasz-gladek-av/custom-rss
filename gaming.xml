<figure><a title="Shadow Labyrinth - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157410/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Pac-Man</strong>, as iconic as he is, has felt like he’s been in a bit of a rut in recent years. The rather delightful <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pac-man_99">PAC-MAN 99</a> aside, there’s an undeniable sense that the series has simply been unable to break away from its core concepts. So, regardless of what gimmicks are chucked in to justify a new entry — Battle Royale in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pac-man_mega_tunnel_battle_chomp_champs">Chomp Champs</a>, endless runner in <strong>Pac-Man 256</strong>, co-op in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pac-man_championship_edition_2_plus">Championship Edition 2 Plus</a> — I often come away thinking, 'Yep, it’s definitely Pac-Man.' This might be enough for some, but more than 40 years after its arcade debut, many are hoping for a bit of a shake-up.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Shadow Labyrinth</a>. Developed at Bandai Namco Studios, this side-scrolling adventure is worlds apart from what you’ve likely come to expect from the pill-muncher. Set in a quiet, foreboding landscape with various biomes, the closest comparison that came to mind was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>. Indeed, Shadow Labyrinth takes many cues from Team Cherry’s masterpiece, including the precise way that currency scatters on the ground from fallen enemies, hot springs to recover health, an eccentric merchant lurking underground, and a stylish, almost hand-crafted art style.</p>
<figure><a title="Shadow Labyrinth - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157406/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet to call Shadow Labyrinth a straight-up Metroidvania would be <em>slightly</em> misleading. Yes, there are multiple areas with a few branching pathways, and you do have the ability to teleport to locations you’ve already visited, but it mostly feels like you’re being driven down a fairly linear path; pushed from checkpoint to checkpoint. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it’s just something to keep in mind. It has much in common with Hollow Knight, but that sense of being lost in a dense, complex world isn’t one of them.</p>
<p>You play as Swordsman No. 8, who at the start of the game discovers PUCK (an entirely unsubtle reference to Pac-Man’s original name, Puck-Man), a mysterious yellow orb who enlists No. 8 to accompany it on a mission. PUCK is — as well it should be — the star of the show, and while it is your companion throughout the game, its motivations and personality left me feeling somewhat uneasy. It’s very much a character laser-focused on its goal, and it doesn’t care who or what stands in its way.</p>
<p>And so, with the power to attack enemies granted, you set off on your adventure. At first, you have a basic three-hit combo at your disposal, but by defeating certain boss characters, PUCK can transform into a hideous beast and gobble them up, thus providing new abilities. You’ll gain an extra, more powerful hit to your combo, a parry move, the ability to dodge in mid-air, and more. It’s all pretty standard stuff, but there’s a good sense of progression as you slowly become more powerful throughout the game.</p>
<figure><a title="Shadow Labyrinth - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157411/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet the most interesting power is the ability to transform into GAIA, a ferocious mech that provides temporary invincibility while you eviscerate your enemies. It only lasts for about 30 seconds, so it’s best left for moments where you might feel outnumbered or overpowered. It’s particularly useful during boss fights, during which you can usually chip away about a quarter of a boss’ health meter while in GAIA form, provided you’re aggressive enough with your attacks.</p>
<p>GAIA can also gobble up the bodies of your fallen foes, even while you’re in standard Swordsman form. By clicking the right stick while standing in front of a body, a disembodied version will grab the body and shove it in its mouth while emitting the same sound that classic Pac-Man makes when eating a ghost. This does two things: firstly, it lets you build up more energy to unleash GAIA in its full form; and secondly, it grants you specific ingredients based on the enemy type. These ingredients can then be used to boost your abilities at certain save points.</p>

<p>So far, so very <em>not</em> Pac-Man, right? Well, there are moments in the game that feel a bit more familiar if you’re after a more traditional ghost-gobbling experience. Every now and then, you’ll come across blue surfaces that, in your regular Swordsman form, are inaccessible. Once you touch it, however, you’ll turn into PUCK and race across the surface, with your mouth opening and closing rapidly, just like the old-school games.</p>
<p>In this form, you can travel up vertical walls and even on ceilings, and PUCK will gobble up any collectible currency along the way, with the classic sound effect present and correct. You can also jump from different surfaces, and your attack in this form is a really neat circular motion with the sword. My only criticism of this mechanic is that it doesn’t show up half as much as it should – it’s really cool.</p>
<p>But then you’ve also got the hidden maze sections, too. Accessed via stone sculptures that almost look like gravestones, these provide the quintessential Pac-Man experience, albeit with PUCK’s specific new abilities. It’s a nice little throwback to the classic arcade approach for Pac-Man, and those who are not keen on Shadow Labyrinth’s new direction will find some comfort here.</p>

<p>Overall, however, the best way I can describe Shadow Labyrinth’s gameplay is 'good enough'. It’s perfectly serviceable and enjoyable, but there’s very little here that hasn’t been done elsewhere and better. The Hollow Knight comparison in particular is unavoidable and I have a hard time believing that it wasn't Bandai Namco's primary influence. You can understand why a team would want to borrow elements from such a stellar game, but goodness, it’s such a high bar, and Shadow Labyrinth unfortunately never manages to reach it.</p>
<p>That said, the environments are consistently enjoyable, with plenty to differentiate one biome from another. I particularly enjoyed the sci-fi-focused Giant Black Tower area, with music that almost reminded me of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> series – pretty wild stuff.</p>
<p>A lot of the same enemy types can crop up, though, almost to the point where I’d shake my head and exclaim, <em>“Really, you guys</em> again<em>?!”</em> The boss characters are a highlight, though, and often provide hefty challenges. I’d prefer the checkpoints to be a little more generous in these instances, but it’s not a major issue. Perhaps a simple ‘Retry’ option would be helpful in a future update.</p>

<p>Performance on Switch 2 is pretty decent for the most part, and anybody who buys the Switch 1 version can get a free upgrade on the newer console. Within the majority of major areas, you’re looking at a solid 60fps with strong image quality. Some areas, particularly those set outside, can stutter occasionally, but I didn’t find it to be distracting. Given the aesthetic and the overall lack of visual effects, I would have expected the frame rate to be consistent throughout, so it’s a little disappointing that it’s not. Still, like the gameplay itself, it’s <em>good enough.</em></p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you're intrigued by Shadow Labyrinth's fresh approach to Pac-Man, I recommend giving it a shot on Switch 2. It provides an intriguing narrative in a foreboding world with varied environments throughout, and PUCK proves to be a compelling character. The short bursts of Pac-Man-style gameplay help mix up the experience, and this is very welcome since the game never really delivers a 'wow' moment. Much of it has been done better elsewhere, but this is nevertheless a promising new direction for an ageing franchise; one I hope to see continue in the future.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a> has released its latest report on the top 10 games for June 2025 by both monthly active users (MAU) and revenue. In its report for <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">May 2025</a>, Elden Ring Nightreign was the top story, but this time around, it's Dune all June, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-patch-notes-deep-desert-changes/">Dune: Awakening</a> breaks into the top-5 games by revenue, and Sloclap's arcade football game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">Rematch</a> is able to eek into the top-10.</p>



<p>Nightreign hasn't entirely fallen off the map, to be fair, it's just a few places behind where it sat in May, as Dune: Awakening took Nightreign's place as the number five game in the list of top 10 games by revenue. Rematch, for its part, made it to number nine, while everything else in the top 10 rankings mostly stayed the same, save for Valorant jumping up six places to make it into the top 10 at number seven.</p>



<p>Zooming out a bit more into the top-20, other notable entries are Toby Fox's Deltarune, which snuck in at number 20, and the highly anticipated release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, which arrived at the tail-end of June and made it into the top-20 games by revenue in 15th place. </p>



<p>Dead By Daylight was another notable entry in the top-20 games by revenue, in part because it was one of the few games to hold a top-20 spot in both revenue and MAUs for June 2025. It jumped 17 places from May to make it into the top-20 games by revenue for June, and 13 places to do the same in MAUs, both driven by a new collaboration with Five Nights at Freddy's.</p>



<p>The MAU list for June 2025 was less malleable than the revenue list, as very little changed regarding the top 10. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, Rematch, and Splitgate 2 were the only games not in the top-20 for MAUs in May 2025 that were able to jump into the top-20 for June.</p>



<p>Here's Newzoo's full report and overview for June 2025 for the top games on PC and consoles: </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Shiro Games has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>roadmap covering the rest of 2025, and there's plenty on the way this year, including DLC that will let you build and manage your very own fiefdom.</p>

<p>Back in February, Shiro revealed its roadmap for&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wartales-roadmap-2025" rel="nofollow">for the first half of the year</a>, and now, it's time to discover what lies in wait throughout the remainder of 2025, starting with a major community update this very month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1527950/view/537733876590575648" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam, the update, which is set to arrive at the end of July, will bring new Tier 5 armor and weaponry, as well as a new notification log, 20 new traits, and 40 new confessions, some of which are "unique confessions" that have been "written specifically for unique characters you may recruit".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wartales-roadmap-2025-battle.jpg?itok=HciknQD_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wartales-roadmap-2025-battle.jpg?itok=IaTQxBdk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>is getting plenty of new stuff throughout the rest of 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>Following that update, a major new DLC pack is arriving in September, and as Shiro says, it's "time to claim your own fief". You'll be able to build and expand said fief, rule over your subjects, and construct districts, all while tending to the needs of your population.</p>

<p>Doing so will involve not only making decisions about the lives of your subjects, but also producing and procuring resources for the healthy maintenance of your lands, all of which will shape the "identity of your fief", as Shiro puts it.</p>

<p>In future, two different kinds of DLC will be produced by Shiro, namely Expansions and Contracts. The former are large-scale additions that bring new regions, storylines, or factions to the game, while the latter are slightly smaller addons with new systems or "modular content that enhances replayability".</p>

<p>To that end, at some point in the fourth quarter of the year, a new&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>DLC pack will arrive that adds a new region and a new storyline, so under the new system, that'll be an Expansion rather than a Contract.</p>




<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1527950/Wartales/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/wartales/9nwq686jb33g" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/wartales-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

Doing so extends the normal cut off distance for raids—a little over the length of a football field—to allow players to join from farther away. </p><p>It’s a technique players have been talking about for years—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@pokemongohandbook/video/7371090844918517038&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pokemongohandbook/video/7371090844918517038" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here’s one how-to video on TikTok from May 2024</a></span>—but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1lxjm5y/just_got_this_message_on_discord_today/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1lxjm5y/just_got_this_message_on_discord_today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent Discord messages</a></span> warning players that the exploit violates <em>Pokémon Go</em>’s terms of service has stoked fears that they could soon be banned for having participated in what the game’s developers consider to be cheating. “We have been informed today that use of GPS drift to swap out raid passes is against TOS,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/shiny_kingt/status/1943732704920391889?s=46&amp;t=zQj7U0qugC7oe78CYR7CEQ&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawLl1QZleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETF6ZFRmQnZpZVVySDJ2NVZHAR60RxYFplRnGdA5LspA_s5RgeuhtkCPUWZA-X_h48a2OyYeDkrB5-0Y_Z2Waw_aem_U9NwmQ6IXC-DpFF6_oSTNQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/shiny_kingt/status/1943732704920391889?s=46&amp;t=zQj7U0qugC7oe78CYR7CEQ&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawLl1QZleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETF6ZFRmQnZpZVVySDJ2NVZHAR60RxYFplRnGdA5LspA_s5RgeuhtkCPUWZA-X_h48a2OyYeDkrB5-0Y_Z2Waw_aem_U9NwmQ6IXC-DpFF6_oSTNQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the messages</a></span> to fans read. “Niantic can track it and is going to start cracking down on it.

One reason could be related to Pokémon Go’s ongoing tug-of-war between getting players out in the world meeting one another IRL and letting them pay to sit back and enjoy the collectathon from the comfort of their air-conditioned apartment. Raid passes which cost roughly $1.50 each let players join special battles from afar. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1klo8gf/crown_clash_taken_over_thepokegohunter/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1klo8gf/crown_clash_taken_over_thepokegohunter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starting with the Crown Clash Take Over event in May</a></span>, players were allowed to begin using remote raid passes for Shadow raids as well, and Niantic also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1kltqbz/the_daily_remote_raid_limit_is_now_increased_to/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1kltqbz/the_daily_remote_raid_limit_is_now_increased_to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upped the number of remote raids players could do each day</a></span>. </p><p>Given how wonky GPS tracking can be in<em> Pokémon Go </em>to begin with, some players are now worried they’ll get unfairly flagged for cheating if their character accidentally gets bounced around the map. “My bathroom sometimes launches me across town, I checked where I was once and it was a place 15 minutes away from where I lived,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1lxjm5y/just_got_this_message_on_discord_today/?share_id=BmfzARQ9s9ntUEWdTePTE&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1lxjm5y/just_got_this_message_on_discord_today/?share_id=BmfzARQ9s9ntUEWdTePTE&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one player on the SylphRoad subreddit. “I’m a suburban player and will very often stop placed when I’m driving to play from my car, especially when it’s 90+ and humid out, and there are tons of errors when I have to restart the app to get it to register that I’m no longer driving or am in a new area from where I was when I minimized it and started driving,” complained another. <br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-fan-confusion-around-the-risks-of-using-a-well-known-pokemon-go-exploit-the-games-developer-responds-by-pointing-back-to-its-terms-of-service-which-lay-out-its-rules-on-cheating&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-fan-confusion-around-the-risks-of-using-a-well-known-pokemon-go-exploit-the-games-developer-responds-by-pointing-back-to-its-terms-of-service-which-lay-out-its-rules-on-cheating" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asked by <em>IGN</em></a></span> for confirmation of whether GPS drifting was considered cheating, the <em> Pokémon Go</em> team pointed to the cheating section of its TOS which states, “Using any techniques to alter or falsify a device’s location (for example through GPS spoofing).” As<em> IGN</em> points out, that section includes a ban on playing with multiple accounts as well, something that’s also been a part of the game for years without any apparent major crackdown. So, is there a ban wave coming for people trying to remote raid for free? Or are players getting freaked out about a years-old exploit for no apparent reason? For now at least, Niantic seems content to let those fears persist. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-remote-raid-chat-gps-drift-niantic-ban-1851786470]]></content:encoded>

It’s the catalyst behind translocation, the only technology that lets humanity bypass light-speed and stay connected across the stars. Every jump burns it. No Gold, no travel. No Houses, no civilization. You are a Loader: a human consciousness uploaded into an antigrav tank, engineered to be destroyed, recompiled, and sent back into the fight, wherever Gold is found, conflict follows. No legends. Just contracts, steel, and survival.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Fully Destructible Environments</strong> – The battlefield is your weapon. Players can blast through rocks, shatter walls, reshape dunes, or widen chokepoints, dynamically altering the flow of combat in real time. Cover is temporary, and no defense is permanent, demanding constant adaptation.</li><li><strong>Tactical 10-Versus-10 Arena Battles</strong> – Engage in intense 20-player matches where teams of Loaders vie for dominance. The objective is clear: eliminate the enemy or destroy their pylon—a jamming system hiding them from devastating orbital strikes. Protect your own pylon or face annihilation from above.</li><li><strong>Build Your Loadout, Define Your Role</strong> – Players can customize their antigrav tanks from the ground up. Choose from 5 distinct classes, each with unique movement, shield, and role types. Equip up to 4 active and 5 passive modules, alongside a unique splitter system, allowing for intricate, ever-evolving builds.</li><li><strong>Shields: Position Matters</strong> – Your Loader’s regenerating shields are critical, covering key angles. Any breach exposes your vulnerable hull. Strategic positioning, flanking maneuvers, and striking weak points are paramount for survival. Trading fire head-on is a losing proposition.</li><li><strong>Deliberate, Tactical Pacing</strong> – <em>Loaders</em> emphasizes momentum and calculated decisions over rapid-fire reflexes. With a high time-to-kill, inertial movement, and no respawns, every shot carries weight. Players must choose their angles, time their approach, and make tactical decisions before engaging, not after.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Ghost of Tsushima is celebrating its five-year anniversary today, July 17, 2025. Below, we revisit the juxtaposition between its revenge-soaked narrative and the calm, reflective moments of meditation.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Drenched in thick, burgundy-colored blood after tearing through dozens of enemy Mongol camps, I rode slowly through the Tsushima countryside searching for my next target. There was only one thing that would defer my thirst for revenge: a brief dip in a hot spring.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghost of Tsushima tells a complicated and deeply troubling narrative about revenge, possible avunculicide, and a warrior pushed to commit atrocities in order to protect the people he loves. The exploration of those themes gets more difficult with each passing mission as the Mongol invasion of Tsushima takes more and more--in terms of family, friends, and even his own home--from protagonist Jin Sakai.</p><p dir="ltr">The gameplay in Tsushima can be equally brutal, consisting of hour after hour of swords cutting through flesh, explosions ripping through homes, and innocent Japanese civilians laying dead on the ground. But Ghost of Tsushima offers pockets of respite in the form of brief segments, namely hot-spring soaks that increase Jin's health capacity and provide short bits of dialogue about the game's story. These moments not only slow the pace of the game down, but actively encourage the player to contemplate the themes of the story.</p><p dir="ltr">Many other action games follow a similar structure with their violent narratives--including other PlayStation titles The Last of Us and Uncharted--where the killing is relentless. But there are few games that offer similarly brutal themes in their story while attempting to give players the space to process it.</p><p dir="ltr">Jin Sakai lives a tragic life throughout the narrative of Ghost of Tsushima. Family members and friends die right in front of him and his living family turns on him after he uses brutal warfare tactics against the Mongols. One major story beat that resonated with me was how Lord Shimura--Jin's maternal uncle--could not accept his nephew's actions in the war. The rift between them can lead to a fatal clash of swords between the family members if the player chooses that route.</p><p dir="ltr">Open-world games structured like Ghost of Tsushima are sometimes hailed as "podcast games," where players can explore the open world and complete copy-and-pasted side missions while part of their attention is focused elsewhere. That's true for Sucker Punch's title, but that exploration does include a handful of moments that require little to no input from the player at all. In a world filled with multi-tasking and an intense focus on productivity--even in our leisure time--trying to slow the player down for a few moments is a design choice not seen often.</p><p dir="ltr">When I came across hot springs on my journey to explore all corners of Tsushima, I actively listened to what Jin pondered during his soak. I often wondered about what happened in the story and I never quite could decide whether I was completely on Jin or Lord Shimura's side when it came to matching the Mongols with their own brutal behavior. I don't think I would have thought about it if the game didn't let me stop for a few moments.</p><p dir="ltr">While these hot-spring moments are a unique element in a blockbuster like Tsushima, many other parts of the world are filled with generic fodder. Side missions involve the same steps of finding someone in peril, listening to their story, travelling to a new location, and then killing every enemy in sight. The other collectables--cosmetics, bamboo strikes, and platforming sections--were also steeped in monotony.</p><p dir="ltr">"One challenge that comes with making an open-world game is the repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again," said Sucker Punch art director Jason Connell in an interview about Ghost of Yotei with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/arts/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sequel-playstation.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes">The New York Times</a>. "We wanted to balance against that and find unique experiences."</p><p dir="ltr">Hot springs are exactly the type of unique experience that's ideal for a game with a narrative as troubling as the one in Ghost of Tsushima. One thing I was eager to learn more about when Ghost of Yotei was announced was how Sucker Punch would expand on its open-world structure and if it would include the hot springs and equally meditative features.</p><p dir="ltr">The Bellevue-based studio is bringing much from Tsushima into its new game, while promoting the idea of the "podcast game" by introducing the "Watanabe mode." The mode will play chill beats inspired by Shinichirō Watanabe in the background, giving players a built-in soundtrack that will make it that much easier to zone out and mesh with Yotei's gameplay while roaming around.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is the most open game we've ever made. One of the greatest joys is just getting lost. You let your curiosity guide you through the landscape," Fox said in an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-trailer-directors-playstation-weapons-1236375610/" rel="nofollow ">Variety</a>. "We view that as this holy moment that we want to uplift for players so that they can feel very present inside of Hokkaido, or Ezo, as it was called back when our game took place."</p><p dir="ltr">Luckily, hot springs will also be returning, according to footage shown in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgM6poO2JmY">State of Play Demo Deep Dive</a>. It'll give players more chances to sit and process their thoughts with another troubling tale about revenge.</p><p dir="ltr">Creating engaging side quests and unique moments like this in a massive open world is difficult. Creating an engaging open world is a massive undertaking. New quests that aim to connect the player with Japanese culture, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-is-getting-vegetable-foraging/1100-6532553/">vegetable foraging</a>, will hopefully set Yotei apart from Tsushima and offer other ways for the player to slow down.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghost of Tsushima gives future games the ideal blueprint for presenting controversial or violent stories within their narrative. It's important to give players an opportunity to grapple with what they experienced, even if it's only one small part of a massive game. Sometimes, less is more.</p>

            <p>A YouTuber may end up facing jail time due to reviewing handheld devices which on occasion come pre-loaded with old games.</p>
<p>The YouTuber in question is Francesco Salicini - aka Once Were Nerd - from Italy, who said customs enforcement officers from the Guardia di Finanza turned up with a search warrant back in April of this year, with the intent to investigate promotion of pirated copyrighted materials (thanks, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/once-were-nerd-youtuber-copyright-lawsuit-3577995/">Android Authority</a>). </p>
<p>Salicini is accused of having violated copyright law, mainly related to the "sponsorship" of consoles that can also be purchased with micro SD cards full of games.</p>

<p>Salicini said more than 30 consoles were "confiscated" from his collection, including ANBERNIC, Powkiddy, and TrimUI gaming handhelds. At this time, the authorities also took Salicini's phone, along with transcripts of his conversations with these gaming handheld makers. His phone was subsequently returned two months later, on 18th June.</p>
<p>While the YouTuber complied with the authorities as he did not believe he had done anything wrong, Salicini is presently accused of violating Article 171-ter of the <a href="https://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text/477668">Italian Copyright Law</a> - that is to say, the Law for the Protection of Copyright and Neighbouring Rights - which holds a maximum penalty of €15,000 (that's just shy of £12,000 here in the UK). Additionally, Salicini could face up to three years' jail time.</p>
<p>In a video uploaded by Salicini (see below), the creator spoke of his plight. He said Italian law enforcement isn't required to disclose what exactly the charges are, or even who has brought them, until the initial investigation is finished. After that time, a judge could then decide to either dismiss the case, or take it to trial.</p>

            <p>Roblox has today announced a suite of new safety features coming to the platform, including an AI used to estimate a teenager's age by taking a selfie.</p>
<p>Roblox, used primarily by children and teens, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-accused-of-being-unsafe-environment-for-children">long been criticised for its questionable safety measures</a>. Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">it was claimed Roblox reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation</a> in 2023. The company has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-adding-further-parental-controls-as-its-belated-push-to-improve-child-safety-continues">taken further steps to improve child safety</a> over the past year, though back in March co-founder and CEO David Baszucki said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/parents-worried-about-childrens-safety-shouldnt-let-them-play-roblox-company-boss-says">parents shouldn't let their kids play Roblox</a> if they're "not comfortable" about their safety. </p>
<p>Now, the company is advancing its "safety and civility vision" with the addition of four new features, as <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/07/advancing-safety-on-roblox-with-age-based-communication">outlined in a new blog</a>.</p>

<p>"Safety has always been foundational to everything we do at Roblox," the blog reads. "Our goal is to lead the world in safety and civility for online gaming. We've spent nearly two decades building sophisticated safety systems, which supports our mission of connecting a billion people every day with optimism and civility.</p>
<p>"We are dedicated to supporting experiences that are both deeply engaging and empowering for players of all ages, while continuously innovating how all users connect and interact. Today, we're taking a significant step forward and announcing an expansion of our safety platform."</p>
<p>The first feature is Trusted Connections. Friends will now be known as Connections, and users 13 and older will be able to specify Trusted Connections, intended to allow for more free communication with people they know. Users who are 13 to 17 can add each other, but can only add users who are 18+ through a QR scan or Contact Importer. All conversations remain proactively monitored by Roblox.</p>
<p>Trusted Connections requires age verification. For this, Roblox is rolling out Age Estimation as a prerequisite. Essentially, this is an AI that will estimate a user's age by analysing a video selfie "against a large and diverse dataset", which the company assures is "handled securely". If the tool identifies a user as under 13, or is unable to verify age, Trusted Connections will be inaccessible. Age verification can still be done with an ID - and in future, by parental consent. How easily this can be exploited remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Roblox is adding new privacy and well-being tools to "help teens set healthy boundaries". This includes online status controls, a do not disturb mode, and insights into screen-time.</p>
<p>Lastly, the parental controls for parents of users aged 13 and under will be extended globally to parents of teens too. Parents will be able to set up a linked Roblox account to gain visibility into a child's Trusted Connections, screen-time insights, and spending notifications - if a teen gives consent.</p>
<p>"Today's announcement marks an important step forward, as we build on our existing safety systems with investments in advanced machine learning with AI, content moderation, and comprehensive parental controls," the blog post concludes.</p>
<p>"The launch of Trusted Connections with Age Estimation, new privacy tools, and parental insights for parents of teens builds on our existing safety systems to deliver industry-leading, age-informed communication that redefines digital safety and civility."</p>
<p>On top of safety concerns for users, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-exploiting-young-game-developers-new-investigation-reports">Roblox has previously been accused of "exploiting" young game developers</a>, as per an investigation in 2021.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-introduces-new-safety-features-including-an-ai-to-estimate-a-teenagers-age-through-video-selfies]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Virtuos, the studio behind this year's&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster and the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>remake, is reportedly about to lay off hundreds of its employees.</p>

<p>According to a report by journalist <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gautoz.cool/post/3lu3ntewdrk2t" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gauthier Andres</a>, around 300 employees' jobs are at risk at Virtuos, constituting around 7% of the studio's overall workforce. These layoffs will mostly be concentrated in the Chinese branch of Virtuos, but employees in "many other areas" are at risk too, Andres says.</p>

<p>Supposedly, these employees are being laid off in the name of "competitiveness", or so Andres says a memo sent to employees a few weeks ago reads. These layoffs reportedly follow payrise freezes and bonus reductions at Virtuos in February.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remaster-virtuos-layoffs-archer.jpg?itok=oDsJPF8q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remaster-virtuos-layoffs-archer.jpg?itok=CC7XYAmD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Despite its success,&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>developer Virtuos has apparently been hit by layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>Andres also says that Virtuos employees have told him the company is ramping up its interest in generative AI; employees have reportedly received "basic but mandatory training" on AI in the last year.</p>

<p>According to Andres, Virtuos is "losing the trust" of many of its staff members, and while he doesn't directly tie that loss of morale to the threat of AI, it's hard not to draw a link between the two, especially when that's reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/king-ai-replacement-morale-layoffs" rel="nofollow">exactly what's happening at other studios</a>.</p>

<p>Virtuos' layoffs come as part of a wider industry layoff wave that has been going on for the past few years, with tens of thousands of industry employees losing their jobs, as well as major studios being closed down and huge projects being canceled.</p>

<p>This month alone, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">reportedly laid off around 9,000 of its employees</a>, and Xbox canceled projects in development at its subsidiary studios; both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Rare's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Everwild</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">The Initiative's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">Perfect Dark</a>&nbsp;</em>were shut down, and the latter studio closed its doors as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The dramatic dismissal of three senior developers at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> studio Unknown Worlds gets messier by the day. In a publicly filed lawsuit, the three fired heads of the studio have accused publishers Krafton of all sorts of dirty tactics, ploys, and shenanigans to purposefully delay the game until 2026, all in an intentional effort to avoid paying a maximum $250 million earnout bonus to the studio. </p>
<p>In one bizarre episode alleged in the lawsuit, Unknown Worlds co-founder Charlie Cleveland went to lunch with Krafton CEO, Kim Chang-han, who told him via translator that having to pay such an earnout would be "disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing" for the publisher. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"On May 20, 2025, Cleveland joined Kim (Krafton’s CEO) and some colleagues for lunch," a section of the lawsuit reads. "Kim said that if Unknown Worlds released the game on its planned timeline (meaning Krafton would have to pay the earnout), it could be disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing for Krafton.</p>
<p>"Krafton later asserted that Kim never made those statements," the lawsuit continues. "Instead, Krafton claimed Kim’s words had been incorrectly interpreted by the translators..." We have asked Krafton to clarify what Kim really said, if that is the case, but judging by all our other ignored questions I doubt we'll get a satisfactory answer.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Krafton</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The lunch took place at the height of an incredibly tense standoff between studio and publisher, just weeks before Cleveland <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">was sacked</a> along with fellow co-founder Max MacGuire and CEO Ted Gill. </p>
<p>Krafton accused the trio of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">abandoning their duties on the game</a>, giving this as the reason for their dismissal. But the lawsuit filed by Cleveland and co alleges that the publisher really shitcanned them to avoid paying the substantial earnout.</p>
<p>To give you some background, this bonus would only be gained if Unknown Worlds hit certain targets by the end of 2025. Most of it would have been paid to the three men, with 10% set aside for 40 other employees at the studio. "Beyond this guarantee," the lawsuit says, "the Founders planned to share even more of the earnout with their dedicated team".</p>
<p>With that much money on the line, a disagreement emerged between the leadership trio at Unknown Worlds, and the suits at Krafton. Cleveland and co wanted the game released - it would earn the studio (and themselves) that chunky bonus. Krafton wanted the game delayed - it would save them millions of dollars and (according to Cleveland at least) some embarrassment. From this point on, the trio allege, Krafton engaged in "desperate efforts" to delay the game and therefore avoid paying the earnout.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Krafton</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"Krafton engaged in a months-long campaign to delay Subnautica 2’s release," says the legal doc, posted <a href="https://x.com/Flayra/status/1945573686611743127">on social media by Cleveland</a> and reported by <a href="https://aftermath.site/unknown-worlds-lawsuit-subnautica-2">Aftermath</a>. "It pulled key marketing materials, refused to follow through with crucial partnerships, and reneged on long-standing commitments to handle important pre-launch tasks. Multiple Krafton employees themselves suggested that these moves were for the purpose of frustrating the earnout, despite the earnout agreement’s prohibition on taking actions for that purpose."</p>
<p>The lawsuit accuses Krafton of turning to all sorts of dirty tactics in an attempt to frustrate the game's impending release in that unspecified month of 2025. For example, Krafton allegedly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assigned an entirely new publishing team to the game, headed by an employee who didn't speak English. That team "delayed decisions and delivered incomplete work"</li>
<li>Issued an "internal stop work order" and "told all Krafton teams to stop all creative tasks related to Subnautica 2"</li>
<li>Ordered all US employees of Krafton previously in touch with Unknown Worlds to stop communicating with the studio</li>
<li>Cancelled work on trailers, advertising, and even a front page plan for PC Gamer magazine.</li>
<li>Cancelled localisation plans to translate the game to nine languages</li>
<li>Neglected to write up the terms of service agreements necessary for the game</li>
<li>Held a milestone meeting in May, and demanded that the game be delayed (this is possibly the meeting in which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-leak-is-authentic-say-publishers-who-benefit-the-most-from-that-leak">this "leaked" document</a> was shown)</li>
</ul>

<p>In another wild story, the lawsuit says that Krafton's own US-based team in El Segundo, California, warned one of the three ill-fated managers about Krafton's plans, saying the publisher had people "combing" through agreements looking for a loophole which would allow them to fire the three key managers. </p>
<p>"Upon their return [from a business trip to Korea], the El Segundo team—Krafton employees—reported to [Ted] Gill that Krafton’s leadership was not focused on a successful launch, but instead on how it could convince Unknown Worlds to delay the game.</p>
<p>"The El Segundo colleagues informed Gill that Krafton’s legal team was combing through the agreements looking for any opening to terminate the Founders if they proceeded with the planned release. The El Segundo colleagues told Gill it was clear that Krafton was aiming to avoid paying the earnout."</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Krafton</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As these obstruction efforts intensified, the trio allege that publishing chiefs at Krafton met with them and offered a lower earnout. But the trio declined, claiming the amount was not "anything close to what they deserved, and did not allow them to share the earnout with the full team."</p>
<p>Soon after, the three men received letters telling them they were fired. Steve Papoutsis, who was installed by Krafton to replace the three chiefs, allegedly said they were fired for their "intention to proceed with a premature release of Subnautica 2."</p>
<p>"The letters make clear that the Founders were terminated without cause," says the lawsuit, and this will likely be a key contention if the case does go to court without a settlement. Krafton have already said they terminated the three developers because those men were absent in their duties. Cleveland, for example, was accused of spending more time working on his nascent movie company than working on the subaquatic sequel. Although the trio are making counterarguments to this too.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit Cleveland suggests that Krafton's own CEO Kim Chang-han (the same man who would later allegedly talk of "embarrassing" circumstances over lunch) personally encouraged Cleveland to "develop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>’s 'franchise IP' with cross-media expansion beyond the game, into television or movies". The lawsuit claims that all parties agreed this "would become Cleveland’s focus". </p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Unknown Worlds</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The lawsuit also claims that Krafton gave the other two leadership members the go-ahead to take on broader roles that might, presumably, see them working a little less closely on the game and more on this "franchise IP" stuff.  </p>
<p>As for other employees, the lawsuit claims that in the runup to Subnautica 2's eventual release, "Gill was negotiating incentive bonuses for the many employees who were not guaranteed to receive earnout pay because they joined Unknown Worlds after Krafton’s acquisition."</p>
<p>The entire lawsuit is quite an angry blast of accusations. It is worth noting that key parts of the lawsuit are redacted. Important figures, such as the exact projected sales numbers of Subnautica 2, and the number of sales of previous games, are blacked out. So are some terms of the employment contracts between Krafton and Cleveland, MacGuire, and Gill. The exact formula that would calculate their earnout is redacted too. It's likely more of these details would come out if it reaches court without a settlement. </p>
<p>As part of the lawsuit's demands, the trio want to be restored to their roles at Unknown Worlds, and to be paid "damages in the amount [they] would have received in earnout payments" had Krafton not fired them all, plus "out-of-pocket loss, damages, and expenses in an amount to be determined at trial."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Krafton do not seem to be backing down. </p>
<p>"While we are disappointed that Charlie, Max, and Ted have filed a lawsuit seeking a huge payout, we look forward to defending ourselves in court," they told Aftermath in a statement. "[D]ecisions were made to ensure Subnautica 2 is the best possible game and lives up to fan expectations. Releasing the game prematurely with insufficient content, falling short of what fans expect in a sequel, would have both disappointed the players — who are at the heart of everything Krafton does — and damaged the reputations of both the Subnautica and Unknown Worlds brands."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paying-the-subnautica-2-team-their-promised-bonus-would-be-embarrassing-kraftons-ceo-allegedly-told-the-games-chief-over-lunch]]></content:encoded>

It’s hard to imagine a more dreadful mutilation of a wonderful story than all three laugh-out-loud terrible seasons of <em>Under The Dome. </em>Or the stupefying awfulness of 2017's small-screen version of <em>The Mist</em>, a show so bad you were always on the fog cloud’s side. And that’s before we even start thinking about all those 90s TV movies and miniseries—<em>The Stand</em>, anyone? But there’s always potential, as proven by the 2010-2015 run of Syfy’s <em>Haven</em>—a delightful and breezy mystery procedural barely based on novella <em>The Colorado Kid—</em>and 2021's <em>Chapelwaite</em>, in which Adrien Brody brooded his way through a melancholic horror based on <em>Jerusalem’s Lot</em>. And I’ll give any of them a fair chance, given all will be based on the deeply developed characters of King’s literary works.</p><p>Well, almost all. Because of all of King’s recent books, <em>The Institute—</em>the story of a hidden facility that kidnaps psychic kids and puts them through awful procedures—felt the most insubstantial. The author, now in his late 70s, is still capable of writing fresh, compelling, heart-capturing stories—as he keeps proving over and over with his recent muse, recurring character Holly Gibney. But <em>The Institute</em> was so slight, feeling like a compilation of Kingly tropes: the disillusioned cop, the magic child, the evil matriach. Part <em>Firestarter</em>, part <em>The Dead Zone</em>, it read to me <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stephen-king-the-institute-mgm-tv-series-trailer-1851784311&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stephen-king-the-institute-mgm-tv-series-trailer-1851784311">like the pilot episode of a TV series</a></span>. Whereas I normally come away from a Stephen King novel feeling a deep attachment to its cast, I finished that book without any great fondness for main characters Luke Ellis and Tim Jamieson.</p><figure id="" data-id="10bbabfddcdc95147edd78cec07282d4" data-recommend-id="image://10bbabfddcdc95147edd78cec07282d4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1828" data-height="1029" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tim chats to the cashier in a gas station." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tim chats to the cashier in a gas station." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->MGM+ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="10bbabfddcdc95147edd78cec07282d4" data-recommend-id="image://10bbabfddcdc95147edd78cec07282d4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1828" data-height="1029" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tim chats to the cashier in a gas station." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Which brings us to the new TV series. From MGM+ (previously Epix), the show has an eight-episode run, of which the first two are currently available to stream. MGM+ may not have even been on your radar as a subscription service worthy of your monthly tithe, unless you’ve already discovered <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/from-mgm-lost-tv-show-horror-mystery-1851659337&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/from-mgm-lost-tv-show-horror-mystery-1851659337">one of the best things on TV, <em>From</em></a></span>. But one show does not a streaming service make, and this year’s atrocious <em>Earth Abides</em> didn’t help. Clearly <em>The Institute </em>is partly an attempt to build on <em>From</em>’s foundations, given directorial duty has been given to Jack Bender, the <em>Lost</em> alumnus who has given that other horror series such a distinct and compelling aesthetic. Bender is one of the best directors in television, and his distinctive style is immediately present here.</p><p>And thank god, given it followed the most extraordinarily terrible opening credits. I realize this is a weird thing to get stuck on, but in this era of prestige TV where two-minute-long opening sequences contain some of the most extraordinary art and animation, <em>The Institute</em>’s look like they were made in the ‘90s, rendered even worse by the accompaniment of a plaintiff rendition of Tears For Fears’ “Shout,” whiningly sung by The Lumineers—clearly a desperate attempt to match <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg0QBuXU_TM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg0QBuXU_TM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>From</em>’s opening number</a></span>, The Pixies’ incredible cover of “Que Sera Sera.” (The only acceptable whining version of “Shout” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV_7LoLbFzs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV_7LoLbFzs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was on <em>Psych</em></a></span>.) The dissonance between <em>The Institute</em>’s amateurish opening sequence and the familiarly glossy Jack Bender zooming crane shot of a perfectly lit school gymnasium that immediately follows was jarring.</p><p>The program then follows the format of the novel, in which alternating chapters tell two completely disconnected stories for a surprisingly long time. We have the kidnapping of Luke Ellis (Joe Freeman), a teenage boy with burgeoning telekinetic powers, taken to the titular Institute where he meets the handful of other child captives and the mercenary adult staff. Then there’s Tim Jamieson (Ben Barnes), a middle-aged former cop who’s “retired” after he shot and killed an armed teenager while off-duty and not sober. Hitching a ride after giving up his seat on a plane to New York City, he finds himself in a small town, DuPray, South Carolina, where he takes on the anachronistic (and entirely fictional) role of a “night knocker,” a police-adjacent patrolman, walking the town at night to check for crime. It’s only by the second episode that we even learn they might be in the same vicinity.</p><figure id="" data-id="1586429cd260bfbc3aebd37512063d7b" data-recommend-id="image://1586429cd260bfbc3aebd37512063d7b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1874" data-height="1054" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Luke talks to Ms Sigsby in her dreary office." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luke talks to Ms Sigsby in her dreary office." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->MGM+ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1586429cd260bfbc3aebd37512063d7b" data-recommend-id="image://1586429cd260bfbc3aebd37512063d7b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1874" data-height="1054" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Luke talks to Ms Sigsby in her dreary office." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If anything, <em>The Institute</em>’s loyalty to the source material is its biggest weakness. The novel always felt strange given the sparsity of its population. The Institute itself has just four kids in its huge rooms and lengthy corridors, outnumbered by the still tiny staff. The kids who are already there when Luke arrives talk like veterans of the place, having gotten so used to their incarceration, separation from their parents, and the experiments being performed on them, that you imagine their stay must have been years—except it quickly becomes clear it’s only been a matter of a couple of weeks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jamieson’s calm and unhurried arrival in DuPray is constantly undermined by these deeply awkward exposition dumps, just in time for something to happen to the relevant character. This grows to the point of farce in the second episode, in which a gas station employee we’ve never met before suddenly delivers an entirely unrequested history of his entire life (he’s a very well-educated immigrant who escaped from being tortured overseas, now working minimum wage in the U.S. but delighted by his freedom...), literally seconds before a gunman runs in and shoots him. It’s so hackneyed and rushed that it feels like a spoof, one of those “Don’t worry darling, I’ll be back from the war before our baby’s born and just in time to deliver the vital medicine to our daughter!” scenes.</p><p>This is all such a shame, because the cast and the direction is working so very hard. Joe Freeman delivers a subtly complex performance as a genius child who’s clearly on the spectrum, and Ben Barnes is...well, he’s outrageously rugged and charming, his eye twinkling alone deserving of all the Emmys. Julian Richings is always a reliably sinister actor, with his gaunt, skeletal face doing half the work of establishing his malevolent character, and Jason Diaz immediately captures the terrifying mood-flipping nature of Institute tough guy Tony. Best of all is Mary-Louise Parker (<em>Weeds</em>) as Ms. Sigsby, the apparent boss of the facility (although the power structure is immediately made unclear), her character constantly walking the line of sanity. (Fun fact: Mary-Louise Parker and Ally Sheedy are two entirely different people.)</p><p>It’s interesting to note that Jack Bender has clearly brought in a few favorites, too. Robert Joy plays the Institute’s main scientist, fresh from his role as Henry in <em>From </em>(although I cannot get over how much, with his pencil moustache, he looks like a Kevin McDonald character from <em>Kids in the Hall</em>), while <em>Lost</em>’s Frank Lapidus, Jeff Fahey, appears in a very mysterious role.</p><figure id="" data-id="3e476ab53f4faa2b59461561bce39026" data-recommend-id="image://3e476ab53f4faa2b59461561bce39026" data-format="jpg" data-width="1835" data-height="1032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Luke wears probes on his head as he's experimented upon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luke wears probes on his head as he's experimented upon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->MGM+ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3e476ab53f4faa2b59461561bce39026" data-recommend-id="image://3e476ab53f4faa2b59461561bce39026" data-format="jpg" data-width="1835" data-height="1032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Luke wears probes on his head as he's experimented upon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The problem is, there’s so little that actually matters. Not in that, “Oh god this show’s so slow” way that is a little too prevalent in streaming right now—things move along at a fair clip, Bender never one for long, brooding quietness—but rather that what everyone says and does feels so rote, so formulaic, and rarely progresses the story. You’ll never guess, but the kids with psychic powers want to escape the facility! So they’re going to discuss that. And that handsome ex-cop? Well, he just wants to be left to be lovely and perfect all the time, but there are all these people and incidents. A bunch of stuff happens, but none of it propels the plot. And, having read the novel, I’m all too aware how little propulsion is ever going to be on offer—not least because the book ends on what feels like should be the opening of a much more interesting tale.</p><p>I hope that what’s coming across is my frustration that <em>The Institute</em> isn’t <em>better</em>, rather than that it’s bad. A lot of extremely competent people have made this show, and that’s apparent throughout—but given the thinness of the book, it feels like this could have been an opportunity to develop those ideas, to let the novel actually be the pilot, and see this series progress things much further. More characters, more momentum, more <em>everything</em>.</p><p>On the other hand, weirdly, the show has entirely abandoned the core metaphor the book was allegedly about. It never <em>really</em> comes across from the page, but King said at the time (2019) that he was responding to America’s anti-immigration policies that saw kids locked in cages, separated from their families, treated inhumanely. If the novel ever resonated with this, it was in exploring how the adults in the Institute could ever be able to behave as they do, to treat children so callously, but certainly in the first two episodes of the adaptation this isn’t a factor at all. We see moments of Ms. Sigsby’s bizarre private life, and that will get deeper as things progress, but the rest of the adult cast just feel like cartoon villains. The kids are far more interesting, but horribly under-developed, reduced to “The One Who...” roles. </p><figure id="" data-id="d55769f98eef0abc842355539e7226d8" data-recommend-id="image://d55769f98eef0abc842355539e7226d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1632" data-height="918" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tim stares confused, in the dark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tim stares confused, in the dark." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->MGM+ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d55769f98eef0abc842355539e7226d8" data-recommend-id="image://d55769f98eef0abc842355539e7226d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1632" data-height="918" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tim stares confused, in the dark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’m going to keep watching. But don’t take that as a reflection of the show’s quality; I watched every single episode of <em>Under the Dome</em>, after all. <em>The Institute</em> is a vastly better show than that, but it’s so far entirely without menace. Like the book it’s based on, it’s slight, undercooked, and fails to convey a real sense of threat. Also, given it’s attempts to ride <em>From</em>’s coattails, it’s also woefully lacking in mystery. Sure, they keep referencing “keyholes,” but they might as well be saying “Care Bears” for all the intrigue it’s establishing.</p><p>I really hope things can speed up in the next six episodes, that it can find some meat to chew on, but I think to do so it’s going to have to step away from the book it feels too beholden to—and that doesn’t seem particularly likely.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/the-institute-stephen-king-tv-series-mgm-from-lost-1851786460]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It’s the very first movie in James Gunn’s revamped DC Universe! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that Superman has hit theaters, James Gunn’s DC Universe is fully underway… Or is it? While Gunn has now released a movie, a TV show (Peacemaker), and an animated series (Creature Commandos) under his stewardship, there’s still a missing piece of the DC Universe puzzle: video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gunn told fans back in 2022 that his master plan for an interconnected DC Universe includes video games. But unlike on the movies and TV side of things, there have been no official announcements regarding what the first DC Universe video game will be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An absence of reveals doesn’t mean we don’t have a reasonably clear picture of what to expect, though. Across multiple interviews and press events, Gunn and co-studio head Peter Safran have explained their plans, including the fact that while they don’t technically oversee Warner Bros.’ gaming division, there’s now a much deeper collaboration between WB Games and DC Studios that could dramatically alter the way future DC video games are made. With that in mind, let’s analyze what the future of games will look like in the new DCU era.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Gunn Takes Over DC</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The first time we learned that video games factored into Gunn’s DC plans was shortly after he and producer Peter Safran were announced as co-heads of DC Studios on October 25, 2022. While answering fan questions on X, Gunn responded to one user who asked if games would be connected to the DCU alongside films and TV. To this, he <a href="https://x.com/JamesGunn/status/1596921811374964736" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>simply replied, “Yes.</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wouldn’t be until a few months later that <a href="https://www.dc.com/blog/2023/01/31/the-next-generation-of-dc-movies-and-tv-has-arrived" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Gunn revealed</u></a> what movies and shows were in development as part of Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters, which is the DCU’s equivalent of the MCU’s Phase 1. And while video games were conspicuously missing from the Chapter 1 roadmap, Gunn told members of the press, “Television, movies, and games all intertwine within the same universe. We’re going to cast actors who are going to be able to play the characters in [animation and TV], as well as in other things.” This was the first clear indication from Gunn that video games were indeed a part of his plans for the DCU.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Confirmed DCU Projects</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One important thing to know is that Gunn’s job as head of DC Studios doesn’t include control over any of Warner Bros’ video game studios, which include developers like Avalanche Software (Hogwarts Legacy), NetherRealm Studios (Mortal Kombat), Rocksteady Studios (Batman Arkham), and TT Games (Lego). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Under the current Warner Bros. Discovery corporate structure, Warner Bros. Games exists separately from DC Studios and is overseen by Warner Bros. Discovery's CEO of global streaming and gaming, JB Perrette. But after Gunn and Safran were named DC co-heads in 2022, Perrette appears to be deferring to the new DC bosses when it comes to matters of comic book video games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Walls Break Down Between WB Games and DC Studios</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/warner-bros-video-games-live-services-dc-game-of-thrones-1235888944/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Variety</u></a> in 2024, Perrette revealed, “Frankly, there hasn’t been as close a relationship between the studio and the games business as there should have been. And James [Gunn] is actually a gamer, so having someone who’s passionate about it is super helpful.” Perrette added that the games departments are now “actively working with [Gunn and Safran] on the core franchises within the DC Universe.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on this interview, it appears there was once a wall that divided WB’s gaming division from the movie and TV studios. And according to Perrette, it was only after Gunn and Safran took over DC Studios that a newfound sense of collaboration was achieved.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“Whether it’s NetherRealm or whether it’s Rocksteady, [we] sit with them and talk about characters and stories that we’re interested in and that they’re interested in.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This dividing wall was confirmed a year later during a DC Studios Presentation held on February 24, 2025. During the event, James Gunn and Peter Safran confirmed Perrette’s statements regarding the separation between the two WB divisions and how that relationship has changed since they took over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We work incredibly closely with JB Perrette, who runs that division, and it’s really the first time ever it’s been this way at Warner Bros,” Safran confirmed. “It’s been great, and we’ve enjoyed it enormously. Everything had been so siloed, and now that’s completely broken down, and it’s been great. Because it also applies to consumer products and experiences, and everything that DC touches runs up through us now, which is awesome.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“James [Gunn] and I sit with literally the guys that run the studios underneath JB,” Safran added. “Whether it’s NetherRealm or whether it’s Rocksteady, [we] sit with them and talk about characters and stories that we’re interested in and that they’re interested in.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s funny that Safran mentions Rocksteady, as it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-reportedly-working-on-single-player-batman-game-monolith-productions-wonder-woman-in-trouble"><u>reported earlier this year</u></a> that the studio is developing a new single-player Batman game. While it may be too soon to tell, at least according to Gunn and Safran, there will likely be some input from their side of things at DC Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We see designs for the projects in their very earliest stages,” Gunn said at the event. “When they’re talking about what the story might be, we say, ‘Well, maybe you want to go this way because we’re planning on maybe doing something with this character and so forth and so on,’ and help deal with that.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/16/screenshot-2025-07-14-at-12-01-37-pm-1752682573383.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Gunn replies to fans on X. Credit: X.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Does this mean Gunn will be fully in charge of the next Rocksteady Batman game? Not quite. Gunn confirmed that <a href="https://x.com/JamesGunn/status/1597360208824569856" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>“not all”</u></a> games will be connected to the DCU’s overarching story when another fan on X shared their concern about losing standalone experiences like Rocksteady’s Arkham series. So, depending on where Rocksteady wants to take its next single-player Batman game, there’s a chance it could be incorporated into the DCU, or treated as a separate universe like Matt Reeves’ The Batman movies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, Perrette said in the aforementioned Variety interview that WB’s game studios will still be making projects based on what’s best for the studios and gamers, saying, “We’re not going to launch a Superman game purely because we feel obligated. We have to do something that makes sense for the gaming strategy and for fans and for the consumer.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>How James Gunn’s DCU Is Already Shaping Games</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if DC’s full gaming plans remain a mystery, we’re already seeing Gunn’s unified vision for DC play out in several games right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our characters can move in and out of animation or jump into a game or onto the big screen, but they will remain consistent throughout: same character, same history, same actor,” Gunn said during the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/james-gunn-creature-commandos-dc-studios-annecy-1235922754/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>press tour for Creature Commandos</u></a> last year — a couple months after Peacemaker was added to Mortal Kombat 1 as a DLC character on February 28, 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just as Gunn said, NetherRealm enlisted John Cena to reprise his TV and movie role as Peacemaker in Mortal Kombat 1. Not only is his likeness and design identical to the version of the character that appears in the HBO series and The Suicide Squad movie, but even his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO_skSl0MDI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Victory Pose </u></a>in Mortal Kombat 1 is a direct reference to Peacemaker’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mrr3UNALww" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>glam rock-themed opening credits</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, this month’s Superman-themed content for Fortnite features skins for Superman, Mr. Terrific, and The Engineer, which are all based on the likenesses of their movie counterparts. So, rather than a comic-book version of these characters, you’re playing as David Corenswet’s Superman, Edi Gathegi’s Mr. Terrific, and Maria Gabriela de Faria’s Engineer. Like Peacemaker, it seems that any appearance by a DCU character in a video game will be identical to their movie and TV counterpart, just as Gunn promised (with the exception of those standalone projects Gunn also promised, of course.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Since taking the reins, our true north has been to bring DC film, TV, animation, and gaming into alignment under a single banner and bring a sense of unity and consistency into the DCU as a whole,” Gunn said ahead of the premiere of Creature Commandos. “This frees us to create a range of products that are diverse and compelling, and deliver great stand-alone entertainment experiences on every medium, while also being part of a larger story that we’re telling within our unified DCU.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been a rough couple of years for DC games under Warner Bros.. Between the closing of Monolith Software and the cancellation of a Wonder Woman video game, to Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s lackluster release, the future of DC video games appeared to be in major flux. Warner Bros. even considered<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-wb-discovery-looking-to-sell-off-games-other-divisions-to-prevent-total-breakup" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> selling off its gaming business entirely.</u></a> </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And while WB Games’ fortunes have changed with the massive success of games like Hogwarts Legacy, there’s still no official word yet on the future of DC video games. But it’s clear based on statements from Gunn, Safran, and Perrette that Warner Bros. Games and DC Studios are collaborating deeply when it comes to any upcoming video game starring DC’s caped heroes. Although the basic expectation is that if a character from DC’s movies and shows appears in a game, it will feature the same actor, the full plans for DC video games, especially from developers like Rocksteady, remain to be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out our full list of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-dc-movies-and-tv-shows-2025-release-dates-and-beyond">upcoming DC movies and TV shows</a>, as well as our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/superman-2025-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-nicholas-hoult">Superman review</a> for our full DC coverage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-know-about-james-gunn-dcu-video-games-rocksteady-batman-superman]]></content:encoded>

Now, however, Sega has removed all doubt, confirming in a new <a href="https://www.sega.com/news/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-faq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>FAQ</u></a> that "the physical version will feature the full base game on a 64GB cartridge." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The FAQ also confirmed that crossplay will be available for Nintendo Switch 2 players, progress will carry over from the original Switch to the newer edition, and yes, there will be a $10 upgrade pack for anyone hoping to upgrade to the Switch 2 version in the future. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By contrast, Square Enix was criticised by fans earlier this week for confirming there would be "no upgrade path" for its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-first-impressions-classic-dq-has-never-looked-so-good">Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake</a> on Switch 2, and that its save files would not be compatible across platforms. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has said CrossWorlds will feature a huge roster of over playable characters, if you include DLC. Characters you’d expect to see, such as Sonic, Dr. Eggman, Knuckles, Shadow, and Tails are present and correct, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-reveals-nickelodeon-collaboration-that-adds-spongebob-squarepants-avatar-and-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-guest-characters"><u>but now you can add the likes of SpongeBob SquarePants, Avatar, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles into the mix</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CrossWorlds is, of course, going up against Switch 2 exclusive kart game Mario Kart World, which has so far resisted adding guest characters from outside Nintendo's portfolio. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is set for release on both the Switch and the Switch 2, so it looks like we’ll be set for some old-fashioned Mario vs. Sonic kart racing rivalry when Sega's effort launches in September.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN recently went <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-hands-on-preview"><u>hands-on with Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</u></a> and came away impressed. “It’s a vibe,” we said, “and one that I’ve enjoyed and will look forward to drifting through.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The company claims new features will help keep teens on platform, where conversations can be moderated.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox has announced a new range of safety features directed specifically at teenagers ages 13-17, including a new age estimation technology that uses AI to guess a user's age based on a video selfie they submit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/07/advancing-safety-on-roblox-with-age-based-communication" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Today's announcement</a> reveals several new features being implemented in Roblox that the company claims will improve teen and child safety on its platform. At the core of the announcement are new features specifically for teens ages 13-17, giving them more freedom on the platform than younger children but still less than adults. Teens will be able to designate "trusted connections" on Roblox, with whom they will be able to chat on the platform without filters. Per Roblox, the goal is to better monitor conversations teens are having on Roblox rather than having them lured to third-party platforms where unmonitored conversations could become inappropriate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trusted connections are intended to be set between users who know one another well, and if a teen intends to set someone 18+ as a trusted connection, they can only do so using a QR code scanner or a contact importer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the past, Roblox has relied on the submission of a government ID verifying that users are 13+ or 18+ to unlock certain platform chat features. However, it is now implementing an alternative verification method. Individuals can submit a "video selfie" to Roblox, and an AI will determine if it believes the person in question is 13+ by analyzing it against "a large, diverse dataset." Google began <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/12/google-to-test-using-ai-to-determine-users-ages.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">testing a similar feature earlier this year</a>, as did <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/instagram-teen-accounts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meta the year prior</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to these changes, Roblox is also adding new tools such as online status controls, a do not disturb mode, and parental controls for parents who have linked their accounts to a teenage's account.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox has long been in an uncomfortable spotlight regarding its handling of children's safety. In 2018, it made headlines when <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-bans-players-who-gang-raped-a-seven-year-olds-avatar" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a mother reported her seven-year-old daughter's Roblox character was violently sexually assaulted</a> by other players in-game, and separately a six-year-old girl playing Roblox was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/05/girl-6-invited-sex-room-playing-childrens-video-game-roblox-7605376/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly invited into a "sex room"</a>. In 2021, People Make Games published a report on the ways in which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roblox's business model allegedly exploits child labor</a>. In 2022, Roblox faced <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/lawsuit-accuses-roblox-of-enabling-sexual-exploitation" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a San Francisco lawsuit accusing it</a> of enabling the financial and sexual exploitation of a 10-year-old girl. In 2023, it was sued both for <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-accused-of-facilitating-illegal-gambling-ring-for-minors" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allegedly facilitating</a> "an illegal gambling ecosystem" and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-faces-new-lawsuit-claiming-it-lacks-child-safety-measures" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more generally</a> for having lax child safety protocols that allegedly led to financial loss and children's exposure to adult content. Just last year, Bloomberg published a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">damning report highlighting the prevalence of child predators on the platform</a>. That same year, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-reported-over-13000-incidents-to-the-national-center-for-missing-and-exploited-children-in-2023" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the platform claimed</a> it reported over 13,000 incidents of child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the year 2023, resulting in the arrest of 24 individuals who allegedly preyed on children through the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Safety has always been foundational to everything we do at Roblox," said Roblox chief safety officer Matt Kaufman in a statement alongside today's new feature news. "Our goal is to lead the world in safety and civility for online gaming. We are dedicated to supporting experiences that are both deeply engaging, and empowering for players of all ages, while continuously innovating how users connect and interact."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s that time of the year again and EA has revealed the cover stars of its next soccer game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26">FC 26</a>. But this go around there’s concern that the infamous 'Madden curse' has spread to EA’s soccer series, after joint cover stars Jude Bellingham and Jamal Musiala suffered significant injuries that left them facing lengthy spells on the sidelines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s really nice to share this moment with Jamal, as a reflection of how far we’ve come,” said Real Madrid and England midfield star Bellingham in a comment accompanying the announcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I remember our times rooming together in the England Youth team, we’d play the game all the time. Where I’m from, everyone knows the game, everyone plays it and talks about it so much. I’m grateful to be given the opportunity to be on the cover again.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s a comment from Bayern Munich and Germany forward Musiala: “When I found out I’d be on the cover of FC, it was such a crazy feeling. I thought, how could I tell my little brother? He’s a big fan of the game, so this will be a nice surprise for him. It’s something I always wanted growing up and it’s such a big part of football culture. Who knows, maybe I can still beat Jude at FC.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem is, both players are injured and are set to miss a significant chunk of the next season. Let’s start with Bellingham. The 22-year-old just had surgery on a long-standing shoulder injury that’s set to keep him out of the game for up to four months. That means he’s going to miss the start of next season and may not return until November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worse for Musiala, though. He suffered a horrible injury playing at the Club World Cup that rules him out for between four and five months. After breaking his leg and dislocating his ankle in the same incident, the 22-year-old is set for a long absence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this means FC 26 launches in September with both its cover stars unable to play the game. One potentially won’t play again until 2026. Hardly ideal for the marketers at EA Sports, who must be wondering whether they are now cursed.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/image001-1752748823131.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Jude Bellingham and Jamal Musiala both face lengthy spells on the sidelines. Image credit: EA Sports.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Madden curse fan theory suggests any athlete who appears on the cover of Madden NFL suffers a downturn in their career, either from an injury or generally underperforming. The long-standing Madden curse most recently afflicted Madden NFL 25 cover star Christian McCaffrey of the San Francisco 49ers, who was shifted to the injured reserve list due to calf tightness and achilles tendinitis one month after he graced the cover of the latest American football entry from EA Sports, which arrived August 13, 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/does-madden-nfl-cover-curse-still-exist-a-look-back-at-25-years-of-covers-after-christian-mccaffrey-nod/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>CBS Sports</u></a> analyzed the history of the Madden curse upon McCaffrey's announcement as 2024's cover star, deeming that, between 2000 and 2024, 58% of players struggled after appearing on the cover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA’s FIFA series — now FC — has a long way to go before a ‘FIFA curse’ spreads online, but perhaps FC 26 has started something new. FC 26 launches across PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One, PC, Amazon Luna, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2 on September 26, 2025, with early access through the Ultimate Edition beginning September 19, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Virtuos, one of the biggest game developers in the world and the team that was behind the positively received The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, is undergoing a "restructure" that will lead to layoffs. A spokesperson for the company told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/studio-behind-oblivion-remastered-one-of-2025s-biggest-hits-subject-to-mass-layoffs-report" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> that around 7% of the company's global staff are facing layoffs. The cuts are being made "primarily in teams facing lower occupancy and slower demand due to structural shifts in the industry."</p><p>About 200 people in Asia are impacted, along with 70 in Europe. Fewer than 10 people at Virtuos' French office, which worked on Oblivion Remastered, were impacted, the company said.</p><p>"We are grateful for the contributions of those impacted. We are providing separation packages, career transition assistance, and opportunities for redeployment across our global network where possible," the company said.

		<p>You will soon be able to sheath your Fortnite character in a Fantastic Four skin. These delightful creations are to tie in with the Marvel movie, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, which can be seen in UK cinemas from July 25th 2025.</p>
<p>The Fantastic Four skins have not been detailed, but it is assumed that you will be able to purchase all four members of the team: Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch and the Thing. Data miners have porked around in the code and found the details below, but nothing official has been posted.</p>


<ul>
<li>Reed Richards: – Skin, has a beard – Emote (With Prop &amp; Hologram) – Glider – Bundle</li>
<li>Sue Storm: – Skin – Emote – Pickaxe – Backpack – Bundle</li>
<li>Johnny Storm: – Skin (Normal &amp; Fire Style) – Emote – Emoji – Pickaxe – Backpack – Bundle</li>
<li>The Thing: – Skin – Spray – Emote – Pickaxe – Backpack – Bundle</li>
</ul>

<p>Epic have not posted a release date but it is assumed it will be somewhere near the launch date of the film. Galactus is the main villain in the movie, but it is rumoured that many lesser-known characters may make an appearance so they may get a Fantastic Four skin as well.</p>
<p>Data miners have also found reference to four pairs of Nike shoes that are linked to the characters, all of which are based on existing real world kicks.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Reed Richards:- Harbor Blue Air Max 90s</li>
<li>Sue Storm: – Air Force 1s with a blue swoosh</li>
<li>Johnny Storm: -Red and orange Air Max 95s</li>
<li>The Thing: – Orange Dunks</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The four skins are the latest Superheroes to be added to the game,&nbsp; on July 10th a version of Superman based on the new DC movie starring David Corenswet was added to the game. Previous additions included Dead Pool, Black Panther, Captain America, Doctor Doom, Black Widow, Ant-Man, Blade, Harley Quinn, Batman and Spider-Man.</p>

		<p>Kalypso Media has revealed the next entry into the Sudden Strike series with the announcement of Sudden Strike 5, which is due to come out in 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS. To mark this announcement, Kalypso Media has put Sudden Strike 4 on sale until Sunday 20th July, with the base game and all the DLC available for $16. An announcement trailer for Sudden Strike 5 has also been released.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sudden Strike 5 | Announcement Trailer | US" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DlNfzXuifFs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Much like the previous games in the series, Sudden Strike 5 will be set during World War 2 and maintain the real time strategy gameplay. This entry will have 25 missions in the main campaign, and give players access to 300 units, with this split between 190 vehicles and 110 infantry units. Players can also select a commander that is best suited to their strategic thinking. During play, you will be able to see the whole battlefield from above allowing for better tactical planning as you look to capture and defend key resources including headquarters and supply depots. Sudden Strike 5 will feature online PvP multiplayer too, so you can face off against other commanders to determine who has the best tactical ability.</p>
<p>For those that are interested in Sudden Strike 5, a closed beta will be taking place through which players can test the game and provide feedback to the developers ahead of the full release next year. To sign up for the Sudden Strike 5 closed beta you need to visit the official <a href="https://www.kalypsomedia.com/sudden-strike-5">Sudden Strike 5</a> website.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>We are no different from the ants, no we are far worse!</p>
</section><section>

<p>Arc System Works Europe has just announced that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/hunter-x-hunters-fighting-game-delayed-until-2025-now-adding-rollback-netcode">ever-so-slightly-delayed</a> 2D fighter, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hunter_x_hunter_nen_x_impact">Hunter x Hunter: Nen x Impact</a>, releases today on Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Developed by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=company%3Abushiroad">Bushiroad Games</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/companies/eighting">Eighting</a>, this one has got some pedigree in that Eighting has given us some well-known fighters in the past, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/naruto_clash_of_ninja">Naruto: Clash of the Ninja.</a> With Hunter x Hunter: Nen x Impact, you get down and dirty in 3v3 tag-team-styled action, which is detailed in the official press release thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"HUNTERxHUNTER: NENxIMPACT is a 3-on-3 fighting game based on the iconic anime and manga series HUNTERxHUNTER, written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. In this game, players create a team of 3 characters and battle against the opposing team with a tag system: calling out their allies for an assisting attack, or for swapping characters on the fly!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those not in the loop, Hunter x Hunter is one of those incredibly long-running anime comics that's got a legion of hardcore fans, although it's not quite in the same league as the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_fighterz">Dragon Ball</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/naruto_x_boruto_ultimate_ninja_storm_connections">Naruto</a> - which also get much flashier, big-budget games to boot. First printed in Weekly Shonen Jump all the way back in 1998, the manga, written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi, focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, now missing, is a world-renowned Hunter.</p>
<p>This 2D fighter uses the universe of the comics to bring some beefy-looking scraps to life. We're always down for some tag-team action, and whilst it's not going to be winning any awards for sharpest graphics, there's an interesting core combat experience here that could provide ample cover for any presentation shortcomings. Indeed, any fighters we've played from Eighting in the past have been right bangers in the mechanics department.</p>

<p>Alongside the digital edition, which is priced at £49.99 (or whatever that translates to where you are!) there's also a physical edition that comes in standard and limited edition flavours, with the limited containing the following extras:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Game</li>
<li>Special Box</li>
<li>Artbook</li>
<li>Acrylic Stand</li>
<li>Season 1 Pass</li>
<li>Alternate Costume Pack Hisoka &amp; Kurapika</li>
</ul>

<p>This limited edition, which comes in a very nice box, will set you back £84.99.</p>
<p>Hunter x Hunter has made the news a few time already in this game form, having been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/hunter-x-hunters-fighting-game-delayed-until-2025-now-adding-rollback-netcode">delayed to add rollback net code,</a> as well as finding itself <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/new-switch-anime-fighter-due-out-in-2025-refused-classification-down-under">banned in Australia for including material deemed "inappropriate"</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer for the game at the top of this very article and, whilst it's definitely not a particular looker in comparison to some other Switch fighters, if it's got it where it counts — in the actual fighting dept. — and you're a fan of the anime already, this one could well be worth a shout.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-bonus</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/subnautica-2-lawsuit-revealed-as-krafton-reportedly-extends-bonus-period.1245990/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Charlie Cleveland and his fellow Unknown Worlds co-founders have released the public text of their&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>lawsuit, and it comes just as publisher Krafton reportedly extends its employee bonus period to cover 2026.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder, Krafton, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-owner-krafton-buys-subnautica-dev-unknown-worlds" rel="nofollow">the parent company</a> of&nbsp;<em>Subnautica </em>studio Unknown Worlds,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow">recently delayed</a>&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access release&nbsp;into 2026. The announcement of the game's delay was made shortly after original Unknown Worlds founders Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill were ousted from the company.</p>

<p>In response to their ousting and&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>'s delay, Cleveland and his fellow co-founders <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-charlie-cleveland-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">pledged to sue Krafton</a>, claiming not only that the game was ready for Early Access but also that Krafton delayed it in order to avoid paying out a potentially large bonus to employees if a 2025 revenue target was met.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-fish.jpg?itok=CP0P78d8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-fish.jpg?itok=kN4gRjKy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Charlie Cleveland and company's&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>lawsuit (or, at least, the public version of it) has been released to the public.</figcaption></figure><p>Now, Cleveland has once again taken to social media in order to release a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889109175/Fortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-via-Aftermath" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">redacted public version</a> of the lawsuit against Krafton. It's a lengthy legal document, but in essence, Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire are suing Krafton for breach of contract with specific reference to the payout.</p>

<p>The three are alleging that Krafton deliberately delayed&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>in order to avoid paying $25 million of a $250 million bonus to Unknown Worlds employees, and that this is also why the three were dismissed from their positions at Unknown Worlds.</p>

<p>In a move that might muddy the waters somewhat, however, Krafton is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reportedly</a> extending the bonus payout window to cover 2026, and it's also apparently planning to advance part of the 2026 bonus pool to employees by the end of 2025.</p>

<p>If this move goes ahead, it sounds to me like it might invalidate a large part of Cleveland's claim, although I'm not a legal expert. We'll just have to wait and see what happens next, but as many lawsuits do, this process may well drag on for a while yet.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>itself, it's currently due for launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962700/Subnautica_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/subnautica-2/9PJPCB188SVG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> sometime next year. Of course, there's every chance it could be delayed until 2027, in which case the aforementioned bonus extension would cease to matter, but that's too far in the future for us to meaningfully speculate on.</p>

We’ve seen the reintroduction of ex cards, the return of Trainer Pokémon, and even a new invasion from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001">Team Rocket</a></span>. At the same time, we’ve also seen a <em>lot</em> of drab sets with pull-rates that ensure you’ll get <em>something</em>, while making the most desirable full-art cards near impossible to collect. Then, during fall 2024, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">everything got out of control</a></span>. The hobby saw a new surge of interest, driven by skyrocketing prices made vastly worse by scarcity caused by scalpers, and ever since it’s been close to impossible to buy a new pack of Pokémon cards from the store without waiting in line, or engaging in a fist fight. Multiple attempts to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">thwart scalpers have failed</a></span>, and even pre-ordering a new set months in advance is now a lottery. Unless you want a pack of the entirely unloved Twilight Masquerade. Everywhere has that poor set.</p><p>It’s into this furore that the English-language’s first ever split set is launched. Black Bolt and White Flare are two overlapping sets of cards, each with their own unique Pokémon and cards, released as a so-called “special set” to finish off the <em>SV</em> generation. Except, “special set” actually means, “harder to buy for some reason,” where packs are only sold as part of collection boxes, or in Elite Trainer Boxes, with no single packs available (unless you go to a canny specialist store, that’ll strip the collection boxes down for their packs), and certainly no 36-pack booster boxes. Then, released as a split set, it’s twice as hard to collect all the cards you might want, given you not only need to be able to find any at all to buy, but you also need to be sure to get the right half of the collection. Yay?</p><h2 id="h703578"><a id=""></a>All 156 Pokémon from...Unova?</h2><p>Black Bolt and White Flare feature all 156 Pokémon from the Unova region, as featured in the 2010 <em>Pokémon Black</em> and <em>White</em> video games. Why? Gosh that’s a good question.</p><p>Obviously, if you’re a fan, you’ll know the set features fan-favorite Legendary Pokémon Zekrom and Reshiram. And then, um, oh dear. Look, if 2010 was your entry into the hobby, then I imagine the Pokémon within have a special place in your heart. But looking back across all the new monsters, it’s surely by far the worst. Filled with deeply unimaginative creatures, like three different evolutions based on flipping ice cream and a second pigeon-based pocket monster, I struggle to muster passion for such a derivative set. Oh, and it also forced Pansear, Pansage and Panpour on us, three creepy-faced monkey-things in a game that was already just fine with Aipom. (Simisear, the evolution of Pansear, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2016/6/17/unpopular-pokmon-launches-pr-campaign-to-improve-image&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2016/6/17/unpopular-pokmon-launches-pr-campaign-to-improve-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was once voted the least popular Pokémon</a></span>, ever.)</p><p>This means it’s not easy to get worked up about seeing the set get celebrated here, especially when—and italicized all-caps is really the only option here—<em>THIS IS THE LAST SET FROM SCARLET &amp; VIOLET</em>. Maybe celebrate that set? Just perhaps?</p><figure id="" data-id="cfa654aacef0320640abb9ca40b4e0a2" data-recommend-id="image://cfa654aacef0320640abb9ca40b4e0a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Five of the cards featured in the set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Five of the cards featured in the set." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cfa654aacef0320640abb9ca40b4e0a2" data-recommend-id="image://cfa654aacef0320640abb9ca40b4e0a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Five of the cards featured in the set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-white-flare-zekrom-reshiram-1851786202&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-white-flare-zekrom-reshiram-1851786202">some absolutely gorgeous art</a></span> to be found in the packs, along with the brand new all-black and all-white Zekrom and Reshiram cards, but based on my experience of opening 35 packs, you’ll be lucky to see the rarer ones. Pull rates are tricky to convey at this point, because  Black Bolt and White Flare are packed with so many twiddly extras that you’ll inevitably get <em>something</em> out of a couple of packs. Because, oh my, there are so many variants here.</p><p>There are new holo Energy cards that show up pretty frequently, and then the most egregious array of reverse holo versions of every card. So, for every Basic Pokémon (the ones with the small window art on the top half), there are <em>four</em> different versions. The regular, the standard reverse holo, then a Poké Ball holo pattern, and <em>then</em> a Master Ball holo pattern. This means to complete a master set, you’ll need to collect a ridiculous 800 cards, and also be a billionaire scalper who lives in a Pokémon card factory.</p><h2 id="h703579"><a id=""></a>What about pull rates?</h2><p>To give you an idea from my unscientifically small sample of 35 packs (very kindly supplied by The Pokémon Company, and roughly half Black and half White) I pulled a gratifying seven full-art cards (six Illustration Rares, one Ultra Rare full-art Trainer), four standard ex cards, eight holo Energies, 14 Poké Ball holos, and one Master Ball holo. And written down, that might sound like a really impressive haul. But given just how common Poké Ball variants clearly are, they immediately didn’t feel special, and the Energies are much the same, while ex cards have been bland throughout the last three years. So, it’s really only those seven full-arts and the Master Ball that felt like special pulls. Still, eight out 35 is vastly better than we’ve seen from other sets, and not to be sniffed at.</p><p>The other side, however, is that this meant I didn’t see a single Special Illustration Rare at all, from either Black Bolt or White Flare, meaning those 18 valuable cards must be incredibly tough to find. Obviously I could have just gotten unlucky, but if they’re really fewer than one in 30 or so, that’s going to be grim.</p><p>The collection sets themselves are pretty nice. The poster collection’s poster is just <em>enormous</em>, while the binder collections come with a top-quality 3x3 side-loading binder, featuring either Reshiram or Zekrom. ETBs have nine packs of either Black or White, depending on the box, while the two-pack mini tins have one of each. As ever with Pokémon, everything is super-good quality, none of the extras feeling like tat.</p><figure id="" data-id="d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-recommend-id="image://d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The black Zekrom card everyone will want." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The black Zekrom card everyone will want." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-recommend-id="image://d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The black Zekrom card everyone will want." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But, you know, I’m left feeling a lot of anticlimax.

Also, was that it for Trainer Pokémon? We had the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-review-pull-rates-iono-1851772464&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-review-pull-rates-iono-1851772464">awful Journey Together set</a></span>, followed by the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001">fantastic Destined Rivals</a></span>, and then...they’re all gone.

If you can find it, you’ll likely pull something glittery out of it, but given it’ll be a Unovan Pokémon, won’t add anything radical to the table-top game, and is extremely unlikely to be rare, it’s hard to get all that excited.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The battlefield just got a whole lot bigger. <em>Off The Grid</em> officially launched on Steam today, meaning players of the cyberpunk battle royale game can now compete across devices to be the last avatar standing.</p><p>Set in a dystopian universe crafted by Hollywood filmmaker Neill Blomkamp—who directed <em>District 9</em>, <em>Elysium</em>, <em>Gran Turismo</em>, and more—<em>Off The Grid</em> was initially released for early access back in October of last year. The free-to-play title has steadily gained popularity since that time, thanks to its fluid third-person shooter gameplay, vast array of looting possibilities, and consistent, thoughtfully crafted updates that keep the in-game experience fresh. Players are especially drawn to <em>Off The Grid</em>’s unique mechanic of switchable cyberlimbs, which grant special abilities and make each session feel completely different from the last. These cyberlimbs can be looted from the map, stolen from other players, or purchased through the player-to-player marketplace, offering a wide range of distinctive abilities and customization options.</p><p>“Every major step forward has been shaped by player feedback,” stated Vlad Korolov, the CEO and Co-Founder of Gunzilla Games. “This launch is a celebration of that collaboration, and it’s only the beginning.”</p><p>Founded in 2020, Gunzilla Games is an independent AAA video game developer that has continued to emphasize innovation and a “gamer-first ecosystem” that “pushes the limits of the games” industry. With <em>Off The Grid, </em>their first and primary title, Gunzilla seeks to bend and reshape the battle royale genre in bold, unexpected ways.</p><p>Unlike traditional battle royales, <em>Off The Grid</em> leans deeply into narrative depth. Players complete PvE missions within a PvP environment, so they might find themselves competing with—or against—others while pursuing their own objectives. This adds unpredictability and strategy beyond what’s offered with the standard shrinking-map formula. The result is a living, breathing world where actions have consequences for other online players, and no two sessions feel quite the same.</p><p>Meanwhile, the community “strands” that constitute the game’s DNA are reflected in frequent enhancements centered around performance, expanded maps, new swappable cybernetic limbs and weapons, and all-new game modes. Deathmatch and Solo Mode, for example, are designed to challenge different playstyles and encourage experimentation and creativity.</p><p>On Steam, <em>Off The Grid</em> is now available to the platform’s more than 130 million active users from every corner of the gaming universe, as it enables seamless cross-play among PC, Xbox, and PS5 gamers.</p><p>“Bringing <em>Off The Grid</em> to Steam is a major milestone for us,” said Korolov. “Not just because of the platform’s reach, but because it allows us to welcome an entirely new wave of players into [the] game.”</p><p>Steam’s powerful community integration tools align with Gunzilla’s aims for <em>Off The Grid</em>. From digital forums and user-generated guides to live broadcasts and support functions, the platform fosters a deeper, more meaningful level of engagement between developers and players. It also allows Gunzilla to gather instant feedback, monitor technical issues, and deploy improvements quickly, helping the team respond to user needs faster and keep the game evolving smoothly. That kind of real-time connection will be invaluable.</p><p>An additional benefit of <em>Off The Grid</em>’s presence on Steam is that the platform’s auto-update capabilities ensure that players stay synced with the latest builds. In effect, there are no patches, software updates, or downloads to chase, creating a hassle-free experience.</p><p>The cyborgs are calling. Whether you’re a first-time player or a seasoned veteran, get plugged in and go <em>Off The Grid</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/off-the-grid-steam-neill-blomkamp-game-1851786461]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Ousted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> studio founder Charlie Cleveland has hit back at claims made by former employer Krafton in a newly unsealed court document, accusing the publisher of deliberately hindering the Subnautica 2 project in order to avoid paying out a $250m bonus.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Krafton announced Cleveland - alongside chief executive officer Ted Gill and special projects director Max McGuire - had all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-leadership-replaced-by-krafton-despite-looming-early-access">departed Subnautica studio Unknown Worlds</a>, but insisted it had "sought to keep the... co-founders and original creators of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> series involved in the game's development". Shortly after, though, it was claimed the team had been "pushed out", and that the move was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers">part of a plan by Krafton to avoid paying out a $250m bonus</a> for the development team.
</p>
<p>
The report was followed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers">delay for Subnautica 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-drama-escalates-ousted-developers-launch-legal-action-as-krafton-accuses-them-of-abandoning-project">Krafton's own statement</a>, insisting Unknown Worlds' leadership team had "abandoned" their responsibilities. Specifically, the publisher said it had "asked [Cleveland] to devote himself to... Subnautica 2" but, "instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project".

<p>
However, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-16/-subnautica-2-leaders-say-krafton-sabotaged-game-over-payout">reported by Bloomberg</a>, a lawsuit against Krafton, filed for breach of contract by Unknown Worlds' former leadership team, claims that Cleveland was, in fact, working on a Subnautica movie the publisher is said to have specifically asked the studio to develop. Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier later <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lu4as2noxc2b">noted on social media</a> that "Cleveland was also working on some sort of AI Christmas film, which Krafton was likely referring to. They just didn't mention the Subnautica film part of it."
</p>
<p>
As for the $250m bonus that increasingly appears to be at the centre of Krafton's fallout with the former leadership team, the lawsuit alleges things began to turn sour in early 2025, when Gill started negotiating bonuses for employees who weren't eligible under the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-company-krafton-buys-subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds">acquisition</a> terms. In one part of the complaint reviewed by Bloomberg, it's claimed: "After Krafton's leaders reviewed Gill's projections and evaluated the anticipated revenue and earnout numbers, everything changed."
</p>
<p>
It's alleged the combination of Subnautica's release on mobile and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, alongside the impending early access launch of Subnautica 2, meant the studio was now presenting Krafton with revenue projections significantly higher than Unknown Worlds' initial conservative estimates. It's claimed this is the point Krafton began pushing to delay Subnautica 2 into 2026, halted its publishing duties - including marketing and localisation - and refused to support Subnautica 2's planned summer release.
</p>
<p>
The lawsuit also alleges a senior Krafton executive told Gill "pulling these resources was a permissible way for [the company] to avoid supporting the earnout", and that Krafton later asked Unknown Worlds' leadership to accept a lower sum. It's around this time Krafton head Changhan Kim is alleged to have written to Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire describing Subnautica 2's progress as "slow and underwhelming", and accusing them of "failing to fulfil [their] responsibilities". This is despite the complaint's claim that pre-release tests for Subnautica 2 "drew high marks and confirmed that the game was ready to meet... lofty expectations."

According to Bloomberg, Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire are now seeking damages "in an amount to be determined at trial" following their termination.

All this comes after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-latest-subnautica-2-twist-krafton-confirms-this-leaked-internal-review-document-is-real">mysterious leak of an internal Krafton review document</a> this weekend, claiming Subnautica 2's planned early access release lacked "the freshness and volume expected of a sequel", and fell "short of meeting... high expectations". Almost immediately after, Krafton took the unusual step of announcing, unprompted, that the document was real, claiming that doing so would 'minimise speculation and ensure accurate communication with players'. It seems likely we'll hear again from Krafton soon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Obsidian’s gorgeous fantasy RPG <em>Avowed</em> just got a new patch, promising the usual list of bug fixes and some new features. The game is also now “Verified” for Steam Deck. What’s it like in a portable form factor? Well, it certainly boots up. It’s certainly <em>playable</em>, hitting a semi-decent 30 FPS that doesn’t necessarily feel <em>that</em> terrible to play. How it looks on Valve’s handheld PC, however, is another story. Have a seat, let’s talk about it. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196447,196663" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Set in an imaginative world with all the trappings of lush forests and pretty, sparkly magical effects, <em>Avowed</em> may not be aiming to be the most graphically impressive title out there, but it sure is a looker.

Sure, the statue is impressively in focus and clear, but I think this overall image takes away from the game’s ability to immerse you visually. It’s not how I’d recommend one experience <em>Avowed</em> unless this was your only possible option.</p><p>Have another look at the game on the same Deck: </p><figure id="" data-id="deb5d5578fb28263938cdd26b44334ee" data-recommend-id="image://deb5d5578fb28263938cdd26b44334ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist throws a Frost bomb at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist throws a Frost bomb at an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="deb5d5578fb28263938cdd26b44334ee" data-recommend-id="image://deb5d5578fb28263938cdd26b44334ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist throws a Frost bomb at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And here’s how combat looks: </p><p>We can go into the details. Distant objects look really messy, splotchy, shimmery, and sometimes pixel-art adjacent—in fact, it sorta reminds me of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/bVw1Mpb0QFo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/bVw1Mpb0QFo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">playing that <em>Oblivion</em> quest</a></span> where you’re stuck in a painting. It hovers at a 30-40 FPS status, which isn’t too bad, but the odd visuals, I think, actually make me play worse (I’m also used to playing this game on mouse and keyboard, not the gamepad layout of the Steam Deck, to be clear).</p><p>Yes, it will sorta settle down at times when rendering and FSR3 catch up, but it’s still not great. And the second you move, distant options look all crunchy and shitty again.</p><h2 id="h704784"><a id=""></a>What about the new class options and other features?</h2><p>I’ve been playing on the hardest difficulty in <em>Avowed</em> with a ranger-ish build that primarily uses rifles. Surprisingly, it feels like playing a first-person shooter more than something like <em>Fallout 4</em> did. My brain is sorta in <em>Doom</em> mode when I’m playing. While the game put up a tough fight early on, I eventually reached a certain level of power where I was annihilating everything. I’m also doing every quest and finding everything on every map, so my character has a lot of experience invested in her stats.</p><p>The fighter and ranger got new active and passive abilities. And the update refunded everyone’s skill points, so you can already get to trying out new builds. From the looks of things, this is only going to make me more unstoppable than I already am. The “Sharpshooter” ranger passive looks like it will make my pretty sweet rifle even deadlier. That said, abilities like “Shadow Step,” a previously NPC-exclusive ability that lets you vanish and appear behind your target, feel a little redundant since I can already go invisible. </p><p>I’m going to need to mix and match these new abilities for a while to judge just how transformative they are for a game I didn’t find that challenging anyway. So maybe I’m not the best judge of how helpful the new build options are. I’ll get back to you if something really blows my mind. You can read all the nitty gritty details of the patch, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134877-patch-15-notes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134877-patch-15-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">includes some new weapons and attire, here.</a></span></p><p>Anyway, <em>Avowed</em> rocks. It’s a serious contender for GOTY in my book—just don’t play it running natively on Steam Deck if you can help it. Stick to streaming if you want to kick back on the couch. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2024-big-games-unplayable-space-marine-2-pc-1851669933&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2024-big-games-unplayable-space-marine-2-pc-1851669933">Many Of 2024's Biggest Games Don’t Play Well (Or At All) On Steam Deck</a></span></p><p><br>And Valve, we’re really gonna need to have a talk about this “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2024-big-games-unplayable-space-marine-2-pc-1851669933&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2024-big-games-unplayable-space-marine-2-pc-1851669933">Playable”/”Verified” dynamic</a></span> on Steam Deck.
