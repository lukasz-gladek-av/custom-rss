            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier today, Bethesda released a new video dedicated to the future of <em>Fallout</em>. And while the studio announced a new version of <em>Fallout 4 </em>and showed off more of <em>Fallout 76</em>‘s next big update, there was no explicit mention of a <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-show-todd-howard-amazon-1851325762">Fallout 5</a></em>. But don’t worry, Bethesda’s creative director Todd Howard wants you all to know that “more” is coming and he’s excited to share it with fans…eventually.</p> <p>In case you weren’t aware, October 23 is known as Fallout Day among the fan community. It’s the day that, in the video game franchise and TV show, the bombs dropped and destroyed the world. A weird day to celebrate, but hey, every mass media franchise needs a holiday to get excited about once a year. Anyway, on Thursday, for the second year in a row, Bethesda aired a Fallout Day Broadcast aka a <em>Fallout</em> Direct filled with some new trailers and updates on the series. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-fallout-4-switch-2-2026-anniversary-edition-trailer-xbox-ps5-2000638638">The big news was <em>Fallout 4</em> making its way to Switch 2 in 2026</a>. But, for those hoping for <em>Fallout 5</em> to be announced or <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_3_remaster">the rumored <em>Fallout 3</em> remaster</a> to be shadow-dropped during the event, well, it was a disappointing presentation. That might explain why, at the end, Howard showed up to assure fans that the company was still working hard on more <em>Fallout</em> games.</p>

  <p>“Even though I am recording this—it’s not live—and I’m probably watching myself right now from my desk and I’m reading your chat and these…that thing you want and this other thing you want…Hey, we read it all,” said Howard. “Just know, we are working on even more. We are looking forward to the day when we can share that with everybody. But thank you again for tuning in and happy Fallout Day.”</p>

 <p>And…that was it. The stream then cut to a video of <em>Halloween</em> director and gamer John Carpenter (?!) claiming to be the biggest<em> Fallout 76</em> fan and then wishing everyone a happy Fallout Day as well. Thanks, John! <a href="https://youtu.be/HMDSfOs1EPY?t=1313">While Howard did also show up at the end of last year’s Fallout Day event</a>, it was a much shorter experience that didn’t seem so apologetic.</p>

 <p>It’s clear that Bethesda knows there’s a large demand for <em>Fallout 5</em> and other <em>Fallout</em> games. That demand has existed for years now, but has only grown larger thanks to the really successful Amazon TV show. That likely explains <em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em> getting a Switch 2 port, and the next<em> Fallout 76</em> update adding the Ghoul from the show as a quest-giving NPC. It’s an easier way to get more <em>Fallout</em> content out there that might appeal to both players and TV show fans.</p>

 <p>Bethesda’s next big RPG after <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627">2023’s <em>Starfield</em></a> is <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>, not <em>Fallout 5.</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-v-bethesda-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-starf-1849062025"> In 2022, Howard confirmed that <em>TES6</em>, announced in 2018, was entering pre-production</a> and was still years away from release. After that’s done, Howard confirmed Bethesda will make <em>Fallout 5.</em> But considering how long these games take to make, that means the next main entry in the post-apocalyptic RPG franchise might be close to a decade away at this point.</p> <p>In 2024, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-new-vegas-2-fo3-remaster-starfield-dlc-1851544120">Howard explained in an interview</a> that Bethesda doesn’t want to “rush” out a new <em>Fallout</em> single-player RPG and pointed to <em>Fallout 76</em> and the TV show as options for fans longing for new <em>Fallout</em> content. But considering how successful the company’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remaster-elder-scrolls-eso-glitch-meme-1851777557"><em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remaster</a> was earlier this year, I wouldn’t be shocked if, in a move intended to provide players with more <em>Fallout</em> games quickly, we see a similar remake for<em> Fallout 3</em> and maybe even one for<em>&nbsp;Fallout: New Vega</em>s in the future. And there’s always next year’s Fallout Day!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Toronto Ultra Rebrands to Toronto KOI in the Call of Duty League]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/toronto-ultra-rebrands-toronto-koi-cdl/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/toronto-ultra-rebrands-to-toronto-koi-in-the-call-of-duty-league.1333516/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Call of Duty League’s Toronto Ultra has unveiled a rebrand, taking on a new name and logo. In a press release, OverActive Media revealed the new name, ‘Toronto KOI’, in recognition of the organization’s association with KOI and Movistar. </p>



<p>This is the latest in a line of a few organizations to rebrand going into the 2026 Call of Duty League season. We recently saw the Riyadh Falcons, FaZe Vegas, and G2 Minnesota all surface amid ‘rostermania’. Merchandise and new jerseys to celebrate the new branding will launch in December, the organization advised.</p>



<h2 id="h-introducing-toronto-koi">Introducing: Toronto KOI</h2>



<p>In a press release, Adam Adamou, the CEO of OverActive Media, Toronto KOI’s parent company, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To be KOI is to belong</p>



<p>KOI has always been about connection, about fans, players and communities coming together under one banner. Toronto KOI brings that spirit home and gives it a global stage. This launch marks an important moment in our global strategy. It connects our North American operations with one of the most recognized and influential brands in global esports. </p>



<p>Bringing this illustrious brand to the Call of Duty League and to Toronto will benefit everyone, our fans, our players, our partners and the broader esports ecosystem. We are building a single, unified brand platform that scales across regions and delivers lasting value for all.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This alignment brings Toronto Ultra into the core OverActive ‘KOI’ branding, offering fans something more tangible to connect to than the arguably arbitrary term ‘Ultra’.</p>



<p>It’s what ROKKR did by taking on the ‘G2 Minnesota’ label, and there are expectations that Gentlemates will deepen brand identity in the coming weeks by ‘moving’ LAG M8 to Paris. It’s a busy time to be a Call of Duty League fan, as everything is changing ahead of the long-awaited Black Ops 7 season.</p>



<p>It already feels like an age since the Call of Duty League Championship wrapped up towards the end of June, and there are still many weeks until the new season starts.</p>



<p>Are you a fan of the new Toronto KOI brand? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Seven legendary ornaments from across the franchise timeline.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Halloween may be right around the corner, but the winter holiday season will come at us just as fast. If you're a big Zelda fan or have special someone in your life that is obsessed, Hallmark has a handful of awesome ornaments spanning the franchise's storied history you can buy right now. Ranging in price from $12 to $32, purchasing one of these won't break the bank and will last for holidays to come. If you're looking for an affordable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-legend-of-zelda-gift-ideas">Legend of Zelda gift</a> to buy ahead of the 2025 Christmas season, this is a delightful option worth considering.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Legend of Zelda Hallmark Ornaments</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pretty much every era from Zelda's history is represented with these ornaments, from the NES original 8-bit Link to 2023's Tears of the Kingdom <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-hallmark-christmas-ornament-amazon-buy-2025">Decayed Master Sword</a>. The Link with his sword and shield ornament is another notable inclusion, since it plays classic Zelda tunes at the push of a button. I personally would have appreciated some Twilight Princess love with this collection, but I can't complain with what's on offer here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each ornament is only a few inches in every dimension, so storing them efficiently in the off-season or utilizing them as year-round decor is definitely on the table. I have a game shelf that the Toon Link ornament would be right at home on. The 8-bit Link ornament is low on stock, so if you've had your eye on it, now's the perfect time to pick one up.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Hallmark Nintendo Ornaments</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, The Legend of Zelda franchise isn't the only <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hallmark-keepsake-ornaments-nitendo-where-to-buy">Nintendo property receiving the Hallmark treatment</a>. There's an Elephant Mario from Super Mario Bros. Wonder would look great on any Christmas tree, and the winter hat Rowlet is one of the cutest things I've ever seen.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Is Hallmark a Good Ornament Brand?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Hallmark isn't the only ornament brand out there, but it is certainly one of the most well-known. The main appeal of Hallmark Keepsake ornaments is that the brand offers yearly releases from popular IPs like Nintendo, Star Wars, Disney, and more. If you're looking for a little piece of your favorite movie or video game to hang on your tree, it's most likely going to be a Hallmark-branded ornament. Seeing as the ornaments are officially-licensed, they are also likely to be of higher quality than any knock-off brands you find elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.

                <p>In side-by-side comparisons, PlayStation 5 games have tended to have an edge over their Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S counterparts. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, however, flips that script by having a better performance on Xbox than either PS5 or PS5 Pro, according to Digital Foundry.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkhp-FUuC7s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zkhp-FUuC7s?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>0n the surface, The Outer Worlds 2 on PS5 and Xbox Series X look very similar, but a closer examination reveals that the former suffers from image breakup, lower resolution, frame rate drops, and screen tearing even in performance mode. Digital Foundry also noted small lighting downgrades in PS5.</p><p>As for the PS5 Pro, the report states that it uses Sony's proprietary upscaler, PSSR, which doesn't interact well with The Outer Worlds 2's lumen lighting or RT lighting effects. The report concludes that PS5 Pro's "frame rate dips and more intense encounters are common, and the general run of play is noticeably worse than Series X in the finished game."

		<p>Lion Shield has announced that players will be able to get their hands on the Roman city builder Nova Roma, with the date being January 22nd 2026. The Nova Roma early access release will be available on both Steam and Epic Game Store. The game is not just about mimicking Rome, but striking out and building an improved version.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nova Roma - Release Date Trailer | Roman City-Builder" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P0Is5zmKugs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Nova Roma, the Roman Empire is falling into decay so you have to lead a small group of citizens to build a new version of the city in new lands. To build successfully you will need to meet the needs of the citizens, and gain the favour of the gods through building temples. Nova Roma is not just a builder where you throw up some buildings a be done with it. You will need to plan where to place dams and aqueducts to get water flowing to the city, without causing floods, and set up supply routes to get raw materials to the city without spreading too quickly.</p>
<p>Advisors and senators will be there to help guide you build Nova Roma, and deal with the different issues that come up which will need balancing. You will need to make sure there is enough variety of entertainment to keep citizens happy after days of working, otherwise they may become unhappy too leading Nova Roma to ruin.</p>

For Hire has piqued our curiosity for years, thanks to its fusion of black-and-white 30s-style animation and shooter mechanics reminiscent of classic Doom games. While it was slated for 2025, developer Fumi Games and publisher PlaySide Studios announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2416450/view/499462068471070731?l=english">the game was sliding into 2026 earlier this week</a>. However, this news also came with the caveat that the release date would be revealed at today's Galaxies Gaming Showcase, and sure enough, we just got a release date trailer. Mouse: P.I. For Hire will launch next year, on March 19.

The two companies will “co-develop transformative AI models, tools, and workflows that empower our artists, designers, and developers to reimagine how content is built,” <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/ea-partners-with-stability-ai">EA says</a>.</p><p>The company says that humans will still be “at the center of storytelling,” but “we’re evolving how we work so that AI becomes a trusted ally: supporting faster iteration, expanding creative possibilities, accelerating workflows, and allowing more time to focus on what matters most – building world-class games and experiences that entertain massive online communities.” EA adds that AI “can draft, generate, and analyze, but it can’t imagine, empathize, or dream. That’s the work of EA’s extraordinary artists, designers, developers, storytellers, and innovators.”</p><p>EA CEO Andrew Wilson has spoken highly of AI in the past, saying last year that the technology is at <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/ea-the-future-of-entertainment-is-interactive-as-dev-looks-to-become-launchpad-for-new-businesses/">“very core”</a> of the company’s business. AI could be embedded in EA’s operations even more in the future: the investor group that is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/787723/ea-private-deal-buyout-future-games-layoffs">looking to take EA private</a> has its eyes on using AI at the company, with the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133"><em>Financial Times</em> reporting that</a> “the investors are betting that AI-based cost cuts will significantly boost EA’s profits in the coming years.” And EA isn’t the only major gaming company looking to increase its use of AI; <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> maker Krafton <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805509/krafton-pubg-ai-first-developer-agentic-gpu-cluster">just announced</a> that it’s investing heavily into AI as part of an “AI First” strategy.</p><p>One of the first initiatives EA and Stability will work on together is “to accelerate the creation of Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials through the development of new artist-driven workflows – for example, tools that generate 2D textures that maintain exact color and light accuracy across any environment,” according to EA. Stability AI <a href="https://stability.ai/news/stability-ai-and-ea-partner-to-reimagine-game-development">notes that</a> the two companies will “also pursue developing AI systems capable of pre-visualizing entire 3D environments from a series of intentional prompts, allowing artists to creatively direct the generation of game content with unmatched speed and precision.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/805777/ea-stability-ai-transformative-game-development-tools]]></content:encoded>

The extended five-minute cut was introduced by studio founder Emanuel Palalic, and offered more gameplay by showing off a squad of THE SYSTEM’S heavily armed police forces storming the grimy halls of a massive apartment complex to terminate a rogue artificial intelligence. They’re quickly given a warm welcome by the ruthless gang lording over the complex, drawing each faction into an explosive firefight that tears the environment to shreds. A quick-thinking officer is able to hijack the consciousness of an unfortunate gang member which allows him to revive a downed teammate by placing them into the mind of this gang member thereby making them part of the friendly team until the end of the match. The squad of police descend further into the guts of the building in order to reboot the entire block, taking their final stand while soaking in the neon lights and lasers of an underground dancefloor. The two-minute short-form version of the gameplay trailer condenses the action down to the highlights in all their destructive glory.</p><p>Initially announced in 2024, <em>DEFECT</em> is a new squad-based cyberpunk shooter, from the creative minds of emptyvessel. <em>DEFECT</em> delivers a new kind of experience through its immersive and highly tactical combat for fans of the action shooter genre.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ion Lands has announced that its cyberpunk slice of life RPG Nivalis, set in the same world as Cloudpunk, will not be making a 2025 release date. Last year, the development team was aiming for a Spring 2025 release but that passed. However, the team did want to get the game out this year. However, there is still work to be done, so Ion Lands has made the decision to delay Nivalis to 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nivalis | Official Summer 2024 Trailer [PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VYykZ9RBo3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a blog post, Ion Lands said, <em>“As you know, our goal over the past year has been to launch the game within 2025. The progress we’ve made in recent months has been both steady and substantial, allowing us to refine every aspect of Nivalis – our unique take on the slice-of-life genre – including all the intertwined, dystopian, and mysterious stories unfolding throughout its streets. However, there’s still one final piece of the puzzle missing.</em></p>
<p><em>Right now, we’re deeply focused on the voice over: we’ve just completed the casting process for over 100 new voice roles after our first casting of 32 roles for our demo 2 years ago. We have received more than 8,000 auditions this time. In Nivalis, there will be around 135 primary and secondary fully voiced characters, for a total of about 200,000 words. They will bring to life the multitude of complex personalities you’ll meet in the game. It’s a massive undertaking that we’re carefully overseeing, because for us this is a key element: as we’ve said many times before, we want the Nivalis experience to be as immersive as possible. So – as some of you correctly guessed after last month’s devlog – between casting, recording, and implementing the voiceover, releasing the game in 2025 would risk compromising its quality.</em></p>
<p><em>For that reason, we’ve made the decision to officially move Nivalis’ release a few months ahead into 2026. This will also allow us to dedicate all the time needed for additional testing, optimization, polishing, and balancing, to ensure the smoothest experience possible. We’re currently working closely with our publisher to determine a specific launch date – which we hope to share before the end of the year. Soon, we’ll let you know when we’ll be able to celebrate ‘Nivalis Day’. Thank you all for your patience, understanding, and incredible support – it’s what gives us the strength and motivation to push through this final stretch.”</em></p>

<p>In Nivalis, you begin with a small business, such as a noodle stand or a small nightclub. Your goal is to grow from these modest origins into a huge enterprise that Nivalis’ citizens will rave about and want to spend their time and money at. However, there’s more to Nivalis than just building up a business. You can get to know some of the city’s inhabitants, go fishing, or just dedicate time to home decoration. Delving into the underworld of Nivalis is also an option, if you want to go that route.</p>

		<p>Yesterday, PlaySide Studios and Fumi Games announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/22/mouse-p-i-for-hire-has-been-pushed-back-to-early-2026/">Mouse: P.I. For Hire had been pushed back to early 2026.</a> Today, the teams have confirmed a concrete release date for the cartoony first person shooter, and players will be able to get their hands on it from March 19th, 2026. The game is coming PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

<p><i>“We are very excited to share our game,&nbsp;<b>MOUSE: P.I. For Hire</b>, with fans across the world on 19 March 2026”</i>, says Mateusz Michalak, CEO &amp; Founder, Fumi Games.&nbsp;<i>“Set in the cartoon-noir city of Mouseburg, MOUSE: P.I. For Hire offers a unique mix of explosive FPS action and hand-drawn rubber hose animation. Stepping into the shoes of Private Investigator Jack Pepper – played by the inimitable Troy Baker – will be an experience that players will not forget!”</i></p>
<p><wbr>In Mouse: P.I. For Hire you play private investigator Jack Pepper, who is being voiced by Troy Baker, in a noir inspired first person shooter drawing on 1930’s animation. The setting is the city of Mouseburg and Jack is initially hired to help a “damsel in distress”. However, things take a turn as the case dives deep into the criminal and corrupt world that lays beneath the surface of the city. There will be numerous areas to explore including the city streets, the sewers, a casino, a film studio, and the docks. All of these locations will have loot and collectibles to gather, along with clues to help Jack solve the case.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-october-24-866/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-866-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-friday-october-24.1333444/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Friday, and as the week comes to a close, I’ve got another round of NYT Connections hints and solutions to help you usher in the weekend. Today’s puzzle was tricky, but I persevered to bring you the hints you need to wrap this NYT Connections puzzle up much faster.</p>



<p>It’s time for the weekend! Let’s get into the NYT Connections hints.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-24">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 24)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #866:</p>



<ul>
<li>BAYWATCH</li>



<li>HIGHLIGHT</li>



<li>RAINBOW</li>



<li>HERRING</li>



<li>PRIME</li>



<li>SUNSET</li>



<li>BOLD</li>



<li>PEACOCK</li>



<li>COOTIE</li>



<li>HEYDAY</li>



<li>KALEIDOSCOPE</li>



<li>UNDERLINE</li>



<li>ZENITH</li>



<li>KINGPIN</li>



<li>STRIKETHROUGH</li>



<li>PINNACLE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These words mark the peak of something — think career highs, golden eras, or when someone was “in their prime.”</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These are all formatting options — the kind you’d find in a word processor or messaging app.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are vibrant by nature — often used metaphorically to describe something dazzling or full of variety.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word ends with something you might wear or carry — but the full word itself isn’t necessarily about fashion.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 24.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-24-866">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 24 (#866)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– HEYDAY, PINNACLE, PRIME, ZENITH</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BOLD, HIGHLIGHT, STRIKETHROUGH, UNDERLINE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – KALEIDOSCOPE, PEACOCK, RAINBOW, SUNSET</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BAYWATCH, COOTIE, HERRING, KINGPIN</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

                <p>Anyone looking to return to the Olympic Exclusion Zone in the first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pacific-drive/">Pacific Drive</a> story DLC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-2024s-best-games-is-getting-a-huge-horror-expansion/1100-6534553/">Whispers in the Woods</a>, are in for a surprise, as the expansion is out right now. In a surprise announcement, developer Ironwood Studios and publisher Kepler Interactive revealed that Whispers in the Woods is now available, and the game has also been ported over to Xbox Series X|S consoles.</p><p>The expansion features a brand-new story and content that Ironwood Studios says is roughly a third of the size of the base game, and it includes new anomalies and horrors to discover.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXRk1pFRgOc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cXRk1pFRgOc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players can also experiment with several new gameplay systems, such as the Whispering Tide. This is described as a "mysterious force that grows more perilous" the longer you linger in the Whispering Woods, and to survive, you'll need to equip specially attuned parts to your station wagon that can keep it at bay. Artifacts from Altars will also be found in the expansion, and these offer reality-warping powers that affect both the environment and you.</p><p>Pacific Drive made a lasting impression when it debuted last year, as the Indie survival game blended a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-pacific-drive-pulls-off-being-unnervingly-spooky-and-relaxingly-chill-all-at-once/1100-6523113/">well-crafted layer of suspense with a surprisingly chill vibe</a> as you explored a creepy patch of the Pacific Northwest from the relative safety of your station wagon.</p><p>"With its wonderful depth in both story and gameplay, Pacific Drive is an early hit in 2024," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pacific-drive-review-road-trippy/1900-6418183/">Pacific Drive review</a>. "It sets out to create a world that fits comfortably in the New Weird genre but brings its own style and substance to it. Though the game can be especially hard to decipher, difficulty options help to counter some of its more overwhelming aspects. I'll stick to bikes in my day-to-day life through the actual northwest, but in Pacific Drive, I'm up for another joy ride through one hell of a winding road."</p>

		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>

		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>A new datamine points from <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1981402959180427611">X (formerly Twitter) user ModernWarzone</a> points to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/">the battle royale mode</a> for Battlefield 6 shadow-dropping next week when the game's Season 1 update arrives on October 28, 2025.</p>



<p>According to ModernWarzone, the new mode which is codenamed "<em>Granite</em>" will be fully revealed first on October 27 with a trailer before it goes live the next day on October 28. It's worth noting that we've heard nothing concrete from EA and Battlefield Studios about when the battle royale mode will arrive, and that it has not been included in any promotional materials for the game's Season 1 roadmap.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>BREAKING: A new content drop for Battlefield 6 that is NOT Season 1 codenamed “Granite” with release date of October 28th has been datamined from the EA App. 🗓️</p><p>Think it’s safe to say this is the BF6 Battle Royale. 🪂</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/onebattlefield?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@onebattlefield</a> for sending the info over to me 🫡 <a href="https://t.co/H3xaZpWmne">pic.twitter.com/H3xaZpWmne</a></p></div>— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1981402959180427611?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>According to ModernWarzone, this is partly due to EA not wanting to immediately pull focus away from Battlefield 6's core offering, its multiplayer modes. If that's true, then that's likely because the coming battle royale will be free-to-play and likely a separate offering compared to the core Battlefield 6 game. Essentially, it'll be just like how you can play Call of Duty: Warzone for free, but to jump into the multiplayer for the new annual Call of Duty release, you'll have to buy the latest entry.</p>



<p>Just yesterday from the time of this writing, Wccftech and several other media outlets <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">shared hands-on impressions with the Season 1 content set to arrive next week</a>, including the new maps and game modes, the first batch of which arrives on October 28, the second on November 18, and the third on December 9.</p>



<p>The new maps both look stunning and like they'll be solid additions to Battlefield 6, but the new game modes, both the permanent one arriving next week and the limited-time mode coming in November failed to impress, and at least in their current state, are rather stale and boring.</p>



<p>If this battle royale mode does arrive next week, then that certainly gives Season 1 a huge boost compared to what it already has available. </p>

            <p>Watch out. There's a musician mystery afoot. They've gone missing, mysteriously. So says Silver Pines, a Twin Peaks-inspired survival horror puzzler that's set to arrive next year, according to an announcement trailer that's just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/galaxies-autumn-25-showcase-how-to-watch">barged into my house</a> in a trench coat, waving a gun about and demanding to know whether I did it.</p>
<p>No, I respond calmly, there are no missing musicians around here. For a moment, I fear he might notice the outline of a guitar's headstock buried under the carpet. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, he says, as all detective-ish types do. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...</p>

<p>I try to distract him by asking for more information about Silver Pines. It's by developers Wych Elm, he says. You must roam the small town filled with horrors to survive, doing puzzles to unlock different areas and managing your resources. Arrrrrrggghhhhhh, I scream, resource management! Shhhhh, he replies, let me read you the plot synopsis to calm you down:</p>
<blockquote>Private investigator Red Walker finds himself in Silver Pines, a place half-abandoned, half-forgotten, in the middle of nowhere on a job to track down vanished musician Eddie Velvet. As the case begins to reveal a dark past, Walker soon slips into a strange and nightmarish descent beyond his control.</blockquote>
<p>The exploration's a bit Metroidvaniay, he claims, and you'll need to find better tools and weapons to open up more bits. Ok, I reply, the roaming around a small town as a moody investigator clearly going through some shit intrigues me, even if this certainly isn't pitching itself to be as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>y in an RPG sense as my brain sort of wishes it was.</p><p>It's set to arrive at some point in 2026, he says, and you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2333000/Silver_Pines/">Steam</a>. Nice, I respond, hoping the ensuing awkward silence will drive him away. He turns towards the door, takes a few steps, and brutally stubs his toe on the telltale head. Watch out, I whisper as he writhes on the floor.</p>

            <p>Looking back on it, when I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockbeasts-is-about-managing-an-animal-band-in-a-bojack-style-world-but-itll-need-to-do-more-than-horse-around">played a preview build</a> of zoological band management game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rockbeasts">Rockbeasts</a> earlier this year, I think I went along with it a bit too easily. I didn't question why people were now animals, how those animals had acquired the opposable thumbs necessary to play Black Sabbath riffs, or whether the bulldog version of Simon Cowell I signed up with at the end might have any ulterior motives.</p>
<p>Luckily, the clearly Bojack Horseman-inspired game about trying to get some musicians you've dubbed Pearl Spam to their gig on time, so they can jam out in their silly hats, has a gotten a fresh trailer at today's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/galaxies-autumn-25-showcase-how-to-watch">Galaxies showcase</a> that asks some of those questions for me.</p>

<p>I'll admit, I didn't think too hard about the whole furry angle. Mainly because I was afraid of potential retaliation from the unaccountable security services they operate in order to support their efforts to bend the will of the world to their own greedy purposes. Actually, wait, maybe I'm getting them mixed up with the billionaires.</p><p>Either way, this trailer offers a few quick peeks at stuff and scenes that weren't in the opening chapter of developers Lichthund's game that I've played. I, regretfully, am yet to pick a colour for a guitar or meet the llama version of Lemmy from Motorhead. I did, however, meet the cat guy who sings towards the end. He was cool. Here's an excerpt from my musings:</p>
<blockquote>All in all, there’s potential here, and some indication in the intro - which scored big GTA 4 nostalgia points with me by having Iggy Pop host a rock radio station - that the events of you guiding the band to superstardom in the 90s will echo into what they’re up to nearer the present day. If Rockbeasts is to properly sell out stadiums, though, it’ll have to prove it’s more than just a tribute band.</blockquote>
<p>Rockbeasts remains release dateless for now, but you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1445880/ROCKBEASTS/">Steam</a> if you're so inclined.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>When I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dualsense-edge-controller-playstation-5-review-kotaku-1850018508"><span>agreed to review the DualSense Edge</span></a><span> for this here </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>period com, I didn’t know I was getting ready to break my brain from decades of video game muscle memory habits. I hadn’t used a modular controller before, and I wanted to approach the PS5 premium controller from the perspective of someone who maybe didn’t see what all the fuss was about. Every video game I play already has button assignments for any action I could do. What was the point of putting two extras on the back? But once I saw the light, it became nearly impossible for me to go back to a standard DualSense, and when I do hold one of the default controllers, I feel my fingers scratching at the back for back paddles that are no longer there.</span></p> <p><span>This came up today because Sony is selling a </span><a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/dualsense-wireless-controller-god-of-war-20th-anniversary-limited-edition"><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>20th anniversary DualSense controller</span></a><span> stylized to look like the titular god Kratos’ ash-white skin and blood-red tattoos. I like the design of the controller a lot, and even if I didn’t love </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-release-date-ps4-ps5-spear-1849734382"><i><span>Ragnarök</span></i></a> <span>(the excellent </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-dlc-review-1851097244"><i><span>Valhalla </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span> really brought me around on it, though), Kratos still occupies a cozy little place in my heart. In another life, I would have scooped it up, even at the whopping $85 price point. But that hefty chunk of change gave me pause. That’s grocery money for a controller that, in all likelihood, I wasn’t going to use. I’ve become so accustomed to having back paddles after two years of playing games with my DualSense Edge that the standard PS5 controller feels almost like a toy in my hands. So if I did buy this Kratos-themed controller, it would probably just be a display item. And that’s a pretty expensive thing to stick on shelf space I don’t have here in the Big Apple.</span></p>

 <p><span>I’ve bought controllers I don’t use before. I own an Xbox Pride controller that sits on my shelf next to all my </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>stuff because </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lgbtq-games-mass-effect-romance-options-overwatch-pride-1850586480"><span>Kaidan Alenko made me gay as a teenager</span></a><span>. But that was a special case where I saw something covered in rainbows and reacted accordingly. Nowadays, I default to my DualSense Edge whenever I can, so I’m not just picky with my money, I’m picky with my controllers. The Edge isn’t even the best version of a modular controller, as it’s pretty limited compared to its contemporaries like the Xbox Elite, but it has rewired my brain to reach for back paddles in shooters and action games.</span></p>

 <p><span>The moment it all changed for me was when I was testing the Edge for our review while playing </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>. As I described in my review, a Pharah was flying behind my team’s backline and shooting rockets down upon my helpless supports. As Soldier: 76, I reloaded while turning around to shoot down my airborne foe. I had mapped the square button to the right paddle and could turn the right analog stick with my thumb to change where I was facing, rather than having to pick between the two actions. That split-second difference saved me from getting blown up, and it was all thanks to this bougie-ass controller. It’s such a small change, but I’ve gotten so used to having the option that my brain defaults to it now. I usually have jump mapped to the left paddle and either reload or dodge on the right. For the longest time, I would have to remap buttons in action games to the default </span><i><span>Devil May Cry </span></i><span>control scheme because I spent so much time playing the old PS2 games that the layout had hardwired itself into my brain. The circle button is the dodge button, right? It’s supposed to be! Now, my hands naturally search for a back paddle to move out of the way. Even when I’m playing games on my Switch 2 like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>, I’m wishing I had an easy dodge button on the back of my Joy-Cons.</span></p> <p><span>I know it’s an unreasonable ask, but I would be so much more inclined to buy these special controllers if Sony made Edge variants, so I didn’t feel like I was sacrificing function for the sake of the aesthetic. And now it’s hard for me to justify buying collector’s items when my tiny apartment only has so much room. You think I didn’t want that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-ps5-controller-last-of-us-dualsense-ugly-price-sony-1851768135"><span>kinda dumb-looking </span><i><span>Last of Us </span></i><span>controller</span></a><span>? Although now that I’m looking at it, I probably could have fit it on my </span><i><span>TLOU </span></i><span>shelf next to the Joel statue. Actually, never mind, I looked at the price again. Maybe I should look into modding these controllers myself. There’s gotta be some sicko out there who’s willing to mess with all the circuitry and put these back paddles on the Kratos controller.</span></p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/tormented-souls-2-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tormented-souls-2-review.1333390/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With its unsettling backdrops and detailed worldbuilding, Tormented Souls 2 may <em>look </em>like a contemporary horror game, but don't let that modern dressing fool you. At its core beats the blackened heart of stone-cold classics like Resident Evil and Silent Hill, with all the treats — and tricks — that both endeared me to and enraged me about these formulaic survival horror games when they first gained popularity. Fixed camera angles? Check. Tank controls? Check. Insanely complex puzzles and an even more bizarre story, complete with cheesy dialogue and a manual save system? Check, check, check, and check. It makes Tormented Souls 2 a surprisingly faithful homage, bringing back all the stuff I loved about old survival horror games… as well as many of the things I loved to hate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tormented Souls 2 picks up right after the events of its 2021 predecessor, but you don't have to have met the Walker sisters before to make sense of this sequel. That’s partly because it tells a standalone story, and partly because it's so fantastical that nothing makes sense anyway. Sure, you may have questions about Caroline's fetching eyepatch, but all you really need to know is she’s searching for answers about her little sister Anna's terrifying visions and reality-bending drawings. For reasons that seem to exist exclusively in schlocky horror tales, that answer apparently sits somewhere in the depths of a creepy convent nestled in a far-flung location. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Before Caroline even gets the chance to shrug off her (exceedingly 90s) leather jacket, though, Anna goes missing, and it's up to the older sibling to both find her sister and figure out what the hell is going on before it's too late… with an emphasis on the “hell” bit, naturally. As stories go, it's not unique, no, but the twists and turns of Tormented Souls 2's roughly 20-hour campaign are delightfully over-the-top in the same way the original Resident Evil games are. It’s packed with cheesy dialogue, curious flavor text, and some truly bizarre encounters I couldn’t help but smile at. Caroline's stay in the remote town of Villa Hess will take you to a number of wonderfully grim places, including a processing plant, spooky school, abandoned mall, bunker, and the sprawling convent you start off in, keeping the creepy environments feeling fresh.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And those environments are so detailed! Stuffed with interest and plenty of lore, Villa Hess and its surroundings are such fascinating, atmospheric places to explore. You never know when a key item or a helpful tool may be secreted away in a hidden room somewhere, so it's always best to keep your curiosity piqued. While your investigation is sometimes interrupted by a bladed demon or shambling zombie, you'll find that enemies have a tendency to stay dead in Tormented Souls 2 — once you've cleared out an area, you're usually left to explore at your leisure. With little more than a flickering candle to guide the way, though, it's a little too easy to miss things; I've been caught out a couple of times by overlooking a key clue or item, even in areas I <em>thought</em> I'd examined pretty closely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As is seemingly the law for old-school survival horror, the more you play, the more you'll find yourself opening up new routes to old places, providing access to rooms and entire areas that were previously blocked off. I suspect the backtracking will irk some — there's a lot of it, particularly early on — but as the levels and fetch-quests are well-designed and usually rewarding, I couldn't begrudge it. That said, there's a reason fixed camera angles and tank controls are considered relics of the past. I grew up playing the games Tormented Souls 2 pays homage to (Resident Evil, Silent Hill 3, Parasite Eve, Alone in the Dark), but moving around Villa Hess is frustrating even when there isn't a demon on your tail, with tight corridors and dead ends that make getting from one side of a building to the other unduly long-winded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Add in Caroline's fear of the dark: she'll freeze and start to hyperventilate if plunged into darkness for even a split second, dying completely if you leave her there too long. You can’t even put away your lighter to shatter a porcelain pot or smash open a wooden crate unless there's an ambient light source nearby… which there very often isn't. The lighter sure does add to the atmosphere, though, which is almost continually tense and unnerving. As the primary source of light quite often, you'll have to proactively step into a room to illuminate what, if anything, is hiding in the shadows, which inevitably means unwittingly getting up close and personal with the denizens skulking around the place. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Vikki's List of Classic Horror Games That Deserve a Remake</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It all falls apart a bit when there <em>is</em> something hiding in the dark, though. Tormented Souls 2's combat isn't clumsy as much as it is enraging. The reliance on Caroline's lighter means you're often unarmed when something lunges at you, and the fixed camera angles and stiff character movement make it harder than it should be to retreat or create a little distance. Caroline protects herself with a range of acquired and improvised weapons, from a shotgun to a nail gun. Some of them can be upgraded to improve their rate of fire or reload speed, but they're still slow to use and difficult to wield accurately in a panic. I know it's kind of a genre convention to ensure we feel weak and underpowered, but this could've been achieved through scarcer ammo or by throwing more enemies at us; inefficient weapons and fixed cameras don't ramp up the tension as much as snap the immersion entirely. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly, that jankiness follows you into boss fights. One of the first you'll encounter, a giant nun, stomps around the room trying to batter you with a gigantic steel cross. But in that one single room, there are at least <em>three</em> different fixed camera angles, which means you may find yourself inadvertently sprinting <em>towards</em> your foe if the camera shifts while trying to put distance between you. This wouldn't be so bad if your shotgun held more than two shots at a time or if the nun flinched with each hit, but she'll keep galloping like an aggravated rhino, which made the camera feel like the real boss I was fighting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, for every underwhelming boss fight you're forced to endure, you'll happen across a good half-dozen puzzles which confuse and delight in equal measure. I never felt closer to an old Resident Evil or Silent Hill game than trying to figure out how to open a door, or decode a cipher, or prise open the jaws of a dead shark for reasons I still don't quite understand. Often deeply cryptic, maddeningly illogical, or completely unsolvable because I stupidly missed a clue somewhere, these puzzles were exactly what I want from a game like this, all the way down to the mini-puzzles that ask you to combine specific items in your inventory. Yes, I'll admit one or two (or five) brain teasers truly stumped me for an embarrassing amount of time, but if that isn't old-school survival horror, then what is?</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">If you're nostalgic for the survival horror games of old, Tormented Souls 2 can provide a modern-looking trip down memory lane, with all the good and bad that brings. It has a tense atmosphere to soak up and some gorgeously spooky locations to explore, but you’ll need to push through janky combat and a bit of backtracking to enjoy them. Its esoteric puzzles really test your brainpower in a way that could sometimes frustrate, but also delighted the part of me that missed smashing key items together to see what would happen. There's a lot to enjoy here, as well as plenty that perhaps should have remained in the past, but Tormented Souls 2 still manages to stand as an entertaining callback to the adventures that made contemporary horror gaming what it is.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/tormented-souls-2-review]]></content:encoded>
