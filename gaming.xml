<p>At least, according to Kadokawa's latest financial report</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="38beb9716a6bd"><a title="The Duskbloods" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38beb9716a6bd/the-duskbloods.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: FromSoftware</em></figcaption></figure><p>If everything goes to plan, FromSoftware is poised to have a big 2026 on the Nintendo Switch 2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a> were announced at the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct in April 2025, but things have been pretty quiet for both games since.</p>
<p>However, both titles have been mentioned in Kadokawa's (FromSoftware's owner) <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/198090/00.pdf">Earnings Report for Q3 2025/26</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fromsoftware-owner-reiterates-duskbloods-is-still-coming-this-year-exclusive-to-nintendo-switch-2/">VGC</a>), and both are still aiming for a 2026 release window. Unfortunately, responses in the report are pretty vague, but at least both games are still alive, right?</p><div><figure data-videoid="DE5HpSoUj-c" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytDE5HpSoUj-c" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed60ecbbvylirh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>When asked about a release date for Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Kadokawa merely states that "we have yet to announce a specific release date", but the question does wonder whether the game is included in the fiscal year's outlook, which Kadokawa "[has] not disclosed". So maybe don't expect it in the next month.</p>
<p>It's a similar story for The Duskbloods, where Kadokawa again says it hasn't announced "a specific release date". The report does confirm that it'll be sold on a joint basis with Nintendo "with sales responsibilities divided by region" and reiterates that the game will be a Switch 2 exclusive.</p>

<p>So, that's all we're getting for now, it seems. We'll likely just have to wait until the next big Nintendo Direct to hear <em>something</em>. And even then, it isn't a guarantee.</p>
<p>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition was actually meant to come out in 2025; as a port of the critically-acclaimed open world RPG, it'll include a few brand new jobs and includes the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. Early hands-on reports at Gamescom 2025 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">were pretty negative</a> regarding the state of the port, but fans and critics have come away <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/heres-another-look-at-elden-ring-running-on-switch-2">a bit happier with later builds</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we've heard or seen next to nothing of The Duskbloods since its reveal, besides a brief little clip at The Game Awards last year and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-duskbloods-could-be-fromsoftwares-most-ambitious-game-yet-according-to-leak">a little leaker tidbit</a> which claims the game contains "many innovative elements the team themselves are very proud of". We know it's a PvPvE game where you pick a vampire-like character and customise them in order to go out and fight others online, and... that's about it.</p>
<p>Regardless, we're looking forward to seeing more of them this year, hopefully.</p>

            <guid>1433770</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>This is </em><a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lowpass<em> by Janko Roettgers</em></a><em>, a newsletter on the ever-evolving intersection of tech and entertainment, syndicated just for </em>The Verge<em> subscribers once a week.</em></p><p>The VR industry has been on edge since Meta’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/13/meta-lays-off-vr-employees-underscoring-zuckerbergs-pivot-to-ai.html">massive job cuts</a> earlier this year: One exec <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7419479403338063872/?originTrackingId=CeYxewxGYg9OrLSe80rfkA%3D%3D">called</a> the layoff announcements “one of VR’s darkest weeks.” There’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/24/metas-reality-labs-cuts-sparked-fears-of-a-vr-winter.html">talk of a VR winter</a>, and multiple VR studios have conducted <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/pistol-whip-developer-cloudhead-lays-off-70-percent-of-staff/">significant</a> <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/walkabout-mini-golf-layoffs/">layoffs</a> of their own.</p><p>For <em>Gorilla Tag</em> maker Another Axiom, however, it’s monkey — or monke, as they’d say — business as usual. The <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/section/891919991406810/">most popular</a> game on Meta’s Quest VR headset reached a new audience high this past weekend, when 119,000 players joined its five-year anniversary event in-game at the same time.</p><p>“We broke the world record, as we understand it, of concurrent players in VR,” says Another Axiom chief marketing officer Jake Zim. (Social VR app VRChat boasted <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/vrchat-nye-user-record/">150,000</a> concurrent users over New Year’s, but that number included people who accessed its 3D worlds on flat screens).</p><p>It’s not just special events: <em>Gorilla Tag </em>attracts up to a million VR users every day. Most of them <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-gorilla-tag-became-a-generational-obsession-and-conquered-vr/1100-6526437/">are Gen Alpha</a>, and they all battle each other in chaotic games of tag, powered by its unique style of arm-swinging locomotion. The free-to-play game frequently leads the <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/section/258035155854818">bestseller charts</a> of Meta’s Quest store. The game’s characters, known as monkes, have become so popular that Another Axiom regularly sells out of plush toys; total merch sales have reached close to $10 million, according to Zim.</p><p>“The fandom is bigger than just VR,” Zim tells me.</p><p>That’s why Another Axiom now has plans to expand beyond headsets: The company is working on a mobile game, a live event, and even a TV show. “We believe that the lore and the world of <em>Gorilla Tag</em> can tell so many stories,” Zim says.</p><p>Of course, there is a flip side to those planned expansion moves: Five years in, and with no bigger titles to catch up to, execs at Another Axiom are acutely aware that there may be a ceiling to VR, and that Meta’s cutbacks are clouding the medium’s future. “VR as an ecosystem is very challenged,” Zim admits. “With all the changes at Meta, this is a transition moment at best for VR.”</p><p>A transition moment that arguably caught Meta itself by surprise. For years, the company bet on gaming, fitness, and social VR to take headsets mainstream. Some of those efforts arguably worked: Meta sold <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/quest-sales-20-million-retention-struggles/">millions of headsets</a>. The Meta-owned VR rhythm game <em>Beat Saber</em> <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/beat-saber-255-million-revenue/">surpassed $250 million</a> in revenue in 2022, and several other VR games, <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/gorilla-tag-revenue-vr-success-another-axiom/">including <em>Gorilla Tag</em></a>, have since seen their revenue numbers top $100 million (“We’re significantly beyond that,” Zim tells me without providing further details).</p><p>But Meta’s bet on its Horizon Worlds metaverse arguably fell flat, and many AAA VR games have seen their audiences dwindle, leading Meta to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/861420/meta-reality-labs-layoffs-vr-studios-twisted-pixel-sanzaru-armature">close several internal VR studios</a>. Instead, VR has seen a massive influx of younger players who prefer chaotic free-to-play titles over polished and more expensive single-player games. And while many of these younger players <a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/state-of-vr-2025-meta-cuts-quest-sales">have picked up Meta’s entry-level Quest 3S headset</a>, overall audience growth has happened “less quickly than we had hoped,” as Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth <a href="https://sources.news/p/why-meta-did-its-big-metaverse-layoffs">recently told Alex Heath</a>.</p><p>All of this has led to significant changes even beyond last month’s layoffs. Meta is shifting some of its massive Reality Labs spending toward AR and wearables and has reportedly <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-delaying-ultralight-headset-starting-work-on-quest-4/">delayed a lightweight headset</a> optimized for video viewing. Third-party headsets from Lenovo and Asus <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-horizon-os-third-party-headset-cancelled-asus-lenovo/">have been canceled</a>, and Horizon Worlds development resources are being redirected toward mobile gaming.</p><p>Zim would still like to believe that there is a silver lining to all of this. “Pulling back on [Horizon Worlds] and allowing what essentially is an indie, third-party app market to exist is a good thing,” he says. At the same time, he knows that a lack of cash infusion from Meta could lead to a talent drain. And if the company decided to not release any subsidized, affordable headsets in the future, it could further hamper the VR industry.</p><p>“2026 is this bridge year,” Zim tells me. “It’s not just [about] surviving, but figuring out how to speak directly to your audience, and put your audience into places that make sense for a business.”</p><p>For Another Axiom, that also means looking beyond the headset. The company hired former Scopely executive Austin Ashcraft as its GM of mobile last year, with Zim telling me that “getting onto platforms that are not VR is a massively strategic, important thing for us to do.” Those efforts may not stop at mobile. “We’ve been working on a variety of different, unique versions of the game that really hold the IP and what’s valuable about it sacred, but put it into formats and on media where it’s going to make sense,” he says.</p><p>Last summer, Another Axiom also hired Michael Vogel, who previously worked on animated shows like <em>My Little Pony</em> and <em>Strawberry Shortcake</em> at Hasbro and WildBrain. “We will make a TV show,” Zim confirms. “We are working on that.” He declined to share further details, but added that the company has been producing its own in-house web shows <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@_GorillaTagVR">for YouTube</a> for some time. “We’re getting tens of millions of views on our owned-and-operated channel,” he says.</p><p>Another Axiom is also experimenting with new business models, and launched a subscription for superfans this month. And finally, the company is going ahead with plans to hold its own real-world event dubbed Gorillacon — something Zim <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jakezim_what-ifand-im-just-dreaming-out-loud-activity-7425344756332847104--Wb7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAAcdcBuvSnY381oPoJdqGqUnAWoJeDkTo">cheekily teased as a possibility</a> on LinkedIn a few days ago.</p><p>“We knew the fans wanted it,” he says. “It’s going to happen.”</p><p>Zim again declined to share additional details — but if you’ve ever spent any time inside the chaotic world of <em>Gorilla Tag</em>, you’ll know that it’s probably going to be bananas.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTM1Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Janko Roettgers</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/column/877473/gorilla-tag-vr-winter-quest]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The fine frigate which serves as the featured image for this article is called the Stately Gunwale. That's not a name I, the boat's creator, gave it. It's a name ShipShaper's demo automatically assigned my vessel when I picked the set of colours I wished it to be painted. Quite frankly, I doubt I could have dreamed up a more fitting moniker for my deliberate attempt to fling something funky onto the high seas.</p>

<p>ShipShaper's the latest creation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-falconeer-review">The Falconeer</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulwark-falconeer-chronicles-review">Bulwark</a> developer Tomas Sala, who describes it thusly:</p>
<blockquote>I’ve always loved ships and boats, perhaps it's the idea of going off to explore or an enduring fascination with the ocean. But I love ships. Over the last years I've known that ships would be at the centre of any Falconeer/Bulwark follow up, and what started out as a little folly made for Bulwark has grown into its own thing. ShipShaper is a small, explorative shipbuilder I made for the simple pleasure of shaping boats and ships. You pull, push, and drag forms into place, creating everything from humble fishing vessels to tall ships, ironclads, and early dreadnoughts. There’s no grid, no ‘meta’, and no right answer. Just shapes, balance, and the slow satisfaction of something coming together.</blockquote>
<p>Starting off with a small, bare template, you stretch and bend you boat into whatever shape you like. I stuck a big hump in the middle of the deck, because that's practical, then peppered masts, exhausts, and gun turrets about with reckless abandon. The engine cover is wedged halfway through the hull, and the sides are stocked with protruding galley oars which don't touch the water and cannons pointed at impractical angles. An anchor and some flaps round out a ship that should fare well at sea, when its prow isn't jutting underwater.</p><p>Once you've built the thing, you can snap some screenshots of it in a waterborne diorama. Sala has teased that "the full game will come with an open creative license to use the ships you create in any way you want for your own game development, boardgame or modding venture". You'll also be able 3D print your ship or import into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bulwark">Bulwark</a>.</p>
<p>It's well worth spending at least five minutes playing around with ShipShaper, which doesn't have a release date as of writing. You can find its demo and wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4339280/ShipShaper/">Steam</a>, if you're so inclined.</p>

              <p>Who remembers<a href="https://kotaku.com/spectre-divide-shroud-refunds-season-1-shutting-down-1851769661"><em> Spectre Divide</em></a>? It was a 2024 tactical first-person multiplayer shooter with eye-catching stylized art style and a novel gameplay hook: you could swap between clones during matches as you hunted enemies and defended objectives. It came out around the same time as <em>Concord</em> and briefly seemed like an antidote to its excesses and shortcomings. Instead, it just failed more slowly and less spectacularly.</p> <p>It was made by Mountaintop Studios, which was founded in 2020 by ex-Oculus guys Nate Mitchell and Matt Hansen, who had the ears of investors. Seizing on gaming’s boom during the early pandemic, <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/mountaintop-studios-30m-funding-shoud-zedd/">they turned $5.5 million in seed money into a $30 million early funding round</a>. They continued raising tens of millions as the game approached launch and tried to make a splash with contributions from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0wXIu-HUq0">high-profile streamers like Shroud</a>.</p>

 <p><em>Spectre Divide</em> came out in September 2024 and peaked at over 30,000 concurrents on Steam, only to instantly begin its long and painful descent. A barrage of complaints about server issues and latency immediately tanked the Steam rating, followed by frustrations over matchmaking fairness and the lack of common features like a battle pass. It was a free-to-play game, so the barrier to entry was low, but some cosmetic bundles were absurdly overpriced.</p> <p>“That fucking killed us,” Hansen <a href="https://80.lv/articles/nate-mitchell-and-matt-hansen-on-the-death-of-spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios">told <em>80.lv</em></a> last year. “It killed our early momentum, which is critical for any new game.” By they time they addressed all of the early problems, the player counts were too low on PC to get fast and fair matchmaking, let alone generate meaningful post-launch revenue to keep the game afloat. Mountaintop pivoted to releasing a console version as soon as possible but it was already too late. <em>Spectre Divide</em> was in a death spiral.</p>

 <h2>The dead game death sentence</h2> <p>It made a bad first impression, with intrigue over the innovative take on what was essentially <em>Counter-Strike</em> in a bubblegum wrapper overshadowed by review-bombing over legitimate but temporary issues. Most players quickly popped back to their existing online games of choice. Anyone new who came along found a much slower, more lopsided matchmaking pool to introduce them to the game.</p>

 <p>Who wants to be caught buying a ticket for the Titanic after it’s already hit the iceberg? Who wants to be seen eating at a restaurant that’s almost entirely empty, no matter how good their tacos or smash burger are? A month after launch,<em> Spectre Divide</em> had a peak concurrent count of just under 3,000 players and was already battling the “dead game” stench wafting around its subreddit and Steam review comments.</p> <p>“The player count is such a self-fulfilling prophecy in and of itself,” Mitchell told me at the time. He called Steam concurrents the new Metacritic scores, a metric to batter games around with in service of competing agendas and narratives. “If people see the player count going up, then their articles get written about it, and then people come in, if it’s going down, people write articles, they’re like, this game’s not going to be around so I’m not going to invest my time in it. And it’s such a tough thing. I don’t think we expected that [back when we started development].”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000668229" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000668229"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000668229">Mountaintop Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>He continued, “‘Dead game’ is not the most constructive feedback. So I much prefer when someone writes online, ‘Hey, the gunplay is not for me, and here’s why, and here’s how I think they should change it.’ But ultimately, it’s okay, you know, it’s on us…we deserve some of those, you know, sort of dead game memes at the end of the day.” In hindsight a year later, Hansen told <em>80.lv</em>, “Some players were saying it was a dead game within one day of release but we always felt like we were one update away from turning things around.”</p> <p>The Mountaintop founders have tried to Monday-morning-quarterback what might have turned things around for <em>Spectre Divide</em>. Delaying development to launch in a better place? Saving the marketing and media blitz for day-one instead of a closed beta? Mountaintop took a $65 million shot and missed. Some players looked at <em>Spectre Divide</em> and immediately felt it was destined to fail. Even months after the game shut down in early 2025, Mitchell believed that wasn’t the case. “In a parallel universe where we didn’t have the server issues, where the community wasn’t frustrated with our early pricing that rankled people, where maybe we had a bit more money for marketing, we could have gotten the critical mass going,” he said.</p> <p>I’m sure all of these questions are similar to the ones currently facing Wildlight Entertainment’s developers, the majority of whom <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-studio-developer-layoffs-wildlight-entertainment-2000667841">were laid off</a> this week, less than a month after <em>Highguard</em>‘s launch. When online multiplayer projects get such a small window to make their mark and find a foothold in an ever more competitive landscape that’s already crowded with too many games, how can you not begin to second-guess every little choice, from where to allocate resources early in development to how many heroes and modes to debut at launch?</p>

 <h2><em>Highguard</em>‘s race against time</h2> <p>Would deciding against revealing <em>Highguard</em> at the Game Awards 2025 have saved it weeks and weeks of bad online buzz, or would it have just made it that much harder to get anyone to pay attention once the game was out? Would a 5v5 mode on day one have kept more players around than the more boring 3v3 it started with? Would better performance on PC for less powerful gaming rigs have spared <em>Highguard</em> an immediate onslaught of negative drive-by Steam reviews? Would pitching its launch as an open beta or early access period have lowered the expectations it got graded against?</p> <p>No one knows the answers to these questions, or whether magically knowing them would matter in the scheme of a game that, at the end of the day, many agree can be interesting and fun but just isn’t as fully baked as its mountain of competition, from <em>Arc Raiders</em> and <em>Deathlock</em> to <em>Marvel Rivals</em> and <em>Overwatch</em>. What has become increasingly clear, however, is that once caught in a live-service death spiral, you need more than good ideas and some extra runway to escape it.</p>

 <p>It seems absurd to launch a multiplayer game and lay most of its creators off before the one-month anniversary, but short of pulling a rabbit out of a hat, it’s hard to imagine momentum ever meaningfully shifting back in a game like <em>Highguard</em>‘s favor. Comeback stories like those around <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>No Man’s Sky</em> are still extremely rare in the live-service space. When it works, it’s usually because you have massive publishers with huge franchises on the line–<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>,<em> Rainbow Six Siege</em>, <em>Fallout 76</em>–and even then it takes tons of money, years of scrambling, and more than a little luck to pull off a miracle.</p> <p>Most multiplayer games have none of those things, and sometimes even when they check all the boxes it’s still not enough. Wildlight wanted to create a game that “people love and [that] becomes a part of them,” studio head and game director Chad Grenier <a href="https://www.polygon.com/highguard-wildlight-interactive-interview/">told <em>Polygon</em></a> a week before<em> Highguard</em>‘s launch. “Whether it gets a thousand people or a hundred million people, it doesn’t matter. What matters most is that the game is loved by the people who played it.” It might have mattered most, but it didn’t matter enough.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/spider-noir-amazon-episodes-premiere-date-nicolas-cage-2000668226</link>
            <guid>1433749</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Nicolas Cage’s Spider-Man Noir was one of the surprise fan favorites from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-beyond-the-spiderverse-release-date-images-1851774004"><i><span>Spider-Verse </span></i><span>movies</span></a><span>. The actor used his Massive Talent and put on one of the more memorable performances in a movie full of them, even though he didn’t have as much screentime as Miles, Gwen, and Peter. The idea of a broody, monochromatic detective Spider-Man was a new concept to some fans, but Spider-Man Noir was introduced long before he showed up in the multiversal animated movies. Now, he’s getting his own live-action show, but not as Peter Parker; instead as Ben Reilly, and that name carries a lot more questions than answers. We have the first trailer for the series, and it looks pretty cool.</span></p> <p><span>The eight-episode series stars Cage as an older version of Spider-Man who is a detective in New York during the 1930s. Ben is a bit of a burnout, which is refreshing after every Spider-Man being a standup citizen who saves the day because it’s right. But if you’re unfamiliar with Ben, this might not be the best introduction to him, as Cage’s character seems to be a composite character of Spider-Man Noir and the Scarlet Spider. In the comics, Ben Reilly is a clone of Peter Parker who has taken on different roles and aliases as the years have gone on. It’s unclear if naming Cage’s character Ben is a nod to another </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>story, or if it’s going to actually play into some twist down the line.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><i><span>Spider-Noir </span></i><span>will premiere on Amazon on May 27, and will be available in both color and black-and-white to capture the character and comic’s original black-and-white color scheme. Based on the views of the YouTube trailers, it looks like folks might be gravitating toward the monochromatic filter. That feels fitting.</span></p>  <p><span>Though it’s being released on Amazon, this show is technically part of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-movies-ranked-tom-holland-spiderman-1851670709"><span>Sony’s extended </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>universe</span></a><span>, which has mostly bombed with absolute stinkers like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/madame-web-movie-reviews-rotten-tomatoes-reaction-1851264337"><i><span>Madame Web</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/morbius-memes-jared-leto-movie-theaters-marvel-sony-bom-1849024089"><i><span>Morbius</span></i></a><span>. The </span><i><span>Venom </span></i><span>movies were kind of okay, sometimes. Really, </span><i><span>Spider-Verse </span></i><span>is the best thing Sony has done as it’s held onto the movie license, other than partnering with Marvel to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-brand-new-day-trailer-leaks-avengers-doomsday-2000654144"><span>bring Peter Parker to the MCU</span></a><span>, and hopefully some of the brilliance of those animated movies has rubbed off on </span><i><span>Spider-Noir</span></i><span>. If not, Cage is usually still worth tuning in for, just to see what he does with bad material.</span></p>

            <p>
Yet more evidence pointing to the existence of Ubisoft's much-rumoured but still doggedly unannounced Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake has surfaced, this time in the form of an official art book currently set to release this March.
</p>
<p>
Reports of a Black Flag remake first surfaced in 2023, when it was claimed the celebrated 2013 open-world pirate game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-reportedly-remaking-rollicking-pirate-adventure-assassins-creed-black-flag">getting the do-over treatment from Skull and Bones developer Ubisoft Singapore</a>. At the time, the project was said to still be "at least a few years" away from release.
</p>
<p>
Since then, evidence of the remake's existence has continued to mount, despite Ubisoft's persistent silence. Last year, for instance, actor Matt Ryan - who played Black Flag protagonist Edward Kenway - hinted the remake was close to release, only for Ubisoft to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up">threaten him with legal action</a>.
</p>
<p>
Then, in December, something called Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">briefly appeared on the PEGI website</a>, rated 18 for violence, bad language, and in-game purchases. But it didn't stop there; January saw the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-statue-leaks">leak of a suspiciously timed Assassin's Creed Black Flag collectible figurine</a> featuring Kenway sat on a treasure chest, seemingly corroborating earlier word from statue maker PureArts that something Black Flag-y was "going on". We've also seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-music-upload">Black Flag sea shanties officially uploaded to YouTube</a>, later blamed on "technical issues", and even a sort of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-claims-assassins-creed-blag-flag-music-reuploads-were-due-to-technical-issues-and-nothing-more">acknowledgment-adjancet meme post</a> from Ubisoft's social media team.
</p><p>
And now, a Black Flag art book can be tossed onto the growing evidence pile. As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remaster-art-book-appears-at-amazon-now-up-for-preorder">spotted by IGN</a>, the tome (listed under the name Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remaster - Art Book) was <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1835417701?tag=i0e25-21&amp;ascsubtag=05aB1hBAYymJ9H38fEE0g5D">recently added to Amazon UK</a> with a recommended retail price of £39.99 - currently £29.95 - and a release date of 24th March, 2026. Titan, a company that's released numerous officially licensed Assassin's Creed art books over the years, is listed as the publisher.
</p>
<p>
Assuming the Black Flag art book is legit, its listed release would coincide with the original launch window for Ubisoft's conspicuous, and much-discussed, "unannounced game" - a title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-could-set-sail-before-april">widely believed to be the Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake</a>. However, as part of a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset" announced in January, the company pushed the title - alongside six other unspecified games - into its next financial year, starting April 2026, to "ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met".
</p>
<p>
That shakeup also saw the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">cancellation of seven games</a> - including Ubisoft's troubled and long-in-the-works Price of Persia: The Sands of Time remake - alongside the closure of two studios, the restructuring of several more, and the implementation of return-to-office mandates. This week, 1,200 Ubisoft workers <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/at-least-1200-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-response-to-recent-restructuring">began a three-day strike</a> in response to the company's recent moves.

			<p>FromSoftware's <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Duskbloods</em> was a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">standout reveal</strong> during the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event</strong></a>, though its continued absence from the spotlight has led to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">speculation regarding its launch timeline</strong>. Despite the title not appearing during this month's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-here-where-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a></strong>, the project <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">remains on track to release before the end of the year.</strong></p>



<p>Kadokawa, FromSoftware's parent company, reiterated this window today in its <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/198090/00.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Q3 fiscal year earnings report</strong></a>, confirming a generic <strong>2026</strong> schedule for the title.</p>



<p> In the report, Kadokawa also addressed the game's platform status, stating it will<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> "only be available for the Nintendo Switch 2".</em> While this confirms exclusivity for now, it likely refers to the game’s status at launch. Given the broader industry trend of moving away from permanent console exclusives, it would be <strong>a significant shift</strong> if <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Duskbloods</em> did not eventually see a PC release, at the very least.</p>



<p>The high level of anticipation surrounding <em>The Duskbloods</em> is understandable, especially following how <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a></em></strong> evolved the studio's formula with its roguelike-meets-soulslike co-op mechanics in 2025.</p>



<p>Reports suggest that <em>The Duskbloods</em> will take things a step further. The game has been in development since before <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>'s marketing began, making it <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-the-duskbloods-gameplay-leak/">one of the studio's longest development cycles</a></strong> to date, and focuses on innovative gameplay features the studio is reportedly very proud of. As such, players are eager to see the game and these systems in action. Hopefully, it will be soon.</p>

<p>Burns says he wants every player to feel as though "they got a great value out of their experience" with <em>The Oily Depths</em>, and that he believes the new price "better reflects the scope and length of the game".</p><p>If you did buy <em>The Oily Depths </em>at its original price, Burns says that given the game's short length, you should still be within the Steam refund window, so you can ask for a refund "and repurchase at the new price if you'd like".</p><p>As a quick reminder, Steam refunds are offered to players with fewer than two hours' playtime in a game, as long as they've owned that game for less than two weeks. Since <em>The Oily Depths </em>came out on February 9th, the latter, at least, applies to every player right now.</p><p>If you're wondering exactly what <em>The Oily Depths </em>is, it's a short horror adventure <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-oily-depths-ex-blizzard-ubisoft-dev" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9d7b5677-68b0-4a7b-8a7c-8bf4bc8cb7eb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">created by ex-Blizzard staffer Ryan Burns</a>, and it combines a lo-fi, chunky art style with gameplay that revolves around examining and maintaining machines abord a deep-sea submarine.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/diablo-ii-gets-its-first-new-playable-class-in-over-25-years/</link>

          <p>It’s not every day that a classic PC game gets a new content expansion 25 years after its last major update. But that’s what happened last night, as Blizzard suddenly <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24243863/rain-annihilation-in-reign-of-the-warlock">released new “Reign of the Warlock” DLC</a> that adds a new class, new end-game challenges, and new inventory-management options to the classic <em>Diablo II</em>.</p>
<p>To be clear, the new DLC is technically not for the original 2000 release of <em>Diablo II</em> (which was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/03/16-years-later-blizzard-is-still-patching-diablo-ii/">still getting patches as of 2016</a>) but for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/diablo-ii-resurrected-impressions-an-uneasy-walk-through-old-remade-dungeons/">the game’s 2021 <em>Resurrected</em> remaster</a>. Still, that remastered version has gameplay and animations that are extremely faithful to the original, making yesterday’s surprise update the kind of content drop that players have been waiting for since <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/diablo-ii-lord-of-destruction">2001’s “Lord of Destruction” expansion</a>.</p>
<p>The “Reign of the Warlock” DLC lets you “command forbidden power” as a new class that “wields forbidden arts, bridles hellfire and shadow, and dominates demons,” according to the in-game class selection screen description. By way of backstory, Blizzard <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24243863/rain-annihilation-in-reign-of-the-warlock">writes</a> that most Warlocks “have the means to lead a lavish lifestyle but find the pursuit of luxury and ease stale. Instead, they leverage their elevated status in Sanctuary to hunt down lost knowledge that would enable them to continue the legacy of Horazon.”</p>

<p>The Warlock has a skill tree that has three distinct paths:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonic: Summon three different types of demons to fight alongside you, then consume those demons to gain powerful boons.</li>
<li>Eldritch: Imbue weapons with hexes that cause status effects on foes, and duplicate and throw weapons at enemies. This includes the unique ability to carry a two-handed weapon and an off-hand single weapon at once.</li>
<li>Chaos: Throw ranged miasma attacks and gain the ability to summon portals that suck in enemies.</li>

			<p>Hordes of Hunger bills itself as being a survival arena slasher, and while you do indeed run around murking a bunch of enemies in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and you do level up as you go, it’s a bit more hands-on than most in the genre. That’s not a bad thing at all, but it means that, to me at least, it feels more like a roguelike Dynasty Warriors game… sort of.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hordes of Hunger - Official Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NSSAlmeW_Ws?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hordes of Hunger bills itself as a roguelite arena-slasher, but it’s a bit more than that. Borrowing a cup of sugar from the roguelite’s neighbours in the bullet heaven household brings regular levelling up through a run into the mix, as well as the larger hordes of enemies to battle. It feels to me like a roguelite spin on Dynasty Warriors… sort of.</p>


<p>You take control of Mirah, a woman on a mission to kill just about everything she sees, because they’re all really hungry and trying to eat you. It basically means there are a lot of monsters to attack, and while they start off just sort of running at you, they’ll quickly end up trying to explode you, debuffing you with magic, and leaping across the map at you. It’s a simple enough premise, and it’s a simple enough game as well.</p>


<p>Instead of the auto-attacks of a Bullet Heaven game, you have to hold down a button to unleash a string of standard attacks, which will have you Geralting around the map with your sword swinging, or whatever other weapon you end up crafting. You also get a heavy attack which requires focus, which you get from hitting things, and a special attack which charges up over time. You’ve got a dodge and parry too, which end up feeling very relevant if you want to actually stay alive.</p>
<p>The dash is especially good, because healing is hard to come by, and one of the level up perks you get lets you heal for each enemy you dash past, which can keep you alive pretty comfortably. Things don’t get a huge amount more complicated than that, which is fine, although some of your level-ups can buff your other abilities, like granting a lightning strike to your jump attack.</p>

<p>With all of that at your disposal, you have to run around different levels completing missions, like destroying cranes or beating up bosses, and just keep doing that for each level. You’re going to die a fair bit – it is a roguelite, my friends – as getting surrounded is fatal, and because each and every new level brings some new enemy to ruin your day. The ones with shields can only be hurt by heavy attacks or special attacks, or lightning bolts.</p>
<p>It’s a fun little loop, as these games so often are, but it’s not doing much beyond that, and the progression feels a little sluggish. A lot of Survivor-likes are sort of carried by the sheer absurdity of your weapons and the things you can weave together, but Hordes of Hunger is a bit more grounded in it’s overall look and feel. That leads to the gameplay feeling a little bit more muted, and because progression is slow on top of that, with you buying passive buffs and crafting weapons sometimes, it just isn’t very inspiring.</p>

		I like Hordes of Hunger, but I don't love it, and in a field of games that are a lot like this, it's hard to recommend. That being said, if you're someone who wants to indulge in a grimdark fantasy world and hit things a lot, this could be a good chance to do so.	</p></div>

<p>It's the little things</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you cast your mind back to 2024, you might recall an adorable-looking little game called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_garden">Tiny Garden</a>, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/cosy-polly-pocket-inspired-farm-sim-tiny-garden-smashes-kickstarter-goal-in-one-hour">smashed its Kickstarter goal</a> in under an hour with the promise of a Switch release to come. Well, guess what! It's coming our way real soon.</p>
<p>Super Rare Originals and Ao Norte have today announced that Tiny Garden will sprout onto the Switch eShop on <strong>26th February</strong>, bringing us heaps of '90s nostalgia and cosy vibes in the process.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, this is a cute farming/decoration sim, set inside a "'90s inspired clam-shelled toy" — if you remember your ample Polly Pocket collection from back in the day, this'll likely ring a bell. The bottom half of this toy is your garden, where you'll plant crops before turning the little handle on the side to watch them grow (<em>adorable</em>), while the top is a tiny little house for you to decorate as you please.</p>
<p>After launching on Steam last year, the Switch version bundles in the Summer Breeze Cosmetic Pack DLC and Supporter's Pack, meaning even more cosmetics and items will be at your disposal right from the jump.</p>
<p>Here's a brief rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from Super Rare:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- <strong>Pocket-Sized! -</strong> Build your dream garden inside this 90's inspired clam-shelled toy.<br>
- <strong>Relax, Discover, Create -</strong> Turn the crank and enjoy a wholesome and thoughtful experience!<br>
- <strong>Relaxation and Creativity -</strong> No score, time limits, or game overs, Tiny Garden is all about unwinding and creating without pressure!<br>
- <strong>A Toy With History -</strong> Discover the toys secrets as you uncover letters and traces of the stories shared within.<br>
- <strong>Nintendo Switch version includes the Summer Breeze Cosmetic Pack</strong>, which brings new customisations to your game!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All in all, it looks <em>ridiculously cute</em>. We're all after an antidote to the endless grey outside, and this might just provide it.</p>

			<p>After a bombastic launch that saw <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> become the best-selling shooter of 2025 and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-best-selling-game-in-us-2025/">best-selling game in the US overall</a></strong> in 2025, enthusiasm waned around <strong>EA's</strong> successful <strong>Call of Duty-killer</strong> as the assembled team of developers known as <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> was unable to keep up with players' thirst for new content.</p>



<p>It went from a game that had a chance of cracking 1 million concurrent players on Steam alone to one that has been struggling to hit <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/">100K concurrent players</a>. Thankfully, though, after an <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release-date-january-update-ea/">unwelcome delay</a>, EA and Battlefield Studios may finally start to have better luck, as <strong>Season 2</strong> for Battlefield 6 is finally just days away, and EA has officially revealed what's coming in this new season.</p>



<p>Ahead of the official reveal, I got the chance to check out a short presentation detailing what's coming in Season 2, as well as the chance to spend some time with the new content. For now, I can't talk about my thoughts on Season 2 and the new content, and you'll be able to read those in the coming days. If you want a peek at what that might sound like, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">you can check out my preview of Season 1</a> or my review of Battlefield 6 to find out more about <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">my thoughts on the game</a>. In the meantime, here are all of the details for what's coming in Season 2.</p>

<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-season-2-breakdown">Battlefield 6 Season 2 Breakdown</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Battlefield-6-S2-Roadmap-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-leadoff-extreme-measures">Leadoff - Extreme Measures</h3>



<p>Like its initial season, Season 2 will be broken into three phases. This time, they're called <strong>Extreme Measures, Nightfall, </strong>and <strong>Hunter/Prey</strong>. Extreme Measures kicks off Season 2, and it's easily the most jam-packed phase of the three. It adds a new map, new weapons, new gadgets, and new vehicles, including the fan-favourite <strong>AH-6 Little Bird</strong> helicopter.</p>



<p>Extreme Measures launches with the arrival of Season 2 and lasts from <strong>February 17, 2026</strong>, to <strong>March 17, 2026,</strong> and brings with it a new feature that players are desperate for: a new map. The new <strong>Contaminated</strong> map launches with Extreme Measures, which brings players to Germany's more mountainous corners, with rocky terrain surrounding a German airbase.</p>



<p>Along with the new map, the other major feature arriving in Extreme Measures is a new limited-time mode, <strong>VL-7 Strike.</strong> This mode covers the map with a hallucinogenic smoke that will have you unable to see what's in front of you, while also seeing and hearing things that aren't really there. You can wear a gas mask to keep yourself from hallucinating, but that doesn't fix how thick the gas is in the first place.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Battlefield-6-S2-Screenshot-2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As for the new weapons getting introduced in Extreme Measures, players will get their hands on three new weapons. A new assault rifle, the <strong>VC-2</strong>. It's a rifle that thrives in close-quarters engagements, and it's capable of burning through enemies. The <strong>M121 A2</strong> is a new belt-fed light machine gun joining the arsenal, and lastly, the <strong>GRT-CPS</strong> is a new semi-automatic DMR.</p>



<p>Engineers are getting a new guided missile launcher gadget, the <strong>9K38 IGLA,</strong> while Recon players will be getting the <strong>HTI-Mk2,</strong> a device that can detect enemy gadgets, suppress enemy recon drones, and disrupt enemy rockets. The only vehicle added to the game in Extreme Measures is the aforementioned Little Bird helicopter.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-s-on-deck-nightfall">What's on Deck - Nightfall</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Battlefield-6-S2-Screenshot-4-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Picking up right where Extreme Measures leaves off, <strong>Nightfall</strong> starts on <strong>March 17, 2026, </strong>and runs until <strong>April 14, 2026</strong>. It'll add the second and last map included in Battlefield 6's second season, <strong>Hagental Base</strong>, and introduce a new limited-time mode, also called Nightfall.</p>



<p>Hagental Base is already a dimly lit place, and there will be plenty of chances for you to use the darkness to your advantage. The map's lighting gets remixed and, almost entirely turned off in the Nightfall LTM, where you're battling against enemy squads in pitch black corridors, as the map is limited to the facility within the mountain range.</p>



<p>All players will have the option of bringing Night Vision Goggles with them in their loadout, but your choice between using NVGs or just a flashlight, which could very well blind an unaware NVG-user, could be the difference between winning or losing a fight. The Nightfall LTM will also be available in REDSEC as a mode in Gauntlet, outside of the vanilla multiplayer.</p>



<p>Two new weapons will be added in Nightfall (the phase), the <strong>CZ3A1</strong> submachine gun, and the <strong>VC.61</strong> fully-automatic sidearm. Both have a high fire rate, making them ideal for close encounters, like the kind you might not see coming until the last second, because you can't see what's in front of you.</p>



<p>Nightfall also introduces a new vehicle, the <strong>M1030 Dirt Bike</strong>. You and a squadmate can jump on the back of the bike and cut across a map even faster than before, trying to hit a sick jump and a sick shot at the same time.</p>



<h3 id="h-in-the-hole-hunter-prey">In the Hole - Hunter/Prey</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Battlefield-6-S2-Screenshot-6-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The last phase of Season 2, <strong>Hunter/Prey</strong>, kicks off on <strong>April 14, 2026, </strong>and is the thinnest phase in terms of content. Or, that's how it seems at the moment, that is. During the presentation, EA did clarify that there is more to the phase than what they've shown so far, as there's currently no indication that Hunter/Prey adds a new map.</p>



<p>Season 1 did add three maps altogether, so maybe there's a third waiting in the wings. What we do know is that coming in Hunter/Prey is another limited-time mode, <strong>Operation Augur.</strong> It's a new mode directly inspired by the Operations introduced in <strong>Battlefield 1,</strong> and it features both of Season 2's new maps, Hagental Base and Contaminated.</p>



<p>It begins on Contaminated, with the attackers driving an assault while using VL-7 gas to push the defenders into Hagental Base, where the battle concludes in infantry-based warfare. Hunter/Prey also adds a new <strong>LTV</strong> vehicle, a new 14" <strong>Ripper</strong> machete melee weapon, and a new unnamed weapon, though that's about all we know at the moment.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[High On Life 2′s Intro Is One Of The Best Video Game Openings Ever]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-2-intro-start-epstein-files-fps-sci-fi-montage-2000668195</link>
            <guid>1433668</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Some games start slow, taking their time to teach you the controls and establish the world. <a href="https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-2-trailer-teaser-xbox-game-pass-sgf-2025-1851783996"><em>High On Life 2</em></a> takes a very different approach. It tosses you into the world at 1,000 MPH, cracking jokes and having a blast. And you know what, it’s a great way to start a video game.</p> <p><em>High On Life 2</em> doesn’t assume that you’ve played its <a href="https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-review-rick-and-morty-justin-roiland-1849888587">2022 predecessor</a>. Instead, the intro to this <a href="https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-squanch-games-rick-and-morty-justin-roilan-1849949995">comedy-filled sci-fi FPS</a> about humans being turned into drugs provides a crash course on what happened in the last game. It does this via an intro that is structured as a series of vignettes and moments seamlessly stitched together into one extended opening montage.</p>

 <p>At one point you’re fighting a giant monster, then you’re on a talk show, a second later you’re back in a limo with your mentor-turned-agent from the original game, then back to the monster fight. A quick cut later, you’re doing a commercial, then you’re zipped away to an obstacle course, back to the talk show, and so on.</p> <p>This introduction sequence isn’t just fun and funny; it also does a great job of teaching you the basics of <em>High On Life 2</em>. You know, how to jump, move, shoot, grapple stuff, melee people, etc. Learning how to jump and run on a <em>Wipeout</em>-like televised obstacle course and then seconds later, though possibly years later in-game, using those skills to climb across buildings as you chase a giant monster not only taught me the controls, it also quickly established what the main character has been doing since the first game. On top of that, it’s all technically impressive and fun to behold as the game hops between wildly different scenes in a few frames without hitching up or breaking.</p>

  <p>And yes, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/high-on-life-2-jeffrey-epstein-joke/">as already pointed out by <em>Polygon</em></a>, there is a joke about deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in the intro sequence. It happens during a bit in which you kill a bunch of different targets in a hyper-fast murder montage that teaches you how to melee while also showing how bored the main character has become with their life as a celebrity bounty hunter. You can kill these people instantly, or let them ramble on for a bit and learn more about why they are marked for death. In the case of one character, they trafficked humans, but not for “sex stuff” like Epstein. They just sold humans to be smoked as a drug by aliens. They want to be clear; they are bad, but not as bad as Epstein.</p>

 <p>This is when I’d show you a clip from this awesome intro, but I can’t do that. <em>High On Life 2</em> has a lot of embargoed content that I’m unable to talk about ahead of its February 13 launch. And we aren’t able to share video or record clips of the introduction sequence at all. It’s a shame, because I don’t think it spoils much, and it’s one of the best parts of <em>High On Life 2.&nbsp;</em></p>

              <p><span>Pokémon Day, the series’ annual anniversary celebration that typically includes a live stream about upcoming projects, is just two weeks away. Rumors and leaks are circulating, and while the new </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-gen-10-leak-wind-wave-open-world-images-screens-2000666444"><span>Generation X games seem imminent</span></a><span>, leakers claim that a pair of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-best-worst-games-ranked-red-blue-scarlet-violet-1849984595"><span>old games may also be announced for the Switch 2</span></a><span>&nbsp;on February 27: </span><i><span>Pokémon FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The Game Boy Advance games originally launched in 2004, and are remakes of the </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Green </span></i><span>RPGs on the Game Boy that kickstarted the franchise. The rumor of their impending rerelease began when Khu, a leaker in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community, claimed that the games would “return soon” on </span><a href="https://x.com/Riddler_Khu/status/2021518874785841331"><span>X</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">They will return soon~ <a href="https://t.co/hwB2Ntsn8H">pic.twitter.com/hwB2Ntsn8H</a></p> <p>— Khu Beating Around The Bush (@Riddler_Khu) <a href="https://twitter.com/Riddler_Khu/status/2021518874785841331?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/2021595272967528833?s=20"><span>Centro Leaks</span></a><span>, a prominent leak account, has also posted saying that a separate source tells them these RPGs won’t be part of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription, and will instead be paid games on the eShop. They also claim they will be compatible with </span><i><span>Pokémon Home</span></i><span>, which allows you to transfer your Pokémon to a storage app that can be traded to other games in the series.</span></p> <p><i><span>FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span> are easily the best versions of the first-generation games, but fans have gotten a bit weary of going back to the Kanto region after years of perceived favoritism for those original 151 Pokémon. So while there’s plenty of excitement about the possibility, some folks are rolling their eyes at the thought that these games might be ported over while&nbsp; plenty of the other games continue missing from the Switch’s line-up. Especially if they end up being pricey, standalone games.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Big news for Kantoids,” wrote one </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1r1ut4f/khu_hints_pok%C3%A9mon_fire_red_and_leaf_green_will/"><span>Redditor</span></a><span>. “Just give me </span><i><span>HGSS</span></i><span>,” wrote another. “</span><i><span>FireRed</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span> will return in </span><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday</span></i><span>,” is the top comment on the GamingLeaksAndRumors subreddit thread about the leak, indicating that a lot of folks feel like they’re being subjected to some MCU-style nostalgia-baiting here and aren’t thrilled at the prospect of going back to Kanto. So some folks might be skipping this if it comes to pass.</span></p>

 <p><span>This is all just a rumor right now, but it would make some sense considering 2026 is </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s 30th anniversary. It doesn’t seem out of the question that The Pokémon Company would want to give folks a way to play that first adventure. The original </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and</span><i><span> Blue</span></i><span> were last available on the 3DS, but now that the eShop on that device has been shut down, you can only download them if you’ve previously purchased them.</span></p> <p><span>For a series with as much continuity as </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> has through intergenerational trading and </span><i><span>Home </span></i><span>support, it’s really shitty that all these games aren’t readily accessible on modern hardware, but Nintendo has a way of making it hard to play old games without some kind of (usually expensive) port or subscription service on its current platforms. So if this does turn out to be true, I wouldn’t be surprised if </span><i><span>FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span> end up costing something like $30 a piece. But we’ll know for sure on Pokémon Day.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Overwatch developers are asking players not to ban Jetpack Cat, as players get tired of the overpowered character’s abilities. </p>



<p>Overwatch came in guns blazing for their latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-new-content-in-overwatch-season-1-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 update</a>, introducing 5 new Heroes to the title, including Domina, Emre, Mizuki, Anran, and Jetpack Cat. Along with that, new sub-roles for the core roles and a bunch of other content were revealed. Today, we are talking about one of the newly released characters. </p>







<h2 id="h-overwatch-s-jetpack-cat-seems-to-be-too-overpowered">Overwatch’s Jetpack Cat Seems to be Too Overpowered</h2>



<p>Overwatch has just posted on their official <a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/2021774745243726021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), “NO BAN JETPACK CAT PLZ” with a very innocent image of the character. Many players in the comments section don’t agree with the developers, stating they will continue to ban the character, while others request a balance in the character’s skills. Some players seem to agree, chiming in with the ‘don’t ban Jetpack Cat’ chants. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There is a full-fledged Reddit post on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1r1iuj4/jetpack_cat_has_a_massive_issue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Competitiveoverwatch</a>, discussing how the character can be a big problem in competitive games. It seems that Jetpack Cat excels at close and midrange duels and can disengage easily. What’s more, their ultimate attack is considered a guaranteed tank killer, and the Tether ability can be a game-changer as well. Many players have said they want the character permanently banned until changes are made. </p>

<p>In other news, Overwatch’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatchs-anran-set-for-redesign-after-community-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anran is getting a redesign</a> after receiving community backlash.

			<p><strong>Nexon</strong> has just reported its<a href="https://www.nexon.co.jp/en/ir/"> fourth-quarter 2025 financials,</a> and, unsurprisingly, the company recorded "<em>record-high Q4 and full-year revenue</em>." The thing that makes it no surprise is the fact that Nexon is the parent company of <strong>Embark Studios</strong>, the team behind the hottest new extraction shooter, <strong>ARC Raiders</strong>. Which we now know has officially sold <strong>14 million copies</strong> since it launched in October 2025.</p>



<p>This official sales update comes after a recent report that ARC Raiders was the top-selling game across Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-dominance-continues-reportedly-stands-as-top-selling-game-across-steam-xbox-and-playstation-for-third-consecutive-month/">a third consecutive month</a></strong>. It also means that the game sold just under <strong>2M</strong> copies in the last month, since Embark confirmed the game had <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-neared-1-million-concurrent/">sold 12.4 million copies in January</a>.</p>



<p>The success of ARC Raiders helped drive a <strong>25% year-on-year (YoY)</strong> revenue increase for Nexon, with the company's overall revenue reaching <strong>$3.1 billion.</strong> Though Embark's popular shooter isn't the only story behind the company's record revenues (though, admittedly, it is most of the story).</p>



<p>It's the <strong>MapleStory</strong> franchise that drove growth outside of ARC Raiders, with the new release of <strong>MapleStory: Idle RPG</strong> driving growth after remaining the number one game on app stores for more than <strong>10 weeks.</strong></p>

<p>Embark Studios' other shooter, <strong>The Finals</strong>, wasn't a slouch while the new third-person extraction shooter took most of the glory. Revenue from The Finals also grew compared to the last fiscal year, with a significant chunk of that growth coming in December thanks to the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-the-finals-season-9-dragon-rising/"><strong>Season 9</strong> update.</a></p>



<p>Looking ahead, Nexon lists eight games in development, half of them being new IPs, while the rest are new games in the <strong>Dungeons and Fighters</strong>, the <strong>Mabinogi: Heroes</strong>, and <strong>Durango</strong> franchises. </p>



<ul>
<li>Azur Promilia - new IP published by Nexon - fantasy world RPG</li>



<li>Project DX - new Durango-based game developed/published by Nexon - MMORPG</li>



<li>Project RX - new IP developed/published by Nexon - anime-style game</li>



<li>Vindictus: Defying Fate - new Mabinogi: Heroes-based game developed/published by Nexon - action RPG</li>



<li>Nakwon: Last Paradise - new IP developed/published by Nexon - extraction survival game</li>



<li>Woochi: The Wayfarer - new IP developed/published by Nexon - action adventure</li>



<li>Dungeon &amp; Fighter: Arad - new Dungeon &amp; Fighter game developed/published by Nexon - open-world action RPG</li>



<li>Project Overkill - new Dungeon &amp; Fighter game developed/published by Nexon - 3D action RPG</li>
</ul>



<p>The rumoured <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-starcraft-shooter-blizzard-entertainment/">StarCraft</a></strong> game said to be in development at Nexon is not mentioned, though that's not exactly a surprise since whatever is happening with StarCraft likely won't be revealed until BlizzCon 2026. And if it was spoiled in a financial report, that would be more than a little anticlimactic.</p>

<p>When it comes to Nexon's other franchises, the popular <em>Dungeon&amp;Fighter </em>franchise grew in both China and Korea on PC, although <em>Dungeon&amp;Fighter Mobile </em>is struggling somewhat. The <em>MapleStory </em>franchise, meanwhile, seems to be going from strength to strength across all of its iterations.</p><p><em>The First Descendant</em>, meanwhile, served as Nexon's third best-selling franchise in North America and Europe, coming in behind the aforementioned <em>MapleStory </em>and <em>Arc Raiders</em>. Revenue for Embark's other shooter, <em>The Finals</em>,<em> </em>also apparently grew during the fourth quarter.</p><p><em>Arc Raiders </em>was first revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-game-awards-2021" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="371b9b88-7644-4a02-9183-477032433072" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back at the 2021 Game Awards</a> and was originally due to launch in 2022, although it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-delay-pushes-release-date-to-2023" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="eb70e4ac-4ed0-4322-b525-b44038581489" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> a number of times before finally settling on a late 2025 launch date. When it was released, it quickly gained an audience, selling <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-sales-4m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="08dd5792-c4a8-4824-90f6-27b50a7dc7fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">four million copies in under two weeks</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>By Christmas, <em>Arc Raiders </em>had reached 12 million sales, a milestone even Nexon and developer Embark don't appear to have expected; the reward they prepared for said milestone was actually intended for the 10 million mark.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with the game, it's a multiplayer extraction shooter that blends PvP and PvE combat, with teams of players taking to the field to battle both each other and the hostile machines of a post-apocalyptic world.</p><p>You can check out <em>Arc Raiders </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/arc-raiders/9NDF1F263RZ4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> if you'd like to see what all the fuss is about.
