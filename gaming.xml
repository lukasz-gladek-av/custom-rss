		<p>Publisher Kasedo Games and development studio Bulwark Studios have confirmed that the sci-fi city builder will be releasing on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2025. It was released in 2022 for PC. The announcement trailer shows some of the issues you will be dealing with as the unlucky Administrator of the space station Tiqqun.</p>

<p>The description for IXION says, <em>“IXION is a city-builder that requires you to be vigilant, to constantly assess and reassess, to learn and adapt. If you and your crew are to endure, you must confront the perils of space, while at the same time uncovering its secrets and extracting its resources. Danger, however, will come from within as well as without; you’ll need to establish, maintain and develop the Tiqqun’s infrastructure while managing the station’s population, deciding how best to answer their pleas so as to maintain their trust in you and the mission.”</em></p>
<p>Every single decision you make as the Administrator of the Tiqqun will have consequences that will have both immediate and long term impacts. There are issues like electrical fires and hull breaches to deal with too, and there is no help readily available. IXION is a game that will have tough decisions, and you will need to balance the needs of the survivors with the reality of trying to survive in a drifting space station.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-enters-steam-top-10-chart-on-launch-day-despite-mixed-reviews/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Two years after we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-pc-beta-test-dated-ue5-f2p-looter-shooter-also-coming-to-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first covered the game</a> ahead of a PC beta test, NEXON has finally released The First Descendant, its free-to-play third-person looter shooter game. During this time, the Unreal Engine 5-powered title underwent various tweaks and additions, some directly requested by fans (over two million users played the cross-play open beta).</p>
<p>Beomjun Lee, Game Producer at NEXON Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>With The First Descendant being our first global multi-platform launch, we wanted to develop something that allowed the voices of our players to be heard. Our goal is not only to create a game that we are proud of, but also to create something our players will love and enjoy for a long time. We implemented many changes for launch based on the community's requests and we hope it makes the experience even more enjoyable.</em></p>
<p>Minseok Joo, Game Creative Director at NEXON Games, added:</p>
<p><em>Descendants, from everyone on our development team, we thank you sincerely for choosing to join us in the fight against The Vulgus. Back when we first developed this concept in 2019, we set out to create a world inspired by some of our personal favorite looter shooters. The genre holds a special place in our hearts, and our development team has worked hard to create a game that we believe stands proudly among those prominent titles.</em></p>
<p>In the game, players choose one out of 19 playable characters, the titular Descendants, heroes who protect humanity against the alien invaders from The Vulgus. The playable roster is split between 14 original Descendants and 5 high-performance ultimate Descendants. Three new playable characters have been introduced with the launch build: Esiemo, Enzo, and Yujin. Esiemo handles explosives with a unique and dynamic gameplay style; Enzo is a support character with the ability to supply ammunition, making him suitable for tactical weapons. Yujin is a healing Descendant, and when played cooperatively with another player, can bring new cooperative strategies. Additionally, new high-performance Ultimate Descendants have been added, joining the previously announced Ultimate Lepic and Ultimate Viessa: Ultimate Ajax, Ultimate Bunny, and Ultimate Grey.</p>
<p>As with any looter shooter, players will enhance their character's statistics and gear by equipping loot, in this case, modules (of which there are 560). The First Descendant includes 11 weapon types and 22 Ultimate weapons at launch. Modules can boost their attack power, modify recoil, and add extra effects.</p>
<p><iframe title="The First Descendant│Play Free Now│Dev Launch Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cxkdEC6hUjc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The endgame content includes the instanced dungeons named Infiltration Operations and large boss raids called Void Intercept Battles. In the former, players can choose between normal and hard difficulty. The latter allows you to add extra challenge options called modifiers before starting the mission. The more challenge options you add, the more points you'll be able to earn for more rewards. There are 16 Infiltration Operations at launch.</p>
<p>In Void Intercept Battles, Descendants are tasked with defeating the massive Colossi bosses (who are equipped with unique attack patterns) by targeting weak points with unique strategies. This content is meant to be played cooperatively with up to four players, but it can also be completed solo. At launch, there are 16 bosses, including Executioner, Dead Bride, Devourer, Pyromaniac, Swamp Walker, Obstructer, Frost Walker, and Molten Fortress.</p>
<p>The main story was also revised following the community's feedback, making it more immersive. Descendants will now appear as NPCs (non-player characters) throughout the storyline. They will also have their own quests to better understand their personalities, starting with Bunny, whose quest is available at launch.</p>
<p>So far, a lot of players are checking out The First Descendant. NEXON's new game has reached Steam's Top 10 chart. As we are writing this article, the game is ranked #6 after Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, Elden Ring, PUBG, and Banana, with around 217K players currently online,<a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> according to SteamDB</a>. However, user reviews are currently quite low: only 42% of the 5,349 reviews already posted recommend the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="The First Descendant | RTX On Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DrO58UTTVis?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As a reminder, The First Descendant supports <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-optimizes-the-first-descendant-nvidia-dlss-3-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 3.5</a> (Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Ray Reconstruction), NVIDIA DLAA, and Reflex on PC. According to NVIDIA, the GeForce RTX 4090 can run at an average of 125 FPS at 4K (thanks to a 2.5X DLSS boost) with ray tracing enabled and Super Resolution set to Performance mode.</p>
<p>AMD users can activate AMD FSR 2.2 (although it should be updated to FSR 3 soon), and Intel XeSS 1.1 is also supported. Moreover, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdr10-gaming-debuts-with-the-first-descendant-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports</a> HDR10+ displays. If you don't have a powerful enough PC, cloud streaming via GeForce is also available.</p>
<p>On consoles, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-descendant-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offer</a> three graphic modes: Fidelity, Balanced, and Performance. Ray Tracing and AMD Frame Generation are also optionally available.</p>

<p>Surgent Studios, the studio behind Tales of Kenzera: Zau, is the latest developer to be hit with layoffs.</p>



<p>The news comes via multiple LinkedIn posts from, now former, employees at Surgent. </p>



<p>“Well, it looks like I’m joining all the people affected by industry layoffs this year,” technical artist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7213858949022785538/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jordan Smee said</a>.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, I have been affected by the layoffs at Surgent Studios,” 3D Environment Artist Joe Phillpot wrote.</p>



<p>Level designer Pete Brisbourne posted that, “The chapter entitled “Pete Works At Surgent Studios” is coming to a close at the end of the month.”</p>



<p>It’s unclear how many people at the studio are being let go. It’s also unclear as to why the layoffs are being made at this time.</p>



<p>Tales of Kenzera: Zau launched in April on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC, and Nintendo Switch. As of writing, the game has a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/tales-of-kenzera-zau/critic-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metacritic score of 76</a> or generally favorable.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Surgent and studio founder Abubakar Salim for comment on the situation. Should we receive a response, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Some adjustments are made to conversion kits for various weapons in multiplayer. The JAK Jawbreaker conversion kit for the KV Broadside shotgun no longer blocks the JAK BFB muzzle attachment and it can now be equipped. The update also fixes incorrect iron sights and misaligned optics that previously happened after unequipping the JAK Requiem conversion kit for the Kastov 762 and Kastov 545 assault rifles.</p><p dir="ltr">Two changes are included for Zombies mode. The Zombies completionist camos can now be equipped to the Sledgehammer, and an issue is fixed that previously caused a server disconnection error when a player left an Unstable Rift.</p><p dir="ltr">The Warzone side of the update is much smaller and only includes a few weapon changes. This includes another nerf for the Kar98k marksman rifle, with a decrease to the lower-torso damage modifier from 1.1x to .95x, a reduction to the arm modifiers from 1.2x to .95x, and a decrease to the leg modifiers from 1x to .95x. The popular Superi 46 submachine gun also has a reduction to its damage modifiers with a decrease to the lower torso, lower arm and hand modifiers from 1.3x down to 1.1x each.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/05/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-season-4-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Modern Warfare 3</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/05/call-of-duty-mwiii-warzone-season-4-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be seen below, as shared by Activision.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Call of Duty news, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-adding-patriotic-uncle-sam-operator-for-4th-of-july/1100-6524532/">patriotic Uncle Sam operator</a> was added to MW3 and Warzone, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-might-include-a-deadpool-wolverine-crossover-in-season-5/1100-6524622/">Deadpool &amp; Wolverine crossover</a> could potentially happen in Season 5.</p><h3>GLOBAL</h3><h3>CUSTOMIZATION</h3><ul><li>Corrected art displayed for the Kill Shot Emblem in the Season 4 Battle Pass.</li></ul><h3>MULTIPLAYER</h3><h3>UIX</h3><ul><li>Improved visual style of the notification that appears after changing Loadout mid-match.</li><li>Bug Fixes  <ul><li>Fixed an issue causing the After Action Report to unexpectedly close.</li><li>Corrected HUD prompts when controlling the Missle Drone Killstreak with an alternate button layout.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>PROGRESSION</h3><ul><li>Underbarrel Launcher Attachments will now progress Challenges requiring double kills with Grenades.</li><li>Improved tracking of the double kills Camo Challenge for the Reclaimer 18 Shotgun.</li><li>DG-58 Micro Barrel Attachment for the DG-56 will no longer remain locked after reaching the Weapon Level requirement.</li><li>Addressed an issue causing Gilded Camo for certain Weapons to remain locked after unlock requirements are met.</li></ul><h3>MODES</h3><ul><li>Bit Party  <ul><li>Fixed an issue causing inconsistent score upon tag collection in Kill Confirmed.</li></ul></li><li>Mutation  <ul><li>Fixed an issue causing the HUD to not match the selected Mutant’s abilities.</li><li>Radioactive Beast will now drown if submerged in water for too long.</li><li>Mutant Perks are no longer inactive during the first life after the halftime team switch.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>WEAPONS &amp; ATTACHMENTS</h3><p>Assault Rifles</p><ul><li>Kastov 762 &amp; 545  <ul><li>JAK Requiem Conversion Kit  <ul><li>Fixed incorrect iron sight and misaligned Optics after unequipping the Conversion Kit.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Submachine Guns</p><ul><li>FJX Horus  <ul><li>JAK Scimitar Kit  <ul><li>Fixed incorrect iron sight and blocked Barrel Attachments after unequipping the Conversion Kit.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Shotguns</p><ul><li>KV Broadside (MWII)  <ul><li>JAK Jawbreaker Conversion Kit  <ul><li>JAK BFB Muzzle Attachment is no longer blocked and can now be equipped.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Sniper Rifles</p><ul><li>FJX Imperium (MWII)  <ul><li>Removed incompatible Ammunition Attachments that could not be unlocked.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Handguns</p><ul><li>.50 GS (MWII) &amp; GS Magna (MWII)  <ul><li>JAK NRG-IV Optic can no longer be equipped without a compatible Barrel.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Launchers</p><ul><li>RGL-80  <ul><li>40mm Slug Ammunition (JAK Thumper-656 Conversion Kit)  <ul><li>Increased minimum damage from 95 to 150 (+58%).</li><li>Removed unintended explosive damage properties.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3>ZOMBIES</h3><h3>GAMEPLAY</h3><ul><li>Zombies Completionist Camos can now be equipped to the Sledgehammer, normally.</li></ul><h2>WARZONE WEAPONS</h2><h3><b><u>ADJUSTMENTS</u></b></h3><h4>ASSAULT RIFLES</h4><p>WEAPON ADJUSTMENTS</p><h3>KASTOV 762 &amp; 545 (MWII)</h3><ul><li><b>JAK Requiem Conversion Kit</b><ul><li>Fixed incorrect iron sight and misaligned Optics after unequipping the Conversion Kit.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>SUBMACHINE GUNS</h4><p>WEAPON ADJUSTMENTS</p><h3>SUPERI 46</h3><ul><li>Lower Torso Modifier decreased to 1.1x, down from 1.3x.</li><li>Lower Arm and Hand Modifiers decreased to 1.1x, down from 1.3x.</li></ul><h3>FJX HORUS</h3><ul><li><b>JAK Scimitar Kit</b><ul><li>Fixed incorrect iron sight and blocked Barrel Attachments after unequipping the Conversion Kit.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>MARKSMAN RIFLES</h4><p>WEAPON ADJUSTMENTS</p><h3>KAR98K</h3><ul><li>Lower Torso Modifier decreased to .95x, down from 1.1x.</li><li>Arm Modifiers decreased to .95x, down from 1.2x.</li><li>Leg Modifiers decreased to .95x, down from 1x.</li></ul>

<p dir="ltr">Aptly titled "Silver Layered Necklace" in-game, the expensive bling's addition to the Ponsonby's catalogue has some players convinced the jewelry may have some sort of significance.</p><p dir="ltr">"Could be a stretch but whatever the price of that necklace is might mean something," reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1dsoqum/comment/lb403xt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">one comment</a> on the post. Another player's reply <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1dsoqum/comment/lb43r78/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">suggests the necklace's price could be a hint</a> at the game's launch date, which has not yet been announced. (The necklace's in-game price isn't shown in the post, but it likely goes for a little over $30,000, based on other items for sale in the store.)</p><p>In all likelihood, the necklace's addition to GTA Online's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-onlines-summer-update-introduces-diy-bounty-hunting-new-creator-tools/1100-6523963/">bounty-hunting update</a> is simply an Easter egg referencing GTA 6, but that hasn't stopped players from coming up with some pretty wild theories. The next installment in the Grand Theft Auto series is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">currently scheduled to arrive sometime in 2025</a>, but Rockstar Games has yet to share a specific release date.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"Descendants, from everyone on our development team we thank you sincerely for choosing to join us in the fight against The Vulgus," creative director Minseok Joo said in a recent press release. "Back when we first developed this concept in 2019, we set out to create a world inspired by some of our personal favorite looter shooters. The genre holds a special place in our hearts, and our development team has worked hard to create a game that we believe stands proudly among those prominent titles."</p><p dir="ltr">"With The First Descendant being our first global multi-platform launch, we wanted to develop something that allowed the voices of our players to be heard," producer Beomjun Lee added. "Our goal is not only to create a game that we are proud of, but also to create something our players will love and enjoy for a long time. We implemented many changes for launch based on the community's requests and we hope it makes the experience even more enjoyable."</p><p dir="ltr">The game's pre-season launch period has introduced a battle pass that includes three new playable Descendants: Esiemo, Enzo, and Yujin. The battle pass also gives players access to new weapons, Void Intercept Battles, and Instance Dungeons, along with other exclusive content.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking to the future, Nexon Games has announced plans to update the game five weeks after launch, though it's not immediately clear what that update will include. A second update, Season 1 Episode: Invasion, will arrive sometime in August, and will feature a new Descendant, new Colossus, new dungeon, and new weapon. According to Nexon, Season 1 Episode: Invasion will also dive deeper into the backstory of a "fan-favorite Descendant."</p><p>The First Descendant is currently available for free on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. For more information on Descendants, weapons, and the new battle pass, check out <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/main" rel="nofollow ">the game's official website</a>.</p>

This month continues that trend with some real bangers worth checking out if you are a subscriber. </p><p>Here’s the list of games coming to Game Pass over the next few weeks and which platforms they will be available on:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong><em>Journey to the Savage Planet</em></strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) - July 3<br></li><li><strong><em>Nickelodeon All-Sta</em>r Brawl 2 </strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 3</li><li>  <strong><em>Cricket 24</em></strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 9</li><li>  <strong><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em> </strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 9</li><li>  <strong><em>Neon White</em> </strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 11</li><li>  <strong><em>Tchia</em> </strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – July 11</li><li>  <strong><em>Magical Delicacy </em></strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 16</li><li>  <strong><em>Flock </em></strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 16</li></ul><p>Some standouts this month include <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/journey-to-the-savage-planet-the-kotaku-review-1841220139&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/journey-to-the-savage-planet-the-kotaku-review-1841220139"><em>Journey to the Savage Planet</em></a></span>, which has a less-than-stellar name but is still a fun semi-open-world survival-action game about exploring an alien environment filled with weird creatures and colorful art. </p><div><p>I also loved <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/neon-white-pc-nintendo-switch-annapurna-interactive-got-1849072088&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/neon-white-pc-nintendo-switch-annapurna-interactive-got-1849072088"><em>Neon White</em></a></span>, a first-person hyper-fast action platformer built around mastering short, gorgeous levels set in a fucked-up version of Heaven. </p><p>I haven’t played <em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em>, but it has a reputation for being one of the best detective games in recent years, so maybe I’ll finally take this opportunity to check it out.</p></div><p>And hey, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-2-new-characters-trailer-1850682210&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-2-new-characters-trailer-1850682210"><em>Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2</em></a></span><em> </em>might not be as good as <em>Smash Bros.</em> but it will be free on Game Pass on July 3 and might be a perfect party game to load up the next time you and your friends get together. You can all pick your favorite cartoon characters and beat the shit out of each other over the 4th of July. </p><p>But, as new games arrive, old games must leave as deals expire. According to Xbox, these are all the games leaving Game Pass on July 15:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong><em>Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus &amp; Butterfly</em></strong>&nbsp;</li><li><em><strong>Figment 2: Creed Valley</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>TOEM</strong></em></li><li><strong><em>The Wandering Village</em>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>If you’re playing any of these titles, you need to finish them up soon. Or take advantage of the Game Pass discount and buy one or more of these games so you can play it forever. Or well, until Xbox decides to shut off the servers. So at least a decade or so. That seems like plenty of time to beat <em>Coffee Talk Episode 2.</em><br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Elden Bling. When you summon people, you always summon the people that aren’t wearing anything, and it’s like, ‘These people are fucking crazy.’”</p><p>As the interviewer points out, there’s a bit of a phenomenon around <em>Elden Ring</em> where players who really wanted to dial in on a particular fight would strip their characters down to their underwear.

You have to roll <em>into</em> things.”</p><p>Headland is almost certainly taking inspiration from players like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-let-me-solo-her-him-messmer-shadow-erdtree-1851563743&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-let-me-solo-her-him-messmer-shadow-erdtree-1851563743">Let Me Solo Her</a></span>, who became a folk legend of sorts in the <em>Elden Ring </em>community.

As Headland puts it, “I was like, ‘Why would you wear armor if you’re not going to get hit?’”</p><p>When we think of a Sith, we think of someone kind of stuffy, who dons either big black robes (Palpatine) or has heavy black armor (a la Darth Vader). The prevailing image is certainly not a smarmy slut of a man showing off how toned he is and who flows through a fight with the swagger of a dude who could pull anyone he wants.</p><p>Qimir reveals himself to be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NklTiHYiK38&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NklTiHYiK38" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most efficient fighter in the sequence</a></span>, showing off what an imposing figure he can be, and why he makes such a striking Sith. He disables Jedi’s lightsabers left and right, and dispatches with numerous warriors without breaking a sweat. He’s got this brazen brutality as he cuts down person after person that’s reminiscent of Vader’s famous hallway massacre in <em>A New Hope</em>. In Headland’s own words, he’s “aggressive” and “roll[s] into things.” Yet when he speaks, he talks in a relaxed cadence, and doesn’t parrot platitudes about darkness—rather freedom. It’s a chilling dichotomy, and it works. Speaking of freedom, you know what Jacinto is free to do? Call me!</p><p>I’d say that stripping Jacinto down for Qimir’s portrayal has absolutely worked. It’s not just that he’s hot as hell, though that certainly helps. His interpretation of a Sith is just so bare and unburdened, that it’s refreshing to see. Now, everyone say thank you to <em>Elden Ring</em>, Let Me Solo Her, and Leslye Headland.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-gta-fan-spots-a-single-piece-of-jewelry-from-the-gta-6-trailer-in-the-new-gta-online-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It feels like an age since Rockstar broke the internet by releasing the debut trailer for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. Since the December 2023 release of GTA 6 Trailer 1, as it’s called, information-hungry fans have analyzed the trailer to within an inch of its life, coming up with all sorts of outlandish theories and predictions about what to expect when Rockstar finally releases the game next year.</p><p>Now, though, they have something tangible to work with, something more than speculation to chew on: a necklace.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1dsoqum/noticed_a_small_detail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor DogWifDreads signaled</a>, the latest <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online">GTA Online</a> update, <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/gta-5/GTA_Online_Bottom_Dollar_Bounties_Update">Bottom Dollar Bounties</a>, appears to have added the necklace worn by perhaps the standout character from the GTA 6 trailer: the woman in the bikini. Comparing a screenshot of the character from the trailer to the silver layered necklace now available to buy in GTA Online, DogWifDreads sent the GTA community on high alert.</p><p>“Dunno if anyone else has caught this but I was rewatching a trailer breakdown and I noticed that the necklaces seen here in the trailer have been added in GTAO with the Bottom Dollar Bounties DLC,” DogWifDreads said.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/12/07/gta6-trailer-4k-00-00-38-29-still001-1701962524689.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Rockstar Games.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/02/screenshot-2024-07-02-155847-1719932343759.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: DogWifDreads / reddit / Rockstar Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>There’s nothing new to be gleaned from this apparent crossover, but that hasn’t stopped people from trying to find some meaning in it. “Could be a stretch but whatever the price of that necklace is might mean something,” suggested Affectionate-Wing771. “Considering all last digits are 0, we could skip that and we'll have four digits, a possible date and month - for something,” OtteLoc wondered, in full GTA theory meme mode. “Or it could just be another generic price like the rest of the items.”</p><p>Most people are taking this as what it probably is: a fun nod to GTA 6 in GTA Online. But that kind of sensible behavior is no fun at all, is it? I suppose it does bring to mind the tough questions Rockstar faces in dealing with the current GTA Online community with the GTA 6 version waiting in the wings. GTA Online is a part of GTA 5, but how will GTA 6's version of GTA Online be made available? Will it be sold standalone? Free-to-download? A part of GTA 6 at a $70+ price point? And what happens to GTA 5's GTA Online when GTA 6 comes out? Will Rockstar effectively replace it with the new version, as Blizzard did to Overwatch when it released Overwatch 2?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p>The first official GTA 6 trailer is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-has-already-surpassed-grand-theft-auto-5s-reveal-with-more-than-100-million-views"><u>the most-viewed video game reveal on YouTube within 24 hours</u></a>.

However, as of right now, it looks like parent company Take-Two and Rockstar are determined to get GTA 6 out the door during its intended release window of fall 2025.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

		<p>Transformers: Galactic Trials has been announced by Outright Games, blending together racing and battling in this latest take on the Transformers franchise. Transformers: Galactic Trials is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC on 11th October 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="TRANSFORMERS: Galactic Trials | Announce Trailer | UK | PEGI" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oXT7fCiBh0g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Transformers: Galactic Trials sees the Prime Relics stolen by Nemesis Prime, with both Autobots and Decepticons racing for the chance to grab their incredible power. Instead of just straight up kart racing, this is a transforming game, so you’ll be racing in Alt Mode and then flipping into Bot Mode to engage in speedy looking third person action. The two modes will feed into one another, as drifting and boosting will charge up Energon which lets you unleash special moves.</p>
<p>The game will feature both solo and local multiplayer, with ten tracks to master and levelling up the eleven Transformers that will star in the game – including fan favourites Bumblebee, Megatron and Optimus Prime.</p>

            <p>Several members at Tales of Kenzera: Zau developer Surgent Studios have been laid off.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-surgent-studios-is-cutting-jobs">Game Developer</a>, a number of former studio employees are now looking for work. Level designer Peter Brisbourne wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peteb_hello-the-chapter-entitled-pete-works-at-activity-7213868361368174594-wVBF/">LinkedIn</a>: "The chapter entitled 'Pete Works At Surgent Studios' is coming to a close at the end of the month", adding he is available for work.</p>

<p>Surgent technical artist Jordan Smee shared a similar post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7213858949022785538/">LinkedIn</a>. "Well, it looks like I'm joining all the people affected by industry layoffs this year," Smee wrote. Additionally, a Surgent Studios producer going by the name of Raysura on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/raysura.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> has also "officially been laid off" over the last couple of days. "Shit sucks," Raysura said. </p>
<p>"I'm another casualty of the wild west industry that is video game development," added game producer Phillip Smy on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7213870230530334720/">LinkedIn</a>. Eurogamer has asked Surgent Studios for comment.</p>
<p>Word of these layoffs comes less than three months after the studio's debut game, Tales of Kenzera: Zau, released to much praise.</p>
<p>"What Tales of Kenzera lacks in creative game design it makes up for in vital, passionate storytelling," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-review">Eurogamer's four star Tales of Kenzera: Zau review</a>.</p>

<p>Today's news is just the latest in a long line of studio shutdowns and redundancies in recent months. By the end of May 2024 - so not even halfway through the year - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">more than 10,000 people had been laid off from their jobs this year across the industry</a>.</p>
<p>Others impacted this year include the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-developer-announces-layoffs-and-studio-closures-including-one-office-open-less-than-a-year">Just Cause developer Avalanche</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">Sony</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-impacted-by-unknown-number-of-layoffs-across-us-and-european-offices">Square Enix</a>, and that is barely scratching the surface.</p>

<p id="I5BLCz">1. Start at the <strong>Castle Front Site of Grace</strong> and head southeast under the rock archway.</p>
<p id="20ngEY">2. Go down the slope on your left and into the cave entrance on the left side of the water.</p>
<p id="pN4O6X">3. Follow the path through the cave and rest at the <strong>Ellac River Cave Site of Grace</strong>.</p>
<p id="58M1sJ">4. Exit the cave and go south downstream, jumping from rock formation to rock formation.</p>

Search along the northern wall to find the entrance to the Darklight Catacombs.</p>

<p id="RzvaBx">After completing the Darklight Catacombs, you’ll be spit out at the <strong>Forsaken Graveyard site of grace </strong>in the Abyssal Woods.</p>

<li id="4a0vHD">Follow the path south towards the Woodland Trail and don’t mind the warnings all over the place for now.</li>
<li id="yVRSEU">Continue down the path to the southeast where you’ll encounter <strong>Madding Hand</strong>, who you can either defeat or run past.</li>

<p>In Japan, a Change.org petition has surfaced to ban Assassin’s Creed Shadows. It has now been a fair few weeks since Ubisoft lifted the lid on this year’s Assassin’s Creed title, announcing a dual protagonist adventure set in Feudal Japan – a setting that fans have been desperate to experience for many years. </p>



<p>However, Japanese fans of the franchise were quick to voice their disappointment and concern about the game, with the most extreme claims suggesting that Ubisoft is floating racism and severe historical inaccuracy in Shadows, which is set to be released in November.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-take-down-shadows">Take Down Shadows</h2>



<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, users can assume control of Naoe, a shinobi, or Yasuke, a samurai and the series’ first protagonist to be based on a real historical figure. One of the main concerns is that Yasuke is being portrayed as a full-blown, respected samurai warrior in AC Shadows, and that is where the historical inaccuracies reportedly begin.</p>



<p>The recent <a href="https://www.change.org/p/%E3%82%A2%E3%82%B5%E3%82%B7%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A3%E3%83%89%E3%82%A6%E3%82%BA%E3%81%AE%E7%99%BA%E5%A3%B2%E4%B8%AD%E6%AD%A2%E3%82%92%E6%B1%82%E3%82%81%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Change.org petition</a> that has surfaced in Japan has gathered almsot 30,000 signatures. Here’s the gist of the petition:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Recently, the lack of historical accuracy and cultural respect has been a serious issue regarding the upcoming game “Assassin’s Creed Shadows” by game developer Ubisoft. The game is based on Japanese samurai and ignores the fact that samurai were a higher class of warrior class and should have been “gokenin” or servants of nobles. In fact, the first European to receive the title of samurai, William Adams (Miura Anjin), served Tokugawa Ieyasu as a 250 koku hatamoto. In this history, Ubisoft continues to misunderstand the nature and role of samurai. This is a serious insult to Japanese culture and history, and may also be linked to Asian racism. We call on Ubisoft to immediately cancel the release of “Assassin’s Creed Shadows” and show sincere research and respect for Japanese history and culture. We need your signature. Sign this petition to let Ubisoft know the importance of cultural respect and historical accuracy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows trailer (especially the one aired in Japanese) picked up a pretty awful likes-to-dislikes ratio. Players in other regions had some issues with the game’s flow and overall appearance, with many ruing the fact that it’s moving back to the massive open-world RPG model that was first introduced in 2017. That subsequently pushed many long-time fans out of the franchise, and it’s one of the reasons why AC Mirage did so well in 2023 – it was a small-form return to glory for the franchise.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-won%E2%80%99t-discord-stop-shoving-shit-in-my-face.917124/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/discord-quests-chilling-no-thanks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Aftermath has <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a wonderful Discord community that you should totally join</a>, but it is time for a confession: I hate Discord. I find it clunky and convoluted, it’s always making noises, I constantly forget to mute myself when I’m done with voice and then everyone can hear me talking to myself, and 90% of its servers <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-forum-messageboard-amazon-lost-ark-new-world-pc-1850393695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">should just be forums</a>. Lately, Discord has added a new circle of Hell, in the form of all kinds of garbage it won’t stop shoving in my face.</p><p>This all began with these ridiculous little status badges that started showing up on my Discord video calls recently, announcing that I am “chilling.” Putting aside the fact that if I’m in a video call I’m <em>not</em> chilling, I’m streaming an episode of our <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">podcast</a>, these things drive me bonkers. Before every stream, we have to remind each other to turn them off, which is annoying. Beyond that, I have been thinking the icon was an eggplant until <em>just now</em>, when I realized it’s a… cat sitting on a beanbag, I think? It’s hard to tell, because it’s a tiny icon and I have the eyes of a man too old to be using Discord.</p><figure><figcaption>Did you know it was a cat? I can't even see this thing.</figcaption></figure><p>Things took a new turn today, when I popped into Aftermath’s Discord to find that I had a “quest” available. What is a quest? Discord <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/22225719947543-Discord-Quests-FAQ#h_01HVPBZR5F8Y7T0F1KJ0RAY9FZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says</a> it’s “a way for players to discover games and earn rewards for streaming them on Discord.” Apparently if I connect a console to Discord and then play 10 minutes of a game on it, I will earn a “decoration” for two months. There’s also a quest related to the new Fortnite mode, which will also earn me a temporary decoration.</p><figure><figcaption>This is in my "gift inventory" tab, a thing I did not know I had and had to Google how to get to.</figcaption></figure><p>A <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/13410113109911-Avatar-Decorations#:~:text=Frequently%20Asked%20Questions-,What%20are%20avatar%20decorations%3F,profile%20aesthetic%20whenever%20you%20want." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decoration</a>, another thing I’ve never heard of until today, lets you customize your Discord avatar. You can apparently buy them by going to your settings, navigating to “profiles,” and then going to the shop, a clunky journey that is very Discord.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/multiversus-review-smash-bros-batman-1851572599<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes when I sit down to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/multiversus&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/multiversus"><em>MultiVersus</em></a></span>, it kinda feels like I’m a child reaching into a cookie jar. Part of me knows, if I want to be a good boy, I shouldn’t be doing it. But cookies taste good as hell. That rush of mind-melting bliss when biting into a gooey, sugary treat easily overtakes the ethical considerations of disobeying my parents. Similarly, diving into <em>MultiVersus</em>’ colorful world of competitive chaos and cartoon charm is as novel and gratifying as ever. But all that joy is propped up by a dumpster fire full of free-to-play, service gaming tropes, some so poorly thought out or predatory that it’s shocking they made it out the gate at all. Having to qualify a good time with a bold asterisk of caveats is the <em>MultiVersus</em> experience.</p><p>First, the basics: <em>MultiVersus</em> is a “platform fighter,” which basically means it’s a derivative work of the <em>Smash Bros.</em> style and structure. It’s also a massive IP crossover, with a roster full of hits from cartoons, movies, and shows under the Warner Bros. umbrella. There’s no holding back in terms of worrying what source material children may be exposed to for the first time either, with <em>Friday the 13th</em>’s Jason Voorhees and <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ Arya Stark in the mix right alongside characters from <em>Scooby-Doo</em> and <em>Adventure Time</em>. It’s one of the best of its kind as well, with a rock-solid foundation combining the party game chaos this genre is known for with a surprisingly serious interest in the language and cadence of a capital-F Fighting game.</p><p>In the hands of developer Player First Games, that combo works quite well. Each character has a lengthy and creative move set full of distinct, IP-flavored properties alongside more common video game elements such as “cold things make you slow.” Looking at command lists is almost daunting in a MOBA kind of way, but in practice the basics are so rock-solid and uncomplicated that you can ignore the nuance and still have a great time. Between the stuff that’s obviously taken from <em>Smash</em> and the little dashes of extras and new ideas, <em>MultiVersus</em> makes an incredible first impression. From a gameplay perspective, anyway. When you boot the game up, the menus and UI begin to tell a different story entirely.</p><p>This could have been a heck of a comeback story. <em>MultiVersus</em> originally came out in 2022 as an “Open Beta,” inviting players to try the game out and maybe drop some dollars to become “Founders” in exchange for some goodies. Despite general aversion to “GaaS” models and feelings that there was something a bit cynical about Warner Bros. just tossing a bunch of the IPs it’s accumulated into a crossover fighter, it seemed like <em>MultiVersus</em> was a hit. Between a strong debut tournament at EVO, surprisingly compelling vibes and mechanics, and shocking player numbers, the momentum was stronger than anyone expected.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="e8bc7a4871c3fc6525dd9bf637b2d755" data-recommend-id="image://e8bc7a4871c3fc6525dd9bf637b2d755" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of characters fighting in MultiVersus." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of characters fighting in MultiVersus." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->WB Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e8bc7a4871c3fc6525dd9bf637b2d755" data-recommend-id="image://e8bc7a4871c3fc6525dd9bf637b2d755" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of characters fighting in MultiVersus." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unfortunately it wasn’t long before <em>MultiVersus</em> started buckling under its own weight. Player First is a small team saddled with an enormous task. The game was plagued with technical issues and balancing problems that only became more evident as more people dug in. Fixes made other problems pop up, and it felt like there was always something wrong, from overpowered characters to devastating fundamental flaws.<br></p><p>To PFG’s credit, these folks did an absurd amount of work in record time, even completely overhauling how hitboxes worked. At the same time, that work had to be funded somehow, and the microtransactions, seasonal content, and so on were also implemented during this “Open Beta” run. This stuff came with its own set of problems, as PFG grappled with reward allotments, Battle Pass XP scaling, event timing, yadda yadda. A lot of real-time learning was happening, to say the least.<br></p><p>Then <em>MultiVersus</em> was unexpectedly shut down. The “Open Beta” period had ended, the feedback was collected, and the devs needed to go head down for a while to come back with the best game they could make for 1.0. This came as a surprise for many; most players expected the Open Beta to simply roll into 1.0, as is often the case in similar service games, especially since a lot of money had already changed hands, as players bought Founder packs, skins, multiple Battle Passes, and more. That brings us to today. <em>MultiVersus</em> 1.0 arrived a few weeks ago, and I wanted to take my time with it, being sure that I was giving PFG a fair shake, as well as time to smooth out bugs, and maybe also Bugs if he came out too strong again. Given how strong its foundations are, I was really hoping for this game to get a win after so much turbulence. Unfortunately, though, it hasn’t quite worked out that way.<br></p><p>Throughout these first few weeks following 1.0’s release, <em>MultiVersus</em> has once again been a solid game plagued by problems. Bafflingly, some of those problems were repeats from before, such as a very deja vu-inducing lack of Battle Pass XP from playing matches, as well as XP being added but at an insultingly low rate. There were important features and options, including accessibility-oriented settings, that were just absent for no reason. Perhaps the loudest and strangest omission was one that immediately <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/multiversus-unlock-characters-local-tournaments-1851505068&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/multiversus-unlock-characters-local-tournaments-1851505068">made <em>MultiVersus</em>’ strong community prospects look dire</a></span>.<br></p><p>All of this stuff has been addressed or is confirmed to be addressed soon, following days of yelling or pleading from players in some cases. The messaging has been rough, with nobody actually knowing if some of these changes, omissions, or alleged bugs were on purpose or not until after the reactions were creating headlines and viral social media posts. It’s hard to undo that kind of damage.<br></p><p>Which is a shame, because <em>MultiVersus</em> remains a blast to play, especially after an initial round of patches and hotfixes. It’s a slower game than before, with a ton of effort put into making the action more reactive and visually digestible. The characters are a little larger, and the camera is more zoomed in. Additional animation work has been done to make hit detection more legible, and the end result of all this is a platform fighter that feels informed by “normal” fighting game logic in many ways. Spacing, reacting, reading, punishing, zoning, footsies…all these keywords are more pronounced in <em>MultiVersus</em> 1.0.<br></p><p>To me, this is a substantial improvement across the board. I understand some of the negative reaction to the slower pace, but speed isn’t an inherent plus for fighters. I may be exposing myself as someone who prefers <em>Street Fighter</em>, but having the breathing space to think more heavily about what I’m doing, and what my opponent is doing, feels better. And having that kind of mentality in a platform fighter feels distinct. Plus, it really helps the style coursing through every element of <em>MultiVersus</em> really shine.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="e8d4b171c727ec920ab6df532d3a541f" data-recommend-id="image://e8d4b171c727ec920ab6df532d3a541f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shaggy from Scooby-Doo is shown with an assortment of &quot;perk&quot; icons next to him.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One thing that hasn’t changed from the Open Beta to now is <em>MultiVersus</em>’ radiating passion for the characters and properties it pulls from. While you can’t argue that this game has anywhere near the same polish or production value as <em>Smash Bros.</em>, the amount of creativity, effort, and love put into molding these characters into a coherent fighting game universe is very close. My favorite example is Tom and Jerry, a pair of troublemakers who are living out an episode of their cartoon show instead of actively participating in combat. Jason Voorhees, a new example, has been presented in a new way visually, but has iconic movie moments built into his moveset. The <em>Looney Tunes</em> energy and reality-breaking toon lunacy is all over the place, even beyond the characters. This is the secret sauce <em>MultiVersus</em> is operating with, and a huge part of what makes the game feel special compared to its peers, despite its glaring problems and GaaS failings.<br></p><p>The new Rifts mode encapsulates that tug-of-war between the secret sauce and the corporatized, free-to-play gaming nonsense. <em>MultiVersus</em> needed a campaign-style mode for non-competitive players. This is that, and in a lot of ways it feels similar to a classic <em>Smash Bros.</em> mode. You make your way through stages that are themed, with specific opponents that have various buffs or other unusual gameplay gimmicks to break up the normal. There are goofy challenges like breaking targets, or a jump rope minigame that simpy exists to highlight the absurdity.<br></p><p>But of course, there’s a moment when the monkey’s paw curls a finger. Rifts have a “Gems” system woven in that asks players to equip these collectibles rewarding stat bonuses and extra buffs. Playing higher difficulties requires grinding the everloving bejeezus out of these Gems, and that’s just to get the doors to open. Succeeding requires further grinding, and even participating in some of the stage objectives (necessary to unlock more Gems) can require things like specific characters or even premium skins in some cases.<br></p><p>Currently, one of the new characters (Agent Smith of <em>The Matrix</em>) can be unlocked early, but it requires defeating 20 distinct bosses, something that can only be accomplished by going through multiple Rifts and multiple difficulty levels. The Rifts are still being rolled out, and it’s not actually possible to get Smith yet, but the prospect of staring down a sort of miniature Battle Pass that asks you to turn the silly campaign mode into a second job is exhausting. But hey, you can just wait a few weeks and pay up your real money if you don’t want to deal with all this!<br></p><p>Enjoying <em>MultiVersus</em> is a series of “yeah, but”s. It launched in poor shape with missing features and settings. Yeah, <em>but</em> it’s a fun, well-designed game that is full of tangible passion. There’s an absurd amount of grinding and pressure to spend money, even incorporated into the campaign mode. Yeah, <em>but</em> it’s a fun campaign with a lot of funny gimmicks and co-op! The roster is big and the new characters are great! Yeah, <em>but</em> you’re expected to grind daily or pony up chunks of cash to actually use them.<br></p><p>It’s the cookie jar. I want to play and praise <em>MultiVersus</em> for everything it does right. But everything it does poorly, or even wrong in a sense, has me wanting to slap my own wrist. <em>MultiVersus</em> has even managed to bungle those aspects of the games-as-a-service model that players have largely come to accept. There has been some course-correcting since launch, but the fact that was even necessary only shows how some forces behind these kinds of games are always ready to push the boundaries on monetization. It feels wrong, ethically, to participate in, and especially to recommend this game to others. But at the same time, it’s so good! Not even in the skinner box kind of way; <em>MultiVersus</em> is a legitimately well-made and lovingly constructed platform fighter that celebrates cartoons and movies I enjoy in effective, gameplay-centric ways. Rick and Morty are there too, I guess.<br></p><p><em>MultiVersus</em> is great. But I wouldn’t feel good about letting my own kid play it. That sucks.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s four back-to-back viewings every day since <em>Look Back </em>was released in theaters. Even with a short runtime of an hour and one minute, it’s still a commitment to see that often. Between all these viewings, Kojima <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1807280914684375299/photo/1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1807280914684375299/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his thoughts</a></span> on the film on June 30. “<em>Look Back</em>” is one of the most remarkable anime of the past decade,” he wrote, “I was shaken to my core! The tenderness, the kindness, the strength! Such rich expressions and sensitivity, surpassing even a live-action film! I was moved by the present and future of entertainment!”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31711040/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31711040/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Look Back</em></a></span><em> </em>follows two students, Fujino and Kyomoto, as they both create manga in competition against and eventually with each other. Like many of Fujimoto’s other works including the short <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-manga-2022-one-punch-man-hell-paradise-chainsaw-ma-1849920639/slides/4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-manga-2022-one-punch-man-hell-paradise-chainsaw-ma-1849920639/slides/4"><em>Goodbye, Eri</em></a></span> and even parts of his more popular series such as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Punch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Punch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Fire Punch</em></a></span>, <em>Look Back </em>deals with the purpose of consuming and creating art, while also serving as an introspective meditation on Fujimoto’s career as a manga artist. But this is Fujimoto, so don’t expect quiet character drama from start to finish. Things will get weird, and you should also be ready to cry. Seems like these themes and how the story executes them got to Kojima, which isn’t surprising given his own status as a revered artist in the gaming space. Kojima has an unending respect for other artists with inspired visions (see his affinity for <em>Mad Max</em> creator <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mad-max-furiosa-director-wants-hideo-kojima-video-game-1851496339&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mad-max-furiosa-director-wants-hideo-kojima-video-game-1851496339">George Miller</a></span>). </p><p>If you want to see what all the fuss is about after all of Kojima’s raving, you’ll have to wait as <em>Look Back</em> currently doesn’t have a wide U.S. release date.

As of this writing, Kojima hasn’t yet posted about <em>Look Back</em> on July 2, so no sign if he is still keeping his viewing streak going.</p><p>. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
