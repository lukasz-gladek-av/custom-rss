		<p>Kingdom Two Crowns: Call of Olympus was<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/20/kingdom-two-crowns-call-of-olympus-dlc-revealed/"> originally revealed back in May</a>, and now it has a release date. Players who want to venture through a new version of Olympus can do so when the Call of Olympus DLC releases on October 8th. In the Kingdom Two Crowns: Call of Olympus DLC, the Greed has started to take over the home of the Gods, who require your aid.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Two Crowns: Call of Olympus | Date Reveal Trailer | Wishlist Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fsx2lMf-A98?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Journeying to the top of Mount Olympus will not be a simple feat, as to gain access you need to gain the favour of some of the gods, including Athena, Hermes, Artemis, and Hephaestus. In addition to that, players will travel to Temple and Quest islands, which hold artifacts to use against Greed, treasures, and challenges to complete. In total, there are four artifacts to be found that represent one of the gods. There are also new mounts to find and unlock within the DLC, with those being the Chimera, the underworld’s guardian Cerberus, Pegasus, and Donkey. The Greed is also stronger this time round with boss battles having multiple stages to complete to beat them, but you do get allies of your own. You can build a fleet of ships to join you, use siege weapons, and have Hoplites fight with you.</p>

<p>In our Kingdom Two Crowns review, Thomas said,&nbsp;<em>“Kingdom Two Crowns feels more like an extensive update than a new entry to the series, but the base game is still so immensely enjoyable that it doesn’t really matter. This is the perfect starting point for new players, and those who are returning might still be surprised by some of the secrets to be found.”</em></p>

<p>Kingdom Two Crowns: Call of Olympus will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, iOS, and Android. It will be £8.49 on consoles, and £3.49 for mobile devices.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-dev-wanted-to-make-two-games-at-once-but-one-is-winning-out/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios publicly <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-larian-studios-2-new-original-projects-best-work-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> a while ago that it is working on two major new projects following its decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-4-playable-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abandon the plan to make a Baldur's Gate 3 seque</a>l. What we didn't know for certain is that Larian is planning to make them at the same time, not one after the other, but as Larian CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/baldurs-gate-3-studio-wanted-to-make-2-rpgs-at-once-but-its-devs-got-swallowed-by-the-ambitions-of-the-one-we-want-to-release-first/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Gamesradar</a>, one of the projects is winning out.</p>
<p><em>We had some people who were dedicated to the other one, and they just got swallowed by the ambitions of the one that we want to release first. So we will try and do it concurrently, but we have to figure out how to leave people alone.</em></p>
<p>Vincke then tackled another major issue for the studio. While the Larian CEO originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-breaks-814k-steam-ccu-but-larian-wants-the-next-game-to-be-smaller-and-to-stay-independent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hoped</a> to make a smaller game after the gargantuan Baldur's Gate 3, he is now coming to terms with the fact that the next games are going to be really large, too.</p>
<p><em>We always say we do want to rein in our ambitions, but then we start thinking, and the machine is meant to make large games. We were made for making large, ambitious RPGs and to try new stuff.</em></p>
<p><em>One of the core problems - it's not really a problem - but one of the core problems to do what you're suggesting is that we actually know what we want from our gameplay systems, how to evolve them, how to do new things…and they're all big.</em></p>
<p>It's not surprising, given the growth of the studio. Just four months ago, Larian <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-opens-new-office-in-warsaw-to-help-make-its-two-very-ambitious-new-rpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the opening of a new office in Warsaw, Poland. This is the seventh office, following the headquarters in Ghent and the offices in Quebec City, Dublin, Kuala Lumpur, Guildford, and Barcelona. The total headcount is around 500, making Larian effectively a triple-A developer at this point.</p>

                <p>Assassin's Creed Invictus, a multiplayer-focused title in Ubisoft's long running franchise, is reportedly inspired by the round-based gameplay of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fall-guys/" data-ref-id="5000-497671">Fall Guys</a> and will support up to 16 players, according to a leaker.</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft announced Assassin's Creed Invictus back in 2022 alongside a host of other Assassin's Creed projects, but no official details other than its multiplayer nature or a release date have been officially revealed since. Now, a leaker by the name <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1837577668365373935" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">j0nathan on X</a>, who has a history of leaking Assassin's Creed information, has shared what might be the first details (in French) on what Assassin's Creed Invictus actually is.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1837577668365373935" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Pour venger mon Slapp, voici des infos sur Assassin's Creed Invictus, le jeu multijoueur censé sortir l'année prochaine : <br>- Ce sera une sorte de "Fall Guys" : 16 joueurs (pour le moment) qui s'affrontent sur plusieurs manches avec des "jeux" différents.<br>- Parmi les jeux on… <a href="https://t.co/VSgKGTjmaM" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/VSgKGTjmaM</a> <a href="https://t.co/Y2RVLanhCt" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/Y2RVLanhCt</a></p>  — j0nathan (@xj0nathan) <a href="https://twitter.com/xj0nathan/status/1837577668365373935?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">According to j0nathan, Assassin's Creed Invictus will see up to 16 players compete in round-based games inspired by the multiplayer format seen in Fall Guys, with participants looking to be the last assassin standing. The rounds will feature various game modes like Team Deathmatch and a free-for-all mode, as well as a mode where players race to reach points on the map first. Those who survive a round are reportedly able to choose between various power-ups, which let players craft a "build" of sorts over the course of the session.</p><p dir="ltr">The game modes themselves will reportedly take place on maps inspired by previous Assassin's Creed games, like Baghdad from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage/" data-ref-id="5000-571409">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> or a Japan-based map inspired by the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. Some maps will have environmental hazards, like a map based near Pompeii that will have players dodging pools of rising lava.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the leak, players will be able to choose between various characters from the franchise's history, with j0nathan stating they can "confirm" characters like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-41674">Assassin's Creed 2's</a> Ezio and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-brotherhood/" data-ref-id="5000-76087">Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood</a> villain Cesare Borgia.</p><p dir="ltr">It's best to take the above information with a grain of salt until official details from Ubisoft are announced, but for now, that's about everything that is known about Assassin's Creed Invictus.</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot confirmed earlier this year it is working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-assassins-creed-remakes-in-the-works-including-potentially-black-flag/1100-6524576/" data-ref-id="1100-6524576">remakes of older Assassin's Creed titles</a>.

		<p>Sony has announced that a State of Play will be taking place tomorrow, September 24th at 3PM PDT/6pm EDT/ 11pm BST. The show will last 30 minutes with news and updates for around 20 games to be showcased.</p>
<p>The games include both PS5 and PSVR 2 titles, and there is likely to be more news about games that will take advantage of the PS5 Pro’s specs. The State of Play will stream across YouTube and Twitch.</p>


<p>There are not that many rumours around to say what will be shown, though one that has been persistent the last week is a Days Gone remaster, which may or may not generate a similar reaction the news of the Horizon Zero Dawn remaster. If there is a remaster announcement then many would be waiting for games like Bloodborne, which would be a very popular option for fans.</p>
<p>Sony’s State of Play comes a few days before Tokyo Game Show gets into full swing, so there could be some early surprises from Japanese studios. Microsoft also have a Tokyo Game Show showcase taking place this week, with that happening on September 26th, and that will have a focus on games from Japanese studios.</p>

		<p>Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings game has been given a new release date, following on from i<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/14/cosy-hobbit-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-delayed-to-2025/">ts delay from a couple of weeks back</a>. That new release date is March 25th, 2025, and from then on you will be able to live the cost life of a Hobbit. To mark the news, a brand new behind the scenes look at the development of Tales of the Shire has been released focusing on features and inspirations.</p>
<p><iframe title="TOTS / for review only" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TFIWB7pYNTs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Tales of the Shire allows players to create their own Hobbit, who lives in Bywater and can establish their own life. As time passes in Bywater, other Hobbits will come to ask your Hobbit for help on matters. Additionally, you can do all the cosy things a Hobbit’s life should consist of, including growing your own vegetables, going fishing, trading items with neighbours, and cooking up meals. You can wander around Bywater visiting other Hobbits and going to the shop, or venture a bit further out to forage in the fields for supplies.</p>
<p><em>“Wētā Workshop has been trusted with J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth universe for more than 25 years, and over that time we have built up a deep understanding of the lore and a real love of Middle-earth that flows through our creative work across screen, collectibles and now, our cosy sims games,”</em> said Richard Taylor, Co-founder and CEO at Wētā Workshop. <em>“Tales of the&nbsp;<span>Shire</span>&nbsp;allows us to inspire our talents in an entirely new medium and, ultimately, create this game for people just like us – fans of The Lord of the Rings. This is a beautiful way that players who are looking for a quieter, more peaceful time can discover this in a less explored corner of this universe.”</em></p>

<p>Tales of the Shire will be released for PC via Steam, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and it will also be available on Netflix.</p>

We can see him matchmaking on the PC version of the game, although the actor was smart enough to paste over his username with the word “nope.” Yes, that means you could be playing with or against Henry Cavill in Space Marine 2 PvP and you’d never know it.</p><p>Space Marine 2’s PvP, Cavill said, “has real potential to be absolutely awesome,” but he admits he knows nothing about video game development.</p><p>“Disclaimer: I know nothing about game development so the kind of dreams I have may be rather difficult to implement!” he said.</p><p>Also of note, Cavill is playing as an Ultramarine Tactical class, and he’s got a copy of The Horus Heresy Book Two on his table. The book contains rules and special characters for the pre-Heresy Iron Hands, Salamanders, Night Lords, and Word Bearers Legions, which I'm sure will set tongues wagging among the Warhammer 40,000 community.</p><p>It might make sense for Cavill to be submerged in the Warhammer 40,000 universe right now. Games Workshop recently reiterated that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-amazon-have-until-dec-2024-to-agree-creative-guidelines-for-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-film-and-tv-series-or-they-wont-happen">Amazon’s hotly anticipated Warhammer 40,000 film and TV series</a>, to which Cavill is attached, will not happen unless both companies can agree “creative guidelines” by December 2024.</p><p>In December 2023, Games Workshop said it would work with Amazon for a period of 12 months ending in December 2024 “to agree creative guidelines for the films and television series to be developed by Amazon.” And that agreement “will only proceed if the creative guidelines are mutually agreed between Games Workshop and Amazon.”</p><p>“We will update you accordingly,” Games Workshop said, like a Space Marine might tell a Guardsman anxious about a coming battle. That means Games Workshop and Amazon have just a few months to sort themselves out, or the Warhammer 40,000 movie and TV series fans so desperately want might never happen.</p><p>If the Warhammer 40,000 Amazon projects move forward, Cavill will be involved. The Hollywood actor is set to star in and executive produce the Warhammer 40,000 franchise across all Amazon Studios productions.</p><p>While concrete details on shows and films are likely a way off, Cavill nonetheless sounded excited to be bringing Warhammer 40,000 to life. “I have loved Warhammer since I was a boy, making this moment truly special for me. The opportunity to shepherd this cinematic universe from its inception is quite the honor and the responsibility,” said Cavill. “I couldn’t be more grateful for all the hard work put in by Vertigo, Amazon and Games Workshop to make this happen. One step closer to making a nigh-on lifelong dream come true.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In February, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/henry-cavill-says-warhammer-40000-amazon-project-the-greatest-privilege-of-my-professional-career"><u>Cavill touched again on the Warhammer 40,000 Amazon project</u></a>, saying: "It is the greatest privilege of my professional career to have this opportunity. I can’t say too much, again, it’s early days still. But to have this opportunity to bring it to screen, and be at the tiller so it can be faithful, is key to me.</p><p>“This is the stuff I’ve been dealing with since I was a kid. This is the stuff I spend my free time daydreaming about, as an adult as well, and I get to bring it into life. There is no greater reason than I joined the industry than doing something like this.”</p><p>Warhammer 40,000 is Games Workshop’s science fiction universe used as the setting for its hugely popular tabletop wargame starring the iconic Space Marines. It’s a grimdark universe in which humanity clings on to survival in the face of terrifying threats within and without the fascist Imperium.</p><p>Who might Cavill play across the Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe? Talking to IGN in 2021, Cavill expressed interest in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/henry-cavill-warhammer-tv-show"><u>playing one of the Primarchs or Captain-Generals</u></a>, who are high-ranking key characters from the Warhammer lore.</p><p>As for Space Marine 2, be sure to check out IGN's interview with Saber development chief Tim Willits to find out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3">what the game's success means for DLC and a potential Space Marine 3</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>The next generation of Xbox consoles reportedly could include both a console and a handheld.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/were-building-plans-for-the-25th-anniversary-of-halo-and-xbox-microsoft-confirms-in-a-new-interview-we-have-such-a-rich-heritage-you-have-to-celebrate-that" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, Microsoft is taking another two-pronged approach to the Xbox hardware market like it did with the Series X and S. The plan is reportedly to have a traditional-style successor to the Series X, as well as a handheld gaming option similar to that of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-steam-deck-games-to-play-right-now/2900-4083/" data-ref-id="2900-4083">Steam Deck</a>.</p><p>It's currently unclear what this approach would end up looking like, but if the handheld anything like the Steam Deck, players will likely be able to play their digital purchases and bounce between the handheld and console. There likely won't be a separate ecosystem like the 3DS and Wii U or Vita and PS3. There's also the possibility that it could look more like a Switch and have both the console and handheld components work together.</p><p>Separately from this report, Microsoft <a href="https://www.licenseglobal.com/video-games/xbox-gaming-evolved" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">also confirmed</a> that it has plans to celebrate both Xbox and Halo's 25th anniversaries, which are landing in 2026. This current generation has been a strange one. Developers are still making games for last generation's consoles, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-analysts-weigh-in-on-price-gta-6-effect-and-more/1100-6526411/" data-ref-id="1100-6526411">backlash against the PS5 Pro's price</a> puts the traditional console generation cycle into an awkward spot.</p><p>Last year, documents regarding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-digital-only-mid-gen-refresh-has-been-leaked-in-court-documents/1100-6517813/" data-ref-id="1100-6517813">Xbox's mid-gen refresh plans were leaked</a>, aiming for a supposed October 2024 release.

</div><div>



            <p>
Nintendo has submitted a mystery new "wireless device" to the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for approval that does not appear to be the hotly-expected <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Specific details of the device remain under-wraps, as Nintendo's <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=Y&amp;application_id=m9V0HXBXo8nolsDsEYU3Nw%3D%3D&amp;fcc_id=BKECLO001">application</a> comes with a confidentiality request set to be held for another 180 days - until late March 2025.
</p>
<p>
Still, we know a couple of things. First, its shape - a roughly-square object with curved corners when viewed from underneath. Second, that it has wireless capabilities - including an intriguing 24GHz mmWave sensor. It's also powered by a USB-C connection. 
</p>
<p>
Could this be a Switch 2 peripheral? After all, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">leaked and likely-real (if dated) Switch 2 prototype</a> model features USB-C ports top and bottom. Perhaps, but what's odd here is the device's product code (CLO-001) denotes an item treated by Nintendo as its own separate 'thing'. 
</p>
<p>
This is not Switch 2 (leaks have already pinned down its likely product code line) and is unlikely to be a peripheral for it (this would have a higher product number than 001). The product code also does not relate to any Nintendo device line released to date.
</p>
<p>
Back to that 24Ghz mmWave sensor. These items can detect human presence or movement in a room and are often paired with smart home features to activate lights or monitor the general activity of people or pets. It's intriguing to imagine the usage case for this in a video game. Could it detect gestures? Is this some kind of party game add-on? 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's application for confidentiality simply states that details of the device "contain technical information which we deem to be trade secrets and proprietary. If made public, the information might be used to the disadvantage of the applicant in the market place".

That, in and of itself, is more than enough to get somebody invested in the action, at least for a match or two. From there, <em>Helldivers 2 </em>sinks its hooks into players very easily.</p><p>The worlds on which your battles take place have so much going on, you may be in awe from the second those boots touch ground. Visually, every planet—even the dead ones—is a marvel, and most of them actually feel distinct, whether due to changes in the biome or larger planetwide effects like fire storms or blizzards. The barks from player characters further reveal the extent of <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-movie-disney-1851269272&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-movie-disney-1851269272">satire and humor</a></span>, which is hilariously unsubtle in its criticism of the fascist underpinnings of Super-Earth, the game’s “good guys.” </p><p>But my favorite thing about <em>Helldivers 2</em> is probably how it never fails to make you feel small and weak. You are, at the end of the day, a human facing off against aliens that simply outclass you. The bug-like Terminids come in all manner of shapes, sizes, and forms that have their own capabilities. Some can fly, while others go invisible and sneak up on you to shred you to ribbons with their serrated claws. Armored brood commanders send grunts charging in your direction, and there are even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-how-to-kill-spore-chargers-update-1851618284&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-how-to-kill-spore-chargers-update-1851618284">massive armored chargers that emit acid-green fogs</a></span> to obscure their position. Hell, there are variants of the latter that unfurl tentacles that burrow into the ground and emerge again as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kill-beat-impalers-guide-update-1851614495&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kill-beat-impalers-guide-update-1851614495">massive spiked tendrils that can impale you</a></span>. Sure, you can call down weapons to defeat them, but in one-on-one scuffles, these things are superior to you in every way, and that’s just one enemy faction.</p><p>Due to this obvious and intentional imbalance, overcoming the odds feels clutch, and victory almost always emerges from smart interplay with your team and a smattering of good luck. I remember running from a hulking Bile Titan and facing my camera back at it while I booked it. I had nothing in the way of resources that could take it out, so I assumed I would just try to dodge its projectiles and legs for as long as I possibly could. The action felt like the big setpiece sequence of an alien invasion film, but the real movie moment came when I rounded a corner, found an ally with exactly the weapon needed to take out my pursuer, and watched them bring it down as I dove past them to safety. Sequences like this happen all the time in <em>Helldivers 2</em> without prompt. </p><p>Once the action gets you, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-guides-tips-chargers-striders-settings-1851265570&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-guides-tips-chargers-striders-settings-1851265570">the rest of <em>Helldivers 2</em></a></span> just kind of clicks into place. Resources can be found around its huge maps and put toward passive upgrades back on your ship, which forces you to explore and discover how deep these environments actually are. They are dotted with patrols, enemy camps, optional objectives, and installments, and taking on all of it can yield even deeper rewards, as well as a stronger sense of mastery over <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Soon enough, you’ll be undertaking major orders, defending planets or trying to capture other ones, and maximizing your loadouts and deployable stratagems like rocket barrages or heavy machine gun turrets to meet the increasing challenges of the missions you undertake.<br></p><p>This is just the tip of the iceberg, too. Falling for <em>Helldivers 2 </em>also means inevitably becoming a conspiracy theorist who constantly argues about the appearance of a third enemy faction, and the motivations of “Joel,” the developer at Arrowhead Game Studios largely <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-galactic-war-game-master-joel-1851297376&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-galactic-war-game-master-joel-1851297376">responsible for the tug-of-war meta narrative</a></span> that encapsulates the game. Like I said, <em>Helldivers 2 </em>fans are different, but they can occasionally be good fun, and if all of that sounds like a good time to you, picking this game up seems like an obvious move while it’s on sale.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Regarding games, we already know that Sonic x Shadow Generations will arrive on October 22, 2024, and Sonic Central 2024 could feature announcements revolving around the upcoming title. </p>



<p>Moreover, there were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-frontiers-2-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumblings</a> about Sonic Frontiers 2 being in development back in April 2024, and many insiders claimed that the game could be released under a different name but would follow a gameplay style similar to Frontiers.&nbsp;However, none of it has been officially confirmed, so we don’t know whether this untitled project will receive an announcement at Sonic Central 2024.</p>



<p>Additionally, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 has been confirmed for December 20, 2024, so fans can expect something about the live-action movie.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/elgato-game-capture-neo-review-recording-and-streaming-made-easy-and-affordable/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you’re into streaming and game capture, you’ve probably heard of Elgato. They’ve dominated the game capture space for over a decade due to their overall quality and understanding of what streamers and content creators need with their products. This time around, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elgato-neo-the-new-family-of-elgato-products-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elgato has taken a different approach with its Elgato Neo line</a>, offering a series of new products in a new Plug-and-play format at a competitive price. For this review, we’ll be deep-diving into the Elgato Game Capture Neo, its latest game capture device that is great for anyone wanting to get into streaming and content creation.</p>



<h2 id="h-cut-to-the-chase">Cut to the Chase</h2>



<p><strong>Price –</strong> $119.99 / £119.99<br><strong>Max Passthrough Resolution</strong> – 4K60HDR<br><strong>Max Capture Resolution</strong> – 1080p60<br><strong>How does it work? –</strong> It connects your console (PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, etc.) to your PC, laptop, or iPad to stream or record.<br><strong>What apps are compatible?</strong> – It’s compatible with almost every app, including Discord, OBS, etc. and can be used to stream to Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and Tiktok.<br><strong>Is there a subscription service needed?</strong> – No, it’s a one-time purchase price, and that’s it.</p>



<h2 id="h-an-affordable-option">An Affordable Option</h2>



<p>I’ve been in the gaming content creator scene for about 15 years now, and the truth is, it can be costly. However, the Elgato Game Capture Neo, priced at $119, is a fantastic price point that suddenly makes streaming and recording gameplay affordable for the masses. The Elgato Game Capture Neo offers a 4K60 max passthrough resolution and a 1080p60 max capture resolution, a perfectly acceptable content output resolution for any novice content creator. For comparison, the Elgato HD60 X will also offer these same resolutions, but with frame rate support up to 240FPS priced at $159.99, but unless you have a monitor that supports such a high FPS, you’re getting the same bang for your buck with the Neo but 25% cheaper.</p>



<h2 id="h-plug-in-and-play">Plug in and Play</h2>



<p>All the Elgato Neo family devices have a ” plug-in and play” design that makes whichever Neo device you use simple and easy to understand. While you will still need to download the Elgato Capture Software or OBS to start your recording or steaming journey, the Elgato Game Capture Neo can be set up from unboxing to recording in minutes.</p>



<p><em><strong>Note – You must have two HDMI cables handy as they do not come with the device. </strong></em></p>



<ol>
<li>Connect HDMI IN to your console and HDMI OUT to your TV or monitor.</li>



<li>Connect Game Capture Neo directly to a USB 3.0 (or better) port on your PC or Mac. (To connect to your iPad, use a good third-party adapter or USB-C to USB-C cable. Do not use a USB hub.)</li>



<li>Download your favorite recording or broadcasting app.</li>



<li>Select Game Capture Neo in your favorite recording or broadcasting app.</li>



<li>Share or share your gameplay on Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, Tiktok, etc.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong><em>Note—If you’re getting “No Signal,” you need to disable HDCP on your console. This is located under Settings in your console’s dashboard.</em></strong></p>



<h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Overall, the Elgato Game Capture Neo is a great capture device for anyone who wants to try out streaming or content creation. While it doesn’t record to the highest resolutions and framerates, it’s important to note that this product is for those who want to dip their toes into recording and streaming gaming content without spending hundreds of dollars on just one product.</p>



<p>Its elegant and simplistic design, lightweight and small size make it an ideal capture device to add to any setup and is the perfect choice for gamers on the move. Overall, it’s another high-quality product from Elgato and a great addition to its existing product line. </p>



<p>The entire Neo family of products, which consists of the Elgato Game Capture Neo, Stream Deck Neo, Facecam Neo, Wave Neo, and Key Light Neo can all be yours now for £399 on the <a href="https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/p/neo-creator-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elgato website</a>.</p>

<p>When The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom began development, it started out as a dungeon creator game. That’s according to the game’s developers at Grezzo.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q&amp;A from Nintendo</a>, Grezzo game director Satoshi Terada said that the studio looked at “a few different ways to play the game”.</p>



<p>“In one approach, Link could copy and paste various objects, such as doors and candlesticks, to create original dungeons,”  Terada said. “During this exploration phase, this idea was called an “edit dungeon” because players could create their own Legend of Zelda gameplay.” </p>



<p>Producer Eiji Aonuma then chimed in saying that after playing it, he wanted to take the game in different direction.</p>



<p>“As I played, I started thinking that while it’s fun to create your own dungeon and let other people play it, it’s also not so bad to place items that can be copied and pasted in the game field, and create gameplay where they can be used to fight enemies,” he said. </p>



<p>“That was the beginning of gameplay using “echoes.” The gameplay was shifted from creating dungeons up until then to using copied-and-pasted items as tools to further your own adventure.”</p>



<p>The changes were made, according to Tomomi Sano, the first female director in the history of the Zelda franchise, about a year into the game’s development.</p>



<p>”&nbsp;…It’d been that long,” said Terada before Sano chimed in confirming.</p>



<p>“Everyone else was developing the game with dungeon creation in mind, but I was right next to them thinking of something different. (Laughs) But there’s a reason it took a year to upend the tea table,” Aonuma then added.</p>



<p>“After all, you can’t really see the potential for ideas to develop into solid gameplay until you can verify features and their feel, so I wanted them to try making it first. I felt that the “edit dungeon” feature they showed me had significant potential to be developed into a new way of playing the Legend of Zelda games if the gameplay was changed to use “echoes” instead. So, I thought it would be good to expand in that direction and could be even more interesting that way. However, there was one concern. Even though game consoles have larger memory capacity nowadays, the more things players can copy and paste, the more game memory is used up. I was really worried that it would crash the game.”</p>



<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, the first Zelda game to feature Zelda as a main playable character, releases exclusively for Nintendo Switch on September 26.</p>

            <p>
With PlayStation 5 Pro pre-order day looming, Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/23/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow/">announced</a> it's airing another of its PlayStation State of play broadcasts later this week.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, this latest State of Play airs on YouTube and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> tomorrow, 24th September, at 11pm in the UK/3pm PT. It's promising over 30 minutes of news and updates "on more than 20 upcoming PS5 and PS VR2 games from studios around the world."
</p>
<p>
Exactly what those games will be remains to be seen, but likely candidates include Sony's impending Until Dawn remake, which we've seen nothing of since its announcement earlier this year, alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s remake of beloved psychological horror <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>, which was recently confirmed to be a PlayStation console exclusive for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-will-be-a-ps5-console-exclusive-for-one-year">year after its release</a>.

<figcaption>When it costs £700, who exactly is the PS5 Pro for?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb7vhF2ELZg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
As for reveals, Guerrilla Games' long-rumoured <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> remaster seems a fair bet given its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-rated-for-ps5-and-pc">recent ESRB rating</a>, and reports have suggested 2019's open-world zombie game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> is also getting the remaster treatment - so perhaps there's a space in the show for that too. Oh, and if we're doing remasters Sony, I know one or two people who wouldn't mind nipping back to Yharnam, eh?
</p>
<p>
In amongst all the above, Sony will almost certainly want to further spotlight <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-pro-upgrade-patches-for-around-40-or-50-games-at-launch-this-november">some of the "40 or 50" games</a> getting PS5 Pro enhancements this November, given the less-than-enthusiastic response to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">the machine's £700+ price tag</a> and the fact pre-orders open this Thursday, 26th September.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, feel free to make your own guesses in the comments below - and then tune in tomorrow at 11pm UK time (we'll be covering the show here on Eurogamer if you want to join in the communal fun) to have your wildest theories proved correct or otherwise.

			<p>It's no secret that Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2 has been a huge hit, experiencing a record-breaking launch. Saber Interactive spoke to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN in an exclusive interview</a>, where Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits said the success of the game would positively affect future projects. At the moment, there has been no official sales figure announced by either Saber or Focus Entertainment, but it's suspected to be a relatively high number. This comes after Focus confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-already-sold-two-million-units/">two million had played the game at launch</a>, with Space Marine 2 quickly becoming the most-played Warhammer game of any type that has been launched on Steam.</p>
<p>Space Marine 2 reached 225,690 peak concurrent players on Steam, and it's possible that the numbers could continue to rise in the future if DLC is added to the game or other updates. While Willits refused to go into numbers about Space Marine 2's success regarding the revenue or profit made, he says that Space Marine 2 is the fastest-selling game he's ever worked on, which comes as a surprise considering he's worked on games such as Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein.</p>
<p>In the interview with IGN, Willits said that the budget for Space Marine 2 was less than half that of Doom Eternal, the last game he worked on as studio director at ID Software before joining Saber Interactive in 2019. Because of the small budget for this game, and the standard edition costing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183900/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$59.99 on Steam</a> and $69.99 on console, it's very heavily hinted that the game has been a very profitable project.</p>
<p>The success of Space Marine 2 means that the staff at Saber Interactive can "dream bigger." There are already big plans for Space Marine 2, including new missions, enemies, and weapons, as well as adjustments once the game has spent a significant amount of time on the market.</p>
<p>In addition to the post-launch plan, there is now the possibility of a story DLC and ideas floating around for Space Marine 3. The open-ended ending of Space Marine 2 makes the idea of Space Marine 3 very feasible.</p>
<p>"Our game director Dmitry Grigorenko, he has proposed some story ideas that could be a DLC or a sequel. We're literally just catching our breath. This is two weeks out. We just need to get the dust to settle. But I can confidently say that we will not disappoint our Warhammer fans in the future." Willits also goes on to say, "Hopefully, we'll be working on Space Marine content for a long time."</p>
<p>While they are considering the idea of Space Marine 3, Willits also mentions that new factions would likely be added in the sequel. However, excited fans will have to wait and see.</p>

But Carpenter is also a huge gamer who has made his opinions on the medium known many times, including stating his love for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/john-carpenter-thinks-halo-infinite-is-the-best-of-the-1848369389&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/john-carpenter-thinks-halo-infinite-is-the-best-of-the-1848369389"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a></span> and “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/10/john-carpenter-is-dedicating-his-life-to-destiny-2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/10/john-carpenter-is-dedicating-his-life-to-destiny-2/">dedicating his life</a></span>” to playing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-kotaku-review-1818530629&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-kotaku-review-1818530629"><em>Destiny 2</em></a></span>. Recently, Carpenter took to X (formerly Twitter) to praise <em>The Lost Crown</em>. In a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/TheHorrorMaster/status/1838017073790030147&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/TheHorrorMaster/status/1838017073790030147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a></span> from September 22, Carpenter wrote that the Ubisoft title is, “a great game,” going on to say that its “old-school side scrolling adventure renews the promise of the old franchise. Highly recommended!”</p><p>And Carpenter is absolutely right! <em>The Lost Crown</em> remains one of this year’s most impressive releases, in large part because it recaptures the wonder of the<em> Prince of Persia</em> franchise, which has largely been left to die for more than a decade. And while Carpenter is right that <em>The Lost Crown</em> has an old-school feel to it, it also masterfully blends those vintage vibes with modern influences from more recent Metroidvanias. </p><p><em>The Lost Crown</em> gives you a chance to explore a fascinating map full of challenging platforming levels that you unlock through the discovery of new skills over the course of your playthrough. That solid gameplay core combined with quality-of-life improvements such as a fantastic minimap/screenshot tool that helps with backtracking or a slew of accessibility settings make this one of the most welcoming yet still challenging Metroidvanias around. If it’s good enough for John Carpenter, it’s good enough for you.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
