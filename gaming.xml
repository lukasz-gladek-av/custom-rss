                <p>Romero Games, the studio headed up by John and Brenda Romero, has announced that an unspecified publisher has canceled funding for its new game, and it's believed to be Microsoft.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/romerogamesltd/status/1940716112922190248?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>, Brenda Romero said "our publisher has canceled funding for our game along with several other unannounced projects at other studios." She added, "This was a strategic decision made at a high level within the publisher, well above our visibility or control."</p><p>The wording and the timing suggests that Microsoft was the publisher for this new game, given Microsoft just confirmed it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">canceled multiple unannounced games</a>. Romero Games said years ago when its new FPS was announced that it was working with a <a href="https://www.romerogames.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"major"</a> publisher, and Microsoft would fit that bill. An affected staffer at Romero Games <a href="https://x.com/christophredl94/status/1940719223472640128?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said outright on social media</a> that, "Unfortunately, due to the recent Xbox layoffs, I've lost my position at Romero Games."</p><p>Romero went on to say, "We deeply wish there had been something, anything, we could have done to prevent this outcome." She added that Romero Games "hit every milestone on time, every time, consistently received high praises, and easily passed all our internal gates."</p><p>"We are incredibly proud of the work being done, and of the talented team behind it," she said.</p><p>Romero said the studio is now "evaluating next steps and working quickly to support our team." According to an affected staffer, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/john-romeros-next-fps-has-lost-funding-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-cuts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the "whole studio" is being let go.</a></p><p>In 2022, John Romero <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-romero-releases-a-new-doom-2-level-donating-proceeds-to-help-people-of-ukraine/1100-6501222/" data-ref-id="1100-6501222">released a new Doom II level with all proceeds going to help the people of Ukraine.</a></p><p>If the new FPS from Romero Games was indeed canceled by Microsoft, it would join the likes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Everwild</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/" data-ref-id="1100-6532921">Perfect Dark in being cancelled</a> as a result of Microsoft latest changes.

            <p>EA's executive leadership has reportedly set a goal of 100 million players for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">the upcoming Battlefield game</a>, which "very few" developers believe is achievable.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/behind-the-next-battlefield-game-culture-clash-crunch-and-colossal-stakes/">This comes from a tell-all report from Ars Technica</a>, which explores the game's many ambitions and problems through information gathered from anonymous sources. In this article, battle royale modes in competitor titles like Call of Duty inspired this <em>optimistic </em>figure.</p>
<p>"Obviously, Battlefield has never achieved those numbers before," stated one source, while another said: "It's important to understand that over about that same period, 2042 has only gotten 22 million."</p>

<p>For reference, Call of Duty Warzone reached 100 million players back in April 2021 <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2021/04/Incredible-Warzone-and-Game-Sales-Milestones">per an official blog post</a>. Warzone originally came out in March 2020, so it took roughly a year for the biggest FPS IP out there to hit that figure. In 2018, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-fortnite-triggered-an-unwinnable-war-between-parents-and-their-boys-11545397200?mod=e2tw">a Fortnite interview in the Wall Street Journal</a> revealed the game had over 200 million people download and play the industry defining battle royale.</p>
<p>According to the report, those who had worked at DICE for a while were "particularly sceptical", with one source saying: "nothing in the market research or our quality deliverables indicates that we would be anywhere near that."</p>
<p>The article also states Battlefield 5's battle royale mode Firestorm failed to meet expectations, while the aforementioned competitors continued to retain vast playerbases. Nonetheless, it seems that a new attempt at this format is what EA leadership expects will attract much of that 100 million figure. </p>
<p>This new Battlefield is currently undergoing a closed alpha test, though that hasn't stopped leaks from getting out. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-leak-confirms-return-of-fan-favourite-mode">Rush mode has been leaked</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online">some single player campaign info</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-most-important-leaks-battlefield-6">a deluge of info on weapons and a battle royale mode</a>. If this next Battlefield can hit the targets set out by EA executives, it'll be the most popular Battlefield game ever by a large margin. Whether it actually can, is something else entirely.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-expects-battlefield-6-to-have-100-million-players-three-times-more-than-the-series-best-seller]]></content:encoded>

Moving forward, we'll continue supporting Rumble with updates focused on regular, systemic in-game events and bug fixes, but no new content.   </blockquote><blockquote>Warcraft Rumble began development nine years ago as a love letter to Azeroth and launched back in 2023, reflecting input from enthusiastic players around the globe and the effort of a passionate team — some of whom continue to support Rumble or other Blizzard games, and some we’ve had to sadly part ways with. Since launch, Rumble has struggled to find its footing relative to our ambition for its long-term success, and for some time now the team has been listening to player feedback, refocusing in certain areas, and exploring different options. Some of that work showed signs of progress, but ultimately wasn’t enough to put the game on a path to sustainability.   </blockquote><blockquote>During this transition, we are focused on supporting our teammates. We’re deeply grateful to everyone at Blizzard and in the community for helping bring Warcraft Rumble to life and embracing the joy that makes this game so special. Your enthusiasm and feedback mean the world to us.</blockquote><blockquote>Fans of the game reacted with disappointment to the news, but there is little surprise given how the game has gone over the last two years. Most players are now waving goodbye to Warcraft Rumble and its community, while sending messages of support to the affected developers.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>The next shooter project from Romero Games has lost funding following recent layoffs and studio closures at Microsoft.</p>
<p>The Galway-based studio, set up by Doom creator John Romero, released a statement earlier today on social media saying its publisher had cancelled funding for its game along with "other unannounced projects at other studios". Romero Games said this decision was "well above our visibility or control".</p>
<p>As a result, the studio is now evaluating next steps, but the team is "heartbroken" at the decision.</p>
<p>While the statement does not specify Microsoft was the publisher in question, it can easily be inferred following yesterday's news. Moreover, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/john-romeros-next-fps-has-lost-funding-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-cuts/">VGC</a> spotted, artist <a href="https://x.com/christophredl94/status/1940719223472640128">Christoph Redl shared on social media</a>: "Unfortunately, due to the recent Xbox layoffs, I've lost my position at Romero Games." This confirms Microsoft's involvement.</p>
<p>The project was set to be an all-new shooter based on an original IP, created in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>The statement from Romero Games - specifically CEO and co-founder Brenda Romero, wife to John - added: "We deeply wish there had been something, anything, we could have done to prevent this outcome."</p>
<p>It continued: "This absolutely isn't a reflection of our team's work, performance, or the quality of the project itself. We hit every milestone on time, every time, consistently received high praise, and easily passed all our internal gates. We are incredibly proud of the work being done, and of the talented team behind it. The best we've worked with."</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/romero/status/1940718014540009489">Romero himself shared the statement</a>, adding: "These people are the best people I've ever worked with, and I'm sorry to say that our game and our studio were also affected."</p>
<p>The original Doom from Romero was of course developed at id Software, now part of Zenimax Media, which is itself part of Microsoft. The link to publishing the studio's next game is therefore clear.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">Microsoft laid off thousands of staff from across the business</a>, including its gaming division - it's impacted the likes of Zenimax, King, Turn 10, and Raven Software. Additionally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild has been cancelled</a>, along with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Perfect Dark reboot at The Initiative, and an unannounced MMORPG at Zenimax</a>.</p>

			<p>Romero Games, the studio founded ten years ago by DOOM series creator John Romero and his weife Brenda, confirmed its next unannounced project is no longer in the works, and the project's cancellation is related to the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">wave of Xbox layoffs</a>.</p>



<p>In a new message shared on <a href="https://x.com/romerogamesltd">X</a>, the studio confirmed that their unnamed publisher has canceled funding for their game alongside several other unannounced projects at other studios. This was a strategic decision made at a high level within the publisher and above the studio's visibility and control. The decision to cancel the project, the message continues, does not in any way reflect the team's work, performance, or quality of the project. Development was reportedly proceeding well, but this wasn't enough to avoid the project from being canned.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While Romero Games' message doesn't mention the publisher's name, a message shared on X by the studio's former hard surface artist, Christoph Redl, confirms that the project's cancellation is a consequence of the recent wave of Xbox layoffs.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Unfortunately, due to the recent Xbox layoffs, I’ve lost my position at Romero Games.</p><p>I’m now actively looking for new opportunities as a Prop Artist, Hard Surface Artist, or 3D Artist.<br>I'm open to both in-house and remote roles and excited to bring my skills to a new team. <a href="https://t.co/7vhj4bZ10b">https://t.co/7vhj4bZ10b</a></p></div>— Christoph Redl (@christophredl94) <a href="https://twitter.com/christophredl94/status/1940719223472640128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>As mentioned in the message above, Romero Games' new project is not the only one that has been canceled as a result of this week's Xbox layoffs, and a lot of studios have been impacted, from Forza Motorsport series developer<a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/"> Turn 10</a>, which was hit hard with over 70 employees having been laid off, to <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">Zenimax Online</a>, whose new MMORPG has been canceled, and Perfect Dark's developer The Initiative, which has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">shut down</a> following the cancellation of its highly anticipated project.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/perfect-dark-reboot-reportedly-canceled-developer-the-initiative-shut-down.1234959/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The ongoing Xbox layoff and cancellation wave continues, and this time, it's developer The Initiative and its long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot in the crosshairs, it seems.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Central</a>, an internal email sent to Xbox employees by studio head Matt Booty confirms the cancellation not only of&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark</em>, but also of Rare's&nbsp;<em>Everwild</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">reported yesterday</a>&nbsp;as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">massive wave of Microsoft layoffs</a>.</p>

<p>Booty's email also confirms the closure of The Initiative, which, along with the project cancellations, is intended to "reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape". Yep, it's that kind of phrasing again.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/perfect-dark-canceled-the-initiative-closed-sliding.jpg?itok=sDMS2Wbs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/perfect-dark-canceled-the-initiative-closed-sliding.jpg?itok=DuyfHD_e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Perfect Dark</em>, along with its developer The Initiative, is no more.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Windows Central, "everything shown in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">recent Xbox showcase from June</a>" is safe from cancellation, including games like inXile's&nbsp;<em>Clockwork Revolution&nbsp;</em>and Double Fine's&nbsp;<em>Keeper</em>, among others.</p>

<p>However, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696676/microsoft-forza-motorsport-turn-10-studios-layoffs-xbox-cuts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">does appear</a> that&nbsp;<em>Forza Motorsport&nbsp;</em>developer Turn 10 Studios was hit by this sweeping Microsoft layoff wave, with over 70 employees at the studio reportedly being let go.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Turn 10 is responsible for&nbsp;<em>Forza Motorsport</em>, but not for&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon</em>; that honor goes to Playground Games, which is, as far as we know, safe from these layoffs, as is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fable-reboot-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow">next year's&nbsp;<em>Fable&nbsp;</em>reboot</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, these things can change on a dime;&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>got itself a gameplay reveal during last year's summer showcase period, and a little over a year later, the project is no more. Let's hope&nbsp;<em>Fable&nbsp;</em>and other upcoming Xbox games, as well as their developers, can escape further cuts.</p>




<p><em>Perfect Dark</em>'s development appears to have been difficult, to say the least. Back in 2021, Crystal Dynamics joined the project as a co-developer, and the following March, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/report-indicates-perfect-dark-studio-initiative-hemorrhaging-staff" rel="nofollow">it was revealed</a> that The Initiative was hemorrhaging staff, with many blaming slow progress on the game and a lack of creative freedom for their departure.</p>

<p>However, thanks to the gameplay footage released last year, the reboot appeared to be back on track, which makes this decision's timing even more baffling.</p>

<p>Completely unrelatedly, back in April, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q3/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> a 13% jump in Q3 revenue over the same period the previous year, with net income also up by 18%. Dire figures like that really show the necessity of laying off thousands of employees and closing studios, I'm sure you'll agree.</p>

Stevens stated he'd successfully tested the existing guardrails in his own time, but Sainsily said that Unity has "no control" over the asset generation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Maybe the data might show some weird stuff," he said, before prompting the tool to generate an asset based on "Disney Mickey Mouse." Four images of the squeaky-voiced mascot then appeared in the asset library.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked about the incident, a Unity spokesperson stressed that one of the company's goals with its AI betas is to "make sure the right guardrails are in place to help prevent copyright issues, especially before those tools are generally available."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/keita-takahashi-sent-over-a-bunch-of-adorable-to-a-t-storyboard-sketches" target="_self" data-discover="true">Behind the Scenes: Check out Keita Takahashi's adorable To a T storyboard sketches</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Unity AI gives developers access to both our own first-party AI models and third-party tools (used to generate visual assets like 2D images and sprites)," the spokesperson said said, later confirming the feature shown in the stream was from a third-party tool.

"The primary legal risk for developers using AI tools used to generate copyrighted images is that the output may be substantially similar to someone else's protected work," he explained in an email to Game Developer. "Even if the developer didn't intend to infringe, if it looks similar it's likely to draw unwanted attention," such as cease-and-desist letters, takedown notices, or a lawsuit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Legal risk doesn't necessarily stop at the source—it can often flow downstream."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity has done its best to reassure developers developers about the safety of its generative AI tools when it comes to copyright risks.

            <p>Yesterday, as widely expected based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-reportedly-set-for-major-job-cuts-from-next-week">earlier reports</a>, Microsoft began another sweeping round of layoffs - its fourth in just 18 months - this time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">affecting thousands of people across the company</a>. It's believed more than 9,000 employees have lost their jobs as a result of this most recent move, which Microsoft told Eurogamer were "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace."</p>
<p>Since the announcement, additional reports have surfaced painting a clearer picture of the devastation wrought by Microsoft's latest cost cutting measures, as well as the substantial impact on its Xbox division. Beyond the significant human cost of the move - which Xbox boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> insisted was necessary to ensure the "enduring success" of the company in a message to staff yesterday - further details on the specific studios and projects impacted have now begun to emerge.</p>
<p>Rare's fantasy adventure Everwild, first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-announces-everwild-its-next-big-new-ip">announced in 2019</a>, has reportedly been cancelled, for instance, leading to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-and-banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-reportedly-leaving-rare-after-35-years">departure of studio veteran Gregg Mayles</a> after 35 years. Microsoft's troubled Perfect Dark reboot, unveiled in 2020, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">reportedly also ceased production</a> and its first party developer, The Initiative, closed. Microsoft is also said to have terminated its partnership with Crystal Dynamics, which was called in to help on the beleaguered project back in 2022, raising questions around how that team may also have been impacted by yesterday's news.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, an unannounced ZeniMax MMO has reportedly been cancelled, while 200 people are said to have lost their jobs at the Microsoft-owned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a> maker King, and nearly 50 percent of staff at Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10 have reportedly been laid off. The full extent and impact of Microsoft's massive "organisational and workforce changes" are yet to become clear, with Microsoft only providing limited information to press. It has, however, moved swiftly to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-microsoft-gaming-ceo-not-retiring-from-xbox-anytime-soon">deny rumours of Phil Spencer's imminent retirement</a>, insisting the Xbox boss won't be retiring from his position "anytime soon".</p>
<p>With fresh reports continuing to surface around yesterday's bombshell announcement and its impact on Xbox, we've set up this rolling news blog to sift through the confusion, and to collate breaking news and industry reactions as the story continues to evolve.</p><div data-live="true">

      <p>Context for Xbox's most recent wave of layoffs</p>
    <p>A brief bit of extra context for yesterday's layoffs: as noted above, these mark the fourth round of job cuts at Microsoft in just 18 months, making for a total of over 11,500 layoffs in that time. And if you go back a further 12 months, you can unfortunately add an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reportedly-set-to-cut-thousands-of-jobs">additional 10,000 job cuts</a> to that tally.</p>
<p>In January 2024 (a little over three months after it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">formally acquired Activision Blizzard for $69bn</a>), Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">confirmed it had laid off approximately 1,900 people</a> from its video game teams - a decision Xbox boss Phil Spencer called "painful" at the time. That was followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">another 650 job cuts in September</a> (which Spencer insisted would "organise our business for long term success"), and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reportedly-makes-small-number-of-layoffs-across-divisions-including-gaming">"small" number of further layoffs</a> were reported earlier this year. These are said to have impacted employees spanning Microsoft's security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming divisions.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of video game workers have <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">sadly now been laid off in recent years</a>, with everyone from small indies to massive companies including Sony, EA, Epic Games, Riot Games, Warner Bros., and Embracer Group having announced job cuts or closed studios. Last year, The Game Business' Chris Dring, writing for Eurogamer, took a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">some of the reasons behind the devastating layoffs affecting the industry</a>.</p></div>

      <p>Romero Games' new shooter cancelled by Xbox</p>
    <p>Romero Games, the small Irish game development studio set up by John Romero and Brenda Romero, has had its funding pulled by Microsoft, effectively <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-next-shooter-project-loses-funding-following-microsoft-cuts">ending development of an all-new shooter IP it was working on</a>.</p>
<p>Brenda Romero announced the development in a statement on social media, saying there was nothing the studio could do to prevent this. All milestones were reached on time and apparently well received.</p>
<p>Jobs have been lost as a result, with some departing staff reporting that the entire development team has been laid off. </p></div>

<p>We have fuller write-ups of these nearly ready to go, incidentally. I was never quite sure about Warcraft Rumble but it's sad to hear about Romero Games. It also sounds like it's put the small Irish studio in a very difficult position too.</p>

I actually had a dream with Phil Spencer in last night, I assume because I went to sleep thinking about this situation, and in the dream I had to interview him. We got as far as the interview starting and then I don't remember any more, so I have no breaking dream-news for you.
</p>
<p>
But I woke up feeling sad about the whole situation. Sad, obviously, for the people losing their jobs. Sad to see decorated developers like Matt Firor, the head of Elder Scrolls Online (and once the co-creator of Dark Age of Camelot, an MMO that means a lot to me) leaving his role after 18 years, after the cancellation of a new MMO he'd been working on. And sad to read about Gregg Mayles reportedly leaving Rare after 35 years there. It's such a shame. I had thought Rare resurgent in recent years, after the success of Sea of Thieves, and I'd greatly looked forward to Everwild, and now I'm left bewildered and wondering what will become of the studio that's there. I only hope the people losing their roles are being offered generous severance packages with it.
</p>
<p>There was also a feeling of losing belief in Microsoft and Xbox. When Microsoft started buying up studios a few years ago, I watched it all enthused. I was really excited at the prospect of studios like Obsidian Entertainment and inXile finally having the backing of a company with deep pockets and resources. I was excited to see Blizzard wrestled away from Kotick, and curious about where Microsoft would take Bethesda. I thought it was a good thing. But of late it's seemed to be more precarious being a part of Xbox than not.</p></div>

		<p>Something strange is brewing at Blake Manor. Set in 1897 Ireland at a remote hotel, you arrive to investigate the disappearance of Evelyn Deane, but there’s the occult and strange mysteries to unpeel before the truth can be discovered, and there’s just 48 hours to go before a ritual will bring everything to a head in The Séance of Blake Manor.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Séance of Blake Manor | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKI7DVrhWL8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Spooky Doorway cut their teeth on the detective mystery genre with the Darkside Detective series, but Blake Manor pushes things in a rather different direction. This is a sprawling mystery with dozens of potential suspects to rule out, a ticking clock that determines the flow and nature of your investigation, and obviously plenty of potentially supernatural goings on, steeped in distinctly Irish mythology.</p>


<p>The opening of the game, though, is much more guided and direct. The deep Irish voice of Declan Ward lulls you into the dour, sombre tone of this investigation, as he takes train and carriage to the manor’s gate. Trudging through the gardens at the front of the manor, the setting and thunderstorm is immediately evocative of this kind of detective story. It doesn’t help that a shadowy figure stood by the fountain suddenly bursts into a flurry of crows flapping away, leaving a shawl behind which humorously suggests it was actually seven crows in a trench coat and not a hunched-over old lady.</p>
<p>The lobby of the manor hotel is empty, save for traditional jack-o-lanterns carved out of oversized turnips –&nbsp;Halloween originated in Ireland, after all. but ringing a bell brings the sour-faced concierge to the table, whose appearance immediately raises questions. How did his glasses come to bear a large crack in one of the lenses? Why is he so tense and preoccupied with the time?</p>


<p>You can question him directly over Evelyn Deane’s disappearance, and follow up on the visual clues found by a bit of traditional point &amp; click screen scouring, but he’s evasive and preoccupied at best. Something about needing to deal with telegrams by hand…</p>
<p>As he retreats to his office, you can start poking around, but the deeper you investigate, the more time passes. There’s no ticking clock mapped to real time, but rather time will advance whenever Ward interacts with objects and characters in the game. It’s an interesting choice that might force you to be more judicious than is typical for games, where players often have a tendency to interact with anything and everything possible. Still, there’s immediately some curious clues to uncover. Poking around in the side rooms for luggage and coats, you can see something hidden behind an air vent, or overhear the concierge muttering about a busted window. There’s also the log book that you can snoop through to see if Miss Deane truly had checked herself out of the manor and left –&nbsp;unsurprisingly, this does not seem to be the case.</p>
<p>The trick is figuring out how to fix the telegram machine, to bring the concierge out of his office and let you snoop within there, and that means constructing a battery from an assortment of electrical discs. A simple starter puzzle, but a nice one to make you feel ever-so-slightly smart.</p>
<p>Much smarter, of course, than when I just bungled into the office and got told to leave. Then I had the bright idea of going out and climbing through the window… except the concierge was still there, banning me from the hotel grounds and getting a dismal game over screen.</p>
<p>Not my finest moment, but quite hilarious. I got it right the second time round.</p>

<p>It was when heading to bed that the real spookiness started, a thoroughly demonic dream sequence befitting of the Overlook Hotel or Twin Peaks. It’s all brooding, dark and bathed in red light as you walk down fish-eyed hallways, and still absolutely in keeping with the graphic novel inspired art style through the rest of the game. The setting is rendered in 3D, but characters are all represented with eight-direction character art, while comic book cutaway panels give a distinctive tone.</p>
<p>It’s only after waking from a frightful night that the game starts to loosen its reigns on your investigation. Stepping out of the room the next day, after a loud noise startled the assorted guests, you’re greeted by all manner of potential suspects, coming from all manner of background and superstitions, and all with their own secrets to hide.</p>

<p>With so many names and faces thrown at you, having a physical pen and paper will no doubt be key to keeping track of everything, but the game does have built in tools within the Mystery Map. This neatly organises all the key clues and narrative threads that you’ve uncovered so far, joining them up for you in a colour-coded web that makes them easier to digest. At various points, you’ll have to make a deduction, filling in the blanks from a particular phrase using the clues and evidence you’ve gathered.</p>
<p>Alongside this, you also have a timetable that lets you track the known locations of all the staff and guests, automatically populated from things like a staff rota and messages you’ve managed to find between people. If you need to find a particular person at a specific time, this will absolutely help, and Spooky Door is building in a feature to let you rewind and retry portions of the game if you run out of time before the séance itself.</p>

<p>All too soon, our time with the game came to an end, just as it would broaden out to reveal the full scope of the mysteries. Having such a broad cast of characters to investigate, it will be fascinating to see how this gels with the game’s time limit. Certainly, there’s an implication from my brief game over that you need to not only save Miss Deane, but also save people from attending the séance. This is absolutely one to watch for fans of mysteries and puzzles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Chronicles of the Wolf Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157116/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/chronicles_of_the_wolf">Chronicles of the Wolf</a> is a tough game to review. A decade or so ago, 2D Metroidvanias were rarer, but they now represent one of gaming’s most enduring and best-developed genres.</p>
<p>But how do I assess a production like this that purposefully ignores many of the design changes that made the genre more accessible? This meaty retro-inspired game will leave a lot of players battered and bruised, ready to give up and swan off to the nearest tavern in its rural 18th-century French setting.</p>
<p>First, an essential statement: Chronicles absolutely nails its aims. It seems to want to be <em>the</em> definitive old-school <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/castlevania">Castlevania</a>. It channels and improves on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/castlevania_ii_simons_quest">Castlevania II: Simon’s Quest</a> from the NES, but with a design aesthetic that lands somewhere between the SNES and PS1 eras.</p>
<p>As you head off on your adventures, you’ll explore towns, fight enemies and bosses, interact with villagers, interpret clues. But Simon’s Quest’s divisive characteristics — hints that lead nowhere, obscure and hard-to-interpret instructions — have only been toned down, not entirely removed. Chronicles of the Wolf is an improvement on the design, not an apology.</p>
<figure><a title="Chronicles of the Wolf Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157117/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game’s second section, which takes up the majority of the 20-hour runtime, is a dead ringer for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/castlevania_symphony_of_the_night">Symphony of the Night</a>’s castle location. That’s if you make it that far; the Castlevania tradition of hoodwinking and misdirection is alive and well here, manifesting in five possible endings and — I was less happy about this — multiple locations that lead to cheap, surprise deaths.</p>
<p>Forgetting nefarious tricks for a moment, Chronicles of the Wolf confidently forges its own mythology, separate from vampires, which allows it to stand on its own two feet.</p>
<p>You take on the role of Mateo Lombardo, an apprentice of the Rose Cross Order trying to rid the French countryside of the mysterious Beast of Gévaudan – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beast_of_G%C3%A9vaudan">a true-life creature</a> that terrorised rural communities in the 1700s, which in this iteration appears very much to be a werewolf.</p>
<p>The developer — Migami Games (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/wallachia_reign_of_dracula">Wallachia: Reign Of Dracula</a>), responsible for the two highly rated <strong>Castlevania: Lecarde Chronicles</strong> fan games — understands what makes Castlevania tick, but it just so happens that Konami’s series often asks a lot of its players, which, here, is the source of my general hesitation about <em>who</em> I can recommend the game to.</p>
<figure><a title="Chronicles of the Wolf Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157115/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I love Metroidvanias. I’ve played more than my fair share. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> are two of my favourite games over the last decade, but these two examples seem pretty mainstream in comparison to Chronicles of the Wolf. Anyone who lacked the patience for either example need not make this visit to France. And if you <em>did</em>, then it still might not be for you.</p>
<p>It's not that Chronicles is hard – it’s not. Its combat is well-balanced, fun, and just challenging enough. But making progress can sometimes feel like a chore. Just as Mateo Lombardo moves through the game screens with Castlevania’s almost characteristic lack of pace, the game’s design demands genuine patience. For the right player, this will transport them back to the '90s – Chronicles of the Wolf feels refreshingly retro. For others, they’ll want to play something else.</p>
<p>Initially I enjoyed Chronicle’s specific flavour of exploring and backtracking. I was happy scrutinising the map for areas that I might be able to reach with one of the huge number of new abilities I was collecting along the way – the double jump, the air dash, feather boots that let me ride air currents.</p>
<figure><a title="Chronicles of the Wolf Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157118/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But given the vastness of some of the areas, and the smattering of fast-travel options, it feels inevitable that some players will miss a crucial hint or overlook a tucked-away item needed to progress. I feel as if these bottlenecks are more frequent here than most modern games would allow.</p>
<p>Your patience level for dealing with this kind of thing will define whether the game is for you or not. Personally, mine was tested multiple times, and by the halfway point, with so much of the game to go, my sense of having fun began to falter a bit. It’s a shame because smashing through skeletons, monsters, and acolytes with my ever-growing arsenal of weapons and attacks was genuinely fun, as was the platforming and the worldbuilding.</p>
<p>The game’s Castlevania-inspired (and therefore excellent) soundtrack did its best to keep my spirits up, and mostly succeeded. The bosses were enjoyable without ever causing me too many issues — as long as I stocked up on plenty of potions — and even ultimately minor technical issues (a bit of slowdown at two points in the game and a flashing black screen when I changed items in the menu, which seems to be a problem on other systems too) won't taint my final score below. In a way, they added to the retro charm.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Chronicles of the Wolf is a confident, old-school Metroidvania that asks a lot of its players. Its DNA is from another gaming era, and simply being a fan of the genre won’t guarantee you’ll enjoy it. If modern quality-of-life features like marking your map or being gently nudged forward are preferable, there are better options elsewhere.</p>
<p>But if you’ve got the patience to revisit a time when games were slower and more cryptic, and the pacing was a little more intense, Chronicles of the Wolf is like a rich, dark relic that you’ll treasure. For every player put off by its demands, another will embrace it as a worthy challenge.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-punches-well-above-its-weight-with-nvidia-dlss-in-street-fighter-6-surpassing-the-xbox-series-s-in-certain-scenarios.1234929/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Proper usage of the NVIDIA DLSS upscaler can make the Nintendo Switch 2 punch well above its weight in terms of image quality and even surpass the Xbox Series S, as highlighted by the excellent work CAPCOM has done with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/">Street Fighter 6</a> port.</p>



<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> recently took a good look at the port of the latest entry in the series which debuted on PC and consoles two years back, highlighting how NVIDIA DLSS does a great job upscaling the image to 1080p in docked mode from the low base resolution of 540p. Though there are some issues like visible aliasing and flicker when characters reveal the background, the end results are considered better in terms of sharpness and image stability than those produced by CAPCOM's in-house upscaler used in the Xbox Series S version, which renders at native 1080 but doesn't handle image noise well. The Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game also beats the Xbox Series S release in terms of texture quality, despite the minor 1 GB differences in available RAM in favor of the Nintendo system. In other cases, however, the Nintendo Switch 2 version is closer to the PlayStation 4 release with no screen space reflections in Fighting Ground matches, missing depth of field, background NPC counts restricted to the standard setting, and non-interactive physics-based particles. In handheld mode, with a lower 360p base resolution upscaled to 720p and additional graphics cutbacks to keep the 60 FPS target, the game is even closer to the PlayStation 4 version, which is still rather impressive, for a handheld.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Though obviously more powerful than its predecessor, the Nintendo Switch 2 is proving with some of its launch titles and upgrades to original Switch games what it is capable of achieving. The Splatoon 3 upgrade is particularly impressive, as it <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-increases-resolution-six-times-splatoon-3/">increases resolution by five to six times</a> in certain scenarios while keeping the framerate to a steady 60 FPS, making playing the third entry in the series on the system the way to go to enjoy it at its very best.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now available worldwide. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> reboot looked like an excellent addition to the immersive sim genre. Based on Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">previous shuttering of Arkane Austin</a>, I can only assume that this made Phil Spencer very angry. "Why can I lift massive crates but only fit one rifle in my inventory!", roared Spencer. Subsequently, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">both the reboot and studio The Initiative were axed this week by Microsoft</a> as part of their ongoing efforts to ensure their legacy going forward is one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">destroying livelihoods</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">participating in</a> what a UN rapporteur<a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session59/advance-version/a-hrc-59-23-aev.pdf"> describes as</a> an “economy of genocide”, and forcing Copilot inside that little plastic bit at the end of your shoelaces.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's a few great immersive sims from the Steam Summer Sale to soothe the bastard wound of Perfect Dark's cancellation.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oops-battlefield-6-features-revealed-by-leaked-battlefield-labs-footage">leaks</a> have earned it a bit of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deadlock-valves-new-multiplayer-shooter-now-has-a-barebones-steam-page">Deadlock-style buzz</a>, but it seems things haven't been going well behind-the-scenes. A new report from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/behind-the-next-battlefield-game-culture-clash-crunch-and-colossal-stakes/">Ars Technica</a> based on conversations with current and former developers details a budget that's beyond big, a campaign that's running "massively late" following a studio closure, and an unrealistic-sounding executive goal of attracting 100 million players.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to the report, the game codenamed Glacier is costing EA "well north" of $400 million, with that number being way more than any entry in series has previously commanded. The execs have their eyes set on competing with Call of Duty and Fortnite, so they've put plans in place for a single-player campaign alongside a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-rumoured-to-get-a-battle-royale-mode-as-leaker-finds-footage-of-an-exploding-dam">free-to-play battle royale element</a>, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-over-a-week-on-from-the-last-one-theres-a-fresh-battlefield-6-leak-here-that-shows-the-return-of-rush">classic multiplayer modes such as Rush</a> and "a community content mode" dubbed Portal all chucked into the big FPS stew.</p>
<p>That scale has reportedly also led the suits to slap Battlefield 6 with equally huge goals: "100 million players over a set period of time that included post-launch", according to one source. "Obviously, Battlefield has never achieved those numbers before," an EA employee told Ars, with another adding that "over about that same period, [Battlefield] 2042 has only gotten 22 million." <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a>, believed to be the series' peak, has apparently attracted "maybe 30 million plus" in total, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-looking-to-bring-battlefield-premium-type-service-to-more-properties">shifting about 15 million copies</a> between its October 2011 launch and June 2012.</p>
<p>It'll probably not surprise you to learn, then, that "very few people" actually working on the game reportedly believe the 100 million figure is achievable, with much resting on there being "such an appetite out there for shooters of this kind that we will just naturally be able to get the audience that we need".</p>
<p>The rest of the report details the game's single-player element as running "massively late" following EA's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shuts-down-ridgeline-games">February 2024 closure of Ridgeline Games</a>, something that could lead to a massive day one patch, delayed features and/or devs being pushed extra hard to fit everything in before deadline.</p>
<p>There's also reportedly tension between staff at long-time Battlefield developers DICE in Sweden and the newer US-based leadership team EA drafted in for the series, and Ars have heard "several first-hand accounts of people working on Glacier who had to take stress or mental or exhaustion health leave, ranging from a couple of weeks to several months".</p>
<p>All in all, it doesn't sound like a game that'll be fun to get over the line. We're wishing the best to the devs on the ground working on it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late]]></content:encoded>

The news has caused Ready or Not's Steam user review rating to hit "mostly negative" for recent reviews, although overall the review rating remains "very positive." Most of the negative reviews complain about "censorship." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in a new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1144200" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>statement</u></a>, VOID set out "full visibility" into what has, and has not, changed, including before-and-after screenshots. It insisted "the effects of gore and violence have not been toned down."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We recently shared that Ready or Not’s PC version underwent minor content changes to support stability and align with policies enforced by global platforms and age rating bodies," the statement began. "These adjustments were made to ensure a smooth global launch across platforms — while fully preserving the game’s tone, themes, and intensity. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Unfortunately, we’ve seen misconceptions and misinformation circulating around the scope of these changes. We want to ensure our entire community has full visibility into what has — and has not — changed. We’re including before-and-after visuals to show that the game’s tone, atmosphere, and graphical impact remain intact. The effects of gore and violence — key to the game’s immersive realism — have not been toned down."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">VOID stressed that missions such as Elephant, Neon Tomb, and the infamous Valley of the Dolls "remain unchanged," adding it has "always believed in creative freedom and the right to build experiences that push boundaries in the service of immersion and realism. That will not change."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At the same time, we operate in a global ecosystem of platform standards, age rating boards, and local legal restrictions," the studio added. "While we may disagree with how some content is treated, we’ve only made changes where absolutely required, and only to the letter of the regulations — no further. As a hyper-realistic tactical FPS, Ready or Not faces different scrutiny than more stylized or fictional games. That’s a reality of the world we publish in — not a change in our creative vision or values."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Potentially distrubing images of Ready or Not follow:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team then outlined specifically what the "six targeted visual changes" entailed: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Twisted Nerve: The girl is now depicted as sleeping instead of convulsing  </li><li>A Lethal Obsession: Nudity involving the ghillie suit suspect has been adjusted </li><li>Hide and Seek: Female hostages now wear underwear </li><li>Narcos: Police informant hostage now wears underwear </li><li>23 Megabytes a Second: ‘Photo of Minors’ objective model was revised, also to better connect narratively with the later ‘Sinuous Trail’ mission</li><li>Post-mortem dismemberment has been disabled (note: dismemberment for living characters remains unchanged).</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ready or Not Before-and-After Screenshots July 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's not about the specifics, it's a matter of principle," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1144200/eventcomments/596279376609306968?snr=2_9_100000_#c596279376609307117" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a> one respondent in the comments.

<p>Where Winds Meet is an open-world action-RPG set during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period of Chinese history. Its combat and aesthetics are inspired by classic Wuxia fantasy, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-winds-meet-brings-wuxia-to-the-west">developers aiming to bring the genre to the west</a>.</p>
<p>A final beta test for the game will take place later this month, on 25th July for players on PC (via Steam) and PS5 across the globe. <a href="https://research.easebar.com/htmls/007fb7/paper.html">Registration for access</a> is now open.</p>
<p>The test will include regions from previous tests, as well as the urban region of Kaifeng (pictured above).</p>
<p>The success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">Black Myth: Wukong has surely impacted the Chinese games industry</a>, as development has shifted towards console game releases in recent years.

<p>As a reminder, Nintendo of Canada is also changing the price of the Switch, Switch Lite, Switch OLED, digital and physical games, accessories, and amiibo.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-bet-on-the-wrong-horse-with-subscriptions-says-analyst-following-latest-round-of-layoffs.1234881/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The main takeaway from the latest round of Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">layoffs</a> may well be that Xbox is losing its multi-year battle to dominate the gaming industry with Game Pass.</p>



<p>It was in October 2017's earnings call with investors that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-game-pass-netflix-games/">told</a> the world that the company sought to replicate Netflix's success with a similar subscription service for gaming. Game Pass had launched a few months earlier, but Sadella's statement made it crystal clear that the company would go all-in with that plan.</p>



<p>To lure more users to Game Pass, Microsoft spent a lot of money acquiring new Xbox studios starting in 2018: Ninja Theory, Compulsion Games, Playground Games, Undead Labs, inXile Entertainment, Obsidian Entertainment, and, in 2019, Double Fine. All their games would launch day one on Game Pass, making it a very enticing proposition for consumers. </p>



<p>Over time, though, the Xbox division realized that this wouldn't be enough to convince dozens of millions of users to subscribe. To make a real impact, Microsoft decided to open its wallet and spend $76.2 billion in the consecutive record-breaking acquisitions of Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media and Activision Blizzard, two of the biggest publishers in the industry. That gave them access to intellectual properties like Elder Scrolls, Fallout, DOOM, Call of Duty, Warcraft, Starcraft, and many more.</p>



<p>However, it quickly became clear that such franchises could not be confined to a single console platform, never mind a flailing one such as the Xbox. They would lose a lot of money by not putting those games on PlayStation and even Nintendo consoles. This led to the multi-platform strategy that a lot of fans have complained about lately.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Game Pass growth <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-falls-fall-short-of-microsoft-growth-targets-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stagnated</a> well below Microsoft's lofty ambitions. Despite the overtures of Xbox executives, the subscription service still isn't allowed on Sony or Nintendo platforms, and its growth on Xbox consoles has reached the point of full saturation. PC Game Pass is growing, but it's not enough to get where Microsoft wanted, and cloud gaming hasn't taken off nearly as much as originally believed.</p>



<p>To delve deeper into the causes of this failed bid from one of the tech industry leaders, we reached out to our good friend Rhys Elliott (Head of Market Analysis at <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/">Alinea</a>), who shared with us some thoughts, chiefly that subscriptions just aren't a good fit for gaming.</p>



<p><em>Like many industries, gaming overextended itself following the black swan event that was the COVID-19 pandemic. During those difficult times, everybody was at home, interest rates were low, and engagement with – and spending on – games skyrocketed. The growth-at-all costs mindset became dangerous. Many companies thought that double-digit growth would continue, greenlighting risky projects and strategies and going on M&amp;A sprees. But the market is very different now, and many moves ultimately did not pan out. The games market has reached its maturity phase. Now, inflation rates are high, money is considerably more expensive to borrow (for consumers and companies alike), there is a cost-of-living crisis, and publishers have been forced to lay off employees and adapt to this new normal. But with Xbox, there is more at play.</em></p>



<p><em>The Xbox One was the beginning of those troubles, and Xbox has been in a constant state of recovery ever since. The Game Pass strategy was Xbox’s main remedy, but the games never arrived with the impact needed. Xbox bet on the wrong horse with subscriptions. Many proclaimed that subscriptions would become the de-facto way consumers access game content, just like Spotify, Netflix, and the like are ruling distribution in music and video. Despite companies’ best efforts, subscriptions will not be the main method of game distribution. For now, consumers – and the market – have spoken.</em></p>



<p><em>The reasoning is clear: the attention economy is already oversaturated, and consuming game content is more demanding than other mediums. A consumer can:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Listen to hundreds of tracks on Spotify each month</em></li>



<li><em>Watch dozens of movies / TV episodes</em></li>



<li><em>But the majority only has time to play a few games maximum – and that extends to even highly engaged players</em></li>
</ul>



<p><em>This is just the tip of the iceberg about why multi-game subscriptions are only worth it for the most dedicated players:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Most gamers are already served by the free-play markets</em></li>



<li><em>Others are happy to buy a few premium games a year</em></li>



<li><em>Xbox was also following that trend on console despite a recent boost from adding Call of Duty to Game Pass, the service's new baseline</em></li>



<li><em>Subscriptions with day-one launch games are good for consumers, but they cannibalise game sales on Xbox’s core platform. And stagnating growth in that strategy has led Xbox to shift its strategy towards becoming a third-party publisher.</em></li>



<li><em>Another wrinkle is that Microsoft’s acquisitions of Bethesda and Activision Blizzard were meant to reshape its gaming business. And they have – just not in the way many imagined. Xbox is now a giant publisher, with a back catalogue that includes Call of Duty, Minecraft, Elder Scrolls, Fallout and many more. But the division is in flux, caught between its historic role as a console platform and a future that is increasingly platform-agnostic – third party. Whether this results in a more successful Xbox, or simply a more diluted one, remains to be seen. But I am not optimistic, truthfully. The Xbox of old is fading, and it’s sadly come with casualties. Too many casualties.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>There's little doubt that Game Pass has so far failed to be as relevant as Microsoft had hoped. There are just too many games on the market, and more and more of those games are continuing to get content for years after launch, stealing attention away from the new titles. There just isn't enough time to play all this content. Quality, not quantity, will win and get away with increasing premium prices. But let's face it, Microsoft never really managed to shine with quality games.</p>



<p>That is not to say Xbox is dead, but as others have noted, Xbox as we knew it is certainly dead, and its Game Pass push hasn't gone well enough to meet estimates. Furthermore, it was Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer who <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-championed-game-pass-even-against-his-own-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">championed</a> Game Pass at all costs, even against internal concerns. However, despite rumors to the contrary, it doesn't appear that he'll be <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-retire-following-next-gen-xbox-launch/">retiring</a> from his position any time soon.</p>

        <p>All three receive suspended sentences</p>

            <p>Three former higher-ups at Ubisoft have been found guilty of sexually and psychologically harassing the women who worked for them at the company's Paris studio. A French court handed out suspended sentences to the three executives, as well as fines, the highest of which was €45,000. It's the final ruling in a sordid trial that has seen the men accused of forcefully trying to kiss female employees, ordering them to do handstands in skirts, and angrily throwing equipment across the office. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Former editorial vice-president Thomas François was found guilty of sexual harassment, psychological harassment and an attempted sexual assault, as reported in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/02/three-ubisoft-video-game-chiefs-guilty-enabling-culture-sexual-harassment">The Guardian</a>. The court handed him a three-year suspended prison sentence, and a €30,000 fine for the crimes. </p>
<p>François was accused of tying a woman to an office chair with a roll of tape and pushing her into an elevator. Another woman told the court how she was forced to do handstands when she came to work in a miniskirt. </p>
<p>"He was my superior and I was afraid of him," she said. "He made me do handstands. I did it to get it over with and get rid of him."</p>
<p>At a themed Christmas party in 2015, François said he liked a female co-worker's 1950s style dress, then allegedly tried to kiss her on the mouth as his colleagues restrained her. During the trial, François put much of his behaviour down to a "culture of joking around". Another Ubisoft staff member put it differently, calling the culture at the studio a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-boys-club-above-the-law-former-ubisoft-execs-in-court-for-alleged-sexual-harassment-and-abuse">"boys' club above the law"</a>.</p>
<p>At the same trial, Serge Hascoët, former chief creative officer at Ubisoft was found guilty of  psychological harassment and complicity in sexual harassment, although he was ultimately acquitted of the charge of sexual harassment itself. He got an 18-month suspended prison sentence and a €45,000 fine. </p>
<p>The court heard that Hascoët's alleged bullying behaviour includes ordering assistants to do personal tasks unrelated to their jobs, such as going to his house to collect parcel deliveries. The court heard how he once blew his nose into a tissue and handed it to a young woman working for the studio. "You can resell it," he allegedly told her, "it’s worth gold at Ubisoft." Hascoët's lawyer said that the former Ubisoft chief is considering an appeal. </p>
<p>Meanwhile Guillaume Patrux, a former game director, was found guilty of psychological harassment. He got a 12-month suspended sentence, alongside a fine of €10,000. Patrux was accused of a variety of harassing behaviour which includes drawing swastikas on a woman's notebook during a meeting, throwing office equipment around, cracking a whip near colleagues faces, and holding a cigarette lighter so close to a male employee's face that his beard caught alight. All three men had denied the charges.</p>
<p>The trial's verdict brings some level of justice to those women, although many complaints which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-vow-to-investigate-allegations-of-sexual-harrassment-and-abuse">surfaced back in 2020</a> have not necessarily been addressed. Back then Ubisoft responded to an outpouring of allegations that overwhelmed the company, saying that they would investigate those stories. When these and other allegations came up throughout Ubisoft's worldwide studios, some workers reported that HR had been informed, yet nothing ever happened. In the end it took the force of France's policing and legal system to do anything about it, following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-ubisoft-executives-taken-into-custody-over-sexual-abuse-claims-according-to-reports">the arrests in 2023</a> of the above accused and two other workers. We've asked Ubisoft for their comment on the verdict.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/three-former-ubisoft-execs-found-guilty-of-sexual-and-psychological-harassment]]></content:encoded>
