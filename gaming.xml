		<p>Sony has confirmed the monthly games coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> in September 2024, with three titles that all subscribers will get a hold of from next week that include wizardly sports, American sports, and small person horrors.</p>
<p>Let’s see what they are!</p>


<h2>What are the PS Plus September 2024 games?</h2>
<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, 3rd September</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quidditch Champions</strong></li>
<li><strong>MLB The Show 24</strong></li>
<li><strong>Little Nightmares II</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You know what you’re getting with MLB The Show, which is the most accurate and visually impressive game of baseball out there. Developed by San Diego Studio, this is a homegrown first party title, even if it’s no longer a PlayStation exclusive. So, as we come to the end of the MLB season, why not throw it onto PS Plus to gather as many interested players as possible?</p>
<p><iframe title="Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions – Official Trailer – 'Magic is in the Air'" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7b6P60X9xB0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What’s a bit less known is what Quidditch Champions will really be like, as the game will join PS Plus on day one. A video game version of the wizarding sport from Harry Potter, the rules to this game have always been a bit of a joke for how massively overpowered catching the Golden Snitch is to winning a match. Still, you’ll be able to customise your character and play as a Chaser, Seeker, Beater and Keeper, and there will be both some broomstick adventures and competitive multiplayer.</p>


<p>And finally, with Little Nightmares III around the corner, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/09/little-nightmares-2-review/">Little Nightmares II</a> is now a monthly game for PS Plus. Looking back on our review, Tuff said, “It’s rather obvious, but if you enjoyed the first Little Nightmares then you will enjoy the Little Nightmares II. While some new elements have been added it is more of a next chapter to the story than a full blown sequel. The attention detail is incredible, bringing the story to life without a single spoken word. It’s unsettling, creepy, darkly amusing, and at times a little frustrating, but immensely enjoyable. Another little, slime covered gem from Tarsier Studios.”</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the August 2024 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab August’s titles up until the new set of game’s arrives on 3rd September, so make sure to grab a pretty great Lego game while you can!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga (PS4/PS5)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Five Nights at Freddy’s Security Breach (PS4/PS5)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights (PS4)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The director behind Marathon at Bungie was fired this year due to inappropriate conduct. According to Bloomberg, Chris Barrett was fired from Bungie in the spring after being accused by “several female employees of inappropriate behavior”.</p>



<p>Per the report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNDg2NDU0OCwiZXhwIjoxNzI1NDY5MzQ4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTSVhUWktEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.lJDK2mJTGM2v8mjO2siujiOigS68jyckaTagfGlXp_A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jason Schreier</a>, “at least” eight female employees came forward against Barrett to the company. From their an investigation took place. That investigation discovered that Barrett would call lower-level employees attractive while also asking them to play truth-or-dare. On top of that, Barrett reported flaunted his “wealth and power” within the company while hinting that he could help people advance their careers.</p>

<p>Messages that were sent to Schreier showed requests to hang out with the women involved as well as texts that were “flirtatious”. It was also said that Barrett’s interactions with the women had “similar patterns”.</p>



<p>“Barrett would befriend women at the studio in various departments and then send them a barrage of text messages that blurred the lines between professional and personal,” Schreier wrote.</p>



<p>In a statement given to Bloomberg, Barrett apologized for making people feel uncomfortable while adding that was never his intention.</p>



<p>“I feel that I have always conducted myself with integrity and been respectful and supportive of my colleagues, many of whom I consider my closest friends,”  he said. “I never understood my communications to be unwanted and I would have never thought they could possibly have made anyone feel uncomfortable. If anyone ever felt that way about their interaction with me, I am truly sorry.”</p>



<p>Schreier says that Sony, Bungie’s parent company, wouldn’t comment on the case. However, he was given a standard response from a spokesperson saying that the company takes all complaints of misconduct seriously.</p>



<p>Employees at Bungie weren’t told that Barrett was fired or why he was no longer with the company.</p>

			<p>Call of Duty: NEXT Showcase is officially underway, and there, people will get to experience reveals of features from the upcoming shooter Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-open-beta-pc-requirements-revealed/">Early Access period</a> for the game isn't far away either, officially opening up to players in two days. Below is the official CODNEXT Showcase, which gives excited fans glimpses into the Black Ops 6 Multiplayer, Zombies, Warzone, and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="#CODNext Showcase | Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Multiplayer, Zombies, Warzone &amp; more" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/brzOBsdEAf8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>By tuning into the showcase, those who are already active COD players will be given rewards for their dedication to the live stream, with the rewards scaling as you dedicate more time to watching the live stream. At CODNext, Treyarch and Raven have teamed up with content creators who cover the franchise and has given them access to the game to experience and showcase the Black Ops 6 Multiplayer and give commentary while they play through it.</p>
<p>If you're watching along at home, you can get the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-next-event-code-bowl-v-black-ops-6-beta-intel#NEXT-Rewards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following rewards</a> for tuning in. Here are the rewards you can get:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 minutes: "Mine" emblem</li>
<li>60 minutes: "Earning Stripes" Calling Card</li>
<li>90 minutes: "Tri Harder" Charm</li>
<li>120 minutes: "The Redactor" Weapon Blueprint</li>
</ul>
<p>Excited fans will also get to hear the developers talk about their journey creating Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and some of the most crucial features being added to the upcoming game, such as Omnimovement. They will also discuss the multiplayer maps that have been added to the game and the choices behind the ones they added, with a deep dive into the map design. Taking feedback from players across previous Call of Duty games, the developers sat down and spoke about how they wanted to add in those gunfight scenarios from the Cold War and wanted players to experience plenty of "controlled chaos."</p>
<p>For those who prefer to avoid traditional multiplayer, there are also many discussions about the Zombies aspect of Black Ops 6, a well-loved feature that has appeared in many previous Call of Duty games, and how they looked at prior iterations of the game mode and what made it so special, while also looking to the future to see how they can provide a modern twist on the game mode.</p>
<p>So far, from what is currently being showcased at the CODNEXT Showcase, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is shaping up to be a very smooth experience, with fast-paced combat with new weaponry and even more flair in executions with the usage of omnimovement. By adding omnimovement back into the game, it allows for an even quicker battle, as you can run, jump and slide anywhere you like to gain an advantage over your opponent.</p>

<p>CODNext officially premiered today (August 28, 2024), showcasing Black Ops 6 and its multiplayer mode. With the new omni movement, Call of Duty is preparing to change how the game is played completely. </p>



<p>The new omni movement was not the only feature shown at CODNext, though. The event introduced many new maps, some classic ones, how players can get the beta and more.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-codnext-displays-new-omni-movement-feature-for-black-ops-6">CODNext Displays New Omni Movement Feature For Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>One of the biggest features that is new with Black Ops 6 is the omni movement. Since the game first announced the feature, gamers have been anticipating getting a chance to try the new movement out, finally.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>So, what is omni movement? The new feature allows players to slide and jump in all directions. No more jumping just up or forward and only being able to slide forward. Players can slide backward and sideways and even jump out of the water in a diving motion.</p>



<p>There will be an omni movement practice course released with the game and will even be available in the beta.</p>



<p>How does a player get access to the beta, though?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-access-to-black-ops-6-beta">How To Get Access To Black Ops 6 Beta</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6’s beta officially drops on <strong>August 30, 2024</strong>. While some of the biggest creators that got to attend CODNext got to test the game out already, other gamers will be able to join in on the action in just a few days.</p>



<p>Those who have pre-ordered the game will get instant access to the beta. Those who also have Game Pass will get access to the beta. So, be sure to purchase one of the two now, and get your beta pre-downloaded.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-many-maps-will-be-in-multiplayer">How Many Maps Will Be In Multiplayer?</h2>



<p>As of now, there will be 16 maps in multiplayer. However, there will be new (and classic) maps introduced with every new season.</p>



<h4 id="h-all-maps-in-black-ops-6">All Maps In Black Ops 6:</h4>



<ul>
<li>Protocol</li>



<li>Payback</li>



<li>Skyline</li>



<li>Lowtown</li>



<li>Subsonic</li>



<li>Rewind</li>



<li>Scud</li>



<li>Redcard</li>



<li>Babylon</li>



<li>Derelict</li>



<li>Vorkuta</li>



<li>Vault</li>



<li>Sandhouse</li>



<li>Stakeout</li>



<li>Gala</li>



<li>Pit</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p>The beta, however, will only include eight of these maps.</p>



<h4 id="h-all-maps-in-black-ops-6-beta">All Maps In Black Ops 6 Beta:</h4>



<ul>
<li>Skyline</li>



<li>Rewind</li>



<li>Scud</li>



<li>Babylon</li>



<li>Derelict</li>



<li>Stakeout</li>



<li>Gala</li>



<li>Pit</li>
</ul>



<p>Additional maps to be added later this year and next will re-introduce some favorites from the Black Ops universe.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-mode-added">New Mode Added</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 will also introduce a brand new game mode called Kill Order. The game mode was described as a combination of Slayer and Objective Mode. </p>



<p>Every team in Kill Order will have a High-Value Target (HVT) that they must protect while simultaneously trying to destroy their opposing team’s. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>While points still count per kill from each player, you will get more points by destroying your opponent’s HVT or if your HVT gets a kill.</p>



<p>There were also some additional changes to other modes. Domination will bring back objectives and Hardpoint is adding numbers to Object Icons to help make callouts much easier for players.</p>



<p>Overall, it seems like Black Ops 6 is going in the right direction in hopes of putting the Call of Duty multiplayer scene back at the top.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.argonautgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Argonaut Games</a> has returned and with it comes a remaster of Croc Legend of the Gobbos. </p>



<p>Releasing later this year for PC and console, the game is a complete remaster of the 1997 platformer that was originally available on PC, PlayStation 1, and SEGA Saturn.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>“We wanted to honor the original game’s legacy while introducing it to a new audience,” said Mike Arkin, Argonaut Games Co-CEO, va release. “The HD remaster allows us to do just that. It’s been a labor of love for our team, and we can’t wait to share it with players on all the current consoles and PC later this year.”</p>



<p>Founder Jez San added, “I’m thrilled to see the Argonaut name back after twenty years away. Argonaut was always about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in gaming, and I’m excited to see how the relaunched Argonaut Games builds on that legacy.”</p>



<p>The Croc Legends of the Gobbos Remaster will feature new HD graphics, updated modern controls, and a “nostalgic, fun, and authentic gameplay experience.” The remaster will also include a “Crocipedia” which Argonaut calls an “extensive and meticulously curated digital museum containing long-lost development assets such as game design documents, concept art, animation tests, team member interviews, and much more.”</p>



<p>An official release date will be announced in at a later time.</p>

<!-- cache hit 50:single/related:3aa6196d0f834ce92a8ca73c02f2f563 --><!-- empty -->
<p>On Tuesday, researchers from Google and Tel Aviv University unveiled <a href="https://gamengen.github.io/">GameNGen</a>, a new AI model that can interactively simulate the classic 1993 first-person shooter game <em>Doom</em> in real time using AI image generation techniques borrowed from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-stable-diffusion-you-may-never-believe-what-you-see-online-again/">Stable Diffusion</a>. It's a neural network system that can function as a limited game engine, potentially opening new possibilities for real-time video game synthesis in the future.</p>
<p>For example, instead of drawing graphical video frames using traditional techniques, future games could potentially use an AI engine to "imagine" or hallucinate graphics in real time as a prediction task.</p>

<p>"<span>The potential here is absurd," <a href="https://x.com/NickADobos">wrote</a> app developer Nick Dobos in reaction to the news. "Why write complex rules for software by hand when the AI can just think every pixel for you?"</span></p>
<p><span>GameNGen can reportedly generate new frames of&nbsp;<em>Doom</em> gameplay at over 20 frames per second using a single tensor processing unit (TPU), a type of specialized processor similar to a GPU that is optimized for machine learning tasks.</span></p>
<p>In tests, the researchers say that ten human raters sometimes failed to distinguish between short clips (1.6 seconds and 3.2 seconds) of actual <em>Doom</em> game footage and outputs generated by GameNGen, identifying the true gameplay footage 58 percent or 60 percent of the time.</p>

<p>Real-time video game synthesis using what might be called "<a href="https://x.com/benjedwards/status/1300252019534462977">neural rendering</a>" is not a completely novel idea. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/rtx-off-ai-on-jensen-says-well-see-fully-ai-generated-games-in-5-10-years">predicted</a> during an interview in March, perhaps somewhat boldly, that most video game graphics could be generated by AI in real time within five to 10 years.</p>
<p>GameNGen also builds on previous work in the field, cited in the GameNGen paper, that includes <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10122">World Models</a> in 2018, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12126">GameGAN</a> in 2020, and Google's own <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/googles-genie-model-creates-interactive-2d-worlds-from-a-single-image/">Genie</a> in March. And a group of university researchers trained an AI model (called "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12399">DIAMOND</a>") to simulate vintage Atari video games using a diffusion model earlier this year.</p>
<p>Also, ongoing research into "<a href="https://runwayml.com/research/introducing-general-world-models">world models</a>" or "<a href="https://openai.com/index/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators/">world simulators</a>," commonly associated with AI video synthesis models like Runway's Gen-3 Alpha and OpenAI's Sora, is leaning toward a similar direction. For example, during the debut of Sora, OpenAI showed demo videos of the AI generator <a href="https://gizmodo.com/openai-sora-is-coming-for-your-video-games-1851264042">simulating <em>Minecraft</em></a>.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<h2>Diffusion is key</h2>
<p>In a preprint research paper titled "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14837">Diffusion Models Are Real-Time Game Engines</a>," authors Dani Valevski, Yaniv Leviathan, Moab Arar, and Shlomi Fruchter explain how GameNGen works. Their system uses a modified version of Stable Diffusion 1.4, an image synthesis diffusion model released in 2022 that people use to produce AI-generated images.</p>
<p>"Turns out the answer to 'can it run <em>DOOM</em>?' is yes for diffusion models," <a href="https://x.com/iScienceLuvr/status/1828618060997239253">wrote</a>&nbsp;Stability AI Research Director Tanishq Mathew Abraham, who was not involved with the research project.</p>

<p>While being directed by player input, the diffusion model predicts the next gaming state from previous ones after having been trained on extensive footage of <em>Doom</em> in action.</p>
<p>The development of GameNGen involved a two-phase training process. Initially, the researchers trained a reinforcement learning agent to play <em>Doom</em>, with its gameplay sessions recorded to create an automatically generated training dataset—that footage we mentioned. They then used that data to train the custom Stable Diffusion model.</p>
<p>However, using Stable Diffusion introduces some graphical glitches, as the researchers note in their abstract: "The pre-trained auto-encoder of Stable Diffusion v1.4, which compresses 8×8 pixel patches into 4 latent channels, results in meaningful artifacts when predicting game frames, which affect small details and particularly the bottom bar HUD."</p>

<p>And that's not the only challenge. Keeping the images visually clear and consistent over time (often called "temporal coherency" in the AI video space) can be a challenge. GameNGen researchers say that "interactive world simulation is more than just very fast video generation," as they write in their paper. "The requirement to condition on a stream of input actions that is only available throughout the generation breaks some assumptions of existing diffusion model architectures," including repeatedly generating new frames based on previous ones (called "autoregression"), which can lead to instability and a rapid decline in the quality of the generated world over time.</p>

The 8.5GB update for Sony's system reportedly addresses bug issues and adds a 40fps mode, but it's also apparently causing headaches for people who have already spent hours playing Star Wars Outlaws.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's the message Ubisoft has reportedly sent out:</p><p>"To best experience the Outer Rim, we rolled out a maintenance to make sure everyone is playing the latest version of the game. As one of the players affected who had access to an older version of the game, we are aware you might be encountering some issues after this recent patch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-pre-production-is-almost-over-says-cd-projekt/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, CD PROJEKT has <a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1828701181020872768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> its earnings for the first half of 2024 while updating investors on the status of its main projects, chiefly The Witcher 4 (codenamed Polaris).</p>
<p>Michał Nowakowski, Joint CEO of CD PROJEKT, said:</p>
<p><em>Work on Polaris (The Witcher 4) is progressing – its development team is nearing a major milestone which will mark the end of the preproduction phase. The first half of the year was also a busy period for our Boston studio, which is laying the groundwork for Project Orion – a new game set in the Cyberpunk universe.</em></p>
<p>The Witcher 4 will enter production soon, then, and it will do so with 410 active developers, as shown in the latest infographics. CD PROJEKT as a whole gained nine employees in total between April and the end of July, with three additional developers on Polaris, four on Orion (the sequel of Cyberpunk 2077), three on Sirius (the rebooted multiplayer The Witcher spin-off in development at Molasses Flood).</p>
<p>The headcount on Project Hadar (a secret brand new IP) remains at 20, while three more developers are working on shared services across all projects, such as AI, localization, Quality Assurance, etc. Lastly, only eight developers have been assigned to other projects, down from twelve in April.</p>
<p>CD PROJEKT also commented on the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-q-further-improvements-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> of the REDkit for The Witcher 3. Nowakowski stated:</p>
<p><em>It's been several months since our dev tools were released to gamers, and there’s already a slew of interesting modding projects out there. We are happy to see the engagement of the gaming community, which is eager to share its ideas, bringing new strength to The Witcher 3 – a game set to celebrate its 10th anniversary next year.</em></p>
<p>The Polish company's financial results are quite positive. Its net profit (170 million in local currency, which translates to around $44 million) outperformed the comparative period by nearly 90%. CFO Piotr Nielubowicz also said:</p>
<p><em>In H1 2024 we also noted an increase in our financial reserves. Despite having paid out almost 100 million PLN in a dividend, and allocating over 150 million PLN to new projects, our reserves nevertheless grew by more than 55 million PLN.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>There's no release date for The Witcher 4 yet, but given the triple-A ambition, it's easy to imagine at least two if not three years of production. As such, the game could launch between late 2026 and 2027.</p>

I came away really enthralled by its world and how it seems to be toying with the barriers of fantasy and reality. I was less thrilled with how Atlus <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-preview-persona-atlus-political-1851633394&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-preview-persona-atlus-political-1851633394">attempted to distance its in-universe political drama from reality</a></span>, but I’m still intrigued by what the game itself seems to be saying. I saw a lot of the game in those four hours, and I think I’m still waiting to find the flair in its turn-based combat, which felt like it was missing some of the bells and whistles that make games like <em>Persona </em>feel more complex than just hitting elemental weaknesses. But despite any lingering concerns, I still experienced a handful of standout moments in which I could feel <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> worming its way into my brain, sparking my curiosity, and alleviating some of the problems I’ve had with some of Atlus’ previous games. Here are a few moments from my play time that have stuck with me.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0e169e7ed9533dc42ec8714a7334c789" data-recommend-id="image://0e169e7ed9533dc42ec8714a7334c789" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Strohl stands next to the rest of the party.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Much of <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>’s structure seems evocative of the modern <em>Persona </em>games. This includes the party’s journey, with each member going through an “awakening,” similar to how Joker and the rest of the Phantom Thieves do when they acquire supernatural powers. In <em>Metaphor</em>, these awakenings happen when they gain their Archetype ability, a transformation that essentially functions as a malleable job system, giving characters different powers and roles in combat.</p><p>These awakenings occur during dramatic, character-defining moments, and the scenes are pretty hardcore. The party members rip their own hearts out and shout into them like a megaphone. We saw two of these during the demo, including Strohl’s, and it was easily one of the best moments of those four hours. Strohl is a warrior from a noble family, and without getting into too many spoilers, he’s a bit downtrodden about the state of things. When he finally awakens, he rips his heart out and then shouts into it as he rallies a crowd. It’s slightly derivative of <em>Persona</em>, sure, but it’s also fucking metal. I was immediately energized by the scene and am stoked to see the game riff on this further as we meet new party members. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="aaf5e4f3a2803102a31dfff5542e82f0" data-recommend-id="image://aaf5e4f3a2803102a31dfff5542e82f0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist stares at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist stares at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aaf5e4f3a2803102a31dfff5542e82f0" data-recommend-id="image://aaf5e4f3a2803102a31dfff5542e82f0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist stares at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the most frustrating things about <em>Persona </em>games is that if your protagonist falls in combat, that’s all she wrote. It means keeping your main character alive and well is a core part of your strategy, even in a game with instakill spells that don’t discriminate. I had completely forgotten about this when I started playing <em>Metaphor</em> and got real nervous when a boss started focusing all their resources on my hero and draining his health. But much to my delight, the battle continued after he fell to the ground. I was able to revive him with some items and keep the fight going, eventually overcoming my foe and continuing my journey. This has always been one of my least favorite restrictions <em>Persona </em>has arbitrarily enforced over the years, and I was glad to see <em>Metaphor</em> buck the trend.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="370549e37c63e6817b9cc0eb8738399a" data-recommend-id="image://370549e37c63e6817b9cc0eb8738399a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Metaphor Party menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Metaphor Party menu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="370549e37c63e6817b9cc0eb8738399a" data-recommend-id="image://370549e37c63e6817b9cc0eb8738399a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Metaphor Party menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Atlus games are well-regarded for their stunning menu design. <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>is no exception, as pausing the game opens up a delight for the eyes. From the gorgeous illustrations of its characters to the ways its text boxes resemble the worn pages of a storybook, <em>Metaphor </em>makes flipping through the menu feel tactile, like turning pages in a long-forgotten tome and uncovering its secrets.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e6693ea589bb26b10a04ec74a29f458d" data-recommend-id="image://e6693ea589bb26b10a04ec74a29f458d" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist attacks an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist attacks an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e6693ea589bb26b10a04ec74a29f458d" data-recommend-id="image://e6693ea589bb26b10a04ec74a29f458d" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist attacks an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Turn-based RPGs are notorious for grind. Atlus has been gradually introducing ways to mitigate it with mechanics like <em>Persona 5</em> <em>Royal</em>’s Instakill stealth maneuver that allows you to defeat low-level enemies without having to waste your time on the whole turn-based song and dance. <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>takes this a step further and allows you to attack overworld enemies in real time. Typically this allows you a preemptive strike advantage, but if you can overpower an enemy with these attacks, you can circumvent fights entirely and still reap the rewards. It’s a satisfying, expedient way to get through something often synonymous with tedium.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="796c19ff3c1e64e7f3f3ffbcf102c21c" data-recommend-id="image://796c19ff3c1e64e7f3f3ffbcf102c21c" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist reads a book in Akademia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist reads a book in Akademia." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="796c19ff3c1e64e7f3f3ffbcf102c21c" data-recommend-id="image://796c19ff3c1e64e7f3f3ffbcf102c21c" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist reads a book in Akademia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The moment <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> clicked with me was when I sat with Gallica, my fairy companion, as we thought back on the early days of our adventure. I opened a book the protagonist had been carrying around for the whole game and it described a “fantasy” universe that sounds a lot like ours. The book illustrates a world full of cityscapes and devoid of the divides and otherings of <em>Metaphor</em>’s universe. That’s obviously an idealized vision of the real world, but I was hooked when I realized Atlus’ fantasy world might have something interesting to say about ours. That curiosity only grew when I stumbled upon a small detail in a library…<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="85e4c83734cffe9a83e0cf2365b8babb" data-recommend-id="image://85e4c83734cffe9a83e0cf2365b8babb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist looks down at something." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist looks down at something." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="85e4c83734cffe9a83e0cf2365b8babb" data-recommend-id="image://85e4c83734cffe9a83e0cf2365b8babb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist looks down at something." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When I started the demo, <em>Metaphor</em> asked me to enter my name. No, not the protagonist, but myself as the entity that would guide the hero through the world. That was an interesting request on its face, but it became more compelling when I visited Akademia, the Velvet Room-esque space in which I would learn more about the world and my character’s Archetypes. Books were scattered around the room, and there was one that was mostly illegible to my character, with the exception of my name. The implication that I, the player, exist in this world already has my mind racing with all the possibilities of where this story could go. <em>Metaphor </em>is clearly playing with the divides between fantasy and reality, and that is almost more compelling to me than its A plot of elections and power struggles. I can’t wait to see where this thread takes me.<br></p><hr><p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 11. That’s coming up pretty soon, but if you’re already feeling the Atlus itch, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-answer-preview-aigis-price-dlc-1851622486&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-answer-preview-aigis-price-dlc-1851622486"><em>Persona 3 Reload</em>’s <em>The Answer </em>DLC</a></span> is coming up on September 10.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
