            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Someone at either developer Build a Rocket Boy or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-hitman-io-interactive-roadmap-update-metacritic-2000623129"><span>publisher IO Interactive</span></a><span> hasn’t given up on </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span>, because several high-profile content creators are still being sponsored to play the game following its December 2025 patch.</span></p> <p><span>As spotted by </span><a href="https://frvr.com/blog/mindseye-devs-are-still-sponsoring-streamers-following-mass-lay-offs-and-single-digit-players-on-steam/"><i><span>FRVR</span></i></a><span>, YouTube creator and Twitch streamer </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsJS-SfccUg"><span>Criken</span></a><span>, whose channel currently boasts over 1 million subscribers, recently uploaded a sponsored video of their </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>playthrough on January 14. While Twitch and YouTube are full of sponsored video game playthroughs, Criken’s video has people scratching their heads since </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>has barely peaked above 30 concurrent players on Steam since its disastrous June 2025 release.</span></p>  <p><span>Several commenters on Criken’s video were shocked to discover that the creator isn’t just playing the game as a joke. “Oh I thought you were playing this because it’s basically a meme at this point, I can’t believe they’re still sponsoring people,” wrote Didorial. “They’re still sponsoring? I’m impressed that the company wants to keep this game alive. (7 current players on steam btw),” wrote Dazcoolman.</span></p>

 <p><span>Even stranger still, he’s not the only high-profile creator who seems to be getting paid to produce new videos for the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-review-bad-ps5-update-boring-open-world-pc-gta-1851785108"><span>middling open-world shooter</span></a><span> at the moment. A quick browse through the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/mindseyepartner"><span>#MindsEyePartner</span></a><span> tag on YouTube shows that YouTubers like SweeetTails, Blue Thunder Gaming, and Willyrex (the latter of whom has over 17.2 million subscribers) have all been sponsored to play the game in the last month following its version 6.1 patch on December 18. According to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TSq8ZaG7gnY"><span>Blue Thunder Gaming</span></a><span>, the PR team that reached out with the sponsorship even agreed upfront to let creators “say whatever [they] want” about the game.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000661015" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661015"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661015">YouTube / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Sponsored streams were also a part of the marketing strategy around MindsEye’s original launch, but ended up </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-steam-reviews-bugs-glitches-update-refunds-1851784312"><span>resulting in viral moments</span></a><span> that only further solidified the shooter’s reputation for being boring and busted. Twitch streamer CohhCarnage was even asked to cancel his sponsored livestream of the game </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lre7iutssk22"><span>mere minutes after</span></a><span> he’d just told his viewers it was about to begin.</span></p>

 <p><span>This all leads to the inevitable question: why? To be frank, I don’t have an answer for you, as the sponsored videos and streams don’t seem to have made much difference to the player numbers on Steam. Maybe things are going better on console. Admittedly, the game does look to be in a better state now than it was at launch, but I think the damage has already been done. A </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span> turnaround story this is not. At least for now. </span></p>

This past weekend, players enjoyed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/lorwyn-eclipsed-reveal-brings-cards-commanders-and-muppets" rel="nofollow"><em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em></a> prerelease, but some players got a surprise. Instead of getting certain promo cards, they got cards from the announced <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> Universes Beyond crossover set.</p><h2>The <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> Prerelease TMNT Card Leak</h2><p>The <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> Prerelease TMNT card leak happened gradually over the weekend. As players went to their local game shops and opened up prerelease packs for the latest <em>Magic</em> set, players noticed certain cards that were not part of the fairytale theme. No, some cards clearly featured aliens, mutants, ninja tools, dangerous green ooze, and certain heroes in a half shell.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>It wasn't long before various dedicated sites and the <em>Magic</em> Subreddit began to pool their findings. If you are curious about what was revealed and don't mind spoilers, <a href="https://articles.starcitygames.com/magic-the-gathering/most-mtg-tmnt-rares-mythic-rares-leaked-during-lorwyn-eclipsed-prerelease-events/" rel="nofollow">Star City Games</a> has photos of the 58 (so far) cards leaked during the event. Fair warning, the cards in this leak are mostly Rares and Mythic Rares, which may give you some insight into the set's relevance in the current competitive meta.</p><p>The <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> set is part of the latest wave of crossovers in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>.

In a social media post on Bluesky Social and X (formerly Twitter), they stated the "incorrect cards" found in the prerelease kits were not intentional and that stores should replace these cards with appropriate promos from other Lorwyn Eclipsed prerelease kits. But, if that wasn't possible, players can play with these cards.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

			<p><span>A member of the grounds crew clears snow during the second quarter of the NFC Divisional playoff game between the Chicago Bears and the Los Angeles Rams at Soldier Field on January 18, 2026 in Chicago, Illinois. (Lauren Leigh Bacho/Getty Images)</span></p>
		</div><div>
		<p>I woke up sad. </p><p>Sleep-smeared eyes skittered over the ceiling as I tried to find context for the feeling and I remembered, "The Bears lost." A series of mental snapshots followed: D'Andre Swift getting knocked out of the air by a helmet to his taint. Williams <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-KJys_K15w&amp;ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">launching a last-minute bomb to Kmet</a> in the endzone. Sean McVay staring blankly at the field as the game went to overtime. Kam Curl snatching the ball out of the air before it hits the ground, killing a Bears overtime drive and setting up the game-winning Rams field goal.</p><p>This is not a new feeling. What <em>was </em>new was the sadness that it meant this season is over, that there weren't more Bear games to look forward to. The Bears have not really been a source of fun and happiness in my adult life. The 2006 team was probably the last time I felt uncomplicated love for Chicago's historic and historically hapless football franchise. Years of Jay Cutler had their ups and downs but it was hard to like Cutler and it was even harder to trust that the team would not fall short in the most painful possible way. I wanted the Bears to win, but I treated their games like MRI or endoscopy appointments. Something unpleasant to get through to find out if you were going to be okay or if you were totally doomed.</p><p>I don't think you can understand the difference between being a fan of a cursed team versus a bad one until you have lived it, the sourness that works its way into your heart and even your sense of reality. Until this season, the moment that best captured the Chicago Bears for me was an Aaron Rodgers touchdown fumble back in 2013. The Double-Doink, Cutler getting knocked out in the NFC Championship game against the Packers, Peyton Manning torching a depleted Bears defense in the Super Bowl… none of that rates compared to this one play that was pure Bears Football.</p><p>With the season on the line, the Bears were playing a "win-and-in" game against the Packers to advance to the playoffs. The Bears were leading early, and I was getting happily drunk as I watched an Aaron Rodgers pass get batted to the ground. I cheered, the Bears began shuffling back toward the middle of the field. The Packers' Jarrett Boykin wandered over to the ball and picked it up curiously. Rodgers sidled next to him and muttered something, waving his hand toward the endzone. Boykin shuffle-jogged away. Confused, a couple Bears turned like they were thinking about pursuing, but Boykin was already past them. He crossed the goal line and, against all reason, the officials raised their arms to signal a touchdown.</p><p>The next few minutes were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB2TX4FmPAc&amp;ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">a hallucination of improbable replays</a>. Rodgers hadn't thrown a pass, the ball was knocked out of his hand by a Bears defender with such force and angle that it looked like an errant pass, but it was clearly a fumble. The officials never blew the play dead. The Packers were the first to realize the ball was live, Rodgers' body language that of a man who has just spotted a bag full of cash lying on the ground and doesn't want to over-react and give away what he's thinking. The Bears didn't seem to fully believe what was happening and acted almost as if they could kill the play just by committing to the idea that it was over. That surely nobody would award a touchdown like this. Then they did and, as every Bear fan watching at home knew they would, the Bears unraveled, committing turnovers and errors that resulted in yet another close defeat in a season that was full of them.</p><p>That's been the experience of the Bears for most of my life. A team so traumatized by failure and disappointment that the first bad break in a game could trigger a collapse. A team coached to miss important details, conditioned to wait for someone to tell them what to do rather than react. A team terrified to have opportunities or to take chances because <em>that </em>would risk failure, so they'd spend entire seasons in a kind of defensive curl, just trying to win via the clock rather than the score. A team that would play like this for years on end and then turn around and complain that the media and their fans didn't believe in them, didn't respect them.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@joshmccausland?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Josh McCausland</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>That wasn't the case with the 2025 Chicago Bears. From a rocky beginning they turned into a team that went from fluke victories to a pattern of incredible resilience and uncanny clutch performance. For the first time in my life I'd feel hope and excitement when I saw a Bears quarterback launch a deep pass with everything on the line. I'd enjoy comebacks in close games because they weren't just prefaces to crushing disappointment. I liked the way my phone would buzz for hours after a game as old friends checked-in, and a half dozen different group texts would share the same half-dozen highlights as if we hadn't all seen the same play.</p><p>Even people who never really followed the Bears before got onboard with this team, remarkable for a franchise that's historically repelled interest from the rest of the NFL world. You could hear how much broadcast teams liked covering their games. I am pretty sure Collinsworth and Tirico would have blocked that Rams kick if they could have, knowing that as good and deserving as they are, they're not a <em>story </em>the way the 2025 Bears were.</p><p>So I'm sad about the end of the Bears season the way I was sad hugging my friends goodbye after we went to that absurd Star Wars hotel, or watching my parents drive away after their first visit to our new home. A wonderful experience is over, and I wish I could have just one more day of it. But I'll take that feeling of sadness over the feeling of frustrated relief that has so often accompanied the end of a Bears season.</p><p>Is one good season enough to banish a lifetime of grim history? Of course not. But I can't overstate the number of demons the 2025 Bears slew over the course of their campaign. Two unforgettable comeback wins against the Packers, one in the playoffs to end their season and perhaps send them into their own existential crisis. An incredible series of misfortunes and miscues against a wounded Bengals team that ended with a miraculous comeback drive that, historically, the Bears never successfully execute. An improbable turnover followed by an another incredible comeback drive against the Commanders, the team that caused the Bears to fall apart completely in 2024, followed by a walk-off field goal by stand-in kicker Jake Moody, who was trying to redeem himself following a terrible season that cost him his longtime job with the 49ers. As the ball sailed through the uprights, the ghost of Cody Parkey finally departed Chicago's collective consciousness.</p><p>And above all, there's Caleb Williams. Flawed, often frustrating. But at a point in his career where previous Bears quarterbacks have fallen apart, showing that they don't have what it takes to be effective starters and don't have the mental makeup to perform well with the game on their shoulders, he showed the opposite. Fourth-quarter and overtime Caleb Williams has been seen too many times this year to be a mirage. He might be one of the reasons the Bears <em>needed </em>a cargo pocket full of miracles to win these games, but he's undoubtedly one of the biggest reasons they <em>did </em>win them.</p><p>It's fitting the Bears had this season in a year when the sports world has been delighted by the fact that a South Side priest is now the Bishop of Rome. Because the Bears are a team that operated more on faith than reason. A lot of the statistics they amassed this year did not suggest they were a particularly good team. At their worst they seemed entirely fraudulent. But watching them you started to understand why people who have spent enough time around sports eventually reach a point where they lose interest in statistics and "the analytics" and the efficiency optimization games that every franchise plays and return to fuzzier, intangible concepts like clutch performance, willpower, and recognizing winners when you see them. In a repeated statistical simulation the Bears likely lost more than half the games they won this year. But in the flesh-and-blood reality of the sport, where instead of calculating and predicting an outcome a thousand times you get to play it <em>once</em>, they emerged victorious time and again.</p><p>Undoubtedly there will be analytical explanations for this Bears season, and we'll likely hear all about them on the eve of the 2026 season as we come to grips with the sheer improbability of this team having anywhere near the same success it enjoyed this year. But Bears fans know what they saw for the past 20 weeks: a team that didn't necessarily deserve their belief, but rewarded their faith.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Promises A Crackdown On The Recent Epidemic Of ‘Lord Farming’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-s6-lord-farming-proficiency-detection-2000661005</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Season 6 of </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> launched last week, finally introducing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-marvel-rivals-role-fourth-wall-break-meta-2000659834"><span>Deadpool</span></a><span> to the hero roster, as well as a new battle pass and various gameplay tweaks. Part of the update includes a major reworking of the hero proficiency system. It added new rewards for players to earn but unintentionally promoted a new epidemic of “lord farming” in the process.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The updated system changes how players earn proficiency. Rather than a tiered system where players earn proficiency through universal and hero-specific challenges, there is now a linear system that players progress through via solely universal challenges, so each hero progresses identically regardless of role. There are now 70 levels for players to progress through, with rewards across various milestones. Players now also earn more proficiency per minute spent playing. You can find a full breakdown of the changes </span><a href="https://www.boostingfactory.com/marvel-rivals/blog/new-marvel-rivals-hero-proficiency-system-explained"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>The overhaul has led to a spike in players farming for cosmetics by staying in spawn and spamming abilities in order to quickly progress through the updated system. Players who engage in this behavior are </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1qgze5x/marvel_rivals_starting_to_take_action_against_afk/"><span>sometimes referred to as</span></a><span> lord farmers, who create deeply unbalanced matches by essentially being AFK the whole time.</span></p> <p><span>The phenomenon calls to mind </span><i><span>Civilization </span></i><span>designer Soren Johnson’s </span><a href="https://www.designer-notes.com/game-developer-column-17-water-finds-a-crack/"><span>2011 blog post</span></a><span>, where he writes, “Many players cannot help approaching a game as an optimization puzzle. What gives the most reward for the least risk? What strategy provides the highest chance—or even a guaranteed chance—of success? Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game.”</span></p>

 <h2>A new behavior detection system is on the way</h2> <p><span>Fortunately, NetEase is aware of the behavior and already working to address it. “Recently, we’ve noticed that some players are exploiting matches by remaining stationary and repeatedly farming stats to gain hero proficiency points. This behavior disrupts normal gameplay and seriously affects the match experience of other players,” the </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> team </span><a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/2013176993383133552"><span>wrote on X</span></a><span> on January 19. “To address this, we are planning to introduce a combat behavior detection system. Players found engaging in such behavior may face penalties including, but not limited to: warnings, short-term suspensions, long-term suspensions, or permanent account bans.”</span></p>

 <p><span>NetEase has not yet stated when the countermeasure will go live, or if any efforts will be made to prevent lord farmers from creating new accounts in the free-to-play game once the old ones are banned. In the meantime, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJsn3W26ghM"><span>some vigilante players are messing with lord farmers</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>While a combat behavior detection system will hopefully help deter lord farming going forward, it doesn’t address the fundamental game design decisions that are encouraging the behavior in the first place. Only time will tell if the hero proficiency system receives additional reworking.</span></p>

			<p><strong>ARC Raiders</strong> was easily one of the biggest releases in 2025. Despite only releasing at the end of October, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">one of the year's<strong> best-selling games on Steam</strong></a>, and it helped the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-helped-push-steam-to-have-highest-grossing-december-yet/">digital storefront have its "<em>highest-grossing</em>" December yet</a>. It was even <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-was-2025-most-searched-videogame-on-google-gta-vi-only-7th/">the most-searched video game on Google for the year</a>, and now, a new report from <strong>Circana</strong> analyst and executive director <strong>Mat Piscatella</strong> shows the first indication that one of 2025's biggest games is in the running to be the biggest game in 2026.</p>



<p>If you've been following our gaming coverage in the last year, then you've almost definitely seen Circana and Piscatella mentioned before. Circana is a data analyst firm that tracks retail sales across multiple industries in the US, and Piscatella is one of their top analyst and an executive director, specifically covering the video game industry. Every month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/">Piscatella reports the US sales numbers for the video game industry</a>, showcasing which titles made the charts that month, and in between those monthly reports, he's also started showcasing weekly player engagement numbers.</p>



<p>Today, ahead of his report for December 2025, which will also include the final sales charts for the best-selling game in the US in 2025, Piscatella reported that on Steam, ARC Raiders has led player engagement in the US <strong>for nine consecutive weeks<em>.</em></strong> These aren't concurrent numbers, just the total number of players per week.</p>







<p>Of course, it's worth remembering that it's still only January, and by the end of this week, ARC Raiders' impressive streak could be over, with it getting overtaken by the number two game, Counter-Strike. Even if the streak is broken, though, it's the latest sign that ARC Raiders is on an extreme hot streak at the moment, and there's no real indication it'll slow down anytime soon.</p>



<p>Since it launched, ARC Raiders has remained towards the top of the charts for global Steam concurrent player numbers. It hasn't <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">even dipped below <strong>250K concurrent players</strong></a> on Steam since<a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-surpasses-200k-concurrent-players-on-steam-at-launch/"> it soared past that mark when it arrived.</a> It has sold over <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-neared-1-million-concurrent/">12.4 million copies</a></strong>, and across all platforms, it reportedly hit close to <strong>1 million concurrent players</strong> this month.</p>



<p>Despite its developer, <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-have-to-take-step-back-understand-ai-can-be-big-help-developers-benefit-players-says-arc-raiders-boss/"><strong>Embark Studios</strong>,</a> being consistently embroiled in <a href="https://wccftech.com/consumers-dont-care-about-ai/">controversy over its use of <strong>GenAI</strong></a>, the game has seemingly only picked up momentum. If it can continue this run, especially as new content is on its way from Embark, then there's little question as to what the biggest game of 2026 will be.</p>

		<p>Developer Kenny Sun has announced that Ball X Pit’s first free major update is launching on January 26th. The Regal Update will add two new treasure seekers, eight new balls, and new passives too. You can get a glimpse of the action in the video below. The two new seekers are the Carouser and the Falconer. The Carouser has returning balls orbiting around him, while the Falconeer has two falcons that throw balls. Ball X Pit players will also get an additional surprise, though no details have been revealed.</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p>Just when we thought we were out, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_x_pit">BALL x PIT</a> drags us back in.</p>
<p>Yes, after being teased back in December, Kenny Sun has today announced that the immensely addictive roguelike will land its first free major update on <strong>26th January</strong> — that's just one week away!</p>
<p>The 'Regal Update' looks positively packed with even more Breakout-inspired mayhem. Chief among the additions is The Carouser, an all-new character who can spin his returning balls around himself in a protective orbit, and The Falconer, another straight-shooter who's supported by her two flanking ball-throwing birds. There's also eight new balls and a bunch of new passive effects to play with, so your runs can get even more random.</p>
<p>What's more, the dev has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2062430?emclan=103582791475171021&amp;emgid=524235040246203073">revealed</a> that there's <em>another</em> surprise getting announced on launch day, so we'll be keeping an eye out for that one.</p>
<p>It'll add to what was already an impressively engaging game at launch. "It operates in such perfect balance that it appeals both to the one-more-go instinct and to more cerebral planning and creativity," we said of Ball x Pit in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/ball-x-pit">our 9/10 review</a>. With three free content updates planned for this year, it'll be interesting to see whether it can get its claws in us all over again.</p>

<p>Destiny 2’s next major update has reportedly been delayed due to the forthcoming release of Marathon, Bungie’s new extraction shooter, in early March.</p>



<p>Destiny 2: Shadow &amp; Order was originally slated for a March 3 release. However, after Bungie officially announced Marathon’s release date on Monday, Forbes’ <a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/2013302457787437355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Paul Tussi reported</a> that the next free Destiny update has been postponed. There’s no tentative release window for the content at the moment.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Have heard Shadow and Order will in fact be delayed to make room for Marathon on March 5, given that it was supposed to come out on March 3. Not sure how long, or when it will be announced, however. <a href="https://t.co/ImVb50bOUZ">pic.twitter.com/ImVb50bOUZ</a></p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/2013302457787437355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Shadow &amp; Order is slated to be the final major update of the Year of Prophecy season of the game, which started back with the Rite of the Nine in-game event that occurred in May 2025.</p>











<p>While it’s full steam ahead on the marketing push for Marathon, pre-ordering Bungie’s new game scores Destiny players new cosmetics, Sparrows, and Ships. There are also new shaders, emotes, and more in celebration of the upcoming release.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Infil into the dark sci-fi world of Tau Ceti IV on March 5, 2026.</p><p>Celebrate <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonTheGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MarathonTheGame</a> in Destiny 2 with the new Waiting for Exfil emote, Silkworm Weave Shader, and Modern MIDA Multi-Tool Exotic Weapon Ornament from Eververse, available to all players.</p><p>🪱… <a href="https://t.co/kY0PbQBQm0">pic.twitter.com/kY0PbQBQm0</a></p></div>— Destiny 2 (@DestinyTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/2013287839325106318?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="177f6fc9f24ac"><a title="RE: DS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/177f6fc9f24ac/re-ds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> has a special place in my heart, and not just because it's a stone-cold classic of gaming, a bona fide icon of the horror genre, and all that sort of guff.</p>
<p>No, I also have very fond memories of riding the bus home with the original PlayStation release of this particular game clutched tightly to my 16-year-old chest. I'd waited and waited, scanned every magazine and collected every nugget of information available over a very long gestation period. I couldn't wait any longer to get started at the Spencer Mansion. It was genuinely, possibly the most excited I've ever been about a game in the run-up to launch.</p>
<p>Who could have known, amidst the excitement of that bus journey, that just 10 years later, just one teeny tiny decade down the line, this sort of incredible horror experience (which at the time had us all shouting "It looks like a f*****g movie!") would be available to play, and with extras to boot, on a dinky portable system? Not me, that's for sure. But that's what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/resident_evil_deadly_silence">Resident Evil: Deadly Silence</a> brought to the table, exactly 20 years ago today in Japan. Happy Birthday, you deadly silent scamp, you!</p>

<p>Even more surprising — and it's awful to do this to something on its birthday, but it is what it is — I really didn't enjoy Deadly Silence very much for a whole bunch of reasons. Yep, I just did that whole big, nice, positive preamble in order to dump even harder on a game. On its birthday.</p>
<p>By the time 2006 rolled around, and as timeless as it is, Resi felt decidedly old-school in its design and gameplay, and in presenting the OG PSX game as a base for the most part here, it really did take a lot of love for Resi to press on through a port that felt stodgy and rather bad to play, and that's before you even get to the smaller screen that sucked a lot of the tension out of proceedings.</p>
<p>Of course, it's easy to snipe from here, from the safety of a hill positioned some 20 years in the future, but even at the time, I distinctly remember this one feeling a bit naff, a bit pointless given we already had nice revamped versions of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil">OG Resi</a>, and very tired on the gameplay front considering we'd all just recently(ish) recovered from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>.</p>

<p>Also, you must remember, at this point, we hadn't quite arrived at the critical retro/nostalgia inflection point for tank-control Resident Evil. It was too soon. It was just an 'old' game in 2006, and there were far better games to be playing, never mind better ports of this very same experience.</p>
<p>Alright. Enough putting the touchscreen knife in. Let's be nice. What Deadly Silence <em>did</em> add to the mix in order to strengthen its appeal was some slightly enhanced character graphics, a 180-degree quick turn, <em>and</em> a "Rebirth" mode, which utilised the console's touchscreen to jab at enemies with a knife in first person. So that's good!</p>

<p>Except the Rebirth mode wasn't good. Not good at all, in fact. Besides aimlessly jabbing at Zs, it also let you do some other trivial stuff like turning valves, which all felt a bit pointless and unresponsive overall, and so not really worth the effort.</p>
<p>However! Look. It was a portable version of a classic, and if you only had a DS, well, it was a solid enough way to experience a genre-definer if you really felt the need! Just eat your cake.</p>

            <p>
Valve have made changes to Steam’s community awards system to discourage people from posting daft and angry posts in order to farm Steam points. You will, in fact, no longer be able to receive Steam points from other users when they give you awards. Adding insult to injury, there's a new set of awards that are explicitly designed to spread goodwill. Filth!<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
For context, Steam community awards are those emoji stickers people slap on reviews to indicate a rich spectrum of human emotions - all the way from spitting contempt to absolutely brainless enthusiasm. With community awards hitherto being a source of Steam points (used to buy stuff like profile pictures and backgrounds) there has long been a culture of posting garbage to attract a few dozen clownface emojis. 
</p>
<p>
No longer! Now, all you’ll get in return for provoking the hatred of the commons is a picture of a flaming chilli pepper. This being one of 12 new community awards Valve have created, which replace the existing designs. They are not only worthless as a means of monetising cringe - they are intended to “keep the vibes positive”. Yeah, good luck with that.
</p>
<p>
“Just as before, you can purchase these awards using your Steam Points (earned by buying games), and use them in Steam Community to show your appreciation for things like user reviews, forum posts, guides, screenshots, artwork, Workshop mods, or even directly on your buddy's Steam profile,” notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/507340830949770620?l=english">the Steam blog</a> in question (thanks, Aerothorn).
</p><p>
“When we originally created Steam Community Awards, the idea was for them to not only look cool but to also grant a small number of Steam Points to the recipient, meaning they could be used as a tip of sorts for people who create and share amazing content with the Steam Community,” it goes on. “However, we found that this encouraged and rewarded a narrow set of attention-grabbing content and didn't allow the focus to be as much on a broader pool of thoughtful, well-considered creative content. 
</p>
<p>
“Because of this, we're refocusing the system: The Second Edition of Steam Community Awards won't transfer points. Instead, the goals of the system will be solely about conveying the appreciation of the viewer to the content creator, and as a signal to others that someone appreciated the piece of content.”
</p>
<p>
The new awards all cost 500 Steam points apiece, and are a mix of flavourless and awfully saccharine. Seriously, if anybody ever reacts to anything I’ve posted with a picture of a bouncing life preserver, take me outside and gun me down like a rabid dog. Still, we can rest assured that Steam users will twist their meaning. Give it a few weeks, and that bouncing life preserver will probably <em>actually</em> be the Steam user equivalent of gunning somebody down like a rabid dog.
</p>
<p>
We can also rest assured that Valve will bring back the OG community award designs at some point, once the dog of nostalgia is sufficiently rabid and ready for the gunning. I will quit with this analogy now.
</p>
<p>If we had a community award system for RPS comments, what designs should we include? Other than a rock, a piece of paper and a shotgun, of course.</p>

<p>Ball x Pit’s first major update, The Regal Update, has officially been announced, and it’s set to launch on January 26, 2026. Better yet, the update will be completely free for all players to claim.</p>







<p>This marks the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ball-x-pit-devs-announce-3-free-content-updates-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first of three major updates</a> promised for the game, with the remaining two currently scheduled to arrive in April and July. But before those roll around, The Regal Update is bringing plenty of new content to dive into.</p>

<p>A trailer shared on the official Ball x Pit <a href="https://x.com/BALLxPIT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account revealed the headline additions: two brand-new playable characters joining the roster.</p>



<ul>
<li>The Carouser, a character whose returning balls orbit around him</li>



<li>The Falconer, who is flanked by her two trusted falcons that throw balls</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s not all, though. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ball-x-pit-january-2026-regal-update-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Regal Update</a> will also introduce eight new balls, alongside several new passives to expand build variety. To top things off, the developers teased a mysterious “nice surprise” that they’re refusing to reveal ahead of launch. If their confidence is anything to go by, you’ll want to jump in on January 26 to see it for yourself. </p>







<p>Here’s the full trailer, which showcases the two new heroes in action.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Rockstar Is Reportedly Letting a Terminally Ill Fan Play Grand Theft Auto VI Early]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/rockstar-is-reportedly-letting-a-terminally-ill-fan-play-grand-theft-auto-vi-early/</link>
            <guid>1410214</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Spotted by <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/rockstar-early-access-fan-gta-6/">Tech4Gamers</a>, a terminally ill <strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong> fan seems to have been given the chance to play <strong>Grand Theft Auto VI</strong> ahead of its release. It's the second time in the span of two years that <strong>Take-Two Interactive</strong> is giving a dying fan a chance to play an unreleased title before they are no longer able to. </p>



<p>The last time this happened, the game in question was <strong>Borderlands 4</strong>, with longtime fan <strong>Caleb McAlpine</strong> posting his story to Reddit, on a wing and a prayer, hoping that his plea to try and play Borderlands 4 before he passed would make it to Gearbox. It did, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gearbox-flew-terminally-ill-fan-to-its-studio-to-play-borderlands-4-early-i-am-praying-he-makes-to-when-we-are-done">Gearbox flew Caleb and a friend of his to their home studio on first-class plane tickets</a> to tour the studio and play Borderlands 4 a year ahead of release.</p>



<p>This time, the story doesn't begin with a post on Reddit, but in now-deleted posts on LinkedIn from a UI integrator at Ubisoft Toronto, <strong>Anthony Armstrong</strong>. Armstrong made a call out to any potential connections he had at Rockstar and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/">Rockstar Toronto</a></strong> to ask if there was any chance a member of his family who had approximately 6 months to a year left to live could play the highly anticipated game ahead of its release.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Terminally-Ill-GTA-Fan-Plays-GTA-VI-Early-1.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Tech4Gamers</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to the post, which you can see above, this story has a happy ending with Armstrong seemingly speaking to the right people, with a report from <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/gta-6-terminally-ill-fan-play-early/">TheGamer</a> adding that Armstrong was contacted by Take-Two boss, <strong>Strauss Zelnick</strong>, as part of the process to set up a private play session for their relative. </p>



<p>It's perhaps the happiest story to come out of Rockstar recently, as news around the studio has mostly circled around topics like <a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-judge-denies-fired-rockstar-employees-interim-pay-iwgb/">allegations of <strong>union-busting</strong> from the IWGB and the current ongoing legal battle between Rockstar and the IWGB union</a>, or <a href="https://wccftech.com/although-not-content-complete-yet-fall-2026-is-a-more-real-release-window-than-fall-2025-for-grand-theft-auto-vi/">the state of GTA VI's development, and whether it'll actually still arrive in 2026</a>. On top of Rockstar trying to put out metaphorical fires, it also had a real one to deal with today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-north-fire-explosion-grand-theft-auto-vi/">after an explosion caused by a malfunctioning heating boiler started a fire at the Rockstar North offices in Edinburgh</a>.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll eventually get a follow-up to this story as we did with Caleb McAlpine's. Wccftech has attempted to reach out to Mr. Armstrong for such a follow-up and will update this story if/when we hear back.</p>

You can mark March 5 on your calendar as the date when you’ll begin your trip to planet Tau Ceti IV.</p><p>First <a href="https://gameinformer.com/playstation-showcase/2023/05/24/bungie-is-revitalizing-its-old-shooter-series-marathon">announced</a> in May 2023, Marathon was originally set to launch last September, but it was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/17/marathon-delayed-indefinitely-from-september-release">delayed</a> to address concerns stemming from an initially rocky player reception to the game’s Alpha test. The game was also at the center of a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/16/bungie-confirms-unauthorized-use-of-art-after-artist-claims-her-work-is-present">plagiarism controversy</a> surrounding its art direction, which has since been resolved. The extraction shooter sees players controlling bio-cybernetic characters called Runners, who must scavenge resources on the hostile Tau Ceti IV. Survival means combating rival player-controlled Runners as well as in-game security forces. You can see the game in action in its latest trailer below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UbNhSVj6WZM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UbNhSVj6WZM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Additionally, Marathon’s extensive voice cast has been revealed, and it includes the talents of Samantha Béart (Baldur’s Gate 3), Jennifer English (Clair Obscur: Expedition 33), Ben Starr (Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Final Fantasy XVI), and Neil Newbon (Baldur’s Gate 3).

            <p>
With Marathon's 5th March release date <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-release-date-reportedly-leaks-via-xbox-store-pre-order-trailer">now official</a>, developer Bungie has started sharing other bits of info about its PvPvE extraction shooter, including a lengthy cast list that - with names including Jennifer English and Ben Starr - reads like a bit of a who's who of video game acting talent.
</p>
<p>
Bungie has so far confirmed 30 actors making an appearance in Marathon's English voice cast "at launch", but it hasn't yet revealed the roles they'll be playing. Alongside Jennifer English, fresh off her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">award-winning turn as Maelle</a> in last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, Marathon also features fellow Expedition 33 actors Ben Starr and Tracy Wiles. Wiles, who played the Paintress, also portrayed Jaheira in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, and is joined by fellow BG3 veterans Neil Newbon (Astarion) and Samantha Béart (Karlach).

<p>
Marathon also stars Roger Clark (Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption), Dave Fennoy (Lee Everett in The Walking Dead), Elias Toufexis (Adam Jensen in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex-human-revolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex-mankind-divided">Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</a>), and Erin Yvette - who last year lent her voice to Samus Aran in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> and Dispatch's Blonde Blazer. Other confirmed talent includes Scott Whyte (Crash Bandicoot) and Jason Spisak (Silco in League of Legends TV adaptation Arcane). You'll find the complete announced English cast list below, with Bungie also noting Marathon will include fully localised dialogue for all its supported languages.

Marathon has, of course, had a turbulent road to release, finding itself embroiled in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">leadership changes</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">legal challenges</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">plagiarism scandal</a>, and more since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">unveiling back in 2023</a>. The shooter was initially due to launch on 23rd September last year, but Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">delayed its arrival</a> following a less-than-positive response to its big reveal and an equally divisive alpha playtest. Today, however, it confirmed Marathon will finally launch for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and Steam on 5th March, arriving in standard, deluxe, and collector's edition forms.

The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646977/bungie-marathon-release-date-september-alpha-test-details">slick-looking shooter</a> from the makers of <em>Halo </em>and <em>Destiny</em> was originally set to release in September, but will now <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon-releases-march-5-2026-new-trailer-and-more">launch on March 5th</a>.

The studio recently held playtests that included new features like proximity chat and an option to solo queue into games.</p><p><em>Marathon </em>is set in a sci-fi universe in 2850, where players take on the role of a Runner to scavenge what’s left behind. As a Runner, you fight in a crew of up to three players across a variety of zones and points of interest. <em>Marathon</em> is a PvPvE environment, so players will be fighting creatures on planets as well as other players. If you die during a run, you’ll drop your gear. But if you survive, your loot moves with you to future runs so you get more powerful gear and level up.</p><p>Bungie’s delay to Marathon means it is now launching months after <em>ARC Raiders</em>, an extraction shooter from the makers of <em>The Finals</em> that has consistently been in the top five most-played games on Steam since its launch in late October. Bungie had originally planned to launch <em>Marathon </em>ahead of <em>ARC Raiders</em>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/864146/bungie-marathon-release-date-march-5th-price]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As seen in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-a-new-inkle-game-a-total-war-alternative-a-paper-mario-like-rpg-and-some-bladesongs">The Maw</a>, fluffy defence shooter Mochi-O is out today, and – judging from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3596670/MOCHIO/">Steam demo</a> I’ve played – is an at least passingly entertaining MIRV explosion of gleeful nonsense. Landing somewhere between tower defence, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, and Tamagotchi, it has you holding up a genetically engineered hamster-like creature up to a window and blasting waves of attackers with the mounted weapons systems hidden in his fur. Then, setting him down and giving him a good long scritch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Keeping Mochi-O (also the name of your adopted battle rodent) happy, through the liberal application of petting and treats, serves two purposes. One, it keeps the beast sweet with your particular band of humans, his genocidal instincts being revealed through a mind-reading iPad. And two, it pre-emptively upgrades Mochi-O for the subsequent mission, sustained scratches yielding XP and currency boosts. Which is more than my cat ever gives to me.</p>
<p>The shooty bits operate on similar "Sure, why not" logic. Downed foes drop delicious seeds that Mochi-O can hoover up to unlock and improve his armaments, which escalate from one or two stick-out rifles to homing missile launcher, flung saw blades, and an orbital laser, the mechanics of which are not discussed beyond noting that the hamster can fire an orbital laser. And that’s just the demo – who knows what other war crimes the full game has tucked away in the floof.</p>

<p>More so than a classic shoot 'em up, the pick-and-mix upgrade system and general focus on waveclear call to mind a modern Survivorslike. Which is risky, as firing from a distance doesn’t allow quite as many of those squeaky-bum, narrow escape moments that the latter genre trades in, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-early-access-review">often to thrilling effect</a>. And yet, Mochi-O does seem to have a good grasp on the simpler dopamine extraction techniques of a quality autoshooter. Heavy waves and upgraded arsenals combine for some amusingly exaggerated destruction scenes, and the casino ding-ding-ding of devouring a seed pile is as satisfying as any SFX I’ve heard in all nineteen days of 2026 so far.</p>
<p>Crucially, it also hard-commits to its silliness, offering its daft pet combat with a confidence that’s only attainable by enjoying a deep sense of peace with itself. I respect that, in people, and in kawaii gerbil missile defence simulators.</p>

            <guid>1410175</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buried in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-trailer-leak-bungie-2000660975"><em>Marathon</em> launch info dump today</a>, which Bungie rushed out early after it was accidentally leaked over on Xbox, is the news that sci-fi shooter will arrive alongside the latest limited edition PlayStation 5 DualSense controller. And unlike many of the recent ones we’ve gotten, this one actually looks really good.</p> <p>The <em>Marathon</em>-inspired limited edition DualSense controller is $85 and goes up for pre-order on January 29 10:00 a.m. local time at direct.playstation.com. There’s also an accompanying Pulse Elite wireless headset that will go on sale at the same time, though for a much heftier price tag. That accessory will be $170. I’ve never loved the look of the Pulse headset and, frankly, the<em> Marathon</em> aesthetic isn’t changing that.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000660998" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660998"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660998">Sony</figcaption></figure> <p>What I love most about the <em>Marathon</em> DualSense, other than the generally subtle design and clean look, is how neatly the typography and icons mesh with the underlying sensibility of the controller. In other words, its a very natural fit unlike some other recent limited edition DualSenses. The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/08/20250508-ds/"><em>Death Stranding 2</em> one</a> wasn’t bad but felt pretty bland and I didn’t dig the giant bronze block over the touch pad. The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/10/first-look-ps5-ghost-of-yotei-limited-edition-console-designs/"><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> one</a>, meanwhile, looked like someone threw up gold dust on it.</p>

 <p>Bonus points to the <em>Marathon</em> controller for keeping the only branded text, the name of the game, hidden in neon on the underside of the controller. Is this controller even better looking than the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/296678467989"><em>Concord</em> one</a>? I think so. Will it be as rare as that one? Probably! Hopefully, it’s not because<em> Marathon</em> ends up flopping as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>From January 29, prospective fans of Marathon, Bungie’s all-new extraction shooter, can pre-order the limited edition DualSense and Pulse Elite wireless headset. The exclusive range is being manufactured to welcome Marathon to the market, and the announcement comes at the same time as the game’s release date was confirmed.</p>



<p>The full game will be released on March 5, but for now, you can stoke your excitement by <strong>preparing </strong>to preorder the limited edition controller and headset.</p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-s-marketing-march-starts-now">Marathon’s Marketing March Starts Now</h2>



<p>Bungie dropped a new trailer earlier today, revealing the full release date for Marathon, the upcoming extraction title. It came hours after the full trailer was leaked online, uncovering the game’s launch date before Bungie could drop the announcement.</p>



<p>What wasn’t revealed ahead of time was the new DualSense controller and Pulse Elite wireless headset, produced in honor of the new game.</p>



<p>It has been a rocky road for Marathon and Bungie over the last year or so, but by all accounts, things are starting to straighten up ahead of the game’s ultimate release.</p>



<p>Here’s a look at the new controller:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And a nice glimpse at the new Pulse Elite wireless headset:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While you can pre-order the peripherals from January 29, you won’t get your hands on them until the game launches in March. Also, you can <strong>only </strong>pre-order the Pulse Elite wireless headset from PlayStation Direct.</p>



<p>Here are your pricing points:</p>



<p><strong>DualSense –</strong> $84.99</p>



<p><strong>Pulse Elite</strong> <strong>– </strong>$169.99</p>



<p>Marathon could turn around all expectations and smash into the extraction space with a mighty roar in just a few weeks. People are approaching the game with bated breath, but recent playtests have suggested that it’s potentially shaping up to be something enjoyable, at the very least.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/heartopia-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-switch-all-platforms/</link>
            <guid>1410169</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Heartopia will likely end 2026 as one of the most lovingly titled games, and the life-sim title established itself early on as a game to keep an eye on. Its popularity boomed very quickly, and if you PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo owners want in on the action, there are answers for you all.</p>



<p>You’d think you can only have so many <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-forget-gta-6-2026-is-all-about-the-life-sim-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life-sim</a> games like Heartopia. Yet, the game from developer XD is proving once again that humanity can’t get enough of building houses and completing menial tasks that would be more productive if done in the real world—but we’re all gamers here, it would be hypocritical to suggest you go touch grass.</p>



<p>If you have a Heartopia-shaped box on your mind, its console status should be of interest.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-heartopia-on-playstation-5">Can You Play Heartopia On PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Pretty bubbles in the air. Credit to XD</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s an arrow through the heart for PS5 users as Heartopia isn’t available to play on PlayStation consoles at launch.</strong></p>



<p>Heartopia’s launch day player numbers on PC were fantastic, as were the ones after it! Before it came to Steam, Heartopia actually launched on the Google Play Store and the App Store. It garnered a reputation very first, making its Steam release a popular one. Tens of thousands of people got straight to work on creating homes and virtual lives.</p>



<p>For now, PlayStation 5 owners must miss out and play the waiting game. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-heartopia-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Heartopia On Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>Heartopia is bypassing Xbox consoles, leaving Xbox Series X|S users to have their hearts skip a beat.</strong></p>



<p>Everyone is striking out with Heartopia. The life-sim title doesn’t have any love in its heart for Microsoft and Xbox owners right now. It follows the same sorrowful fate as PlayStation players, but let’s hope there’s a future where this can change.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-heartopia-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2">Can You Play Heartopia On Nintendo Switch or Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 owners can also get in the same loveless boat, as Heartopia isn’t on a Nintendo console either.</strong></p>



<p>Per the Heartopia Discord Server, one of its main moderators (sweetkayla_xo) <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1128257488375005215/1420319877507579988/1458417800250134569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“No – Heartopia isn’t launching on consoles yet.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s unclear how much official information they have on the game. If they do know the inner-workings of the game’s development and reach, then this is a surefire sign that Heartopia is coming to consoles; we just don’t know when.</p>



<p>Are you playing Heartopia on mobile or PC? Do you have anything to say about the poor console players who are missing out? You can share your thoughts via the official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-location-post-apocalyptic-china/</link>
            <guid>1410166</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Shift Up recently posted an image on social media revealing a ‘location scout’ for their ‘next title’, which is almost certainly Stellar Blade 2. The follow-up to the 2024 post-apocalyptic sultry slasher was confirmed a while back, and by now, it should be full steam ahead for Shift Up in terms of piecing it together.</p>



<p>The apocalyptic landscape shared by the team on social media is a snippet taken from Chongqing, China. This is a gargantuan, dense cityscape with a population of <span>over 32 million people, but in Stellar Blade 2, it appears&nbsp;<strong>as</strong></span><strong> a ghost city</strong>. </p>







<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-2-promises-to-turn-heads">Stellar Blade 2 Promises to Turn Heads</h2>



<p>Stellar Blade dropped on PlayStation 5 in 2024, emerging as a game that intrigued players because, while it was marketed almost as a ‘gooner game’, it turned out to have some immensely satisfying combat mechanics and a decent story.</p>



<p>The game’s lead, Eve, wastes no time in showing as much flesh as possible, and that’s why the game perhaps didn’t get as serious a stamp of approval as it should have from some critics.</p>



<p>Regardless, it was a commercial success that was compounded by a hugely successful launch on PC a year later, and recently, the team at Shift Up revealed that <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sequel-in-development-now/">another game in the series</a> is coming</strong>.</p>



<p>The recent post <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/2012973553562321375">on social media</a> shows a crumbling, abandoned landscape, which eagle-eyed fans immediately identified as being a rendition of Chongqing, China. This was confirmed by Shift Up shortly after, giving fans the impression that, whenever Stellar Blade 2 arrives, it might take inspiration from or be directly set in and around the Chinese city.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s no big secret that Chinese fans were hugely approving of the game. It was estimated that 58% of PC-related sales of Stellar Blade were <strong>from </strong>China.</p>







<p>We know nothing about Stellar Blade 2, outside of these tiny tidbits from Shift Up. The nature of the game is yet to be revealed, but it might not be too long before <strong>it is</strong>. Fans expect something to be uncovered <strong>in the coming months</strong>.</p>
