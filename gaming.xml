It comes with a roadmap for the next few months of content, including a promise to keep players in the loop as development continues.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/22/the-division-2-2025-2026-roadmap-1755891200160.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Division 2 roadmap.

Ubisoft calls the new content “an updated take on the survival extraction experience” that is currently “in the early stages” of development. Aiding as creative director for Survivors is Magnus Jansén, who previously served as creative director on the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division"><u>The Division</u></a>. During today’s gamescom panel, he confirmed that, after a few years away from the franchise, he’s “back” and “working on something very, very exciting.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>...a hint to, maybe, the biggest new thing we’re doing is right there in the name.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“As some of you had already figured out, the wintery, survival extraction experience is coming to The Division 2,” Jansén said. “I know some of you are, like me, fans of the survival mode that we had in the first Division, and obviously, we think that those of you who like that, will be very, very happy, but it’s more than a remake. We are doing cool, new things.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He admits there’s little else to reveal, considering The Division 2: Survivors is so early in development. However, Jansén does have one note to leave fans with: “But what I will say, and this is like a teaser, is that a hint to, maybe, the biggest new thing we’re doing is right there in the name.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, I’ll just leave that there, and then I’ll be back next year,” he added.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tom Clancy's The Division 2: Survivors Concept Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll have to wait at least a few months to get a first look at The Division 2: Survivors. It’s release date on the roadmap is currently listed as “TBA,” so don’t expect its arrival until later in 2026 at the earliest. However, Ubisoft did provide eager fans with a first look at concept art (above), which may offer more hints about some of the scenarios players can find themselves in when Survivors eventually launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Division 2: Survivors is as much your baby as it is ours, and we strive for transparency during its development,” executive producer Julian Gerighty said in a statement. “Clear communication and community involvement are a focus as we build the new experience, and we will be closely involving you as we move forward on the development journey.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Division Resurgence</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Also included in today’s gamescom The Division announcements was an update on Ubisoft’s upcoming free-to-play mobile RPG MMO, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-resurgence"><u>The Division Resurgence</u></a>. Closed test phases for iOS and Android users will begin this September, with Ubisoft pushing interested players to sign up <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/resurgence" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Division Resurgence takes players back to the streets of Manhattan, set several months after the conclusion of the Division 1,” an official description for the mobile spinoff says. “With a familiar map updated to reflect the passage of time, the Division Resurgence will bridge the narrative gap between the Division 1 and 2, adding to the existing lore with additional story beats over time.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To encourage additional feedback from fans, Ubisoft is pushing players to <a href="https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=htMb4FH6EEKipCnlq296sXjbhitgTNtHlOCTQYxJZLRUQzhYSlVHQzI3UVMzN0ZFN01BWlFUQUU0MC4u&amp;route=shorturl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>sign up</u></a> for its Elite Task Force program.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">When you’ve played video games long enough, you eventually develop something of a “Spidey Sense” when you see a game that seems like it’s going to be extra special. You never know until the final product is on your hard drive, of course, but more often than not, that sixth sense is correct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Replaced, a 2.5D action-adventure game drenched in an absolutely stunning sci-fi cyberpunk pixel-art aesthetic – complete with incredible camera work and moody music – is making that Spidey Sense tingle. I’d already played a brief three-part demo over a year ago, which only reinforced that feeling I first got after the initial reveal four years ago. This time I got to play the first 30 or so minutes of the campaign, and it did nothing to dampen my enthusiasm for what could be – if the rest of the game delivers – an all-time indie classic in the same category as Limbo, Braid, Inside, Balatro, etc.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Right from the jump it’s obvious that Replaced’s art director knows what the heck they’re doing. The look of this dystopia, set in an alternate-history 1980s America, takes the 16-bit graphics I grew up with and plusses them up with soft dynamic lighting and some absolutely brilliant cinematography. Toss in just the right amount of depth of field and you get a world that looks lived-in. It oozes griminess and despair but somehow makes them look gorgeous. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Replaced is set in an alternate-history 1980s America and takes the 16-bit graphics I grew up with and plusses them up with soft dynamic lighting and some absolutely brilliant cinematography.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as R.E.A.C.H., an AI that lives in the body of a man named Warren, who wakes up after having been literally left for dead amongst a pile of corpses. The world of Phoenix City you see before you is the evolution of a worldwide nuclear event that occurred several decades prior. There are diaries, news articles, and other ephemeral bits of world-building information scattered around for you to collect and read in your Wingman – think of it as this cyberpunk world’s version of a 1980’s Walkman-meets-Palm-Pilot.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Replaced starts simply enough, keeping you on a left-to-right 2D plane, old-school-style, and having you do little more than some basic platforming. But it establishes its setting so amazingly well – and quickly to boot. Whether it’s the aforementioned digital clippings revealing pieces of the radiation-coated backstory or the searchlight-wielding snipers who will gun you down in one shot if they spot you, things are clearly grim in Phoenix City. Before long you’ll have to fight to survive, as you’ll be forced to throw hands with a couple of faction members and soon entire gangs of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s where Replaced will next impress you: it’s packing a proper Batman: Arkham combat system. Enemies who are about to attack will get a yellow lightning bolt over their heads. Press Y when you see that to instantly counter them. And then – my fellow Arkham veterans know where this is going – when a red lightning bolt appears over a foe’s head, that means they’re about to unleash an unblockable/uncounter-able attack, and you need to press the A button at just the right moment in order to dodge-roll away. Successful dodges and parries charge up a special-attack meter, which in Replaced’s case, means you get to either fire a shot from your found firearm at distance, or brutally execute an enemy if you’re at point-blank range. Of course, it’ll get more complicated; before long rifle-wielding bad guys will enter the fray, and the timing window changes on their (obviously) unblockable bullets. Enemy heavies will complicate things too. There was just one in the opening minutes of Replaced, and, probably by design, he wasn’t too tough to tango with. All of his attacks are unblockable, and he takes a ton of hits to bring down, but he didn’t have friends left by the time we faced off, so it was a very straightforward introduction to the higher-hit-point heavies you’ll face off against later in the game. So I expect the fisticuffs to ramp up significantly over the course of Replaced’s runtime in every sense of the word: number of enemies, difficulty, etc.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Soon Replaced began introducing the 2.5D elements, literally expanding its world by letting me walk to the background or foreground to get something I needed to progress onwards. You’ll need to grab onto dumpsters to slide them around in order to climb up on them to reach a higher ladder, or to bridge a gap, just as one example. While this opening sequence didn’t offer me too much freedom of movement within the environment, I know it eventually will, because I’ve seen it before in last year’s demo. I should add, though, that exploring will sometimes reward you with pickups that are often tucked out of plain sight – I won’t go so far as to call them secrets – and they’ll fill out your dossier and shed a little bit more light on this broken world, or give you an upgrade. I wouldn’t go so far as to say that Replaced is going to have replayability, per se, but if the developers do an awesome enough job at building out the backstory of Phoenix City, that might deliver enough motivation to want to go back and find all of the hidden bits of information. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Replaces is packing a proper Batman: Arkham combat system. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This year’s demo – again, since it was the very beginning of the game – also didn’t show off the biggest pleasant surprise from my initial hands-on with it last year: the RPG hiding under its 2.5D cyberpunk aesthetic. From the first couple of extremely impressive trailers, I’d thought that Replaced was “just” a side-scrolling action-adventure game. But no, it’s got sections packed with quest-giving NPCs and the ability to free-roam the area. I absolutely can’t wait to dig into more of this.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But getting back to this newest slice of Replaced, I should take a moment to compliment the music. A moody synth soundtrack is key to nailing the vibe in any dystopian cyberpunk piece of media, and Replaced wastes no time confirming it understands the assignment in that department. And I’d actually like to get back to the visual identity of this game for a second as well. The pixel art, as you can already tell, is phenomenal, and the use of color and lighting is top-shelf, but I’d also like to shout out the animation. I’m not sure if this will make sense, but in attempting a retro look complemented by modern visual touches like in Replaced, there is such a thing as the animation being too good. I would argue that the development team at Sad Cat Studios has struck a perfect balance here. Neither R.E.A.C.H. nor his enemies move too smoothly. Instead, they have a slightly stilted movement to them, which only adds to the broken, beat-down spirit of Phoenix City, and it sells the neo-16-bit look even more perfectly, in my eyes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I reached the end of the demo build of Replaced, all I wanted was to play more. It is simply a captivating game from top to bottom, and I can’t wait to see where R.E.A.C.H.’s story goes as well as what the deeper plot reveals. I’m also eager to find out how much deeper the combat and RPG elements specifically go. I’d love nothing more than for my Spidey Sense to prove correct and for Replaced to be one of the best and most memorable games of 2026 (even if we already know that Grand Theft Auto 6 will dominate the headlines). We don’t have a release date for Replaced quite yet, but I get the sense that it’s close. Hopefully we’ll soon find out exactly when we can see just how special the final game is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

                <p dir="ltr">When I watch a great pro match of a fighting game like Marvel vs. Capcom 2 or Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, my reaction is equal parts awe and bafflement. The sheer speed and hyper-kinetic action flies by so quickly that I can only make sense of a percentage of what I'm seeing, and the people who have mastered the chaos must be a different species. Kirby Air Riders is like that: a bubblegum colorful confection of speed, agility, and action that feels overwhelming, but still fun to play.</p><p dir="ltr">My hands-on experience at Gamescom started with some tutorials showing the ropes of handling your ride. The ride accelerates automatically, which may seem like it suggests simplicity, but there's still a lot of finesse and fine control to handling your ride. Nailing a drift around a corner takes precise timing, and when you take a jump you can get a speed boost with a clean landing--which means tilting your racer slightly to land parallel if you're coming up on a hill. Those mechanics felt approachable and easy to grasp during the limited time of a demo, but had enough depth that the skill ceiling looks high.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Kirby Air Riders Is Faster, Deeper, and Cleaner Than The Original</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This is a sequel to Kirby's Air Ride, but the shift to Air <em>Riders</em> is a significant one. There's a particular emphasis on the characters themselves and their unique powers, and this is where I could most keenly sense Masahiro Sakurai's experience with the Smash Bros. series. It feels like an evolution of that, and bringing that spirit of balancing different power sets into a new racing context.</p><p dir="ltr">After the tutorial featured, I played as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-character-in-kirby-air-riders/2900-6901/" data-ref-id="2900-6901">two different characters</a>: Magalor, the antagonist of Kirby's Return to Dreamland; and Starman, a recurring Kirby enemy. The riders seem to handle slightly differently, but the major difference is their special moves. Magalor activates a massive beam that shoots behind him, hitting any opponents that are coming up on your tail. By contrast, Starman's special was not an offensive tool at all. Instead, he could fly into the air on command using your regular spin attack while the special was activated. This seems primarily suited to help reach high places, though in a pinch you could also use it to dodge, at the expense of some speed.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo mostly focused on the City Trials mode, which is separated into two parts. First you explore the wide-open hub area gathering power-ups and switching your weak starter vehicle for a better one. There's a layer of strategy here, as various icons that you collect give you increased defense, weight, boost, and so on. You can use these to compensate for any of your racer's weaknesses, or make a naturally strong aspect even stronger. Once the first phase is over, everyone's total power-ups get tallied up and your build gets taken into the second phase. I could imagine that, as players grow more familiar with the game, serious competitive players will start to optimize combinations of racers and air rides with which types of icons they should prioritize for collection.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

dir="ltr">The build you craft during this first phase has a huge bearing on how competitive you'll be in the second one. Once all the players tally up their powers, they're able to choose one of four game types, and the game will recommend one that's optimized for your build. Some are more combat-focused while others are centered more on racing. I chose the recommended mode in my first game, a combat/racing fusion with Magalor and held my own decently well. For my second game, I picked one of the modes that was not recommended (mainly in order to stay grouped with the other human players in our closed session) and my unoptimized build showed on the almost pure racing track. Plus, Starman's vertical-focused power just isn't the best for a regular race around an oval track, but maybe I just need to get good.</p><p dir="ltr">Both phases feel extremely fast, so while one is about prepping a build, they both reward skilled play. And it's easy to see, even from my limited experience, how choosing your rider, finding your ride, and gathering power-ups could lead to a fierce Kirby Air Riders meta, as advanced Air Riders players explore different options to optimize their competitive edge.</p><p dir="ltr">For casual players like myself, Kirby Air Riders looks to be a sweet experience to play with friends, especially in couch co-op, fueling a rowdy party atmosphere. But I suspect that there's going to be a whole other layer of the game, with the speed and skill of a fighting game, and that one seems destined for the competitive stage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a tough time for new video game IPs. According to a new report, Wildgate, the new online PvP game from developer Dreamhaven, has struggled with sales since it’s release.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-22/blizzard-co-founder-s-game-startup-struggles-amid-industry-glut?srnd=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Cecilia D’Anastasio</a> reports that Wildgate has <strong>sold just 130,000 units</strong> in its first month plus. The data, which comes from a letter Dreamhaven co-founder Michael Morhaime sent to staff.</p>



<p>The Blizzard co-founder said that despite positive reviews from critics, the game performed below commercial expectations. It wasn’t just Wildgate that struggled, either. Dreamhaven’s other game, Sunderfolk, has sold just 62,000 copies since it released in April. Because of the struggles, he said, the company is looking for new financing. </p>



<p><strong>“Our monthly expenses are outpacing revenue,” </strong>Morhaime said in the letter, adding that Dreamhaven’s focus is to now <strong>“urgently”</strong> reduce costs. </p>



<p>He added that he is<strong> “committed”</strong> to making sure the studio survives its current financial turmoil.</p>



<p>Wildgate is currently available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. Through August 28, the game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504780/Wildgate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on sale on Steam</a> for under $20. In our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/preview-wildgate-could-be-the-multiplayer-game-of-the-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview of the game earlier this year</a>, we said that Wildgate showed potential for being the multiplayer game of the year. The main concern, however, was getting players to buy in and keep them engaged with the game. Based on the current state of things, it appears that concern remains.</p>



<p>What do you think the future holds for Wildgate and developer Dreamhaven? Let us know down below, and join this discussion and more in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

                <p>Team Cherry's Hollow Knight sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, is finally releasing on September 4 after years of development and fears from the community that the game may never see the light of day. But Silksong is real, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/" data-ref-id="1100-6534147">we've played it</a>, and the upcoming launch is looming so large that multiple game studios have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/" data-ref-id="1100-6534203">delayed their upcoming projects to get out of the way</a>. But why did Silksong take so long to make?</p><p>Team Cherry founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen said Silksong was not stuck in development hell or anything like that. The enormous success of the 2017 game--it's sold more than 15 million copies--allowed the Australia-based developers to develop the follow-up at their own pace.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hollow Knight: Silksong - Official Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"It was never stuck or anything," Gibson told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. "It was always progressing. It's just the case that we're a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn't any big controversial moment behind it."</p><p>Silksong was originally envisioned as an expansion to Hollow Knight, but it became a big enough project to shift to a full, standalone release. That's one of the reasons why it didn't come out sooner.</p><p>As for why Team Cherry went quiet and didn't discuss development updates with fans over the years, Gibson said the team opted not to because, "All we could really say is, 'We're still working on it.'"</p><p>Pellen added: "Instead of popping up and bugging people for the sake of it, it felt like our actual responsibility was just to work on the game."</p><p>At one point, Silksong was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/12/22175400/hollow-knight-silksong-sequel-xbox-game-pass-trailer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">officially scheduled to launch before June 2023</a>, and Pellen said the team did "genuinely believe" the game would make it out then. But that didn't happen, of course.</p><p>The wait could have been even longer. Gibson said Team Cherry has a development structure that allows its members to "see results fasts," with ideas turning into real elements of the game "almost immediately." That was a fun way to work, Gibson said, but it also presented challenges.</p><p>"I remember at some point I just had to stop sketching," Gibson said. "Because I went, 'Everything I'm drawing here has to end up in the game. That's a cool idea, that's in. That's a cool idea, tha'ts in.' You realize, 'If I don't stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.'"</p><p>Silksong will release on September 4 for console and PC, and <a href="https://google.com/search?q=silksong+game+pass+gamespot&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=silksong+game+pass+gamespot&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRhAMgYIAhBFGDwyBggDEEUYPNIBCDMzNDZqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you'll be able to play it at launch via Game Pass. </a></p><p>"Hollow Knight: Silksong appears to be exactly what we all should have expected: a strong, well-designed, visually lovely game that carries forward the aesthetic and design philosophies of the original with thoughtful, if not earth-shattering, updates," Steve Watts wrote after going <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/">hands-on with Silksong at Gamescom this week</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Remember that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/across-the-spider-verse-spider-man-lego-teen-animate-14-1850506788"><span>scene in </span><i><span>Spider-Man</span></i><span>: </span><i><span>Across the Spider-Verse</span></i></a> <span>that showed a Lego version of Peter Parker living his best blocky life? If you didn’t know, that segment was animated entirely by then 14-year-old animator Preston Mutanga, who caught the filmmaker’s attention after he recreated the movie’s first trailer in the style of a Lego movie. It’s been two years, and the now 16-year-old Mutanga is still hard at work building scenes and trailers from Lego blocks. His recent projects include making the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaY7pJbYDy8"><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl_VFCX_iaM"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i></a><span> trailers look like something right out of a kid’s toy box, but it’s his latest incredible videos that have really caught my eye: faithful remakes of scenes from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span>, done in such spectacular fashion that they could have been an official collaboration between Sony, Netflix, and Lego.</span></p> <p><span>Mutanga has uploaded two videos featuring the Lego versions of Huntr/x to his TikTok account. One is a snippet of one of the coolest parts of the movie’s first musical number, “How It’s Done,” which shows the group skydiving down onto a blocky version of Seoul and kicking some demon booty on the way down.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>The second is less action-packed but longer, and lets Mutanga add a cute nod to his </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>roots. It’s a scene, maybe a third of the way into the movie, after the demonic Saja Boys boy band has started getting their flirty, sexy demon claws into the hearts and minds of the world. They’ve weakened the Honmoon barrier between the real and demon worlds, and the girls are trying to figure out what to do while maintaining their Kpop girl group cover. Their manager, Bobby, comes in to give them an update on their rivals’ newfound virality, and as he scrolls through videos of the Boys’ fans dancing to their hit song “Soda Pop,” a familiar webslinger briefly appears on his phone.</span></p>   <p><span>Mutanga’s incredible work speaks for itself, but I will say I sure hope someone over at Lego or Sony is ready to give this kid a job when he’s of age.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE: Hell Let Loose Isn’t Going to The Pacific Theatre Anytime Soon]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hell-let-loose-pacific-theatre/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-hell-let-loose-isn%E2%80%99t-going-to-the-pacific-theatre-anytime-soon.1278600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Following the announcement of Hell Let Loose: Vietnam, I had the opportunity to get <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hell-let-loose-vietnam-hands-on-preview-jungle-warfare-has-never-been-this-immersive-in-a-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on with the game for the very first time </a>and quiz the developers on the decision as to why they haven’t yet gone to the Pacific Theatre with the original game.</p>



<p>The Pacific Theatre, in my view, has been a highly requested setting by the community for a while now, but for whatever reason, the developers have yet to bring it to life. So, quite jokingly, and before I got hands-on with Vietnam, I quizzed the developers as to why the Pacific Theatre isn’t a direction they’ve yet gone in.</p>



<p>I was told that, for the most part, the idea of Hell Let Loose going to Vietnam as a separate title in the franchise has been a plan for some years. For those unaware, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will be developed in tandem with the original game, with no resources being moved away from the original. So if you’re a fan of the original game, it will continue to be developed at the same rate it is currently, with new content.</p>



<p>It was said that around 80 developers are currently working on Hell Let Loose: Vietnam, with around 30 developers on the original. However, in terms of resource allocation, I was told that some developers are working on both games, and these numbers will fluctuate based on the individual game’s requirements at any given time. </p>



<h2 id="h-hell-let-loose-pacific">Hell Let Loose: Pacific?</h2>



<p>Following my hands-on with Hell Let Loose: Vietnam, I circled back to the Pacific Theatre with the developers, where I was told that Hell Let Loose going to the Pacific Theatre isn’t out of the question, but what would that look like?</p>



<p>It was explained that although taking Hell Let Loose to the Pacific Theatre is something that the team would want to take the franchise to, it would likely mean a whole new game, instead of just adding a few maps into the original.</p>



<p>The explanation continued by highlighting that the Pacific Theatre is characterized by large naval battles involving carriers, planes, the Bushido code, and so on. It was noted that it presents an entirely different atmosphere compared to fairly grounded fighting in Europe and Russia, where the foundations of Hell Let Loose were laid.</p>



<p>So similar to Hell Let Loose: Vietnam, it was heavily implied to me that a Pacific Theatre entry would likely require a new game entirely, offering players new ways to play while continuing the expansion of the Hell Let Loose franchise. Transparently, I was also told that taking even the original Hell Let Loose to the Pacific Theatre with even just a few new maps, weapons, and factions would be very resource heavy, and that it would probably make a lot more sense to build an entirely new experience from the ground up, similar to what they have done with Vietnam.</p>



<p>But ultimately, I was told that it all depends on what the community wants.</p>



<p>So, who knows, maybe in 4-5 years, a highly immersive Hell Let Loose: Pacific Theatre title is something we can all look forward to playing – If players want it! </p>



<p>Would you like to see the series take that direction after the release of Hell Let Loose: Vietnam? Let me know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 might be the most talked-about game in the world, but that doesn’t stop Grand Theft Auto <strong>5 </strong>from still being extremely relevant. It remains one of the best-selling games right now, even though we’re a mere nine months (mere?) away from the launch of GTA 6, in May 2026.</p>



<p>At Gamescom, I was fortunate to run into GTA 5’s Ned Luke (Michael de Santa) and Shawn ‘Solo’ Fonteno (Franklin Clinton), and I took the opportunity to ask them about their expectations and excitement for Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-i-wanna-play-it-i-wanna-livestream-it">‘I Wanna Play It, I Wanna Livestream It!’</h2>



<p>Ned Luke and Shawn Fonteno were at Gamescom to promote the new ROG Xbox Ally as part of an ongoing partnership with Asus. The pair wasted no time revealing their handheld gaming devices to me and walking me through some of the key features before we took a dive into the world of Grand Theft Auto.</p>



<p>As Ned was hot off a popular stream of Grand Theft Auto 5 and had been vocal about the GTA 6 trailer, I was eager to ask him what he was most looking forward to:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m just excited <strong>for the game</strong>. I want to play. I want to play it, I want to <em>livestream </em>it, I want to enjoy it just like everybody enjoyed our game.</p>



<p>It’s going to be awesome.</p>



<p>You know, apart from the jiggle physics, which are going to be great, because of the <strong>big asses</strong>—Solo’s going to love it because he loves those big asses!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The mic was then passed to Fonteno:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s Miami, baby! You know what I’m saying?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the same interview, the pair let me know that Young Maylay, recognizable as the voice of Carl Johnson in 2006’s GTA San Andreas, is now touring conventions with them and meeting fans, and he’s loving every second.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>I tried to get a little information from Ned and Shawn about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-actors-gta-5-leads-advice-get-ready-for-it/">the lead actors in GTA 6</a>, but they remained tight-lipped. I had to try!</p>



<p>It might have been more than 12 years since Grand Theft Auto 5 was released, but these guys are still beloved by the wider community. Let me know which GTA 5 character was your favourite on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Since May 2024, however, the studio has also been shepherding </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Rogue Prince of Persia </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">through an Steam Early Access campaign that culminated in an official launch on August 20.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, due to a variety of factors including shifting player expectations, the team had to tweak their pre-release strategy in a bid to lure in players. As a result, the studio has become more wary of early access in general.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"To be honest, the way I see it now is that unless you're coming into early access with a 90 percent complete game, don't do it. Because players, they don't see it as early access, they see it a game to play," says Houghton.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He adds that players are entitled to express their views because they're often paying money to play early access titles, but he feels that sifting viewpoint means consumers are less willing to follow games on an early access journey that will often result in significant changes.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/frost-giant-ceo-tim-morten-says-layoffs-are-possible-after-stormgate-underperforms" target="_self" data-discover="true">Frost Giant CEO Tim Morten says layoffs are possible after Stormgate underperforms</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eurlings echoes that point and suggests that a perceived lack of polish and content can now be a "huge issue" during early access campaigns. He explains that Evil Empire was even forced to rethink their original roadmap after the earliest versions of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rogue Prince of Persia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> failed to meet internal expectations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Initially we wanted to do quick updates. Very fast. In the end, we took a bit more time to ensure that each update would be a bit more chunky," he adds, noting that pivot resulted in a steady cadence of monthly updates that each packed a fair bit of clout. That shift came after the team conceded that early access numbers "weren't great."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Houghton explains the project initially attracted just under 1,000 peak concurrent users (CCU). After they flipped the script, the title started to pull in around 4,000 CCU.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's why we wanted to prioritize chunky content—there would be an impact every time," says Houghton, before acknowledging the title still hadn't quite met the team's CCU expectations even after that switch-up.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/newsbrief-devcom-to-rebrand-as-gamescom-dev" target="_self" data-discover="true">Devcom to rebrand as Gamescom Dev</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Of course you listen to the feedback and take the ideas [on board], but you have to feed them through a filter.&quot;">"Of course you listen to the feedback and take the ideas [on board], but you have to feed them through a filter."</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It underlines the risks that come with early access, and Houghton specifically wonders whether some developers who can't hit that 90 percent completion benchmark before launching into early access might instead be better off conducting beta tests through Steam instead.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're curious as to where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rogue Prince of Persia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was when it entered Early Access, Houghton suggests the project was roughly 60 percent complete. Eurlings, was slightly more conservative, and claimed it was more like 50 percent. We suggested they meet in the middle.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Steam has evolved now. You can do beta tests and playtests through Steam. I think that's become more like Early Access. People aren't paying for it and your project might be a bit janky [...] but that's okay because they're still going to give feedback and it's not going to be a disaster if it's not great yet," continues Houghton.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;When asked whether Evil Empire would consider revisiting Early Access in the future, Houghton isn't so certain.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I don't know. I'm going to be honest. I've been put off by it, because especially now people are so used to games coming out and then doing live ops for three, four, and five years—so why go with early access and have to deal with the stigma that's around it?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-pitchford-nervous-challenge-borderlands-4/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-randy-pitchford-admits-he%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98a-little-nervous%E2%80%99-about-the-more-challenging-parts-of-borderlands-4.1278552/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Borderlands 4 boasts the biggest evolution of the series thus far. It’s the most ambitious game the team at Gearbox has ever created, boasting a seamless open-world map, numerous hours of exploration-based opportunities, and a core gameplay loop that facilitates endless playstyles.</p>



<p>I caught up with Randy Pitchford, Gearbox CEO, at Gamescom, and took a deep dive into the changes that will help to differentiate Borderlands 4 from Borderlands 3. He wasn’t afraid to admit he’s nervous about one key change that will alter the game’s difficulty rating.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-borderlands-4-hard">Is Borderlands 4 Hard?</h2>



<p>I played Borderlands 4 for an hour at Gamescom and can confirm that it’s not <strong>super tough</strong>. I <em>was </em>playing on a lower difficulty level, so it’s tough to give an accurate representation of how the game will feel when you’re playing with more users to push the challenges up and running the game at a higher difficulty grade.</p>



<p>Going into my interview with Randy Pitchford, I knew that the team at Gearbox had designed some of the toughest bosses in franchise history. I was curious why and how that challenge would be felt by even the most die-hard veterans of the series.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We have lots of players that actually aren’t interested in deep, hard challenges; lots of people that love just exploring the Borderlands or spending time with the characters.</p>



<p><strong>I’m a little nervous because there are points of Borderlands 4 that are more challenging</strong>, but one of the coolest things about Borderlands 4, because of the nature of the RPG, is if anything is a little challenging for you, you can just grind somewhere and level up and become more powerful.</p>



<p>You will find that things that were hard when you were a little chump will become trivial when you become a badass.</p>



<p>But we definitely have pushed the challenges quite a lot, especially with bosses and boss fight mechanics.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans of the series will recognize this gameplay mechanic. If you can’t defeat an enemy, go away and level up, and you’ll do much better on your successive pass at that boss or objective.</p>



<p>In my exclusive Gamescom demo, I got to control Harlowe, one of the game’s more technical Vault Hunters, and I faced off against a fairly challenging boss, a ‘Spy Master’ of the game’s ‘Timekeeper’ big bad. It was innovative, enjoyable, and satisfying, even considering my hatred for intense challenges.</p>

                <p>The Borderlands series is well known for many things, including its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-co-op-aims-to-be-as-seamless-as-possible/1100-6533964/" data-ref-id="1100-6533964">emphasis on co-op</a>, unique visual style, and humor, but it is also quite famous for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-all-vault-hunters-classes-skills/2900-6583/" data-ref-id="2900-6583">distinct player characters</a>, who often use advanced tech or psychic superpowers to lay waste to enemies. Harlowe, one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a>'s new playable characters, is no different, and Gearbox has finally provided some insight into how they play.</p><p>Harlowe has <em>a bunch </em>of toys at their disposal considering their past as a combat scientist for Maliwan, one of the Borderlands universe's weapons manufacturers. They seem to be particularly great at using this high-tech weaponry for crowd control, often debuffing or straight up incapacitating enemies to create advantages for themself and their team.</p><p>For example, one of Harlowe's main abilities is the Chroma Accelerator, which fires an unstable ball of energy that  drifts forward and plows through crowds, all the while dealing cryo damage to anyone it floats past. Harlowe players can also detonate it an anytime to deal radiation damage or seemingly wait for it to burst on impact. This skill can be further upgraded to bounce haphazardly between enemies, store damage overtime to be dealt when it eventually explodes, and it can even be given a greater gravitational pull.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDrYNvTaFHs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EDrYNvTaFHs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Harlowe can also throw out a flux generator that emits an freezing energy field, and enemies that are caught in it are also entangled. This means that other enemies with the same debuff share weapon and skill damage dealt to them, like a chain effect. Additionally, it can gain a slew of new properties, including a greater radius, secondary area-of-effect triggers, and can even be used to simultaneously buff teammates and debuff enemies.</p><p>Harlowe's flashiest tool appears to be their Zero-Point ability, which suspends enemies in mid-air via a colorful, high-tech bubble. They can fire upon enemies trapped in them, but they can also press the action skill button again to slam these foes in whatever direction Harlowe is facing, which sounds like something I may never tire of. It can also be upgraded to provide healing to Harlowe or their teammates, attract ricocheting bullets to suspended enemies, or create a singularity and subsequent cryo explosion upon slamming an opponent in a bubble.</p><p>If you want to start planning your Harlowe builds, there is already a <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/game-info/vault-hunters/harlowe/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preview of their skill trees</a> available, but you also won't have to wait too long to play the game for yourself. After all, Borderlands 4 is releasing on September 12 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with a Switch 2 port coming about a month later on October 3.</p>

			<p>If you were unaware, <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/gamescom-award">Gamescom</a> has its own set of awards given out at the annual event that are voted on by members of an independent jury, with the purpose of the awards being "<em>to honor outstanding games, extensions, exhibitors, booths, merch, as well as announcements and trailers</em>," per the <a href="https://media.koelnmesse.io/gamescom/redaktionell/gamescom/downloads/pdf/gamescom-award/regulations.pdf">awards regulations</a>. For <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, there was a clear winner, with Capcom and Resident Evil Requiem hogging the spotlight and being one of three games to take home multiple awards.  </p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem took home wins for Best Visuals, Best Audio, the Most Epic Game, and the Best Sony PlayStation Game at this year's show. The only other titles to grab multiple awards were Hela, an indie game that won Most Entertaining and Most Wholesome, and Anno 117: Pax Romana, which won Best PC Game and Best Booth, though technically that last one goes to Ubisoft for the Anno 117: Pax Romana booth.</p>



<p>The other notable win in this year's awards was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-gamescom/">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> taking home the prize for Best Trailer, which was one of the few awards not voted on by the pre-selected jury, but by the general public.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In January, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337860/intel-brought-a-big-honking-stereo-3d-handheld-gaming-pc-to-ces-2025">one of the wildest Intel prototypes I witnessed at CES</a> was a giant handheld gaming PC with an 11-inch autostereoscopic (read: glasses-free) 3D screen, detachable controllers, an Intel Lunar Lake chip, and a dedicated toggle to switch between 2D and 3D modes.</p><p>Co-developed by Intel and Tencent Games, it was called the Sunday Dragon 3D One and <a href="https://www.ithome.com/0/813/251.htm">dubbed an experimental product</a>. But now, Abxylute, the company best known for kickstarting <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/abxylute/abxylute-cloud-gaming-handheld-console">a $199 cloud gaming handheld</a>, tells <em>The Verge</em> that it will actually sell this massive Windows handheld as the <a href="https://abxylute.com/products/abxylute-3d-one">Abxylute 3D One</a>.</p><p>It should go on sale in late September or early October for a price under $1,700, marketing head Eunice Lu tells me.</p><p>Abxylute largely seems to be whitelabeling the product. The company’s photos look like the one I saw at CES, up to and including the model name “Sunday Dragon 3D One” printed on the back, though Lu tells me final units won’t have that branding. The company’s also upfront that it will come with Tencent’s eye-tracking 3D display, co-developed with partners Intel and display maker BOE.</p><p>It should even have a Tencent app that claims to add 3D depth to your 2D photos, videos, and games, using a real-time interleaving algorithm, though you won’t always need to rely on that: Abxylute claims the product’s specifically optimized to deliver 3D for 50 of the top Steam games, including <em>Black Myth: Wukong, Naraka Bladepoint </em>and<em> Hogwarts Legacy</em>.</p><p>One important difference since CES: it has new twin touchpads on each of its detachable grips! Those grips also have magnetic drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks and triggers.</p><p>Like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338654/i-finally-touched-the-msi-claw-8-ai-plus">MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</a> that I’m currently reviewing (which recently got a graphics driver update that gives it competitive performance with other top Windows handhelds), it’ll feature Intel’s Core Ultra 258V chip and 32GB of LPDDR5X memory, powering a 120Hz 16:10 screen.</p><p>Unlike MSI’s 8-inch handheld, however, this is a huge 3-in-1 convertible: its 10.95-inch 2560 x 1600 display can lean back on a kickstand as you detach the controllers, or plug into a magnetic keyboard folio, when you’re not holding up its entire 2.45 pounds (1.11kg) between your two hands. And yet it only houses a 50 watt-hour battery, smaller than the Claw 8 or the Asus ROG Ally X. It also advertises a switchable display with 60Hz and 120Hz modes — not a variable refresh rate, which I’ve found provides smoother gameplay on handhelds like these.</p><p>Some of the screen’s specs are intentional for 3D reasons, though. Lu says “3D mode requires the display to run at 120Hz,” and it’s deliberately a large screen: “smaller panels noticeably reduce the naked-eye 3D effect, so this form factor was chosen to preserve stereoscopic quality.” Thinking back, it’s true that I’ve enjoyed glasses-free 3D screens more when they’re larger, as you can move your head more to appreciate the depth without running into a screen bezel.</p><p>Even if it’s not as portable and far pricier than the competition, I bet the Abxylute will have devotees: my colleague Antonio <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24344308/asus-rog-flow-acer-nitro-blaze-steam-deck-giant-pc-handheld-experiment">appreciates the idea of big handhelds</a> after toying with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339992/acer-nitro-blaze-11-gaming-handheld-steam-deck-size-comparison">the Acer Nitro Blaze 11</a>, a handheld the same size and shape as this!</p><p>And it’s also possible creators looking for a glasses-free 3D device will buy one with no intention of gaming: the screens can be handy to preview 3D models and artistry, though <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24036574/leia-glasses-free-3d-ces-2024">laptops and standalone screens with the tech also exist</a>.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/763957/abxylute-will-actually-sell-intel-and-tencents-gigantic-glasses-free-3d-handheld#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/763957/axbylute-will-actually-sell-intel-and-tencents-gigantic-glasses-free-3d-handheld]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-new-bubsy-game-actually-looks-awesome-seriously.1278528/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When, earlier this week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> kicked off with the reveal of a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-first-five-minutes-of-bubsy-is-all-the-bubsy-we-nee-1749075286"><em>Bubsy</em></a> game, many online, myself included, went “Oh no…” as we shook our collective heads. But despite the last few <em>Bubsy</em> games being bad, it seems this new one,<em> Bubsy 4D</em>, might actually be…good? In fact, it might even be awesome. Really. Seriously.</p> <p>Back in the early ’90s, Bubsy starred in a handful of fairly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubsy#History">well-received 2D platformers</a>. But then in 1996, the <em>Bubsy</em> series made the leap to 3D, and everything went south. People hated <em>Bubsy 3D</em> and to this day, it is still called one of the worst platformers ever made. Then, in the last decade, we started getting new <em>Bubsy</em> games. They were also bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/PecXsy5-0yw"><em>Really</em> bad.</a> But now, a few years after Atari bought the franchise, <em>Bubsy 4D</em> is here, and it just might turn things around for the hopping feline.</p> <p><em>Bubsy 4D</em> is being made by <a href="https://www.fabraz.com/">Fabraz</a>, a renowned indie studio that has made a name for itself developing fun, innovative, and colorful 3D and 2D platformers that feel amazing to play, like <em>Demon Turf</em> and <em>Slime San</em>. And since announcing the game earlier this week at Gamescom, the studio has started releasing gameplay of <em>Bubsy 4D</em>, and it looks wonderful!</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Because a lot of people were curious: Here's me playing the same Bubsy 4D level without trying speedrun it. <a href="https://t.co/Xcm6mygpS8">pic.twitter.com/Xcm6mygpS8</a></p> <p>— Fabraz: Demon Tides ➡️ Gamescom (@Fabrazz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fabrazz/status/1958646093031366982?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>In new gameplay shared from the Gamescom demo, we can see <em>Bubsy 4D</em> in action, and the game looks vibrant and slick. Movement and jumping look snappy, but there’s some weight to Bubsy, so it’s not too floaty. I’m also a fan of<a href="https://x.com/Fabrazz/status/1958190420598366399"> Bubsy’s personality in the videos released so far, too</a>. Another wild fact about this new <em>Bubsy</em> game: It contains fully voiced, 3D animated cutscenes.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fun fact, Bubsy 4D has fully voiced cutscenes cus' why not! <a href="https://t.co/DrL6A75f9x">pic.twitter.com/DrL6A75f9x</a></p> <p>— Fabraz: Demon Tides ➡️ Gamescom (@Fabrazz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fabrazz/status/1958456027675795909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I can’t believe I’m saying this in the year of our lord 2025, but I’m very excited about a <em>Bubsy</em> game. Everything I’ve seen of Fabraz’s<em> Bubsy 4D</em> looks incredible. And people who have played the demo at Gamescom seem positive about how it plays and feels, which is only making me more excited for this sequel. <a href="https://x.com/Fabrazz/status/1958916894548803679">There’s also an outfit that blurs Bubsy’s private parts</a> and is a reference to Sonic. <a href="https://x.com/Fat_Bard/status/1958938923507306765">Even the game’s music sounds great!</a> So yeah, I want to play<em> Bubsy 4D</em> right now. But I can’t. Which makes me very sad. Damn you, Bubsy!</p> <p><em>Bubsy 4D</em> is set to launch on consoles and PC… eventually. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3237970/Bubsy_4D/">You can wishlist it now on Steam.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nvidia graphics cards are getting a bit cheaper in Europe as the company has lowered the prices of a number of RTX 50-series GPUs.</p>



<p>Cut by nearly 10% in some cases, the RTX 5090, RTX 5080, and RTX 5070 have seen their prices drop across the region. The move comes as the Euro contains to strengthen against the United States (US) dollar.</p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-cuts-geforce-rtx-50-prices-in-europe-as-eur-strengthens-against-us-dollar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>, the top-end Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 is retailing for €2,099, a 9.88% drop from the launch price of €2,329.

<p>While the prices are lower in Europe, there’s been no sign that the US will see anything similar any time soon. Due to the state of global economics, companies are looking at ways they can continue to sell products while generating revenue. In this instance, it’s more of a case of adjusting for the aforementioned strength of the Euro against the US dollar than anything else.</p>

<p>The Division 2 has revealed its Year 7 roadmap for 2025 and beyond at Gamescom. Furthermore, the next season of the title is only a few weeks away.</p>



<p>Developed by Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment, The Division 2 has been going steadily since its release in 2019. Taking over for the original, the game has expanded its boundaries, both in locations like Washington, DC and in modes like the roguelike Descent. Now, the future of the multiplayer shooter has been laid out, thanks to a new update from Gamescom.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Starting off the new content for Year 7 of The Division 2 is The Pact, a new season launching September 9th, 2025. We get a glimpse of what it will be like in the trailer above. As per <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/4235uGIN3QkbDq4iNQVlT1/the-division-2-at-gamescom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a> on The Division 2’s website, The Pact focuses on the enemy factions, which have joined up. New to the season is Retaliation, a permanent open-world activity that adds Control Points mechanics.</p>



<p>After The Pact, the next season, titled Mutiny, will launch later this year. It plans on adding new modifiers, as well as a new companion mechanic. While details are scarce about Mutiny, the team promises that fans will hear more in the coming months. In the roadmap, there is mention of the franchise’s tenth-year anniversary, so there’s many reasons to look forward to that, whether it be The Division 3 or bigger expansions.</p>



<p>What do you think of the upcoming roadmap for The Division 2? Will you be joining in on The Pact and Mutiny? Let us know in the comments and on the forums!</p>

While this could just be a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wizards-of-the-coast-says-no-truth-to-rumors-that-magic-the-gatherings-spider-man-crossover-will-only-get-one-print-run">fairly limited preorder allocation</a> and more will come later, we’ve been seeing some eye-wateringly gigantic markups on the secondary market in the build-up to launch (September 26).</p><div catalogid="5f900a08-75a3-42a4-b812-6847123c4fb5" id="216020"><div id="216020" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Marvel's Spider-Man - Collector Booster Box (12 Packs)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, just a single Collector Booster is listed at a "Market Price" of <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OPZ4?object_uuid=6a3833de-741e-47e5-ad20-b1077e9febcc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$88 at the trusted resale site TCGPlayer</a>. <strong>This </strong><em><strong>only </strong></em><strong>contains 15 cards. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Play Booster Boxes (including 12 packs) aren't much better, <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xq05?object_uuid=6a3833de-741e-47e5-ad20-b1077e9febcc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reaching close to $1000</a> on the resale market right now, so buying in bulk isn’t exactly economical either. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So, what's the big deal, and why are Spider-Man Collector Boosters flipping for so much already?</strong> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a mix of a few factors. Collector packs are supposedly a shortcut to the coolest, most valuable cards in a set. 11 to 13 of them are Traditional Foil cards, but there are still 5 commons, 4 uncommons, and 5 rare or higher, with a ‘Headliner Mythic’ in around 1% of boosters.</p></div><div catalogid="5f900a08-75a3-42a4-b812-6847123c4fb5" id="216021"><div id="216021" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Marvel's Spider-Man - Collector Booster (1 Pack of 15 Cards)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With cards like the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAnMY?object_uuid=6a3833de-741e-47e5-ad20-b1077e9febcc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">borderless Soul Stone already sitting at around $475 resale</a>, there’s no shortage of chase cards in the Spider-Man MTG crossover, though prices will likely shift once the Universes Beyond set fully lands. The catch is most of those big pulls will generally be locked behind Collector Boosters, which, as we have discussed, aren’t exactly cheap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combine that with Magic riding an all-time high after Final Fantasy and Edge of Eternities, the hype of its first major Marvel crossover starring Spider-Man, and demand easily outpacing supply, and those boosters might as well be worth their weight in cardboard… or gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But just like the Collector Boosters, every other preorder for the upcoming Spidey set is sold out. That includes the Gift Bundle, Booster Bundle, Scene Box, and Prerelease Pack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want those before launch, your best bet is still the secondary market at trusted resale sites like, as we've mentioned, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObml7?object_uuid=6a3833de-741e-47e5-ad20-b1077e9febcc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGPlayer</a>.

      </div>
<p>"We are always thinking about what we could do for the Metal Gear series," added producer Noriaki Okamura. "But in regards to remaking future titles, currently we're just focusing on the now, and we thought what would be the best way to reach both the old fans and potential new fans as well."</p><p>The most in-demand candidate for a remake may be Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, which has been locked in on PS3 for 17 years.

<p>Maximum Entertainment and Little Sewing Machine have announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bye_sweet_carole">Bye Sweet Carole</a>, a horror game inspired by Don Bluth and animated Disney movies, is launching on Switch on <strong>9th October 2025</strong>, just in time for Halloween.</p>
<p>The date was announced yesterday via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPc5ya2f_Y0">IGN Live Showcase</a>, with Maximum Entertainment sharing the trailer earlier today.</p>
<p>Taking place in the early 1900s in Britain against the backdrop of the women's suffrage movement, Bye Sweet Carole follows Lana Benton as she searched for her missing best friend, Carole Simmons. This takes her to Bunny Hall orphanage, a place that hiding a dark truth.</p>
<p>And part of that mystery takes her to a Wonderland-esque world, the kingdom of Crolla, that is under the control of Mr Kyn, a terrifying figure, and a group of ravenous rabbits. Will she find Carole? And will Lana make it home with her friend safely?</p>
<p>Lana won't be alone, though — she makes friends with a shape-shifting creature called Mr Baesie, and certain sections of the game have you controlling him. Lana herself can also change into a bunny rabbit, because of course — they do like their bunnies here.</p>


<p>Ahead of the game's release date announcement, we got to chat with Bye Sweet Carole's director, Chris Darril, best known as the creator of the <strong>Remothered</strong> series. Keep an eye out for our interview this weekend!</p>
<p>A physical release has also been confirmed for <a href="https://x.com/MaxEnt_Retail/status/1958923256670405091">21st October in North America</a>, which will include the game, a digital OST, and a reversible cover sheet.</p>
<p>With the game dropping on Switch right around spooky season, we're looking forward to diving into this one by the fireplace. <em>Let us know if you're doing the same in the comments</em>.</p>

            <p>Did you know that the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater"> Metal Gear Solid 3</a> on PS2 had a reworked Zone of the Enders 3 prototype hidden in it? I didn't. The secret minigame in question is "Guy Savage", a barebones hack-and-slasher featuring hook swords, bestial transformations and zombie coppers. It's framed as a dream of Naked Snake's - triggered by a combination of torture and an unhelpful reference to Dracula from radio contact Para-Medic during a codec conversation before saving. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>The original Guy Savage was directed by long-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> writer Shuyo Murata. The dreamy minigame returns in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, an Unreal Engine remake which launches next week. It's a lot glossier this time, however, because the new version has been contracted out to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> studio PlatinumGames. They've gone to town on the visuals, trading the old jailhouse backdrop for a moonlit graveyard, though the spinning and gouging looks pretty much as before. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1LIylZ8VaM">a video of the PS2 version</a>, and here's some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m0fnaLwXgw">footage of the updated one</a> from Gamespot.
</p>
<p>Learning about Guy Savage gives me the heebie jeebies, somehow. Delta Snake Eater is Konami's latest bid to show that Metal Gear Solid has a future after Hideo Kojima, but it's also a fawning tribute to the guy, a careful recreation of every eccentric flourish that took root under his eye, whether it truly came from Kojima or no.
</p>
<p>As I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/does-metal-gear-solid-need-a-new-kojima-konami-have-many-people-in-mind-but-its-difficult">attempted to articulate last August</a>, Delta Snake Eater feels stranger than the average blockbuster remake project because Kojima has built up a brand for bespoke designer's asides - brilliant or silly titbits born of Kojima's own proudly brandished fan obsessions, that create a feeling of closeness to the auteur, even if they were executed by one of his underlings.</p><p>Konami have extracted all those wonky fossilised organs and sent them off to be rehydrated and plumped up, then pushed them back into the game's body while grafting on new skin. In the case of the Guy Savage, the fossilised organ is also the aborted stub of <em>another</em> game, the Zone of the Enders threequel Konami cancelled in 2013. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metal-gear-solid-3s-remake-includes-a-mini-game-made-by-platinum/">Apparently</a>, Kojima wanted the minigame to be Gradius initially, but decided an original game would be better.
</p>
<p>It's just weird! Video games are weird! They are the ultimate haunted houses. This is probably the only thing I've discovered about Delta Snake Eater that seriously interests me. We'll hopefully have a review ourselves before the remake's release next week, on 28th August.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>John Cena has a brief cameo in this summer’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/superman-israel-palestine-woke-clark-kent-punk-rock-1851786212"><i><span>Superman</span></i></a><span> as Peacemaker, the foul-mouthed mercenary the wrestler-turned-actor has played since 2021’s </span><i><span>The Suicide Squad</span></i><span>. That movie was part of the old DC Comics shared universe (DCEU), so it seemed odd that Cena’s character would appear in James Gunn’s new take on Superman, considering he was, ostensibly, part of a different multiverse. Well, </span><i><span>Peacemaker</span></i><span>’s second season premiered last night, and through a reshot scene, has plucked the antihero from one universe into another without making a huge stink about it.</span></p> <p><span>In Peacemaker’s first season finale, Cena’s character met up with the Justice League from the previous film universe, including Jason Momoa’s Aquaman and Ezra Miller’s Flash. The rest of the team was mostly obscured in shadows and only seen as silhouettes, but Momoa and Miller’s presence makes it clear they’re likely accompanied by Henry Cavill’s version of Superman, who portrayed the superhero from 2013 to 2023. This ties Peacemaker to the old continuity, which again complicates Cena’s appearance in </span><i><span>Superman</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Season two’s premiere episode, “The Ties That Grind,” addresses this with an opening sequence called “Previously in the DCU,” which recaps the previous season with one major change. Rather than calling the Justice League for help as he did in the finale, this section is reshot and redubbed to instead show the Justice Gang featured in </span><i><span>Superman</span></i><span> arriving on the scene. Nathan Fillion and Isabela Merced reprise their roles as Guy Gardner and Hawkgirl, while silhouettes of Superman, Supergirl, and Mister Terrific are also shown but obscured in shadow, like in the original scene.</span></p>

Normies don’t care about all this canon stuff so intimately.”</span></p> <p><span>“It doesn’t matter if it’s not completely consistent in the past. So I thought the simple way was really the best, which is just saying, yeah, this world is a little different. We know there’s universes, and this is the universe in which everything was exactly the same as Season 1, except for the Justice League.”</span></p> <p><span>Some fans might be annoyed at the handwavey nature of this change, but it’s probably a good thing </span><i><span>Peacemaker </span></i><span>didn’t have to spend a whole episode throwing its hero through the multiverse to justify him showing up in future projects. Now it can just get back to what it actually wants to do rather than wasting all those precious, costly minutes of runtime, not to mention the precious time of us viewers. New episodes of </span><i><span>Peacemaker </span></i><span>premiere on HBO Max on Thursday nights at 9 p.m. Eastern.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After years of waiting, The Division 2 is getting a survival mode called Survivors is coming in 2026. Announced at Gamescom, the team at Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment showed off some of the new mode.</p>



<p>Since its release in 2019, The Division 2 has been going strong with new updates and expansions. Earlier yesterday, the team laid out the roadmap for Year 7, with plans for two new updates. Beyond that, as revealed today, a whole new way to play will be what fans have been asking for for quite some time.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-division-2-survivors-officially-revealed-at-gamescom">The Division 2: Survivors Officially Revealed at Gamescom</h2>

<p>While a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/division-2-project-gamescom-reveal-panels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tease earlier this month</a> did hint at it, it has now been confirmed that The Division 2 will get a Survival Extraction mode. Called The Division 2: Survivors, the project is in early development with Magnus Jansén directing. However, in <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/enWR3N37m6wAbtZbV4nuA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a> on the official page of the game, executive producer Julian Gerighty released a statement, saying:</p>



<p><strong>“The Division 2: Survivors is as much your baby as it is ours, and we strive for transparency during its development,”</strong> Gerighty states. <strong>“Clear communication and community involvement are a focus as we build the new experience, and we will be closely involving you as we move forward on the development journey.”</strong></p>



<p>Concept art of the mode, including Survivors’ logo, can be found on the blog, as well. We see some familiar landmarks in Washington, DC, all dusted in snow. Given how the base game plays, it’ll be interesting to see how the mode comes out. Still, it seems like it may be far off in terms of release. However, the team sounds positive that it will live up to expectations.</p>
