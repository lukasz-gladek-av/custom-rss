            <p>"Never read the comments," is a truth much-rehearsed by senior games journalists, but I have long since levelled-up past this axiom and entered into a new world of benevolent narcissism. I <em>always</em> read the comments, for all commenters are my children. They exist to glorify and preserve me in my dotage. True, occasionally my children say things like "I think your writing and opinions are appalling, and that you deserve to be repeatedly run over by a herd of deer", but it is the nature of children to rebel.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/weve-temporarily-closed-comments-for-maintenance-but-theyll-be-back">the comments downtime during a tech transition</a> this week has been painful for me. I've missed you all! I don't have anything particular to say in this post - I just thought we could do with a place to convene after this long, strange purgatory of articles being published with no accompanying trickle or waterfall of reader insights. What have you all been up to? Any news to share? I hear there's been some kind of election somewhere. I promise you the comments outage is unrelated.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/steams-game-recording-feature-is-now-out-of-beta/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>All Steam users now have a brand new built-in system called Game Recording to take advantage of. This system allows you to create and share footage directly from Steam.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Steam’s Game Recording <a href="https://x.com/Steam/status/1853950924018118790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">introduces several features</a>, such as Background Recording, On-Demand Recording, Replay, Clip, and Share. Through Background Recording mode, players can continuously save footage on their preferred drive according to their specified duration and storage limits. On-demand recording, on the other hand, allows you to stop and start the recording process manually.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Replay allows players to jump back in time, helping them catch up on what they might have missed during their adventures. A new Recordings and Screenshots interface includes the Clips feature, allowing you to choose the specific gameplay footage you want to share. The Share feature in the same interface will enable you to share your game recordings with the world or between devices such as your PC, Steam Deck, and Mobile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, when using Steam Game Recording, a Steam Timeline is introduced, which features event markers, player-added markers, game-added markers, game mode indicators, and highlight views. These markers are great for editing and going back through the footage to find something specific. There are timeline-enhanced games that “proactively notify Steam when relevant events happen” to add game-event markers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game recording feature will also work with non-Steam titles as long as the Steam Overlay is running. However, the feature will not record your desktop; only the games you are playing will be recorded, and all footage will be stored on your hard drive. Lastly, Game Recording is Steam Deck verified so you can record on the go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Steam now shows that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-now-shows-that-you-dont-actually-own-the-game-youre-buying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you don’t own the game you are buying</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sparking-zero-tops-all-dragon-ball-games-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sparking Zero has topped all Dragon Ball games</a> on the platform. What are your thoughts on Steam’s Game Recording system?

Those paying $9.99 a month for the Premium Pass can collect all cards in 437 days, though the subscription would add up to almost $150 in this time.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/06/machamp-1730896591108.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The alternative art Machamp ex and the regular Machamp ex.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those not desperate to collect every alternate art card, identifiable by their artwork expanding beyond the normal borders to cover the entire card, can do so in just 130 days, or 87 with the Premium Pass. Developer Creatures Inc. will presumably release a new set of 200 to 300 cards every three or four months, so those playing every day should just about be able to complete one before another comes out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket, like many other free-to-play mobile games with microtransactions, floods players with dozens of packs on their first day as they complete simple quests and gain large amounts of experience. But this generosity soon dries up as the option to pay real money for packs is waved in front of players, and those not willing to spend can open one new pack just every 12 hours. The Premium Pass lets players open one extra pack a day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPCollector also provided some tips on how players can optimize their collecting, recommending that Wonder Picks only be used to collect 2 Star rarity cards. Pokémon TCG Pocket cards are classified by rarity, with the standard 226 ranging from 1 Diamond to 4 Diamond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 60 alternate art cards range from 1 Star to 3 Stars, followed by three super special gold background Crown cards. Regular alternate arts are 1 Star, ex Pokémon are 2 Star, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-date-set-for-october">the special immersive cards with fully animated artwork</a> are 3 Star.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most efficient way to collect cards is therefore only to pick out alternate art ex Pokémon in Wonder Picks, though it's far from guaranteed one will appear in the regularly rotating spots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, players should only use Pack Points to obtain the 3 Star and Crown cards. These are the points players acquire for opening regular booster packs, obtained at the rate of five per pack. Cards at 3 Star cost 1,500 points, demanding the opening of 300 packs, and Crown cards cost 2,500 points, meaning 500 packs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will obviously take a long time to get there, but TCGPCollector is essentially recommending players play the long game and not be tempted to exchange Pack Points for cheap cards they'll come across in booster packs eventually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the last recommendation implores players not to use Poké Gold to buy packs, noting that the Premium Pass and, again, a little patience, is a much better way to spend money. Spending $9.99 on a Poké Gold bundle instead of the Premium Pass, for example, would allow players to open just nine packs compared to the 30 accrued over the course of a month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the best shop bundle, which grants 690 Poké Gold for $99.99, grants just 115 packs and therefore averages out at 87 cents per pack. This is much more than the 33 cents per pack average from the Premium Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This financial logic isn't enough to stop many, many players from buying bundles of Poké Gold, of course. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">Pokémon TCG Pocket pulled in a whopping $12 million in its first four days</a>, so the simple routine of opening packs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">collecting cards</a>, building decks, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">battling others</a> is certainly enticing enough to open the purse strings of players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The digital, streamlined version of the traditional Pokémon Trading Card Game is keeping players entertained in other ways, with Creatures Inc. having already launched two events including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">one that allows players to win a Lapras ex</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players may otherwise want to keep an eye out from cards from the two decks currently dominating the Pokémon TCG Pocket meta, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">headlined by usual suspects Charizard ex and Mewtwo ex</a>.

We never confirmed it. There were some discussions of course. There was some misalignment, there was some misinformation, but at the end of the day there won’t be any Denuvo at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With that, I would like you to close the case already. Stop texting under every post we do that Denuvo is in the game, because it’s not. We never announced… we never said it will be there. As I said, a bit of a misunderstanding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That is something you should really remember, as long as Warhorse doesn’t announce anything it’s not true.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Let’s bury that thing and let’s never ever talk about it any more. What we can talk about though is the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This all stems from an apparent email sent by publisher Plaion that appeared to confirm Denuvo <em>would</em> be used in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. Clearly, though, that is not the case.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Denuvo is a controversial system used by video game developers and publishers to stem the tide of video game piracy by, they hope, pushing back the release of cracked versions of their games by sometimes weeks, maybe months, and in some cases, indefinitely. From a publisher perspective, Denuvo helps to prevent lost sales and revenue it might have received if those who pirate a video game at launch would have otherwise bought it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Denuvo is often criticized by PC gamers for potentially affecting video game performance and even reducing the life-span of solid-state drives (SSDs). Denuvo has repeatedly denied the claims. In 2021, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-resident-evil-village-cracked-performance-beats-official-code" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a> found the pirate version of Resident Evil Village actually improved performance. Capcom later patched the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, we’ve seen some developers even announce that their games won’t launch with Denuvo, much to the delight of PC gamers. In October, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-does-not-include-any-3rd-party-drm-including-denuvo">BioWare confirmed <u>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u> wouldn’t have third-party DRM of any kind</a>, including Denuvo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, it’s set to launch February 11, 2025. Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-the-first-preview">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 – The First Preview</a> for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Valve has announced that Steam Game Recording has been released for all PC and Steam Deck users. The new built-in system for game recording offers a variety of tools for users, allowing them to capture highlights of their gameplay, record lengthy play sessions, and share them online through the Steam overlay.</p><p>Similar to Nvidia's GeForce Experience, Steam Game Recording has a background-recording mode. This can be fine-tuned to continually record footage while you play according to a specified duration and storage limits. The recording software also offers a quick-replay function so you can see where you went wrong in a game, as well as tools to make it easy to find and clip your gameplay footage. Gameplay will be recorded in an MPEG-4 format, in a folder designated by the user.</p><p>This could be especially interesting for users, as you'll be able to drop markers as reference points and Steam has provided tools for developers to create "timeline-enhanced" games that can proactively notify Steam when relevant events happen. "These events are represented along the timeline with details specified by developers," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/gamerecording" rel="nofollow ">Steam explained</a>.</p><p>The timeline-enhanced feature could be where Steam stands out from other game-recording options, as Nvidia and Windows don't offer a function like this within their respective applications. Valve says that Steam Game Recording has been designed to use minimal computer resources, as it uses your Nvidia or AMD graphics cards to help with the recording workload.</p><h2>How to enable Steam Game Recording</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4395338-steam-recording.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4395338" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4395338-steam-recording.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4395338"></a><figcaption>Once Steam is updated, you can start tweaking the settings.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4395338-steam-recording.jpg"></figure><ul><li>Ensure that Steam is updated</li><li>Click on Steam in the top-left corner of the client</li><li>Click on settings</li><li>Select "Game Recording"</li><li>Adjust settings to your preferences</li><li>Press CTRL+F11 to start recording gameplay footage manually</li></ul><p>It's also worth noting that Steam Game Recording works for any game that supports the Steam Overlay, but it may not work for some older games.</p>

<p>As Matt reported last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jusant-lost-records-studio-dont-nod-says-69-jobs-at-risk-as-part-of-reorganisation-project">69 jobs at the studio are at risk</a>, as Don't Nod initiates a "reorganisation project to ensure the company's long-term future" amid "deteriorating" financial results.</p>

<p>In an open letter seen and translated by Eurogamer's sister-site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dont-nod-workers-to-strike-on-november-8">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Don't Nod workers accused studio leadership of failing to take responsibility for its own shortcomings, instead using economical context as a justification for the redundancy plan.</p>
<p>"As workers at this company, we know that these failures are due to a succession of negligent acts and bad decisions from leadership," the letter reads. "We have warned leadership about these failures for years, but are not being listened to. Ultimately, we're the ones paying the price of these absurd decisions today, with the redundancy plan."</p><p>Workers accused leadership of "short-term thinking", adding "delusions of grandeur" influenced those higher up in the organisation to over-invest. "We want to save the company, but not at the price of unjustified redundancies or a deteriorated working environment," the letter closed.</p>
<p>Don't Nod's workers have laid out a number of demands, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>That Don't Nod abandons the redundancy plan</li>
<li>That employees have a voice in decision-making at the company</li>
<li>That Don't Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert be present at the negotiation</li>
</ul>
<p>The strike is set to begin at 2pm on Friday, union STJV announced, next to Don't Nod's Paris headquarters.</p>

<p>In September, Don't Nod said it had high hopes for Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-bets-on-lost-records-bloom-rage-as-multiple-projects-fail-to-meet-expectations">Jusant and Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden failed to reach company expectations</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-creators-lost-records-launches-in-two-parts">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage is set to arrive in two parts next year</a>. The first instalment launches for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 18th February 2025. The second part will then debut a month later, on 18th March.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>According to two prominent insiders, Fortnite Season OG will return permanently in December. The news was reported by <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1853920988594930095" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HYPEX</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1853920981682704412" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShiinaBR</a>, who received the information from an anonymous source and were able to confirm its veracity. They also said all Fortnite Chapter 1 seasons would return monthly with an OG item pool. Moreover, both Build and Zero Build modes will be available. The announcement is expected at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards, which will take place at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on Thursday, December 12, starting at 4:30 PM Pacific Time.</p>
<p>Fortnite Season OG <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-season-og-breaks-player-count-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned</a> for the first time last November, marking record player numbers for Epic. The first day after the relaunch, the Battle Royale game registered the biggest day in its history with more than 44.7 million players. It came at the right time, too: just a few months before, Epic had been forced to lay off sixteen percent of its workforce. Fortnite's comeback, which started with Season OG, was largely responsible for a much healthier state of the company's finances.</p>
<p>Epic seems to have figured out Fortnite users are really into nostalgia. Right now, there's the Chapter 2 Remix season <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-is-live-now-brand-new-kicks-cosmetics-unveiled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> on live servers. Are you enjoying it? What do you think about these returning seasons? Let us know in the comments.</p>

transition</a> into the next console. The Switch hasn't featured traditional backward compatibility since it launched, as it shifted from the disc format of the Wii and Wii U consoles back to cartridges. It's not clear yet if the Switch 2 will have a dedicated cartridge port for original Switch games, or if it'll implement a similar backward compatibility approach toward downloads of digitally purchased games like on the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles.</p><p>As it enters its eighth year, sales of the Switch have begun slowing down and an official announcement on it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">expected within the next five months</a>. 140 million systems and more than 1 billion Switch games have been sold so far, and Nintendo said in its latest earnings result that hardware sales continue to remain stable. <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1854050495566061608" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo stock has also been on the rebound</a>--shares fell yesterday after Nintendo revised its sales forecast and confirmed that Switch sales were starting to slow down--increasing by 5.8% on November 6.</p><p>As for when exactly the Switch 2 will be revealed, analysts predict that it won't be this year as Nintendo wants to avoid diverting attention from its current system before it heads into the lucrative holiday season.</p>

And while there are over 3,000 PlayStation 4 games to date, there’s one many of us hold dear to our hearts: Bloodborne. With a sequel now seeming little more than a pipedream, we’re left with only one option – to play through the original again on PS5 Pro to make the most of the console's Enhanced Image Quality feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But does the PS5 Pro actually make Bloodborne look any better?

			<p>The story of Awaken – Astral Blade is a nonsensical never-ending stream of proper nouns. Karpas Energy, Jacha, Royal Altars, Enginery Swords, and Energy Burst Points – it’s all completely incomprehensive and renders the dialogue a confusing chore to tap the skip button through. Sadly, when it comes to the gameplay of this Metroidvania, things don’t get much better.</p>
<p><iframe title="AWAKEN - Astral Blade | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DmGLIRJR-es?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Karpas Energy is running wild across the interconnected 2D environments of the Horace Islands, corrupting the animals into hideous mutated beasts. It’s up to Bionic girl Tania to explore levels, kill enormous bosses, and find obscure power-ups hidden all over the place. So, your standard Metroidvania then. Not that there is anything wrong with that, I love a good Metroidvania. Problem is, when it comes to Awaken – Astral Blade, it fails to achieve any of the basic fundamentals of the genre.</p>


<p>Take the level design itself. Rather than an expansive world that becomes accessible as you gain new abilities and has you returning to areas with a fresh perspective on them, the Horace Islands feel oddly linear. Sure, you can briefly diverge from the path and find a power-up of two but your soon ferried back to the correct route. There’s little sense of exploration or discovery, instead this is predominately a tedious plod from A to B and back again.</p>


<p>Combat is similarly limp and lacks impact. Tania wails away with her Enginery Sword but rarely is the impression given that she’s hitting anything. Instead, the visual and audio response to your attacks is messy and indistinct, resulting in it being difficult to tell what is going on. The same is true of enemies, where it’s often impossible to ascertain if a boss will connect with an attack or not. It’s a regular frustration when you’re unwittingly struck having clearly avoided the blow, which is only exacerbated by the poor character collision detection. All too often Tania ends up inside enemies whilst you try to attack them, resulting in health loss because she – despite clearly being some sort of immaterial apparition to be inside them in the first place – has apparently made physical contact with them.</p>
<p>That also has an effect on the platforming, &nbsp;as Tania levitates several inches above any surface, making it near impossible to tell whether you have touched down on a platform after an irritatingly floaty jump. The game doesn’t seem to know whether you have been successful or not either, seemingly flipping a coin to decide if you’ll land on a precipice or not. Dashing is dodgy too, the consistently naff collision detection seeing you hit by spinning blades, jabbing spears, and buzz-saws, despite your upmost attempts to dodge them successfully.</p>

<p>All these issues come to an unpleasant head with the spectacularly sharp difficulty spikes. Take an escape from a giant worm by way of an early game example. It’s one of those typical ‘run away from the unkillable baddy’ segments, seeing you dodge your way down a tunnel filled with moving platforms and deadly traps. Any sensible game would have revealed these new obstacles bit by bit, allowing the player to get used to them, to understand how to navigate them, before putting their newfound skills to the test in a time-trial situation. Not so in Awaken –Astral Blade, it just throws everything at you at once and says to hell with it.</p>
<p>This unbelievably poorly calibrated and sign-posted section cost me an hour of my life. Don’t let Awaken – Astral Blade rid you of any of your finite-time on this planet, give it a miss and play another Metroidvania instead.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		With a multitude of Metroidvanias out there, a prospective new entry in the genre must stand out from the pack to get attention. Awaken – Astral Blade certainly stands out, but not in a good way. A poor story, poor collision detection, and overly floaty platforming combine to provide an unforgettable experience, just for all the wrong reasons.	</p></div>

			<p>An Alan Wake 2 PlayStation 5 Pro comparison video was shared online today, highlighting the improvements made possible by the soon-to-be-released mid-generation console by Sony.</p>
<p>The comparison, put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a>, provides a new look at the game's ray-traced reflections on opaque and transparent surfaces exclusive to PS5 Pro between consoles, better shadows, volumetric lighting, and fog compared to quality mode on the base model and Xbox Series X, and performance mode settings comparable to quality mode on base console and Microsoft's most powerful current generation system. The video also highlights how PSSR delivers a much better image quality than AMD FSR 2 but also causes artifacts in some areas. Still, these are very impressive results for the first iteration of the upscaler.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake II | PS5 Pro - PS5 - Xbox Series X - PC | Graphics Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_p389l3GmPk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 launched last year on PC and consoles and continues to be one of the most stunning survival horror games released in recent years. Last month, the game was expanded with The Lake House expansion, which serves as a clear introduction for the next story in the Remedy Connected Universe, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-whos-the-real-monster/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>With its great atmosphere and tight story pacing, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House retains the same elements that made the base game so engaging. The lack of significant new mechanics and its very short length, however, make it a worthwhile purchase only for the most die-hard fans of Alan Wake 2 and the Remedy Connected Universe.</em></p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 is now available on PC via the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-nuketown-manniquin-easter-egg/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has reintroduced one of the most iconic maps in Call of Duty history, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-nuketown-in-black-ops-6-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuketown</a>. After debuting in the original Black Ops, Treyarch have brought the map back in every Black Ops game since, and it usually comes with an interesting little <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-super-hero-easter-egg-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Easter egg</a>.</p>



<p>In the past, shooting all the heads off the mannequins on the map would initiate an Easter egg. In Black Ops 3, the mannequins awoke and started attacking you, while in the original, music would start playing much like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-terminus-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teddy bear Easter eggs in Zombies</a>.</p>



<p>So, many have been wondering if Black Ops 6’s Nuketown has something similar, so, here’s your answer.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-an-easter-egg-on-nuketown-in-bo6">Is there an Easter egg on Nuketown in BO6?</h2>



<p><strong>No, there is currently no Easter egg in Black Ops 6’s Nuketown</strong>. Players have shot all the heads off the mannequins on the map and nothing happens. This is strange since every iteration of Nuketown has included some sort of secret for doing so, but players were surprised to see that the devs have not put anything in the map.</p>



<p>While many may be slightly disappointed to learn this, it’s important to note that the devs could implement an Easter egg in the future. </p>



<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oih841WfYiw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inkslasher</a> noticed an intriguing map of Nuketown on the wall of the middle truck that’s open for players to go into. This map has not been in any other version of Nuketown, and since this is supposed to be the original version of the map, it poses the question of why the devs decided to introduce it. It may have nothing to do with an Easter egg, but Treyarch are known for hidden secrets and don’t tend to introduce things like this for no reason.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The map is also not available in Private Matches and you can’t watch Nuketown matches on Theatre Mode, so perhaps the devs are still working on things for Nuketown before pushing an Easter egg live.</p>



<p>Some in the community have managed to glitch into Theatre Mode for Nuketown and clip out the map, allowing them to explore the surrounding area. It was discovered that both the Warhead Face Off map and the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/area-99-revealed-as-new-resurgence-map-in-warzone-at-codnext-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Area 99 Warzone map</a> can be found very close by.</p>



<p>We knew these maps were in the same location, but the fact that they exist in the same space while playing on either map, albeit in much lower resolution, could suggest that Treyarch have a much larger, more intricate Easter egg in store.</p>

<p>In many ways, the timing of Sony's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/playstation-4-ps4-pro-review-4k/">2016 launch of the PS4 Pro</a> couldn't have been better. The slightly upgraded version of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/11/impressions-our-first-day-with-the-playstation-4-is-full-of-surprises/">2013's PlayStation 4</a> came at a time when a wave of 4K TVs was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161109006184/en/2016-a-Banner-Year-for-4K-UHD-TV-Display-Sales-to-Grow-40-Percent-as-4K-Ecosystem-Continues-to-Expand-Says-CTA">just beginning to crest</a> in the form of tens of millions of annual sales in the US.</p>
<p>Purchasing Sony's first-ever "mid-generation" console upgrade in 2016 didn't give original PS4 owners access to any new games, a fact that contributed to us <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/playstation-4-ps4-pro-review-4k/">calling the PS4 Pro "a questionable value proposition"</a> when it launched. Still, many graphics-conscious console gamers were looking for an excuse to use the extra pixels and HDR colors on their new 4K TVs, and spending hundreds of dollars on a stopgap console years before the PS5 served that purpose well enough.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today and the PS5 Pro faces an even weaker value proposition. The PS5, after all, has proven more than capable of creating excellent-looking games that take full advantage of the 4K TVs that are now practically standard in American homes. With 8K TVs <a href="https://variety.com/vip/8k-tv-high-resolution-tech-1236115228/">still an extremely small market niche</a>, there isn't anything akin to what Sony's Mike Somerset called "the most significant picture-quality increase probably since black and white went to color" <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/ps4-pro-hdr-preview-gt-sport-nioh/">when talking about 4K TV in 2016</a>.</p>

<p>Instead, Sony says that spending $700 on a PS5 Pro has a decidedly more marginal impact—namely, helping current PS5 gamers avoid having to choose between the smooth, 60 fps visuals of "Performance" mode and the resolution-maximizing, graphical effects-laden "Fidelity" mode in many games. The extra power of the PS5 Pro, Sony says, will let you have the best of both worlds: full 4K, ray-traced graphics <em>and</em> 60 fps at the same time.</p>
<p>While there's nothing precisely <em>wrong</em> with this value proposition, there's a severe case of diminishing returns that comes into play here. The graphical improvements between a "Performance mode" PS5 game and a "Performance Pro mode" PS5 game are small enough, in fact, that I often found it hard to reliably tell at a glance which was which.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with the PS5 Pro, in other words, is that the original PS5 is already too good.</p>
<h2>Smooth operator</h2>
<p>In announcing the PS5 Pro <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/sony-announces-ps5-pro-a-700-graphics-workhorse-available-nov-7/">in September</a>, Sony's Mark Cerny mentioned that roughly three-quarters of PS5 owners opt for Performance mode over Fidelity mode when offered the choice on a stock PS5. It's not hard to see why. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/does-anyone-really-need-a-1000-hz-gaming-display/">Research shows</a> that the vast majority of people can detect a distinct decrease in flickering or juddery animation when the frames-per-second counter is cranked up from (Fidelity mode's) 30 fps to (Performance mode's) 60 fps.</p>
<p>The extra visual smoothness is especially important in any reflex-heavy game, where every millisecond of reaction time between your eyes and your thumbs can have a dramatic impact. That reaction advantage can extend well past 60 fps, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/does-anyone-really-need-a-1000-hz-gaming-display/">as PC gamers know all too well</a>.</p>


<p>But the other reason that Performance mode is so overwhelmingly popular among PS5 players, I'd argue, is that you don't really have to give up too much to get that frame rate-doubling boost. In most games, hopping from Fidelity mode to Performance means giving up a steady 4K image for either a (nicely upscaled) 1440p image or "Dynamic 4K" resolution (i.e., 4K that sometimes temporarily drops down lower to maintain frame rates). While some gamers swear that this difference is important to a game's overall visual impact, most players will likely struggle to even notice that resolution dip unless they're <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/does-the-world-really-need-8k-resolution-game-consoles/">sitting incredibly close to a very large screen</a>.</p>

<p>For the PS5 Pro, Sony is marketing "PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution," its buzzword for an AI-driven upscaling feature that adds further clarity and detail to scenes. Sony's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/sony-announces-ps5-pro-a-700-graphics-workhorse-available-nov-7/">original announcement of "Super Resolution"</a> heavily used zoomed-in footage to highlight the impact of this feature on distant details. That's likely because without that level of zoom, the effect of this resolution bump is practically unnoticeable.</p>

<h2>Tracing those rays</h2>
<p>The other visual upgrade often inherent in a PS5 game's Fidelity mode is support for ray-tracing, wherein the system tracks individual light rays for more accurate reflections and light scattering off of simulated objects. Having ray-tracing enabled can sometimes lead to striking visual moments, such as when you see Spider-Man's every move reflected in the mirrored windows of a nearby skyscraper. But as we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/playstation-5-review-more-of-a-generational-hop-than-a-leap/">noted in our initial PS5 review</a>, the effect is usually a much subtler tweak to the overall "realism" of how objects come across in a scene.</p>
<p>Having those kind of ray-traced images at a full 60 fps is definitely nice, but the impact tends to be muted unless a scene has a lot of highly reflective objects. Even the "Fidelity Pro" mode in some PS5 Pro games—which scales the frame rate back to 30 fps to allow for the ray-tracing algorithm to model more reflections and more accurate occlusion and shadows—doesn't create very many "wow" moments over a standard PS5 in moment-to-moment gameplay.</p>


<p>On the original PS5, I never hesitated to give up the (often marginal) fidelity improvements in favor of a much smoother frame rate. Getting that slightly improved fidelity on the PS5 Pro—without having to give up my beloved 60 fps—is definitely nice, but it's far from an exciting new frontier in graphical impact.</p>
<h2>Which is which?</h2>
<p>When testing the PS5 Pro for this review, I had my original PS5 plugged into a secondary input on the same TV, running the same games consecutively. I'd play a section of a game in Pro mode on the PS5 Pro, then immediately switch to the PS5 running the same game in Performance mode (or vice versa). Sitting roughly six feet away from a 60-inch 4K TV, I was struggling to notice any subjective difference in overall visual quality.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>I also took comparative screenshots on an original PS5 and a PS5 Pro in as close to identical circumstances as possible, some of which you can see shared in this review (be sure to blow them up to full screen on a good monitor). Flipping back and forth between two screenshots, I could occasionally make out small tangible differences—more natural shine coming off the skin of Aloy's face in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>, for instance, or a slight increase in detail on Ratchet's Lombax fur. More often than not, though, I had legitimate trouble telling which screenshot came from which console without double-checking which TV input was currently active.</p>



<p>I'm a single reviewer with a single pair of eyes, of course. Your impression of the relative visual improvement might be very different. Luckily, if you have access to a PS5 already, you can run your own visual test just by switching between Fidelity and Performance modes on any of your current games. If you find the individual screens in Performance mode look noticeably worse than those in Fidelity mode (putting frame rate aside), then you might be in the market for a PS5 Pro. If you don't, you can probably stop reading this review right here.</p>
<h2>Barely a bang for your buck</h2>
<p>Even if you're the kind of person who appreciates the visual impact of Fidelity mode on the PS5, upgrading to the PS5 Pro isn't exactly an instant purchase. At $700, getting a PS5 Pro is akin to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/review-geforce-rtx-4070-super-makes-a-good-gpu-even-better-still-costs-600/">a PC gamer purchasing a top-of-the-line graphics card</a>, even though the lack of modular components means replacing your entire PS5 console rather than a single part. But while a GeForce RTX 4070 Ti could conceivably keep running new PC games <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/your-10-year-old-graphics-card-can-run-dragon-age-the-veilguard/">for a decade or more</a>, the PS5 Pro should be thought of as more of a stopgap until the PlayStation 6 (and its inevitable exclusive games) hit around 2028 or so (based on past PlayStation launch spacing).</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>If you already have a PS5, that $700 could instead go toward the purchase of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/the-return-of-the-70-video-game-has-been-a-long-time-coming/">10 full, big-budget games</a> at launch pricing or even more intriguing indie releases. That money could also go toward <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/breaking-down-sonys-confusing-playstation-plus-subscription-relaunch/">more than four years of PlayStation Plus Premium</a> and access to its library of hundreds of streaming and downloadable modern and classic PlayStation titles PS5 titles. Both strike me as a better use of a limited gaming budget than the slight visual upgrade you'd get from a PS5 Pro.</p>


<p>Even if you're in the market for your first PS5, I'm not sure the Pro is the version I'd recommend. The $250 difference between a stock PS5 and the PS5 Pro similarly feels like it could be put to better use than the slight visual improvements on offer here. And while the addition of an extra terabyte of high-speed game storage on the PS5 Pro is very welcome, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/the-ps5-pro-brings-the-game-consoles-disc-drive-era-to-an-end/">need to buy an external disc drive peripheral for physical games on the new console</a> may understandably rub some players the wrong way.</p>
<p>Back when the PlayStation 2 launched, I distinctly remember thinking that video game graphics had reached a "good enough" plateau, past which future hardware improvements would be mostly superfluous. That memory feels incredibly quaint now from the perspective of nearly two-and-a-half decades of improvements in console graphics and TV displays. Yet the PS5 Pro has me similarly feeling that the original PS5 was something of a graphical plateau, with this next half-step in graphical horsepower struggling to prove its worth.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll look back in two decades and consider that feeling similarly naive, seeing the PS5 Pro as a halting first step toward yet unimagined frontiers of graphical realism. Right now, though, I'm comfortable recommending that the vast majority of console gamers spend their money elsewhere.</p>

            <p>Valve has added a game recording functionality to Steam.</p>
<p>This feature was previously in beta, but is now available to the wider community. It's described as a "new built-in system for creating and sharing your gameplay footage".</p>
<p>Users will now be able to record, replay, clip and share their gameplay experience. This includes on Valve's handheld PC, the Steam Deck. You can see how it looks via the video below. </p>

<p>In a blog post detailing Steam's new feature, Valve said its 'Background Recording' mode will mean gameplay is "continuously saved to your preferred drive, never exceeding your specified duration and storage limits". It stated that an 'on demand' function is also available, so users can stop and start recording manually as the mood takes.</p>
<p>That aforementioned replay functionality, meanwhile, can be found in the Steam Overlay for each game on Valve's platform.</p>
<p>There will also be 'Timeline' and 'Event' markers. "The Steam Timeline appears whenever you’re actively recording," Valve said. "Timeline-enhanced games generate event markers as relevant game events happen. Steam achievements and screenshots automatically create markers as well."</p>
<p>Full details on Valve's new game recording feature, including how to save and share clips, can be found on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/gamerecording">Steam</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-playstation-5-pro-test-highlights-how-the-console-can-brute-force-improvements-even-without-dedicated-patch.1028673/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-playstation-5-pro-test/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>An early Elden Ring PlayStation 5 Pro test was shared online, showing how the console can brute force improvements in games even without a dedicated patch.</p>
<p>The test conducted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@brazilpixel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brazil Pixel</a> reveals how the action role-playing game by FromSoftware often runs at native 4K resolution in Performance Mode while keeping close to 60 frames per second framerate most of the time. In Quality mode, on the other hand, performance is shakier but still manages to be close to 60 frames per second while constantly running at native 4K resolution. The biggest performance improvements, however, are seen with ray tracing, which is not surprising considering the console's GPU improvements over the base model.</p>
<p><iframe title="Elden Ring - PS5 PRO - Resolution and Performance - Patch 1.17" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EFbBlagU1VE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Given how Elden Ring's performance on the base PlayStation 5 isn't as solid as it should have been, this is definitely good news, as a dedicated PS5 Pro patch would definitely make 4K resolution, 60 FPS gameplay possible. Even with its technical hiccups, however, the game is worth experiencing for fans of the Souls series, as it is the natural evolution of the successful formula created by FromSoftware, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">review.</a></p>
<p>Elden Ring and its expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, are now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-review-how-close-is-your-tv.1028658/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>You don’t need me to tell you the new PS5 Pro, on sale November 7th, is the most powerful PlayStation ever made. The real question: could it possibly be worth $700, the most Sony’s ever charged for a game console?</p><p>I think I can answer that — but first, I need you to go find a measuring tape.</p><p>Find your favorite seat in front of the TV, then measure the distance between your head and the screen. Now measure your screen diagonally. Do you own a 65-inch or 55-inch TV, the most popular sizes? Do you sit 10 feet away or more? Then no, the PS5 Pro is probably not worth $700. Not even if you have 20/20 vision like me. The improved visual fidelity just isn’t tangible enough at that distance.</p><p>But if you sit closer, Sony’s new game console can make select games look amazing. Blades of grass, pillars of rough hewn stone, the weave of a backpack — they pop at higher fidelity. It’s enough of an improvement that I found myself <em>wanting </em>to sit closer, or stand, or even plug the PS5 Pro into a 4K computer monitor to use it like a gaming PC.</p><p>With some games, playing the original PS5 could feel like looking through a dirty window. The PS5 Pro has the power to wipe that window clean.</p><p>I think it’s important to make this clear right away: the PS5 Pro doesn’t make every game “Pro.” To really see a difference, it requires specially patched “PS5 Pro Enhanced” games.</p><p>This is no PS6 — Sony has made no suggestion that it’ll kick off a new console generation or have any<em> </em>exclusive games. It still plays the same PS5 and PS4 titles using the same AMD Zen 2 CPU cores, gets the same software updates, uses the same excellent DualSense gamepad, and offers largely the same ports.</p><p>If you pick games that already run beautifully on PS5, like the excellent <em>Astro Bot</em>, the only differences you’re getting might be physical ones, like the three curved scimitar-shaped fins that divide the console’s upper and lower halves, or how cool and quiet it runs, or how surprisingly light it feels. The PS5 Pro weighs three pounds less than the original 2020 model, even after you add the optional disc drive. The console’s slightly smaller, too.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Size comparison: Original PS5, PS5 Pro, PS5 Pro with disc drive.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>But the PS5 Pro comes with an extra 2GB DDR5 memory, more than double the storage at 2TB, and — most importantly — a 62 percent faster GPU, with 16.7 teraflops of raw graphical compute. Add an AI upscaling technique called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR), and it’s easily the most potent home console yet made.</p><div><p><strong>A few extra PS5 Pro reviewer’s notes:</strong></p><div><ul><li>You get two front USB-C ports, but one’s the slow USB 2.0 variety.</li><li>The easy-upgrade NVMe SSD expansion slot still exists.</li><li>Remote Play isn’t necessarily enhanced, but it feels improved just by virtue of better resolution in PS5 Pro performance modes.</li><li>It runs cool enough that I failed to use it as a foot warmer yesterday.</li><li>Many PS5 Pro Enhanced games have targeted, rather than fixed, framerates and claim to run slightly faster on variable refresh rate (VRR) screens.</li><li>Some PS5 Pro Enhanced games have 120Hz modes, potentially with lower latency — I haven’t effectively tested this yet.</li><li>Ray tracing aside, the Pro feels slightly weaker than my 5800X / 3060 Ti gaming PC in early tests; I can run <em>Alan Wake II</em> there with better textures and more detail. </li></ul></div></div><p>What that actually means for games is up to each studio to some degree. But in practice, many developers are boasting that you no longer need to choose between smoothness and fidelity; you can have your cake and eat it too with 4K-like graphics at 60 frames per second.</p><p>At Sony’s PS5 Pro preview event, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253649/ps5-pro-preview">I told you how that wasn’t strictly accurate</a>: with only 45 percent more rendering performance, some graphical compromises are still being made. But after spending several straight days swapping back and forth between my original PS5 from 2020 and the new PS5 Pro, testing over a dozen games in all their different graphical modes, I think there’s something to that “best of both worlds” claim.</p><p>In every title I tried — while sitting no more than eight feet away from a 65-inch TV — the PS5 Pro was clearly the better place to play.</p><p>In <em>The Last of Us</em>, I could see individual blades of grass instead of a sea of green. In <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>, I could make out the peach fuzz on Aloy’s cheeks. In <em>Demon’s Souls</em> and <em>Spider-Man 2</em> and <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart </em>and <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, the enhanced crispness and smoothness of the entire image helped bring cities to life, making their castle walls and skyscrapers and floating ships and post-apocalyptic frozen wasteland feel more real. Everything’s just more… defined.</p><p>Even PS4 games can get a bit crisper on PS5 Pro: I booted up <em>Bloodborne</em>, <em>Gravity Rush 2</em>, and my current kid-favorite <em>Lego Dimensions</em>, and each had slight improvements once I toggled a new PS4 image enhancement option in the console’s setting’s menu.</p><p>Thing is, my couch <em>isn’t</em> eight feet from my TV. It’s 12 feet, too far to tell a difference between the PS5 and PS5 Pro, because those details melt away. I can just barely make out the difference at 10 feet, sitting on the edge of my seat.</p><p>The big exception I’ve tried is <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. </em>While I can’t see <em>all</em> its visual improvements leaning back on the couch, <em>Rebirth</em> definitely takes the award for Most Improved on PS5 Pro, no longer forcing me to choose between distractingly choppy or annoyingly blurry. Its new PS5 Pro-exclusive “Versatility” mode offers such a clearer picture than the previous muddy options, the difference is visible at distance; I could see some <em>Final Fantasy</em> uber-fans picking up the console for that reason alone, particularly lapsed fans who haven’t yet purchased a PS5 and only need to justify an extra $270 for the Pro. </p><p>Most games don’t have this much room for improvement, though.</p><p>And you shouldn’t expect the PS5 Pro to necessarily improve graphics in the ways you might prefer. <em>FFVII Rebirth</em>’s open world still does that pop-in thing where plants and bushes appear just as you’re about to run into them, and <em>Alan Wake II </em>still can’t keep Detective Casey’s sideburns and facial hair from strobing in and out of existence.</p><p>Speaking of <em>Alan Wake II</em>, it’s also one of the few PS5 Pro Enhanced titles to offer an optional new ray tracing mode. <a href="https://www.remedygames.com/article/alan-wake-2-on-playstation-5-pro---behind-the-scenes">It’s just ray-traced reflections</a>, a far cry from the full-fat ray tracing the game can offer on today’s beefiest gaming PCs. Still, it’s amazing to see how realistic the Oh Deer Diner’s windows look when you can see the whole world reflected on them, and realistically see through them at the same time — the PS5 Pro handles it well. The game runs much slower, targeting 30fps rather than 60fps, but it’s not so much of a performance hit that it becomes unplayable.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Image slider: swipe left to remove Alan Wake II’s ray traced reflections from the window and puddle. Larger images </em><a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25717781/2.jpg"><em>here</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25717780/1.jpg"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The ray tracing in <em>Alan Wake II </em>(<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253649/ps5-pro-preview#:~:text=The%20biggest%20surprise%20for%20me%2C%20though">and <em>F1 24</em></a>) is an intriguing taste of what the PS5 Pro might be capable of in the future — if the console sells well enough for developers to seriously target it with their new games. The PS4 Pro eventually got <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:PlayStation_4_Pro_enhanced_games">a long list of enhanced games</a>, but it launched at just $400 with an optical drive, generous trade-in offers at GameStop, and a clearer value proposition of taking your games from 1080p to 4K. Adoption was high; <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/playstation-ceos-hideaki-nishino-hermen-hulst-1236194125/">Sony recently revealed</a> that 20 percent of PS4 customers wound up buying a PS4 Pro as well.&nbsp;</p><p>$700 will be a tough pill for some would-be buyers to swallow, especially considering it doesn’t come with an optical drive. Personally, most of my PS5 and PS4 library is on disc, and I had to special-order the $80 optical drive (they’re a little scarce right now!) to get some of my games running. Sony provided review codes for others.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Adding the optional $80 disc drive is incredibly easy — no screws, just pop the panel off.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>You should know that reviewers didn’t have access to <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/04/ps5-pro-50-enhanced-games-available-at-launch-november-7/">all 55 of the PS5 Pro Enhanced patches</a> that Sony’s promising for launch day. As I write these words, major titles that could use enhancements and have promised enhancements, like the just-released <em>Dragon Age</em>: <em>The Veilguard</em> and <em>Star Wars Jedi Survivor</em>, have yet to release their patches. It’s possible some of the games I haven’t tested look better (or worse) than the ones I was able to try out. But at this point, I feel like I’ve seen the gamut from “good” to “meh.” And like the PS4 Pro, there’s real potential here if developers take advantage of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ever since Sony announced the PS5 Pro and revealed both its $700 price tag and lack of optical drive, I’ve heard all kinds of people ridicule the company. Some suggest you need a magnifying glass to see the difference in visual quality. (You don’t.) Some suggest you’d be better off building a gaming PC. (You might, but probably not for $700.)</p><p>For that matter, I fired up <em>The Last of Us Part I </em>on my mid-range gaming PC today, a PC whose graphics card alone would still retail for around $300. I sat on a loading screen for 15 minutes just to compile the game’s shaders, then launched a game with buggy hair and dull grey mirrors that don’t reflect. I mucked about with settings for 20 more minutes to make the game playable. </p><p>Then, I plugged a PS5 Pro into the same 4K monitor. The game loaded almost instantly. It was both beautiful and playable right away.</p><p>The kind of person who should buy a PS5 Pro is the kind of person who doesn’t want to muck around. They’ll want the best console gaming experience money can buy, a large OLED display to go with it, and a plan to park themselves <em>real close</em> to that screen.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> recently received a big update in the form of Delta Arena, a playlist that features recreations of Halo 2's most popular maps and a special third-person mode. The true highlight, though, is yet to come. And that's through an entirely different Halo game: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection">The Master Chief Collection</a>. Soon enough, you'll be able to play Halo 2's lost E3 demo on it, thanks to some lovely modders.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So yes, to celebrate Halo 2's 20th anniversary you can boot up Halo Infinite and jump into some Halo 2 maps. There's Ascension, Midship, Lockout and many others that are good and dandy (you can actually play original Halo 2 maps via The Master Chief Collection). I don't remember any of them because I didn't have Xbox Live at the time as I was quite a young lad. I <em>do</em> remember really enjoying the campaign, though, and rinsing it over the course of a day or so. God, I loved dual-wielding and particularly, those Flood-ridden levels.</p>
<p>Now, I also don't remember E3's 2003 demo because I was probably playing tag in the park or something. Either way, it's hailed as an iconic moment for Halo and the Xbox and what was possible back then. In an interview with Halo community director Brian Jarrard for <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/04/20-years-of-halo-2-new-maps-e3-demo/">Xbox Wire</a>, he explains that it's since remained locked away due to "snags with technology", but thanks to modders and "Digsite data archaeology", the original assets and files were recovered.</p>

<p>Still, Jarrard says that because the original E3 demo was then built in a "version of the Halo engine that no longer exists" and with assets incompatible with any other versions of Halo 2, the team still had some more work to do. Halo senior franchise writer Kenneth Peter says that it even needed an "Xbox developer kit to get it to boot", which aren't exactly in abundance in the studio anymore.</p>
<p>Modders like Steven Garcia and Digsite members helped get the demo in shape, though. And Peters says that without them, we'd all have a "rather unceremonious drop of raw assets".</p>
<p>To play the recreated E3 demo, you'll need to own Halo: The Master Chief Collection and download the free mod from the Steam Workshop when it arrives on November 9th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That would track with Warner Bros. Discovery's previous announcement that the show would debut sometime in 2026.

<section><p>The latest iteration of the PS5 doesn't make a good case for its premium price tag</p></section>

                <p dir="ltr">When the PlayStation 5 debuted in November 2020, Sony made a compelling case for picking one up. In addition to simply being a shiny new console, the value proposition it presented was largely in the games available at launch. The selection included a variety of third-party titles but, more importantly, multiple first-party titles that served as excellent showcases for the power of the newly available PS5.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2024, playing Spider-Man: Miles Morales on the original PS5 is--excuse the pun--a visual marvel. Steering Miles Morales through a vast and vibrant cityscape as he pirouettes through the air and plunges towards the ground, just before effortlessly launching himself back up into the sky to slip between towering buildings, remains an exhilarating thrill. Back when it was released, however, it was spectacular. Especially with the quick loading times that felt like a major distinguishing factor.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> PS5 Pro Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For my money, Bluepoint's Demon's Souls remake remains the most visually impressive game on the PS5. Its use of lighting and art direction captured the mood of a game beloved for its unsettling sense of tension and atmospheric world. It's a testament to Bluepoint's efforts that it holds up so well four years later and shows that, even now, the PS5 and its games can remain impressive.</p><p dir="ltr">Experiences like these were immediate and emphatic validation that the PS5 was worth the asking price and that the future of gaming on the platform had exciting potential. These games, and a few others, proved beyond any doubt that Sony's console represented a generational leap worth taking.</p><p dir="ltr">The PlayStation 5 Pro is the second iteration of the console, and although Sony hopes both new consumers, and existing PS5 owners, might find a place for it in their homes, the mid-cycle upgrade is fitted with features that are aimed at a much more niche market. For either group to make that transition, then, the PS5 Pro needs to clear the same value proposition checks as the original console—and it faces a higher bar given its price tag and the lack of exclusive games compared to the original PS5.</p><p dir="ltr">The PS5 Pro is a more powerful piece of hardware that, physically, looks largely the same as already available models. And so, like most iterative tech with a steep asking price, it needs to communicate its advantages clearly and compellingly. Though it is capable of technically improving gaming experiences, without brand-new games to shine a spotlight on the advantages of having one, the PS5 Pro's tangible benefits are much harder to grasp for the average person and may even not be enough of a differential to get its target demographic to part with their cash.</p><p dir="ltr">For the sake of transparency, this review is coming from the perspective of someone who has all versions of the PlayStation 5, as well as a very powerful gaming PC and both the Xbox Series X and Series S. In many ways, I am the target audience for the Pro, but like most people who will consider the purchase, I am an average person with an intermediate understanding of the technicalities of the hardware and its capabilities. If you're looking for precise frame data and in-depth explorations of artificial intelligence-enabled resolution upscaling, this isn't where you'll find it--head over to the Digital Foundry crew for that. The methodology I'm most capable of and best positioned to employ is a naked eye test. All of the comparisons I am making are based on close inspection of games being displayed on an LG 55" OLED TV, which supports 4K, 120hz, and VRR. But the naked-eye test, in my opinion, is appropriate for the question I'm trying to answer: Should an average person with an interest in playing games buy or upgrade to the PS5 Pro? And the answer to that is, as you can probably guess, complicated.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4394476-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4394476" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4394476-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4394476"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4394476-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Familiar Design</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Let's start with the most inconsequential part of the PS5 Pro's changes: aesthetics and form factor. The PS5 Pro doesn't come with a disc drive, which means it is a digital-only console by default. In terms of form factor, it has a much smaller footprint that is closer to that of the PS5 Slim than the chunkier original version, though it still takes up roughly the same space due to the stand (the launch PS5's stand will not work on the Pro). While the PS5 Slim features a glossy finish on the outside panels (unless you attach a disc drive, which is matted), the Pro has the same matte finish as the launch PS5. It's also a little taller than previous models. Overall it has a slicker look and profile.</p><p dir="ltr">The most notable cosmetic changes, however, are the vents striped across both sides of the console. Their intended function is to help with ventilation and cooling, especially since the Pro has a more powerful graphics processing unit and will be working a little harder to pump out those crisp, 4K visuals. However, it also has a nice aesthetic impact in the same way that putting racing stripes on pretty much any car makes it automatically look cooler. I've never had an issue with the design of the PS5--I was a fan of the Seto Kaiba-esque flaring collars of the original and also appreciated the thinner look of the Slim. The Pro has that original design and the slimness too, and it's faster because of the racing stripes… and the better internals, too, I guess.</p><p dir="ltr">As previously mentioned, that thinner form factor is enabled by not having a disc drive, which means if you have built up a physical media collection--be it games or movies--that you intend to utilize, you'll need to spend more money to make that possible. At $700, the Pro has a steep asking price, and while digital delivery might be more commonplace these days, for the average consumer being able to put a game disc into a console is an important feature. Additionally, the power users who are likely to consider upgrading probably have an extensive library of physical PS4 games. While the absence of a disc drive might not be a deal breaker for some, it's a basic video game console function missing from one with the highest price we've seen to date. It's a decision that potentially leaves the most hardcore PlayStation fans in an awkward spot where they have to choose between leaving physical media behind or paying extra to retain that support. You'll also have to spend extra to get a vertical stand if you don't already have one from the PS5 Slim.</p><p dir="ltr">While the PS5 Pro may be missing a basic function, it has gained a few impressive new ones. When the console was revealed, Mark Cerney--somewhat uncharacteristically--kept the pitch very simple and digestible. He said the Pro allows players to play their games with the higher frame rate and stability of Performance modes while having the higher graphical quality of a Fidelity mode. This is enabled by three key features that are new to the PS5 Pro. The first is an upgraded GPU which, through a combination of more compute units and faster memory, allows games to be rendered quicker. The second is more powerful ray tracing capabilities, allowing developers to implement more realistic lighting with fewer compromises. And finally, the PS5 Pro is capable of AI-driven upscaling through PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution that uses machine learning to sharpen images and make them more clear--if you're familiar with PC gaming, it's kind of like XeSS or DLSS but on console, which is an impressive thing to pull off. This "big three," as Cerny calls it, is the foundation for a console gaming experience that is unrivaled from a visual and performance perspective, and closes the gap between console and PC a bit more. It's an intriguing set of features that undoubtedly elevated the games I tested on the PS5 Pro, but not as dramatically as I expected.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>A Difference In Games?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">My first stop was, naturally, Demon's Souls, which has been updated to offer a PS5 Pro setting in the visual mode options. In this game, the promise of unifying the higher frame rate of the performance mode with the visual detail of the Cinematic mode is on full display. In the standard Cinematic mode, there is a sluggishness to character movement and choppiness to camera movement, but there is also a clear improvement in visual fidelity, with sharper details and more noticeable effects in the environment. The fog sweeping across the bridge in front of the Boletarian Palace and the flaming torches are clearly of a higher resolution. On the other hand, the Performance mode cuts down on many of these effects and runs much smoother.</p><p dir="ltr">In PS5 Pro mode, Demon's Souls can be played with the best of both worlds and then some. With it on, the level of detail is much more evident compared to both the Cinematic and Performance modes. I have played Demon's Souls multiple times in both Performance and Cinematic modes, and I've never noticed how much debris there is in the air in the tutorial section; I've never stopped to watch how the light coming from the flame of a lamp realistically pulses on the stone wall it's pressed up against. This effect, in the other modes, is significantly degraded compared to when using the PS5 Pro option. The individual embers that make up the red tutorial messages are discernible--until now it looked more like a red streak. Light hitting stone defines the jagged edges of blocks used to build decrepit walls and monumental castles. I never noticed it before because it just wasn't there. In PS5 Pro mode, everything has an extra luster to it in a way that made me feel like a tourist in a world I've spent hundreds of hours in already. Demon's Souls is a nice-looking game regardless of how you play it, but on PS5 Pro, I kept spotting new details and I will be replaying the game on the Pro for sure.</p><p dir="ltr">The issue, however, is that most of these new visual touches are extremely subtle, to the point where I spent a not-insignificant amount of time flipping back and forth between the cinematic, performance, and PS5 Pro modes to properly identify the changes. It's one of those things where if I hadn't spent the time closely inspecting inches of the screen, I probably would never have noticed it. This makes the visual tweaks to Demon's Souls that the PS5 Pro brings a ”nice-to-have” more than an essential upgrade. The graphical difference between cinematic and PS5 Pro, for most people, will be negligible, but the improved frame rate and the smoothness that comes from that is palpable in the game feel, and that was the objective, according to Cerny.</p><p dir="ltr">Alan Wake 2 has been updated to utilize the PS5 Pro's improved ray-tracing capabilities and, again, it becomes noticeable if you spend the time to inspect the differences. The mood of the game is enhanced thanks to the better ray tracing and, for those who choose the "Quality" mode, you will not be able to play the game and have it look as good anywhere other than on a more powerful PC. A game that is as reliant on lighting to set its tone and power its gameplay definitely benefits from the quality of ray tracing. But, again, there are trade-offs. Quality mode has ray tracing, with all the bells and whistles of realistic reflections, as well as 4K resolution, but it runs at 30 frames per second. Much like Demon's Souls' Cinematic mode, the downside is a more languid feel to gameplay. It's not the way I would play the whole game. However, the PS5 Pro again does what Cerny said it would and finds that sweet spot in Alan Wake 2's performance mode, which is equivalent to the visual fidelity of the quality mode when the game is played on a standard PS5, but with the higher frame rate and resolution of the performance mode, so it looks nice and feels good.</p><p dir="ltr">Rather than simply present you with a few preset modes, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 gives players a variety of options to tweak the visual effects and features to their liking, akin to the way a PC game would allow for specific adjustments to dial in how you want it to look and perform. This is possible through the Fidelity Pro mode, which targets 30fps, brings in ray tracing, and lets you tweak how light, shadows, reflections, interiors, and ambient occlusion work, as well as offering an uncapped frame rate meant to work in conjunction with variable refresh rate support if your display offers it. There's also an option to leverage 120hz support if your display is capable of it, bumping the frame rate up depending on what you're getting up to with Spidey. With all options on, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 looks fantastic. At night, there's enough clarity to make out the individually lit rooms on high-rise buildings far into the distance. The game allows for the time of day to be quickly changed, and seeing the city bathed in a blanket of golden light at sunrise is genuinely stunning.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhReCdn5Gc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kAhReCdn5Gc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Of all the games I tested, the distinction between the way the game feels with everything cranked up and the less-intense performance mode was the least pronounced--it looked fantastic and played great too in both modes. Similarly, the visual disparity between Fidelity Pro and Performance Pro wasn't noticeable unless you compare them side by side--both modes use ray tracing too. Shuffling between them causes the game to reload and restart at a checkpoint, so trying to spot the differences is trickier with just one screen. But I was impressed that the PS5 Pro was able to give me gameplay at 60 frames per second without compromising the quality of the image or missing out on ray tracing and reflections through the performance mode. I opted to stick with that, over the 30fps/VRR/120hz options offered in Fidelity mode. Thanks to PSSR, Performance Pro's visuals are roughly equivalent to the game being played on previous PS5 models on the Fidelity Mode, so you're effectively getting ray tracing-lite. This disparity is only really evident if you stop and fixate on the detail of reflections or how light hits windows though. In a game where you're constantly swinging around a city at breakneck speeds, how often are you really going to be doing that?</p><p dir="ltr">The PS5 Pro made a difference in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which previously took a big hit when playing with graphics as the priority. The new Versatility mode, however, balances a sharp, 4K picture with the high-quality graphical details with staying at 60fps. A "Graphics" option allows the game to prioritize visuals even further while letting the fps fluctuate a bit more. There's also a Sharp and Soft options, which adjusts the clarity of the graphics accordingly while maintaining 60fps. Versatility mode, however, is the best way to play Rebirth since it remedies the choppiness of the resolution mode on the base PS5.</p><p dir="ltr">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart's Performance and Fidelity modes function similar to Spider-Man 2. The former offers the visual quality of the fidelity mode on a standard PS5 but with improved ray tracing, 60-frames-per-second performance, and sharper image quality through PSSR. Fidelity Pro, meanwhile, runs at 30 frames per second with individually tunable ray tracing, VRR, and 120hz options. Ratchet &amp; Clank in Fidelity Pro mode looks so sharp that, when I switched to it, I could feel my eyes straining to adjust to the increase in visual quality. The game is incredibly colorful and vibrant, as well as dense with characters, objects, and effects. In the best way possible, it's way too much. I didn't know where to focus because there was just so much going on that it was initially overwhelming. This is the showpiece if you want to show off your brand-new PS5 Pro. But again, for the average person, chances are if you switch to Performance Pro, you'll have to pop on specs and bust out a pointer to highlight the differences between the two modes on PS5 Pro.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>To Buy Or Not To Buy?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">That is the common thread in most of the other games I played too. In many ways, the PS5 Pro changes very little--there's an option to play games with stunning visuals albeit at a lower frame rate, and an option to play the game looking nice but performing at higher frame rates, which is the same decision that needs to be made when playing games on the standard PS5. And because of that, the little gaming gremlin in your head reminding you that you're using the inferior option that you were hoping to silence is still there, there are just new options to get caught up in.</p><p dir="ltr">PSSR and its ability to upscale and clean up images also applies to PlayStation 4 games. According to Sony, Game Boost will stabilize or improve the performance of around 8,500 backward-compatible PS4 games. There will also be enhanced image quality for some PS4 games. I decided to put this to the test for a couple of PS4 games. Like with the PS5 titles, I just used my naked eye, but this time I was able to more directly compare the games by connecting an additional PS5 console and using my European account to run the same game on both devices. Then, I could flip between them to see what, if anything, changed.</p><p dir="ltr">The games I tested were the PS4 versions of Bloodborne, Ghost of Tsushima, and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. In all three games, I observed very subtle changes in visual quality. After staring at them for long enough, I felt that they looked ever so slightly better, which I attribute to the noticeable contrast due to less of a blur in the picture quality. Once again, it's a difference subtle enough that it is easily missable, and for many people that is likely what will happen. But, while the visual difference was negligible, there was an improvement in load times to PS4 games running on the PS5 Pro. For example, Bloodborne's notoriously long transitions between locations and the Hunter's Dream are now a couple of seconds shorter in places. Going from the 1st Floor Sick Room to Hunter's Dream went from 11 seconds to nine seconds. Ghost of Tsushima, meanwhile, has a pretty long initial load that comes after the Sucker Punch logo is displayed, which is cut down on the Pro. It seems that, without developers taking specific actions to better utilize the power of the PS5 Pro, most PS4 games won't meaningfully change, and those that do need to have features like an uncapped frame rate--Bloodborne, locked at 30fps, doesn't see the oft-requested performance increase on Pro. In a similar vein, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain seems to load a bit quicker, but it wasn't egregiously bad on the PS4 anyway so the difference isn't noteworthy.</p><p dir="ltr">And so, what the PS5 Pro is overall is a device that won't have a huge impact on the way most people play or experience games. The titles that are available at the time of testing show changes that are so minuscule that I can't confidently suggest people buy it instead of one of the existing, cheaper PS5 models. It certainly doesn't help that games like Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which reportedly benefits more significantly from the power of the Pro, aren't patched yet. Nevertheless, the bigger issue the PS5 Pro faces is that it fails to pass the value-proposition check the original hardware presented. There are no new games available that demonstrate what the additional horsepower does, nor any already released games that are significantly elevated by the PS5 Pro. Worse still, Sony hasn't even given us a glimpse at the future potential for what the console <em>could</em> do.</p><p dir="ltr">That ostensibly makes the PS5 Pro fit neatly into the same category of inessential, premium-priced hardware iteration that Apple's Pro iPhones occupy. The new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/">tech specs</a> seem exciting, but once you've spent the money and have your hands on it, the impact is minimal, leaving you to think about whether your money was better spent elsewhere. The die-hard, need-to-be-on-the-bleeding-edge people will likely see some benefit, but for most people, the differences aren't essential. And if you're looking to play games in the best way possible, a PC still presents more value for money.</p><p dir="ltr">What Mark Cerny and the engineers at Sony proposed to do in the PS5 Pro reveal has been achieved to a degree. The gap between how a fidelity mode looks and the way a performance mode plays and feels is smaller. Having a technology like PSSR and a machine-learning chip in consoles is also impressive. But, for now, all of this is only exciting on paper; it's not enough to recommend over the alternative, cheaper options. And, ultimately, there is still a choice to be made between better visuals and performance, just with a less noticeable trade-off. I hope that one day the PS5 Pro really shows off what it can do to elevate games, but for now, this is a console you should get only if you've got cash to spare and just want to know you have the latest version of the console. For everyone else, a standard PS5 will do just fine.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> is removing the majority of its Interactive Specials from the streaming service.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, a Netflix spokesperson confirmed "almost all" of its interactive titles will come off the service on 1st December.</p>
<p>"Only four will remain: Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend, Ranveer vs. Wild with Bear Grylls, and You vs. Wild," Netflix told us.</p>

<p>Perhaps somewhat fittingly, Bandersnatch is about a young programmer who "begins to question reality" as he sets to work adapting a dark fantasy novel into a video game. Set in the 1980s, Bandersnatch is described as a "mind-bending tale", which features multiple endings depending on the viewer's decisions.</p>
<p>Word of Netflix's plans first started making the rounds earlier this week, when Battle Kitty series creator Matt Layzell shared an update on Instagram. Here, Layzell confirmed Netflix would be removing their original animated series from the service.</p>
<p>"It's not the ideal future I had hoped for Battle Kitty but I'm SO grateful for everyone who watched and enjoyed the show," <a href="https://x.com/AWorkersIgnited/status/1853261942951211155">Layzell wrote</a>. "As always, a huge thanks from the bottom of my heart to the entire crew who helped me bring it to life."</p>
<p>Here's the full list of <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/2869704">Interactive Specials</a> set to be removed from Netflix in the coming weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headspace: Unwind your Mind</li>

            <p>Back in the misty reaches of time (March) popular farming sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> got a big update that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valleys-huge-update-16-brings-new-items-pets-and-progression-and-more-players-in-co-op">added more pets</a> to the game (it also let you drink mayonaise but let's not get sidetracked). Those new cats, dogs, and turtles had the cute distinction of being able to wear hats, should you choose to kit your wee friends out. Now, following many months of smaller updates to the game, it seems those hats are causing a problem. "[If] you are experiencing performance issues in Stardew Valley 1.6, remove all hats from pets," said creator Eric Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853889827294650577">in a xeet</a>. When asked the lore-accurate cause of this problem, he blamed: "a strange rash".

<!--more-->
</p><p>"There's rumors of a strange rash affecting pets' ears in Zuzu City," he said in response to a player <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853890739413082199">jokingly asking for deep Valley lore</a>, "and we just want to make sure those ears can breathe for a few days."

</p><p>This isn't the first time in recent days the big man down on the farm has given lore-appropriate reasons for a bug. A couple of days ago it became clear that chickens were vanishing from some players coops. "Lore: There is a wild coyote on the farm day 1 rn," <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853521395080368514">explained Barone</a>. This would surely horrify our own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-am-going-to-become-a-battery-chicken-farmer-in-stardew-valley">battery chicken farmer</a> Alice B (RPS in peace). Thankfully, that bug has since <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/ogg/413150/announcements/detail/4445708897933590776?snr=2___">been fixed</a>, while the too-many-hats-on-animals issue is still being worked on. "We will address the problem as soon as possible," he said.

</p><p>Like all good games, Stardew Valley has had some funny bug fixes over the years, as can be seen in the many patch notes that accompany the regular updates. "Players now close their eyes when they go to bed," reads one note from <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-4-update-full-changelog/">update 1.4</a>. "Trees no longer grow on top of placed furniture items," says another in <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-5-4-patch-out-now-on-pc/">update 1.5.4</a>. "Spouses will no longer stand around looking at rug-type furniture items," states a change in <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-5-1-patch-notes/">update 1.5.1</a>. This last one caused players to get stuck when the love of their life would freeze at the sight of a floor divider and stare at it like they suddenly knew their entire life was a cosy farm simulation for anxious people. 

</p><p>Meanwhile, the developer is still working on the follow-up life sim, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>. Although splitting time between both that and Stardew updates is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/concerned-ape-is-taking-a-break-from-haunted-chocolatier-to-work-on-stardew-valleys-next-update">unsurprisingly difficult</a>.  He's previously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valley-dev-posts-another-look-at-next-game-haunted-chocolatier-sparks-immediate-fan-theories">teased a scene</a> from the upcoming game and has said it will have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valley-devs-next-game-haunted-chocolatier-will-be-more-combat-focused">"a greater focus on combat"</a> than life on the farm.</p>

            <p>Steam's built-in game recording feature has been usable in beta since the summer, but it has now been properly launched for every user, following a client update to Steam yesterday. It's basically another method of capturing funny ragdoll glitches and posting them on the "lol-games-are-dumb" channel of your friend's Discord. Or for posting that flukey knife throw in Call Of Duty to Twitter, as if you really meant to kill the man from across the map all along. Or saving a clip for your personal records, like the footage of that time you yeeted an innocent citizen off the 50-foot wall of a castle town in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragons-dogma-2">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>. We all do that, right? Right?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Steam update is accompanied by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4530150757095178610">a post explaining the ins and outs of the game recording feature</a>. It can run in the background, constantly capturing your games for up to 2 hours (much like similar program OBS, or Nvidia's Shadowplay). You can then clip things out and spread the love of jank with some clicky share buttons. It works on Steam Deck, and you can also set recording limits for each game individually, devoting a longer window of recording time to your run in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, for instance, but asking it to never record that <em>other</em> game. You know, the one you shouldn't even have installed. What, you thought I wouldn't notice? <em>Disgusting</em>.</p>
<p>Our James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-new-game-recording-beta-lets-you-instant-replay-all-those-elden-ring-deaths">tried out the recording tech during its beta</a> and quite liked Valve's method when compared to other video capture programs. It's easy to find your mp4 files, he says, and you can scrobble back through your footage instantly using the Steam overlay. If a game has special timeline features included, it'll show you icons above certain important moments, like boss fights and deaths.</p>
<p>"I employed this feature to replay my perishing at the hands of some knife-spamming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> bullshit merchant," said James, "quickly studying his moves in preparation for a more successful rematch. Neat!"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I will be happy so long as it is less cantankerous than Nvidia's own capture method using GeForce Experience - the video grabber I had been using until it recently decided it doesn't want to record anything if there is even the slightest whiff of Spotify or YouTube running in the background. Awww, is da widdle video capchah softwah afwaid of an iddy bit of copywight infwingement? GROW UP, NVIDIA. Jesus.</p><p>Elsewhere in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4472730495692571024">the client update post</a>, Valve note that this new client won't work for users still sporting Windows 7 or 8 (plus some old versions of Mac too). Alongside that there are some fixes to Big Picture mode, controller input, and the remote play feature. But that's all very boring. Go yeet a dude and clip it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sets-dev-stream-for-tomorrow-first-game-reaches-8-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> on Monday, Warhorse Studios held their first Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 developer stream yesterday afternoon. The broadcast lasted over two hours and can now be replayed <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2294365343" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitch</a> (although there are also captures available on YouTube). It featured Warhorse Global PR Manager Tobias Stolz-Zwilling and Art Director Viktor Höschl playing the game and discussing its features at length.</p>
<p>The duo talked about optimization, revealing that people will be surprised by the PC optimization. The PR Manager also said his personal PC powered by a GeForce RTX 3050 could run Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 'buttery smooth.' Moreover, he confirmed that the game won't include the Denuvo DRM on PC.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tobias Stolz-Zwilling:</strong> We are deep into optimizations and bug fixing. I'm extremely positive about the performance of the game and also about the state of the game if you're bothered by bugs. We will tell you the PC specs very soon. We are finishing it up. Right now, I can't tell you yet, but as you can see, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 runs, I think, at 80 FPS right now. I'm playing on a decent PC, of course. It's maybe even 90, so that is pretty good. I wouldn't be too worried.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Viktor Höschl:</strong> I think people will be really surprised by what kind of PC can run it.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Tobias Stolz-Zwilling: </strong>Yes, absolutely, so don't worry about that. We learned from what we did in KCD. We took way more time than in the first game for bug fixing, optimization, performance testing, and so on. We are working on this right now and not only on PC but also on consoles for the console players, so there's good news for everyone. Give us a tiny little bit more time, but I think by the end of the year we should be able to tell you exactly what you should get. I personally at home play on a 3050 GPU I think, and it runs buttery smooth. As I said, give us some time on performance testing and we will tell you soon.</em></p>
<p><em>Now, the other thing is, and give me a second of your attention here, DRM. There's things floating here in the chat; there's things floating out in the Internet, and many of those things are absolutely fake news. You should be very careful with the stuff you trust and see. I can tell you right now the exact situation, and the exact situation is that Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will not have Denuvo in there or any DRM system at all. We never confirmed it. There were some discussions, of course. There was some misalignment, there was some misinformation, but at the end of the day, there won't be any Denuvo at all.</em></p>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be released on February 11, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/brighter-shores-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Point-and-click RPGs like&nbsp;<em>Runescape</em>&nbsp;don't have much in the way of competition, and one can argue that they've gone the way of the dodo in light of the more complex MMO experiences out there. Not everyone is quite as ready to give up on this niche genre, though, and I'll tell you all about it in my&nbsp;<em>Brighter Shores</em>&nbsp;preview.</p>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="267bf6df-f6d9-4b15-924c-2ec87b4cc856" href="https://techraptor.net/games/brighter-shores"><em>Brighter Shores</em></a>&nbsp;puts players in the shoes of a new recruit to the Hopeport Guard. Though you may be seeking a simple life protecting the town, you'll soon be thrust into a world of adventure. There's a lot to love about this game, but there's also a few rather worrying problems lurking under the surface.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/brighter-shores-preview-fighting-a-looter-gobling-soldier-in-the-streets.jpg?itok=iJGzdq5N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/brighter-shores-preview-fighting-a-looter-gobling-soldier-in-the-streets.jpg?itok=FYnhJ5W8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Combat is a simple, yet engaging, turn-based experience. Your success depends on the quality of your gear more than anything else, along with the occasional use of potions or last-minute escape.</figcaption></figure><h2>Setting the Stage</h2>

<p>Your adventure in&nbsp;<em>Brighter Shores</em>&nbsp;begins in the headquarters of the Hopeport <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8f2bbaff-9df7-4667-b43e-91f1ef121dba" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/brighter-shores-guard-leveling">Guard</a>. Your character has decided to join up and you'll immediately begin your training. As narrative devices go, this is as good a start as any.</p>

<p>Players will get a tutorial for some basic mechanics including <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c981cf39-f24b-47b4-a6d2-42c99f89fbf9" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/brighter-shores-forager-leveling">foraging</a>, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="980439a5-d661-4376-a1b3-b909a2eaa03f" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/brighter-shores-alchemist-leveling">potion crafting</a>, and eventually combat. The entire tutorial can be completed in under an hour, and then you're free to explore the town of Hopeport and the wilderness beyond.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every little section of the map will have one or two things you can fight, gather, or collect, with the sole exception of NPC-specific locations such as shops and houses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a fair few named characters spread throughout the town and some fairly basic dialogue trees. It's not on the scale of what you'd expect for a port town in most MMOs, but it's a good start for a game of this scale and scope. The world feels fairly fleshed out in terms of characters.</p>

<p>You won't see much of an overarching narrative just yet, but the world of&nbsp;<em>Brighter Shores</em>&nbsp;doesn't quite feel like any other RPG. It occasionally leans towards the generic — goblins and bandits in a fantasy setting are nothing new — but there are plenty of unique design choices that make it feel like its own thing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/brighter-shores-preview-fighting-a-mutant-newt-in-episode-2.jpg?itok=6eYqZTCU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/brighter-shores-preview-fighting-a-mutant-newt-in-episode-2.jpg?itok=Kdlpog5S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Episode 2 introduces a lot more boss battles, and they're often a nice change of pace from the usual turn-based combat.</figcaption></figure><h2>Plenty of Professions</h2>

<p>As you explore <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ac1b8a2f-81ad-4589-bf3a-56a66ad38a4d" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/brighter-shores-hopeport-map-and-locations">the map of Hopeport</a>, it becomes increasingly evident that the entire area is essentially a vehicle for you to level your professions. Every little section of the map will have one or two things you can fight, gather, or collect, with the sole exception of NPC-specific locations such as shops and houses.</p>

<p>There are a total of 5 professions at the start of the game: Guard (which is a measure of your combat ability), Forager, Fishing, Chef, and Alchemist. The second Episode introduces another four professions: Scout, Gatherer, Woodcutter, and Carpenter. Each of these professions has its own experience bars and specialized tools.</p>

<p>Some of the professions will directly aid you in combat and adventuring. For example, you'll gather plants with Forager and Gatherer and convert them into potions with the Alchemist profession. Others are simply a vehicle for making money and don't yet serve any real gameplay purpose beyond that, save for the occasional quest requirement to catch a strange fish.</p>

<p>One of the interesting mechanics is the notion of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c155ce08-cc16-4eac-b857-e77d29a27576" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/brighter-shores-knowledge-and-passive-activity">"Passive Activities"</a>&nbsp;— a system that allows you to level up a single profession while you're not actively playing. You can use Passive Activities to gain a level or two overnight, but it's much slower than actively grinding out the experience in your profession of choice.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/brighter-shores-preview-the-brannof-inheritance-quest-details.jpg?itok=K3S7jmly 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/brighter-shores-preview-the-brannof-inheritance-quest-details.jpg?itok=e6ioU50P 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of the profession level requirements are far too high and, frankly, downright absurd. It can take 10–20 hours of grinding to get to Level 50 Alchemy.</figcaption></figure><h2>Back to the Grind</h2>

<p>Play&nbsp;<em>Brighter Shores</em>&nbsp;for long enough and you'll eventually encounter one of the worst things about this game: the grind. Grinding in a game like this isn't anything new, but some of the requirements are frankly absurd for a game with a handful of quests and not much else to do yet.</p>

<p>Leveling up a profession goes fairly quickly up until around Level 20; that's right about when your progress slows to a crawl. The quests for advancing to the next episode will require you to get a reasonable level of combat experience (through the Guard and Scout professions, respectively), but it's the side quests that get truly absurd with these requirements.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nearly every side quest has some requirement to get one or more professions to a certain level, and those profession level requirements are far too high for a game that is early in its development and somewhat devoid of meaningful content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, the "Forgotten Things" side quest in Episode 2 requires you to cut down a specific tree, and you can't cut that tree down until you reach Level 45 of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0d0cd20c-4754-446a-8cb0-c71bc079e50a" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/brighter-shores-woodcutter-leveling">the Woodcutter profession</a>. I actually ran a stopwatch and estimated that it would take me 28 minutes to get from Level 22 to 23, and it only gets worse from there.</p>

<p>Think about it — you would have to move around the map clicking on trees every few seconds (and doing nothing else) for 10+ hours, just to meet an absurdly high skill requirement for a side quest. And it's not as if there is an abundance of side quests, either; I only encountered three or so side quests in each Episode.</p>

<p>I'm not one to shy away from grinding — I spent two years mining asteroids in&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c4876c24-ebd4-47a9-991b-11d53a274443" href="https://techraptor.net/games/eve-online"><em>EVE Online</em></a>&nbsp;—but this feels like a bit much. Nearly every side quest has some requirement to get one or more professions to a certain level, and those level requirements are far too high for a game that is early in its development and somewhat devoid of meaningful content.</p>

<p>At its core,&nbsp;<em>Brighter Shores</em>&nbsp;has an intriguing world and serviceable gameplay mechanics for the genre. However, meaningful quests and activities are few and far between in the Early Access launch version of the game, and most of your success is measured by reaching a new level in a profession that ultimately isn't useful for much beyond making a few coins.</p>

<p>I can see&nbsp;<em>Brighter Shores</em>&nbsp;evolving into the kind of game that has a dozen great quests per Episode, a complex economy, and rewarding activities. It's not there yet, though. If you try it, you should explore all of the quests in Episode 1 — you'll quickly get a good understanding of whether or not&nbsp;<em>Brighter Shores</em>&nbsp;is the game for you.</p>

            <p>We’re still a week away from <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24143783/warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-20th-anniversary-celebration-now-live-support-cure-duchenne-and-more">Blizzard’s Warcraft 30th Anniversary</a> Direct next Wednesday the 13th of November, but art from an apparent remaster of 1995 real time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warcraft-2-tides-darkness">Warcraft II: Tides Of Darkness</a> has leaked online, via <a href="https://x.com/Stiven_SRB/status/1853933258112712918">Xibbly user Stiven</a>. It’s a thin one, as far as leaks go, but does show what looks to be cover, logo art, and a Battle.net icon. Thanks for the spot, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/it-sure-looks-like-a-warcraft-2-remaster-just-leaked-ahead-of-next-weeks-anniversary-event/">Percy Coswald Gamer</a>.</p>

<p>If you’ve got as fond memories of Warcraft 2 as I have, you may have managed to scry a flitting, copium-infused omen from Blizzard’s announcement of the event, which mentioned the first Warcraft game, Orcs And Humans. Still, this is a pleasant surprise, if one tainted by the memory of how they’ve handled the series in the recent past with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warcraft-iii-reforged">Warcraft 3: Reforged</a>, which removed many features such as offline multiplayer lobbies that players had come to expect. Whether they’ll repeat the same mistake remains to be seen, although I wouldn’t bet against them snatching defeat from the jaws of an easy win.</p>
<p>If you missed Warcraft II the first time around, that Tides Of Darkness subheader was a reference to the naval units added. In practise, this just means clicking units around some blue stuff rather than some snow, but it did feel evocative at the time, and the naval transport units added a new dimension to maps. Also, dragons!</p>
<p>As for what else to expect for the anniversary direct, Blizzard have promised <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzard-promise-something-for-everyone-in-warcrafts-30th-anniversary-direct-next-month">“something for everyone”</a> at the event, which streams at 6pm GMT/1pm ET/10am PT. This promise is, of course, a lie, because there won't be any Rock n' Roll Racing news. The stream itself will be followed by a musical event celebrating 20 years of music. If you fancy a real time portal/reminder of how utterly head-spinning it’s been to watch games get prettier in real time, I leave you with this cutscene from the original Warcraft 2:</p>

            <p>Ogres, Orcs, and Khorne are all on the way in the upcoming expansion for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>, and Creative Assembly have just released their latest dev vlog with a few more details on what to expect. There’s still no word on the exact title, although given the established naming convention (Shadows Of Change, Thrones Of Decay), I’m tentatively calling it “Sniffers Of Glue” in honour of the No Think, Only Krump faction selection.</p>
<p>You’ll find the vlog in its full glory below. What’s interesting about this one is that vlog mainstay director Rich Alridge has brought along some new faces: battle designer Josh King and audio director Chris Goldsmith. And, yes, so no-one can accuse me of burying the lede: that audio design involved the enthusiastic, deeply disgusting slurping of porridge and yoghurt, and the jangling of real bones. The source of the bones is not revealed.</p>

</ul></blockquote>
<p>Phew! Based on the number of units in previous DLCs, there’s still a fair few reveals to go, too.</p>
<p>We also get a new look at some Khrone campaign mechanics, namely a new Skull Throne screen where you’ll trade skulls for buffs. But the <em>real</em> skeleton-related news is that the jangling from Skulltaker’s cape was made with actual bones. They’re ethically sources corpse sticks, we’re assured. Again, the source of the bones is not divulged.</p>
<p>There’s also a lovely video an employee slurping yoghurt to create the eating sounds for the colossal squig. It starts around 22:15 so you can not watch it while you’re eating. Or at all.</p>
<p>There’s still no hard and fast word on when this next expansion actually releases, but the official trailer is due “later this month”. Maybeeee we’ll have an interview with Rich Aldrige too. Maybe I’ll ask him about the bones, but do let me know if you’ve got any other questions. Also, periodic reminder I wrote a massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-absolute-beginners-guide-to-getting-started-with-total-war-warhammer-and-immortal-empires">beginners guide to Total Warhammer</a> if you’ve been eyeing it from afar, but still aren’t sure where to start.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible.1028592/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of the latest <a href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1853976778366443775" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corporate Management Policy Briefing</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa confirmed that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be backward compatible with Switch games. There have been rumors about this feature for a long time, and even the president of Nintendo America <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-backward-compatibility-possibly-hinted-at-by-nintendo-of-america-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> at it around a year ago. However, getting it confirmed definitively is sure to make prospective fans happy.</p>
<p>Furukawa stated:</p>
<p><em>In addition to being able to play Nintendo Switch software they currently own, consumers will be able to choose their next purchase from a broad selection of titles released for Nintendo Switch.</em></p>
<p>More information on Nintendo Switch 2 backward compatibility is expected to be shared at a later date. The Japanese corporation still plans to announce the new console within the current fiscal year (that is to say, by March 2025).</p>
<p>Nintendo's financial results <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-cuts-yearly-forecast-after-another-weak-switch-quarter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> yesterday weren't great. The company had to lower its sales forecast for the full year. However, in his briefing, Furukawa maintained that the Switch was still selling robustly compared to previous Nintendo platforms in their eighth year.</p>
<p>He then provided an analysis of why the Switch performed so well, attributing the platform's outstanding overall results not only to the great games but also to four key structural changes: merging the handheld and home console platforms into a single one; an emphasis on consumer touchpoints; reinforcing relationships with game developers; and regional expansion to growing markets.</p>
<p>The first point is arguably the most important one. On this subject, Furukawa-san explained:</p>
<p><em>Before Nintendo Switch, we offered two types of dedicated video game platforms: home consoles and handheld systems, each with its own unique set of titles. By merging these two platforms, Nintendo Switch became a unified platform where popular series from both home consoles and handheld systems come together in one place.</em></p>
<p><em>The merging of the two platforms allowed us to integrate our software development teams. By focusing our research and development on a single platform, we have achieved a more continuous stream of new titles without major gaps. With Nintendo Switch, we introduced the concept of a portable home console, which has been well-received by our consumers worldwide. Consumers now purchase Nintendo Switch for many reasons. Not only do we see first-time users, but we also see consumers purchase additional hardware to add to their collection or replace their hardware with newer ones. At the same time, ownership patterns have shifted from “one per family” to “one per person.” Although Nintendo Switch debuted as a home console, its sales also exhibit the characteristics of a handheld system.</em></p>
<p>That's why the Nintendo Switch 2 is also going to be a hybrid console. Whereas the Japanese corporation previously employed gimmicks that only lasted a generation (the Wiimote and the Wii U Gamepad, for instance), this shift to a handheld/home console combination will pay off dividends for multiple generations, given the consumer trend of playing on the go. After much experimentation, it looks like Nintendo has found a clear path forward.</p>
