			<p>Obsidian Entertainment has briefly mentioned the Avowed release date, but the mention was quickly scrubbed from existence.</p>
<p>We finally received a new trailer for Obsidian's upcoming action RPG during yesterday's Xbox Showcase. Unfortunately, we still haven't gotten a release date for the title, which has many suggesting that a delay is likely. Interestingly enough, however, the <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/obsidian/avowed-story-trailer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official blog post</a> that accompanied that new trailer mentioned an actual release date for the title, but the mention has since been removed from existence. Luckily, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240609233558/https://www.obsidian.net/news/obsidian/avowed-story-trailer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cached sample</a> of the blog still mentions the planned release date - November 12, 2024. We've included a screenshot of the cached page below:</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/avowed-release-date.png"></a></figure>

<p>At the moment of writing, the blog post doesn't mention a release date at all. "The last few months at Obsidian Entertainment have been fast-paced and exciting", the edited blog now reads. "Since we saw you at the Xbox Developer Direct this past January, we’ve been busy with Avowed. Today, we’re thrilled to have revealed our first-ever story trailer at Xbox Games Showcase 2024, and to talk with you more about what we’ve shared."</p>
<p>Possibly, Avowed's Game Director mentioned an initially planned release date, but this date was changed around due to other Xbox titles releasing in the same time frame. Still, we're pretty sure that fans of Avowed will find this interesting.</p>
<p>Whether Avowed will indeed launch on November 12th remains to be seen, but at this point, we don't think that's likely.</p>
<p>Avowed was <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-announced-for-xbox-series-x-and-pc-by-obsidian-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially announced</a> for Xbox and PC back in July of 2020. Down below we've included some additional info on the game:</p>
<p><em>Welcome to the Living Lands, a mysterious island filled with adventure and danger.</em><br>
<em>Set in the fictional world of Eora that was first introduced to players in the Pillars of Eternity franchise, Avowed is a first-person fantasy action RPG from the award-winning team at Obsidian Entertainment.&nbsp;</em><em>You are the envoy of Aedyr, a distant land, sent to investigate rumors of a spreading plague throughout the Living Lands - an island full of mysteries and secrets, danger and adventure, and choices and consequences, and untamed wilderness. You discover a personal connection to the Living Lands and an ancient secret that threatens to destroy everything. Can you save this unknown frontier and your soul from the forces threatening to tear them asunder?</em></p>

        <blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Weird farming meets silly physics in <em>Southfield</em>! Combine chaotic crops with unpredictable effects, build your dream farmstead, and experiment with playful machinery. Wobble your way around an ever-changing island solo or with up to three friends and unearth its secrets.</p><p><strong>Welcome to Southfield</strong></p><p>Southfield is no ordinary island, and this is no ordinary farming game. Combine cartoony crops with chaotic effects, and customize your farm with fun toys and machines to automate your harvest. Whether you’re a solo explorer, or you’re looking for a new destination to play with friends—Southfield is the place to be!</p><p><strong>Combine Chaotic Crops</strong></p><p>Things grow differently in Southfield, so you’ll quickly learn to expect the unexpected. Your harvest could bounce, go boom, chime a tune, or change shape. We’re talking about crops that radiate, illuminate, even levitate, and that’s before you mix crops together to create something entirely new! Complete quests, experiment with crops, and check off combinations in your trusty Almanac.</p><p><strong>Be More Bud</strong></p><p>You’re a Bud. A big, bouncy Bud, freshly sprouted from the land itself. Nobody knows where these delightfully silly creatures came from, but now it’s your job to help these uncoordinated island dwellers navigate farm life. Flip, flop, and fling yourself into all kinds of physics-based fun. Play online with up to three other Buds, and give yourselves a unique look with customizable colors and quirky outfits.</p><p><strong>Experiment with Machines</strong></p><p>As your farm grows, so does your to-do list! Free up time for more tractor <a title="Genres > Racing [184 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> and lily-pad jumping with fun farming automation. From trampolines to air cannons, there’s a myriad of toys and machines to help you get the most out of each harvest. Use these same tools to build obstacle courses or life-sized pinball machines for you and your friends.</p><p><strong>Build Your Own Way</strong></p><p>Go wild with creative sandbox tools to construct super unique builds in <em>Southfield</em>! Treat your Buds like royalty with their very own stone castle, or live a simpler life in little wooden lodgings. With plenty of materials and customisations to create your dream farmstead, the sky is (literally) the limit… Buds don’t belong in space.</p><p><strong>Beware the Ruffians</strong></p><p>Buds aren’t the only inhabitants of this strange and unpredictable island. As night settles, a shadow grows, a mysterious Monolith looms, and out come the Ruffians. Southfield’s spectral mischief makers are out to cause chaos for you and your crops, and it’s up to you to defend yourself and your farm. Contend with wild weather, protect your harvest, help the other island-dwellers, and restore balance to Southfield—even if your Bud loses balance along the way.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Early Access Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Southfield - Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2NkfRH4AWa8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/starfields-june-2024-update-introduces-the-creation-kit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Creation Kit mods incoming.</h2></div><section><p>After teasing that a brand-new update would arrive in Starfield later today, Bethesda Game Studios has officially released the June 2024 update for Starfield, which introduces the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2722710/Starfield_Creation_Kit/?linkId=100000266072161" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creation Kit</a>, new Trackers Alliance missions, and more. </p><p>In a new blog post, Bethesda has detailed all the new features coming into Starfield update 1.12.30. Most notably, this month's update introduces Creations, an editing tool that allows players to create mods and share them with other players via Bethesda.net. Players can pay for these mods via Creation Credits. The Creation Kit has been featured in several Bethesda Game Studios-developed titles like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Fallout 4. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>More interestingly, Bethesda notes that those who purchased the Premium Edition of Starfield will find 1,000 Creation Credits available on their account after installing the latest update. While it seems odd to provide those select players with Creation Credits, given the tool was just released, <a href="https://youtu.be/7wvqF41_Bgw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview with KindaFunny in April</a>, Todd Howard revealed that a Creation Kit for Starfield was given to some creators. </p><p>The announcement comes hours after Bethesda's parent company, Xbox, held a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-and-black-ops-6-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">Summer Games showcase</a>. At the showcase, the developer also provided the first official trailer for its upcoming story expansion, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfields-shattered-space-dlc-first-official-trailer-gives-players-a-first-look-at-house-varuuns-homeworld-xbox-games-showcase-2024">Shattered Space</a>, which will be released sometime later this year.</p><p>You can check out the full patch notes below.  </p><h2><strong>Starfield Update 1.12.30 Update Notes</strong></h2><p><strong>Update Highlights</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Creations are here! Creations are now available in Starfield. What does that mean? You can now access and play new content in Starfield. Creations may include new missions, gear, skins, weapons, and more! You’ll also find Bethesda Game Studios Creations including one of the new Trackers Alliance missions, The Vulture. You can find Creations via the in-game menu. For those of you who own Starfield's Premium Edition, you will also find 1000 Creation Credits within this menu.</li><li>If creating your own content for Starfield is something that interests you, you may also now download the Creation Kit for Starfield on Steam. Note, this is a separate download from the game download and is only available on Steam.</li><li>Trackers Alliance Missions Available New missions have been added to Starfield as part of this update. Trackers Alliance establishes the first of several missions enabling you to live your best bounty-hunting life. The first mission, The Starjacker will have you in contact with a mysterious Tracker located in settlements throughout the Settled Systems. From there, let the hunts begin!</li><li>The second Trackers Alliance mission, The Vulture is available within the new Creations menu. And what bounty hunter is without their trusted methods to get the job done?</li><li>Bounty Scanning and Mission Boards! This update also introduces the bounty scanner system that enables you to seek and destroy (or peacefully resolve...?) those targets with bounties on their heads. If you still want more, you can also check out the Elite Trackers Alliance mission board.</li><li>Armed and Ever Ready!

But it’s come at a huge price, and one the company doesn’t seem ready to acknowledge publicly. </p><div data-video-id="191188" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Thank You, PS Plus, For Making My Backlog Even Bigger" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="125" data-playlist="191188,196181,196230" data-current="191188"><div><p>Thank You, PS Plus, For Making My Backlog Even Bigger</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191188/191188_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191188/191188_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191188/191188_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191188/191188_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/17210.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Insiders had been hyping the showcase for days, in part due to the fact that its full list of reveals and announcements had already leaked to some in the media and beyond. Fans have been burned before, expecting Xbox to finally turn a corner only to have the football pulled once again and realize the platform is still in another one of its inescapable “rebuilding” years. The proof is always in the games themselves, and how successful they are can only really be determined once they get into players’ hands. For now, though, the showcase delivered. </p><p>There was over sixty minutes of games big and small, offering everything from zombie survival to nostalgic teen hangout, punctuated by massive first-party franchises and third-party teases. If you own an Xbox Series X/S there will be plenty to play this year and next. Xbox game studios head Matt Booty’s perennial promise for a steady cadence of quarterly Xbox games worth showing up for might finally come true. The only thing missing from the event was any accountability for what, and who, Microsoft has sacrificed to get here. </p><p>It’s been just over a month since the company announced <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-closing-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-1851460685&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-closing-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-1851460685">it’s shutting down three studios and reshuffling a fourth</a></span>. One of the casualties, Tango Gameworks, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-shut-down-xbox-studios-1851461379&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-shut-down-xbox-studios-1851461379">its 2023 hit <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a></span>, seemed to symbolize the best of Xbox in the Game Pass era: a hyper-stylized passion project from a newer team that wowed critics and won awards and wouldn’t have been possible without the “let a thousand flowers bloom” strategy behind the platform’s pivot to a Netflix-like subscription library. In a crushing reversal, however, the deep-pocketed tech giant cut the team, along with storied immersive sim makers Arkane Austin and others. According to internal comments from Booty and the head of parent company Zenimax, there just wasn’t enough bandwidth for one of the three most valuable companies in the world to manage so many studios.</p><p>The bad news and bullshit explanation might not have gone down like a lead balloon if Microsoft hadn’t announced mass layoffs just months earlier across several departments, including newly acquired Activision Blizzard. The cuts hit everyone from the <em>Overwatch 2 </em>team to <em>Call of Duty</em> makers Sledgehammer Games, and included the cancellation of <em>Odyssey</em>, a survival crafting fantasy game that might have become the first new franchise from Blizzard in nearly a decade. Microsoft spent $69 billion on the acquisition, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer toured the Activision Blizzard King offices shortly after the deal was finalized last fall, and then in early 2024 the mask came off. </p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer blamed the heel turn on a combination of investor pressure and the stagnation of the console gaming market in interviews with <em>Game File</em> and <em>Polygon</em>. In other words: capitalism. But  the complete closure of Tango Gameworks, originally founded by <em>Resident Evil </em>director Shinji Mikami to train a new generation of creatives, seemed especially capricious.  The Xbox team didn’t mention the developers it’s laid off and their contributions in its remarks to a live audience ahead of the showcase today, or during the pre-recorded event itself. (Even after learning its fate, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/redfall-final-update-arkane-austin-1851509877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/redfall-final-update-arkane-austin-1851509877">Arkane Austin worked hard</a></span> to push out <em>Redfall</em>’s much-needed final update.)</p><p>Instead, Spencer opened the showcase by promoting <em>Black Ops 6</em> and the company’s desire to bring one of the most popular franchises to even more players through <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-game-pass-day-one-1851503214&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-game-pass-day-one-1851503214">the power of a $17-a-month subscription</a></span>. It maybe wasn’t surprising given the billions Microsoft paid to acquire the series, but the choice to open the show this way underscored the new reality of an Xbox brand that now needs to make a return worthy of all of those investments. “I haven’t been talking publicly about this, because right now is the time for us to focus on the team and the individuals,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spencer told <em>IGN</em> later in the day</a></span>, away from the hundreds of thousands of fans tunning into the showcase. </p><p>He continued:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>It’s obviously a decision that’s very hard on them, and I want to make sure through severance and other things that we’re doing the right thing for the individuals on the team. It’s not about my PR, it’s not about Xbox PR. It’s about those teams. In the end, I’ve said over and over, I have to run a sustainable business inside the company and grow, and that means sometimes I have to make hard decisions that frankly are not decisions I love, but decisions that somebody needs to go make.</p></blockquote><p>The showcase, meanwhile, didn’t even clear <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-geoff-keighley-layoff-palworld-balatro-1851527203&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-geoff-keighley-layoff-palworld-balatro-1851527203">the bar set days prior by Geoff Keighley</a></span> at the Game Awards host’s own showcase.

But the future is built on the past, and every shiny new Xbox game now comes with the question of what will happen to the teams Microsoft has purchased or partnered with, once it no longer feels like they serve its bottom line. </p><p><em>Update 6/9/2024 9:10 p.m. ET: Added comments from Spencer’s post-show interview with </em>IGN<em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft held its annual Xbox Games Showcase on Sunday afternoon, and with it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-summer-games-showcase-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came a look at 30 games</a> and the announcement of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-three-new-series-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three new series consoles</a>. What wasn’t announced, however, was the highly rumored Xbox Handheld that the company is working on. In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-xbox-handheld-rumors-being-able-to-play-games-locally-is-really-important-ign-live-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Xbox head Phil Spencer talked about the lack of an announcement and where things stand.</p>



<p>“The future for us in hardware is pretty awesome,” Spencer told the outlet. “The work that the team is doing around different form factors, different ways to play, I’m incredibly excited about.</p>



<p> “Today was about the games… but we will have a time to come out and talk more about platform, and we can’t wait to bring it to you.”</p>



<p>Spencer was then asked if this new handheld would be a cloud-only system, or if it would all for local installations and gameplay. To that Spencer said that playing games locally on a handheld is “really important.”</p>



<p>There’s no timetable on when this rumored Xbox handheld console will happen. However, with Spencer not denying it’s existence, it seems to be only a matter of time before gamers get something more concrete on that front.</p>

The work that the team is doing around different form factors, different ways to play, I'm incredibly excited about," Spencer said. "Today was about the games... but we will have a time to come out and talk more about platform, and we can't wait to bring it to you."</p><p>When asked if a hypothetical Xbox handheld would be a dedicated gaming platform where you can play games locally (like a Steam Deck or Nintendo Switch), or a cloud-based handheld, Spencer responded: "I think being able to play games locally is really important."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Rumors about a possible Xbox handheld console have been swirling for months, with many expecting some kind of announcement at today's showcase. Those rumors were fueled by the trove of leaked Microsoft documents last fall, which revealed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-major-revelations-from-the-ftc-vs-xbox-court-document-leaks">plans for an Xbox handheld</a>. Spencer, however, would later come out to say those plans were outdated.</p><p>Xbox has hinted at new hardware in the near-ish future, with Microsoft <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-next-gen-console-confirmed-business-update">announcing a multi-year roadmap</a> in February that includes a next-generation Xbox console. And, while neither Spencer nor any other Xbox leadership had confirmed the existence of it, Spencer did go so far as to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-official-xbox-handheld-rumors-swirl-phil-spencer-reveals-what-he-wants-from-it">say what he would want from a handheld Xbox</a> in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-official-xbox-handheld-rumors-swirl-phil-spencer-reveals-what-he-wants-from-it">Polygon</a> in March. </p><p>At the time, Spencer listed various features that would make a handheld console "feel like an Xbox," including having access to all your games with associated save files: "What should we build that will find new players?” he said at the time. “That will allow people to play at times when they couldn’t go play [in the past]?”</p><p>Elsewhere during our interview with Spencer, he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024">addressed the recent closure of Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks</a>.

		<p>During the PC Games Show, tinybuild revealed that Streets of Rogue 2 will be released into Steam Early Access on August 14th. This release has been somewhat delayed, as Streets of Rogue 2 was originally aiming for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/05/streets-of-rogue-2-will-be-entering-early-access-in-2023/">a 2023 early access release</a>. This early access release promises a lot of content, with much more to be added before Street of Rogue 2’s full release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Streets of Rogue 2 - Release Date Trailer (feat. Perturbator)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/giKX3jFF47A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the initial early access phase of Streets of Rogue 2, players will be able to play as numerous characters who all have their own skillsets, including a tech-savvy hacker, an agile ninja, and culinary chef. Whichever character you choose, there are multiple ways to approach the procedurally generated open world of Streets of Rogue 2. You can go on a huge destructive spree to topple the President and take over the nation, or help people for rewards. You can build up a criminal empire or a business empire, and use those proceeds to gain power in the world too. There will be ample exploration opportunities by land and sea, using fast cars and fast boats. When it comes to fighting, your weapons arsenal could include flamethrowers and banana peels.</p>
<p>There is no need to play Streets of Rogue to understand the story of Streets of Rogue 2, but the games do take place in the same universe. The game will eventually feature four player co-op both locally and online, with there being scope to potentially increase the number of online players and increase the carnage, though this is likely to happen later on in early access, if not after the full launch of Streets of Rogue 2.</p>

"It’s a franchise that I think everyone deserves to play. When I was in a meeting with Marty a couple years ago, I asked Marty what he wanted to do, and he said he wanted to sell it on all platforms.

		<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/30/antistatic-studio-founded-by-ex-cyberpunk-2077-and-bioshock-devs/">Antistatic Studio was founded by ex Cyberpunk 2077 and BioShock devs</a>, and at the time it announced Project Hornet. Now, Antistatic Studio has confirmed the real name of Project Hornet is Phantom Line, and revealing new information about the game as well as giving the chance to register for its playtest.</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Line - Reveal Trailer - Join the paranormal SWAT" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vf0EsjF4uOQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Phantom Line drops players into a version of Eastern Europe which has become embroiled in a global nuclear war. Amidst the chaos of nuclear war, Phantom Line hones in on a different threat, that of paranormal origins, that teams must confront. The game supports up to four players in an open-world setting, where they must navigate and survive dynamic events that will be full of dangers. Within Phantom Line’s lore, players’ consciousnesses are transferred into artificial bodies known as HUSKs, which are essentially avatars for scouting and combating paranormal threats. The game’s home base is set on an icebreaker ship, serving as a hub where players can upgrade and personalise their HUSKs, as well as manage their equipment, weapons, and armour. This ship also serves as the location for mission briefings,where players will learn more about the threats that plague the world.</p>
<p>Antistatic Studios has confirmed that there will be a playtest for Phantom Line, and if you want to join you will need to be part of the studio’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/uHheyk2PBA">Discord channel</a>. The playtest is set to be taking place later in the summer, though an exact date is yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ysbryd Games and developer Necrosoft have announced the&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>release date, so if you're hankering for some&nbsp;<em>Devil Survivor</em>-style tactical RPG action, you won't have much longer to wait.</p>
<p>As announced during today's PC Gaming Show presentation,&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>will launch across PC and consoles (although not Xbox One, it seems) on September 13th. It'll be playable on Steam Deck, too.</p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-persona-inspired-tactics-rpg-announced">announced back in 2022</a>,&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>will bring&nbsp;tactical RPG action inspired by&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor</em>, old-school&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>games (think&nbsp;<em>Persona 1&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>2&nbsp;</em>rather than more recent entries), and Italian giallo-style horror movies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demonschool-release-date-boss.jpg?itok=Xhb1E0St 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demonschool-release-date-boss.jpg?itok=iBWepkD7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>will probably bring back warm, fuzzy memories if you're an old-school&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>fan.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will revolve around Faye, the last in a line of demon-hunters, as she tries to navigate university life on "a mysterious island".</p>
<p>While doing so, she must also contend with "big weirdos in between the human and demon worlds", which sounds very much like the same kind of supernatural-mundane mix&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>is going for.</p>
<p><em>Demonschool</em>'s tactical battling will allow you not only to plan out moves in advance, but also to rewind actions during the planning stage of combat, giving you greater control over your strategy.</p>
<p>You can check out the release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>right here. It should give you a good idea of what to expect from both the game's art style and its tactical systems.</p>

<p>Faye will be assisted along the way by several companions, including kind pugilist Destin, "photography nerd" Namako, and "pragmatic media enthusiast" Knute.</p>
<p>In battle, you'll be able to buff your companions for extra damage and support, and you'll likely need to if you want to overcome some of&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>'s tougher challenges.</p>
<p><em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on September 13th. It's looking like a must-play if you're a fan of Atlus' old-school RPGs and&nbsp;<em>Devil Survivor&nbsp;</em>in particular.</p>

        <p>New console options "join our current console line-up", Microsoft says.</p>

            <p>
Tonight, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reveals-three-new-xbox-console-variants">Microsoft announced a trio of new Xbox Series X/S consoles</a>, including a digital-only Xbox Series X.
</p>
<p>
In part, these seemed similar to the consoles seen in leaked plans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-xbox-series-xs-consoles-detailed-in-enormous-microsoft-leak">released into the public domain in error last year</a> that awkwardly trumpeted an "adorably all-digital" future for Xbox - something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-a-good-thing-microsoft-now-says-its-adorably-all-digital-future-plans-are-outdated">Microsoft's Phil Spencer later said was outdated</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But how much has changed? The new digital-only Series X is white, as expected, with are no major performance upgrades under the hood. It's no longer cylindrical, and keeps the regular Series X's rectangular design. Most importantly, though, it will be accompanied - initially, at the very least - by a new Series X option that retains its disc slot. This "special edition" 2TB Xbox Series X will be available in "limited quantities", Microsoft said. 
</p>

<p>
All of this prompts several questions. How limited are those quantities, should you want a disc-based Series X? And what will happen to existing disc-based Series X (and for that matter, the current Series S) when these new models go on sale?
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer contacted Microsoft to ask whether the current Xbox Series X/S models will still be manufactured and sold when the new versions join the line-up.
</p>
<p>
"The three new Xbox Series X/S options will join our current console lineup," a Microsoft spokesperson said in response, before listing out all five models set to be available this Christmas. 
</p>
<p>
"This holiday, players will have the choice of Xbox Series S ($299.99 USD ERP), Xbox Series S - 1TB ($349.99/€349.99), Xbox Series X - 1TB Digital Edition ($449.99/€499.99 ERP), Xbox Series X -1TB with ODD ($499.99 USD ERP), and Xbox Series X - 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition ($599.99/€649.99 ERP). Console availability will vary by market."
</p>
<p>
For now, then, Microsoft is clearly only committing to the Xbox console line-up available as of this Christmas, or "holiday". What happens in 2025, or even later into this console generation, remains an open question. But perhaps, six months out from the new consoles' launch and with the sales performance of these new consoles still to be tested, some of this does remain an open question even within Microsoft itself. 
</p>
<p>
If you did want to buy an Xbox Series X with a disc drive (handy, if nothing else, to support your existing Xbox 360/Xbox One back catalogue), you still have time - for now.

            <p>
The god of video games news is vengeful, for this weekend He has sent forth a flood of game announcements to wipe out any remaining game journalists from this earth. Come at me, God! What have you got? Ah. It’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ale-abbey">Ale Abbey</a>, a management game about brewing beer in a monastery of medieval monks, and between making craft ales the priests get tipsy on their own supply. You can’t fool me, god of game reveals, this one has been openly in the works <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/aleabbey/699261">on GameJolt for 2 years</a>. But, yes, I suppose now that the developer is teaming up with the Northgard creators as a publisher, the people must know.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Ale Abbey shares some cute factor with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-dev-story-and-more-kairosoft-manage-em-ups-are-now-on-steam">Game Dev Story</a> and other lite sims ending in “Story”, but it looks more involved than your average Kairosoft clickathon. “No pre-made recipes in Ale Abbey, oh no. It's a canvas for true beer alchemists,” say developers Hammer &amp; Ravens. We're looking at lots of lager, here.
</p>
<p>
“Dive into a vast array of over 20 European styles, meticulously choosing the equipment that best suits your needs. Adjust the quantity, quality, and mash temperature to blend the perfect brew. Decide whether to store it for aging, or sell it at the market.”
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/ale-abbey-announced-1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Meanwhile you’ll have to build parts of the monastery as you go. Digging into the ground below to make space for cellars, while housing your holy folk upstairs, with living quarters, refectories, libraries and offices. There are also hints of some trouble beyond your big wooden doors. “Appease Lords, befriend neighboring abbeys, and handle bandit encounters,” say the developers. 
</p>
<p>
The sloshed seminarian sim was shown off during the PC Gaming Show, part of the fragmentary summer game news deluge. Aka, the slow-motion blood spatter resulting from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-will-miss-e3-for-its-spectacle-but-mostly-because-it-only-lasted-one-week-not-months">E3’s violent death</a>. It hasn't got an exact release date yet, but it's planning to hit Steam some time in late 2024, the creators say. </p>
<p>Like I say, the team behind the frothy friars have already been keeping <a href="https://www.indiedb.com/games/ale-abbey-in-hops-we-trust">a thorough development log</a>, exploring the fine details of their pixel art sim. But now it seems to have been picked up by Shiro Unlimited as a publisher. Shiro are the folks behind very solid viking RTS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/northgard">Northgard</a> and the equally solid sci-fi strategy of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-spice-wars">Dune: Spice Wars</a>. I guess they publish other people's games now too? Cool. Yeah, no worries. Good on ‘em.

Revealed during today's PC Gaming Show, Our Darkest Days is an upcoming entry in the PC and mobile Into The Dead franchise. In Darkest Days, players are brought to the height of a zombie outbreak during the sweltering summer of 1980 Texas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's a side-scrolling shelter survival game in which players attempt to escape Walton City before it's completely overrun. To survive, players must scavenge, craft, fight, and plan their next moves.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days gameplay teaser below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xHZO5ugMIWw" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>"Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days' PC Gaming Show teaser showcases three cornerstones of the game: planning, adapting, and surviving," a press release reads. "Scavenge various locations for valuable materials, carefully avoiding zombies in heavily infected areas. Balance the needs and well-being of each survivor, and upgrade meager shelters with fortifications and amenities to make it through the night before selecting new locations to explore the following day."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our Darkest Days features difficult in-game decisions, survivor permadeath, and of course, plenty of zombies.</p>

<p><strong>Here are some additional screenshots of the game</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>It's due out on PC via Steam Early Access in 2025, but a demo is coming to Steam this October.&nbsp;</p>

The news comes via the PC Gaming Show, which also premiered a new trailer for the open-world sandbox game.</p>

<p>Set in a living, procedurally generated world, Streets of Rogue 2 gives players one task: take down a corrupt president. How they accomplish that is up to them. Whether that means helping citizens with their problems or causing absolute chaos, the game gives players the freedom to twist and bend its colorful, destructible world to their whims. Sporting a variety of playable characters with unique talents, such as a ninja, chef, or hacker, you can cruise around in cars, boats, and other vehicles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's no word on how long Streets of Rogue 2 will be in Early Access, but creator Matt Dabrowski says to expect "multiple exciting updates" as it gears up for a 1.0 launch.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="369" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Jump Over The Age has released the first gameplay trailer for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/citizen-sleeper-2-interview-pc-sequel-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citizen Sleeper 2</a></em> during the PC Gaming Show 2024. Not only that, but we also know roughly when we can expect to be able to play the game, both of which are enough to give you the drive to hop back into the original and try for another ending to refresh your memory of this universe ahead of time. </p> <p data-characters="546" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true"><em>Citizen Sleeper 2 </em>will be released in <em>early 2025</em> for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch. So don’t worry. There’s no need to clear your schedule just yet. It’ll be a lovely little bonus game you can play when winter rears its head again, right when you think spring has arrived. The new trailer shows that, unlike the previous game, you’re going to be exploring multiple systems across an asteroid belt and picking up a crew who will help you on your journey as you push forward to avoid those hunting you down. </p>
 <h2 id="h-explore-a-complex-collection-of-locations-within-an-asteroid-belt-while-living-on-the-run-in-sleeper-citizen-2" data-injectable="false">Explore a complex collection of locations within an asteroid belt while living on the run in <em>Sleeper Citizen 2</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Citizen Sleeper 2 - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3DdETwG_eyo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true">In <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em>, you play as a Sleeper. These are artificial bodies that house human minds, and they’re pretty useful in a workforce. The trouble is, not all Sleepers want to be workers forever. Unlike the previous game, this time around, you’re on the run from a criminal gang who wants to capture you. </p>
 <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">To do this, you’re going to use a ship to stay one step ahead of your enemies, but you’ll need a crew. Thankfully, a fellow escapee named Serafin joins you from the word go, but the asteroid belt is filled with all sorts of characters who you can recruit or ask for advice on others who might be able to help you out. </p> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">Those who played the first game will be familiar with the core mechanics you’re going to be dealing with in <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em>. Your Sleeper body is broken, malfunctioning to the point where you need to repair it now and then or die. But you’ll also have to take on dangerous missions and favors for the characters you meet, forcing you to choose between your needs and the potential gains. </p>
 <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true">Almost every action requires a dice roll. There are variations to these that can alter them in your favor, but for the most part, you’re at the mercy of the roll of a dice. As you craft your character with the game’s RPG system, you’ll build a strong Sleeper who can better make decisions and take actions that will succeed more than they fail, allowing you to conquer this mini-system and escape the pursuing gang once and for all. </p>
 <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/citizen-sleeper-review-pc-steam-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Citizen Sleeper</em> </a>was set in a single space station and managed to make it feel like a rich, living world. I have no doubt that Jump Over The Age will be able to do the same with a collection of hubs scattered throughout an asteroid belt, and I can’t wait to see how they’ve built upon the lore of the first title. </p>

            <p>Citizen Sleeper 2 is coming in early 2025, publishers Fellow Traveller have announced, and it's also going to be releasing on PlayStation 5 and Switch alongside the already confirmed Xbox Series S/X, Game Pass and PC versions. </p>
<p>Unveiled at tonight's PC Gaming Show during its first proper gameplay trailer, Citizen Sleeper 2 will see you wake up in the body of a brand-new Sleeper android who's fighting for survival out on the Starward Belt on the edge of the Helion System. We've known for a while that Citizen Sleeper 2 is going to be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-update-reveals-first-new-location-game-pass-release">much bigger game</a> than the original, but tonight's trailer gave us a taste of just how large the Belt actually is, as it will have its own navigable map screen, along with lots of different space ports and unique locations to visit along the way.  </p>

<p>We also get to see some of the characters we'll be meeting when we get there. Unlike the first game, though, they'll be joining your crew as valuable team mates here, and will live alongside you in your ship as you travel between locations. You'll also be able to draw on their unique skills and character traits when taking on big contract jobs, too, as each crew member you recruit will have their own set of dice rolls to use to help you complete tasks and get the job done.  </p>
<p>Contracts will take place in dedicated locations, too, far away from the hustle and bustle of the spaceports where you'll have heard about them in the first place. As such, you'll need to prepare accordingly before you take one on, as they can quickly blow up in your face (literally, judging by the gameplay trailer) if you attempt them before you're ready. </p>
<p>There looks to be plenty of double-crossing and wavering loyalities to navigate, however, and making peace with all of your newfound stablemates will form a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/citizen-sleeper-2-is-real-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">big part of Citizen Sleeper 2's underlying story</a>. </p>
<p>Beyond these new additions, Citizen Sleeper 2 will no doubt feel very familiar to returning players. It's still chock full of the same tabletop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-rpgs">RPG</a> inspirations that defined the original game, and you'll still be rolling plenty of dice to determine the outcome of your actions. </p>
<p>Of course, we already know that you won't be dependent on keeping your health topped up with stabiliser shots in this sequel, but there are new systems at play here that you'll need to keep an eye on instead. It's easy to miss from the trailer, but Stress looks to play an important role in Citizen Sleeper 2, and managing this (both across yourself and your growing number of crew members) will no doubt prove to be quite the balancing act when it launches early next year.  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/2024/6/9/24173143/generation-exile-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="7p8OEf">Steam is flooded with city builders right now (I’m playing <em>Fabledom</em>, for instance), and most of them are relatively similar. Which is why, for me, the excitement of starting a new city builder comes in the form of new art styles, interesting combat mechanics, and compelling stories. But former Klei Entertainment developer Nel Anderson’s new company, <a href="https://sonderluststudios.com/">Sonderlust Studios</a>, is bringing novelty to the genre with its first game, <em>Generation Exile</em>, announced with a trailer on Sunday.</p>
<p id="Qghi8g"><em>Generation Exile</em> is a pretty city builder like any other, but this one has a distinctly anti-colonialist, environmentally sound aspect: Rather than bore into your new land for resources, ultimately destroying what it once was, <em>Exile</em> challenges players to use only the resources they had with them when they left their old world in the last-ever generation ship.  That includes water, food, and even air. Gameplay will also include turn-based combat as well as the typical tasks of creating abodes and amenities, amassing resources, and keeping your residents content.</p>

<p id="ES1gil">Over email, Anderson, who works as Sonderlust’s creative director, aptly explained to Polygon what the game’s trying to do: Lots of city builders, he explained, are “fundamentally extractive and reward — if not demand — growing infinitely.” That means in order to continue in the game, you have to continuously bore into the earth, cut down trees, mine caves, etc. <em>Generation Exile</em>, on the other hand, pushes players to work in tandem with the new environment.</p>
<p id="Aqt8Vc">“Rather than simply ‘number get bigger’ we wanted to make the problem-solving space more about seeking balance,” Anderson said. “Rather than pulling more raw materials out of the ground for refinement, progress might instead look like developing a series of anaerobic lagoons that transform the biological waste (that must be stored and managed regardless) into nutrients for growing food or source crops for bioplastics.”</p>
<p id="MJH2mf">Time will move ultra-fast to account for several generations of your in-game society, which is comprised of procedurally-generated characters so no two games are the same. In fact, the generation of new maps and characters is a major part of how Sonderlust’s developers plan to accomplish that balance.</p>
<p id="gd0HRP">“While the player of course interacts with the map portion of the game from a familiar birds eye-ish viewpoint, they aren’t some disembodied force of civic will or an otherwise nameless and uncharacterized overseer,” Anderson said. Instead, player characters will have reputations and bespoke interactions with NPCs “triggered procedurally in reaction to the game’s state and decisions the player has made.”</p>
<p id="VLWjXK">The premise is enough to pique my interest, but the lineup of devs and designers is even more impressive. Sonderlust is also calling in its chief operating officer, Karla Zimonja, co-creator of <em>Gone Home</em>, and some developers who worked on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23837019/baldurs-gate-3-review-dungeons-dragons"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/26/17164878/far-cry-5-review-ps4-pc-xbox-one"><em>Far Cry 5</em></a><em>. </em>As for sound design, Ben Prunty from <em>Into the Breach </em>will collaborate with the audio team from <em>Celeste</em>, Power Up Audio.</p>

<p id="TnahkF">The early looks at the game are moody in a late-summer-afternoon type way, with an intriguing honeycomb city structure and lots of overgrown ’50s-looking buildings. The UI also looks modern (and <em>big enough to read</em>, ahem) — a welcome change from your average city builder. </p>
<p id="XjAoyD">“The art style of Generation Exile was inspired in part by fauvism,” said Pier-Olivier Desbiens, 3D environment artist for Sonderlust Studios. “It’s a polygonal stab at the bold colors &amp; flat strokes of the movement, with a heavy emphasis on simplifying shapes and objects so only the essential remains. The main goal was to create a world that feels familiar yet mysterious through the use of unusual, saturated color palettes.”</p>
<p id="KEdiy3"><em>Generation Exile</em> doesn’t have a release date yet. When it’s released, it’ll be available on Steam and other consoles to be announced. </p>

<p>When Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches, everyone starts from scratch. That means load-outs, skins, weapons, and gear won’t carry forward from Modern Warfare 2 and 3 to Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>“We want to make sure that everybody starts fresh, together, as we move into an all-new experience with the launch of&nbsp;Call of Duty: Black Ops 6,” <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-worldwide-reveal-announcement#Carry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision said</a>. “Allowing everyone to experience the&nbsp;Black Ops&nbsp;universe the way it’s meant to be played, learning the era-specific weapons and gear, learning the gameplay innovations like Omnimovement, and keeping that signature&nbsp;Black Ops&nbsp;style is important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Therefore,&nbsp;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare®&nbsp;II&nbsp;and&nbsp;Modern Warfare III&nbsp;content will not carry forward to the&nbsp;Black Ops 6&nbsp;Premium experience.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There will be one exception to the rule, however. The Black Ops 6 Vault Edition Woods Operator Pack that includes the Classic Woods Operator Skin will be available in Modern Warfare 3 and Black Ops 6. Also, Warzone players will still get Carry Forward content for Season 1 of the next game including content from Modern Warfare 2, 3, and Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, and Game Pass.</p>

<p>When Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches in October, players will be required to be online at all times no matter what they want to play. That means even playing the campaign requires an internet connection.</p>



<p>“To deliver the highest-quality visuals while also reducing the game’s overall storage space on your hard drive, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will use texture streaming across all game modes,” Activision says. </p>



<p>“This means you’ll need a continuous internet connection to play any game mode, including Campaign. If you’re on a console, Campaign can be played without a premium subscription service such as Game Pass Core or PlayStation Plus.”</p>







<p>With the need to always be online, that means those in areas with poor network infrastructure, or those who may lose connection for whatever reason, won’t be able to play any aspect of the game.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 releases on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC. It will also be the first Call of Duty game to come to Xbox Game Pass on Day 1.</p>
