		<p>Nintendo’s reveal of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> came with a big teaser for what will be easily the console’s biggest game: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-9">Mario Kart 9</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout the short video that showed off the Switch 2’s hybrid design and how it’s been changed compared to the original Nintendo Switch, a Mario Kart game was running on the console’s screen in handheld mode, and when docked. Check it out:</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 – First-look trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxLUf2kRQRE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s plenty of tidbits to dig out of this, most notably that this was a never-before-seen Mario Kart game, featuring a brand new circuit: Mario Bros. Circuit.</p>


<p>Mario Bros. Circuit takes us to a desert location with a proper race track design to it, though a track that quickly veers off the tarmac and onto the baked dirt of the desert, and eventually careening onto a multi-lane highway with traffic on it, where a Yoshi branded motoway-side diner or filling station could be seen as the camera pulled out to show a huge landscape, by Mario Kart standards.</p>

<p>We spotted a bunch of returning characters, taken from the regular cast of playable characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario</li>
<li>Luigi</li>
<li>Peach</li>
<li>Daisy</li>
<li>Rosalina</li>
<li>Toad</li>
<li>Toadette</li>
<li>Donkey Kong</li>
<li>Bowser</li>
<li>Yoshi</li>
</ul>
<p>These characters were driving a variety of different vehicles, including traditional kart/ATV styles, bikes, and a new tracked snowmobile for Rosalina.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">Today’s Nintendo Switch 2 announcement</a> was pretty abstract outside of Mario Kart 9, showing lots of points of comparison how the console has changed from the original Switch design. It shows the added USB-C port on the top of the console, the new kick stand design, the enlarged Joy-Con with new magnetic snap attachment mechanism. The console shares the same hybrid approach as the original Switch with detachable Joy-Con for docked or tabletop play.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 is coming out in 2025, with Nintendo reconfirming that it will have backward compatibility to Nintendo Switch games, both digital and cartridge. Outside of that, details remain sparse, but given how Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has continued to sell and sell and sell, Nintendo has put its strongest foot forward already.</p>
<p>A Nintendo Direct is planned for 2nd April 2025 which will no doubt showcase all of the launch games and give all the juicy launch details and pricing. In the meantime, we’ll have to go back to the rumour mill and speculation…</p>

Indie games have a much wider variety, and because by necessity they have to have a great hook or idea to form a game around, those that usually see the most success are also the most interesting games of the year.</p>

<p>Here are the nominees for TechRaptor's 2024 Indie Game of the Year Award for outstanding creative and technical design from outside a large studio.</p>

<ul><li>1000xRESIST</li>
	<li>Animal Well</li>
	<li>Balatro</li>
	<li>Indika</li>
	<li>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</li>

<hr><h2>Fifth Place -&nbsp;The Rise of the Golden Idol</h2>



<p>Developer: Color Gray Games | Release Date: November 12th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Otton</p>

<p><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em> was easily one of my favorite games in recent years, and thankfully the sequel <em>The Rise of the Golden Idol </em>doesn't disappoint. An exercise in beautiful simplicity,<em> Rise of the Golden Idol </em>is amazing at making you feel like a genius (or idiot for an extended period) when something finally clicks.</p>

<p><em>Rise </em>brought with it some quality of life updates in this detective/investigation game in how information is organized and how you can quickly access it as you try to suss out exactly what happened in any one scene. There are bigger storylines connected in interesting ways, with plenty of callbacks to the original game as well.</p>

<p>If you like logic-based puzzles or really just want to figure out some mysteries, including some murder mysteries here and there, this game is a no brainer.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Fourth Place - UFO 50</h2>



<p>Developer: Mossmouth, LLC | Release Date: September 18th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Austin Suther</p>

<p>If you love the artform of video games, <em>UFO 50 </em>is the game for you. It’s a digital time capsule with 50 individual games, giving us a glimpse at how technology and gameplay evolved during the early years of the medium, warts and all.</p>

<p>There’s a fun little narrative behind the scenes, with this fake company called UFOsoft, running on fake hardware and a bunch of made-up employees in the credits. It’s fun to explore the history of UFOsoft, but the games themselves are, of course, the highlight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’d be here forever if I explained the ins-and-outs of every game within this collection, but just know these can range from quick, arcade-like experiences to full fledged RPGs. <em>UFO 50</em> is a remarkable achievement in game design.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Third Place -&nbsp;1000xRESIST</h2>



<p>Developer: Sunset Visitor | Release Date: May 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p>

<p><em>1000xRESIST</em> is the kind of interactive experience that is few and far between -- a narrative experience that is equal parts strange and personal, profound and intimate.</p>

<p>Across 15 hours, it encompasses the complexities of high school drama, the anxiety of uncertainty in the face of a pandemic, the existential dread of an alien invasion, the hollow comforts of a religious cult, and the complex cracks in the system by revolution.</p>

<p>It is the kind of narrative that is dense with metaphor and layered meaning. The generational gaps of Watcher, All Mother, and Iris. The recursive nature of humanity throughout the centuries: oppression leading to revolution leading to oppression.</p>

<p>While its gameplay features are light, little more than dialogue options, the experience of <em>1000xRESIST</em> cannot be missed by those that love interactive narrative or thoughtful sci-fi.</p>

<h2>Second Place - Animal Well</h2>



<p>Developer: Shared Memory | Release Date: May 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p>

<p>This game caught my eye as soon as it was revealed -- a tease of puzzles within puzzles, upon release it absolutely delivered. With a core game experience presenting a tight, non-linear Metroidvania, you can enjoy the unsettling atmosphere as you hop through the world. For those who enjoy finding collectibles you'll be treated to unique puzzles and gameplay challenges.</p>

<p>If you scratch just a bit further below the surface, the experience is one that only a few games have managed to pull off so far. No matter what level of interest in this game, it's an entertaining and unique experience for every type of player.</p>

<h2>Winner - Balatro</h2>



<p>Developer: LocalThunk | Release Date: February 20th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Blair Bishop</p>

<p>It was somewhat humorous to see the reaction to <em>Balatro </em>in the run-up to awards season. People simply couldn’t believe a game that looked like that could generate enough hype to last throughout the entire year. So they delved in and saw for themselves how this was possible, and they returned changed. Ashamed that they ever doubted that this was possible.</p>

<p>It’s a testament to how well-designed <em>Balatro </em>is. It’s easy to pick up and play, and it’s easier to find yourself lost in it. Striking the perfect balance between casual muckabouts and all-in numbers games, LocalThunk has created something which will be in the space for years to come.</p>

<p>And maybe even after that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The arrival of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">the Nintendo Switch 2</a> heralds some much-needed improvements over its predecessor, especially its Joy-Con controllers. Here’s a quick breakdown of what the announcement trailer showed us about the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons.</p><p>Before the official reveal of the console, there were rumors alluding to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">how the new Joy-Cons would work and their internal mechanisms</a>. The most significant rumor was that they were held to the console via magnets, and in the reveal video, that appears to be the case. The video features the Joy-Con seemingly snapping to a cover as though attracted by a magnetic force.</p><div><figcaption>The new Joy-Cons snap to everything as though powered by magnets.</figcaption> <p><cite>Gif: Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>The video shows that the Joy-Cons have a protrusion that fits into an oval depression in the main body of the console, plugging into ports (with that iconic Nintendo Switch “snap” sound) instead of sliding down rails. There’s also a button at the top of each controller that is ostensibly how the Joy-Cons detach from the main console, but the reveal video didn’t show that in action. According to some of the Switch 2 rumors reported on by <em>The Verge</em>, pressing that button actuates a pin that will push the Joy-Cons away from the console, and in the video, you can see on the inside track of each controller a small circle at the top that looks like it pushes out.</p><div><figcaption>You can see a tiny protrusion at the top of the Joy-Con that is likely what detaches the controller from the console.</figcaption> <p><cite>Gif: Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>The Joy-Cons, like the Switch 2 itself, are larger. In the version of the console shown in the announcement video, they’re black with accents in the traditional red and blue colors from the original Switch. Other elements from the previous Joy-Cons are still there, like the indicator lights and the SL / SP buttons that are visible when the Joy-Cons are being used individually. The left Joy-Con still has its square screenshot button and the right one has the home button, but directly below that is a new button whose function is still unconfirmed.</p><p>The biggest problem plaguing the original Switch Joy-Cons was a condition known as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">Joy-Con drift</a>. Users reported that their analog sticks would display movement without input from the player, kind of like a cursor moving on a computer screen without moving the mouse. Nintendo didn’t share any information about the internal mechanisms powering the Joy-Cons, so we don’t know how susceptible they will be to this problem.</p><div><p>We’ll know more about the Joy-Cons, along with the console and its upcoming library of games, when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24236766/nintendo-switch-2-games-direct-date-time">Nintendo holds its Switch 2 Direct on April 2nd</a>. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After a waterfall of leaks, it was expected that the Japanese company would make an announcement for the official reveal this week, and then went and threw everyone by just surprise-announcing it at 8 a.m. ET without warning. Within that announcement was a screen showing a date for a new Nintendo Direct.</p><p>This will be the first Nintendo Direct since July 2024, the <em>Mario</em> makers having entirely skipped their usual September edition, which only fueled confusion over what was happening with the Switch 2. It’s described as being for the “Nintendo Switch 2,” but doesn’t make clear if this will be purely detailing the console itself (which many had hoped would already be available by April), or games that will be available for it too.</p><p><em>Mario Kart 9</em>, already widely expected to be a release title (given it’s been an extraordinary 11 years since <em>8</em> first came out), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-9-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-trailer-1851740833&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-9-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-trailer-1851740833">is pretty certain to be among them</a></span>, but fans are obviously hoping to see a new tentpole <em>Super Mario</em> title, given it’s been well over seven years since <em>Odyssey</em> shifted the original Switch.</p><p>We know that Switch 1 (as we’ll have to get used to calling it now) games will mostly work on the new system, both physical and digital editions, but obviously there’s going to be great clamor for brand new titles that’ll take advantage of the new system specs which will also hopefully be fully revealed before or during the Direct.</p><p>Best guess: the Direct will be pre-empted with a lot of leaks from stores about dummy boxes and stock expectations for the Switch 2 itself, with a release date revealed in the Direct broadcast. Maybe early May? Please don’t be later than that, Nintendo.</p><p>Until then, more speculating, rumor-pondering and thumb-twiddling.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal.1083915/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
As part of its highly anticipated (and heavily leaked) first look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, Nintendo has shared another date for the calendar; the company has confirmed it'll be sharing more information on its new console on 2nd April this year.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">finally unveiled Switch 2 today</a> after weeks of leaks - but its announcement, as expected, was light on detail. It gave a first look at the machine itself - a fairly subtle revision of the original Switch's familiar form factor at first glance - plus a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">tease of a new Mario Kart game</a>.
</p>
<p>
It also reiterated Switch 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">will be backward compatible</a>, and is capable of playing both digital and physical Switch games. Beyond that, though, Nintendo is saving the juicier details for a later date. And unfortunately, it's going to be a bit of a wait, with the company confirming it'll hosting a Switch 2 focused Nintendo Direct on 2nd April this year.
</p>

<p>
That'll almost certainly be when the company does its proper deep dive into the console's features (Miiverse 2 please Nintendo, and Street Pass 2 while you're at it, thank you), alongside the full run-down of games coming to Switch 2 at launch and beyond. A new Mario Kart seems a certainty for launch at this point, for instance, and a Switch 2 version of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">long-in-development Metroid Prime 4</a> appears likely too. Additionally, previous whispers have suggested a new 3D Mario is coming later this year. April's Direct should also provide pricing details and a proper launch date beyond its current vague release window of "2025".
</p><p>

In addition to April's Direct, Nintendo has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">confirmed it'll be holding a Switch 2 "world tour"</a> event, giving the public an opportunity to go hands-on with the console and, presumably, its launch line-up of games. That's due to run from early April to June, suggesting the console won't release until sometime after. Exciting times!

		<p>After <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/14/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-heavily-rumoured-for-thursday/">a metric ton of rumours and reports</a>, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> has been revealed, showing off the revised design of the hybrid console sequel and confirming a 2025 launch.</p>
<p>Watch the reveal trailer here, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">a Nintendo Direct for a full reveal set for 2nd April 2025</a>. In-person preview events are also planned and confirmed for major cities around the world from April through May… which would hint at a June launch, wouldn’t it?</p>

<p>Today’s Nintendo Switch 2 announcement is pretty abstract, showing lots of comparison bits and bobs for how the console has changed in comparison to the original Switch. It’s all black, for one thing, with just a pop of neon blue and neon red on the inner cap of the analogue sti cks, but all-black Joy-Con. It shows the added USB-C port on the top of the console alongside the bottom, the new kick stand design that runs the full width, the enlarged Joy-Con with new magnetic snap attachment mechanism, and with a mysterious new button on the right Joy-Con. The console shares the same hybrid approach as the original Switch with detachable Joy-Con for docked or tabletop play.</p>
<p>The one game teased during this video was Mario Kart 9.</p>
<p>Nintendo reconfirmed that it will have backward compatibility to Nintendo Switch games, both digital and cartridge. Some games might not be fully compatible or supported on Switch 2 with more details coming at a later date.</p>

<p>The much-anticipated successor to the Switch has been heavily leaked over the past year or so, but it’s reached a fever pitch in the first few weeks of this year. Already being expected through 2023 and 2024, Nintendo took the unusual step of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-is-coming-this-fiscal-year-but-not-at-nintendo-direct-in-june/">stating repeatedly that it will be announced before March 2025</a>, and clarifying before every stream that they would not be discussing it. Thankfully we can put all that behind us. Kind of. There’s still a lot of information to be confirmed by Nintendo about the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Since then there’s been leaks about the console’s hardware specs, revealing the Nvidia chipset that is set to replace the Tegra X1 within the original Switch to be a modified Tegra T239. There’s also been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R1p1LjHME8">a big discussion over Nintendo’s upscaling patent</a>, suggestions about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/">the use of MicroSD Express for SSD-like read speeds</a>, and just last week at CES, accessories manufacturer <a href="https://x.com/Numerama/status/1876817276143378586">Genki rocked up to the show with a full suite of bits and bobs for the new console</a>, even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks">prompting Nintendo’s lawyers to visit</a> (though Genki state they’ve never signed an NDA or actually seen an official Switch 2.</p>

			<p>After months of rumors and speculation, the Nintendo Switch 2 has been officially revealed today with a new trailer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxLUf2kRQRE&amp;t=18s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The short trailer</a>, which can be watched below, uses the original consoles as a basis to show how the hardware will change in its next iteration with a bigger screen, different Joy-Con controllers, and more. Unfortunately, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/">previously rumored</a>, the new trailer doesn't provide much information on the games, showing only a seemingly new Mario Kart game that has yet to be officially confirmed, and confirming only that the system will be fully backward compatible with both physical and digital original Switch games. The trailer doesn't even provide a precise release window past the generic 2025 window, but thankfully, it seems we won't be left in the dark for a long time, as a Nintendo Direct focused on the Nintendo Switch 2 will be aired on April 2nd.</p>
<p><iframe title="An update from Nintendo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxLUf2kRQRE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Besides providing a better look at the new system in April, Nintendo also confirmed that in select cities around the world, players will be able to get hands-on with the system. These cities include New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Toronto in North America, Paris, London, Milan, Berlin, Madrid, and Amsterdam in Europe, Melbourne in Oceaniakyo, Seoul, Hong Kong, and Taipei in Asia. Ticket registrations, which require a Nintendo Account, will open tomorrow, January 17th. More information on these hands-on events, including dates for each city, can be found <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-switch-2-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide later this year. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Officially Announced, Direct Coming in April]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced-direct-coming-in-april.1083870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has finally officially announced the Switch 2, putting an end to months and months of speculation. What's more, a Direct presentation is coming with more information in April.</p>

<p>In a new trailer uploaded to the official Nintendo account, Nintendo shows off the console, which does indeed appear to feature many of the rumored improvements, including magnetic Joy-Cons, a bigger screen, and a redesigned dock.</p>

<p>Nintendo also says you'll be able to play both Switch 2 games and original Switch titles on the new machine, although "certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-announced-frontal-view.jpg?itok=uDHqZxsT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-announced-frontal-view.jpg?itok=4cvp3yOZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's the Switch 2 in all its glory.</figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2's Joy-Cons will, it seems, lose the bold color scheme of the originals; instead, the default Joy-Con controllers will be all-black, although their analog stick housings will sport the Switch's traditional blue and red.</p>

<p>Additionally, the inside of the Joy-Cons, where the SL and SR buttons are located, will be blue and red, as will the magnetic housing on the console itself.</p>

<p>A new kickstand will also be present on the Switch 2, and it looks a lot sturdier than the original Switch's equivalent. Our very own Stretch has done the math, and he reckons the kickstand tilts by about 150 degrees.</p>

<p>It looks like the Switch 2 won't be making too many changes in terms of ports, either; the USB-C socket will once again be located on the bottom for charging and attaching to the dock, and you'll also have access to a headphone jack.</p>




<p>We knew a Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">announcement was coming sometime before April</a>, and rumors had suggested that the announcement would come today, so it's nice to have the console out in the open at last.</p>

<p>Of course, right now, Nintendo is keeping its cards close to its chest regarding hardware specs, so we don't know how much more powerful the Switch 2 is than the original Switch.</p>

<p>It does, however, look like some kind of new&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game will accompany the launch of the console; the trailer shows what seems to be a new entry in the phenomenally popular racing series, although I suppose it could also be&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>with yet more new courses.</p>

<p>In any case, Nintendo will be revealing more about the Switch 2 during a new Direct presentation on April 2nd. Stay tuned for more on that.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-mod-liberty-city-preservation-project-taken-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-mod-liberty-city-preservation-projects-takedown-isnt-a-dmca-dev-says.1083867/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-mod-liberty-city-preservation-project-taken-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ambitious&nbsp;<em>GTA&nbsp;</em>mod Liberty City Preservation Project has been shut down, but contrary to what you might think, the mod's developer insists that the takedown wasn't due to a DMCA request on Rockstar's part.</p>

<p>In a message shared to the mod's Discord server (via <a href="https://x.com/GameRollGTA/status/1879611635343741349" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GameRoll on X</a>), modder nkjellman says that the choice to take the mod down was made "due to the unexpected attention" the project received, and that a decision was reached "after speaking with Rockstar Games".</p>

<p>However, in a <a href="https://x.com/GameRollGTA/status/1879683899015700852" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup message</a>, nkjellman clarifies that the takedown "isn't a DMCA" but rather "a friendly takedown, mutually agreed upon by all parties involved". The modder says there's "no negativity between [their team] and Rockstar Games / Take-Two Interactive".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gta-liberty-city-preservation-project-mod-shutdown-trevor.jpg?itok=LYAOCXcD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gta-liberty-city-preservation-project-mod-shutdown-trevor.jpg?itok=OeJ0uke4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Liberty City Preservation Project is no more, but it wasn't taken down because of a DMCA, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>The modder goes on to say that you shouldn't download LCPP from unofficial sources because they "may contain malware", and that users also shouldn't share download links in the Discord server.</p>

<p>Of course, although nkjellman says the takedown was "friendly" and that Rockstar didn't issue a DMCA, that doesn't mean it wasn't Rockstar who unofficially requested the mod's removal.</p>

<p>It's very possible that if nkjellman and their team had refused to take down LCPP, a DMCA would have been the next step, so even though a DMCA wasn't issued, it could well have been the threat of a DMCA that caused the modders to take down the project.</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, one thing's for certain: you won't be able to get Liberty City Preservation Project from official sources anymore, so I hope you've already got the mod downloaded if you want to keep playing it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gta-4-liberty-city-preservation-project.jpg?itok=XhxeCzuQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gta-4-liberty-city-preservation-project.jpg?itok=XTo3oq5s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rockstar's parent company Take-Two is well-known for its hawkish stance on modders.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering exactly what the Liberty City Preservation Project mod was, it was an ambitious attempt to essentially mod the entirety of&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 4&nbsp;</em>into the&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>engine, complete with the whole Liberty City map to explore.</p>

<p>In a way, it's not surprising that it's been taken down. Rockstar's parent company Take-Two is notoriously hostile towards modders, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-adds-gta-underground-list-killed-mods" rel="nofollow">taken down</a> several&nbsp;<em>GTA</em>-related <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-issues-another-wave-of-dmcas-for-gta-mods" rel="nofollow">modding projects</a> in the past.</p>

The specific time will be shared “at a later date.”</p><p>Your first chance to try it could come at a series of events in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas that are scheduled over several days later in April — ticket registration <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fnintendo-switch-2-experience%2F">will be available here on Nintendo’s website</a> starting January 17th at 3PM ET.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 console.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>The Nintendo Switch will be a tough act to follow. The device was a clever hybrid of a home console and a handheld, and the formula resulted in one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150926/nintendo-expects-switch-to-become-its-best-selling-console-ever-this-year">bestselling consoles of all time</a>. A huge part of the console’s success was that it was home to some of Nintendo’s best-ever games, including hits like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/9/23592822/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-best-way-classic"><em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em></a>, and the very popular <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/21/15382628/mario-kart-8-deluxe-nintendo-switch-best-features"><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></a><em>. </em>Fortunately, you’ll be able to play all of those games on the new console — Nintendo said in November that the Switch’s successor <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">will be compatible with Switch games</a> and will have Nintendo Switch Online.</p></div><p>The first Switch was also a massive sales hit. The company <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">says that</a>, so far, it’s sold 146.04 million units, making the console its second-highest-selling video game system behind the original Nintendo DS, which sold 154.02 million units. The Switch’s sales figures also mean that it has surpassed the Nintendo Wii (101.63 million units), the Game Boy (118.69 million units), and the Nintendo 3DS (75.94 million units).</p><p>While we’ve been waiting years for a true Switch successor, the console had mid-cycle hardware refreshes along the way. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date">Nintendo Switch Lite</a> was a great way to play Switch games on a smaller device, and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">Nintendo Switch OLED</a> added a beautiful display and a handful of other nice upgrades.</p><p>Starting in December, supposed information about Nintendo’s next console began to trickle out from accessory manufacturers. Dbrand, for example, gave us <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">what it believed</a> to be actual dimensions of the hardware and said that its “understanding” was that the Joy-Con controllers would be magnetically attached. And at CES 2025, Genki showed off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">a 3D-printed mockup</a> of what it believed the Switch’s successor would look like.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We didn’t get a the release date today beyond the fact that it’s coming sometime in 2025, but we did get the official name. Switch successor is indeed called the Nintendo Switch 2. How un-Nintendo of them!</p><p>The trailer shows off a bigger, sleeker upgrade to the 2017 hardware that’s sold over 150 million units. The new Joy-Con are black instead of red and blue, and the right one has a new, mysterious c-button. They attach to the screen—which is larger with a smaller bezel—with magnets. But Nintendo still hasn’t gone into detail on the official specs or what the hardware will be capable of. It looks cool though:</p><p>A quick segment near the end of the trailer appears to show the upgraded Joy-Con moving like a PC gaming mouse, possibly an allusion to a new optical tracking capability. The company also reiterated that the Switch 2 will play Switch games, but with a major caveat. “Certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2,” a disclaimer at the end of the trailer reads. It’s unclear which games will be included in that carve-out, but more information is promised on Nintendo’s website at a later date. </p><p>Nintendo’s official Switch 2 reveal comes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-genki-ces-2025-official-1851736830&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-genki-ces-2025-official-1851736830">after weeks of alleged leaks purporting to show everything</a></span> about the new console from its motherboard to its new magnetic Joy-Con connectors. The sum total of the rumors amounted to the new device being an upgraded Switch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-joy-con-nintendo-new-features-1851735307?_gl=1*1r5k8ox*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjg4MjQyMy4yNzcuMC4xNzM2ODgyNDI3LjU2LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-joy-con-nintendo-new-features-1851735307?_gl=1*1r5k8ox*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjg4MjQyMy4yNzcuMC4xNzM2ODgyNDI3LjU2LjAuMA..">with a bigger screen and a more powerful processor</a></span> but otherwise largely the same hybrid gaming tablet everyone’s come to love since the original launched back in 2017. And they basically all turned out to be right.</p><p>Whether the Switch 2 can pull off a similar year-one coup will depend mostly on what first-party exclusives the system launches with. The one-two punch of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> was a powerful recipe for success with the original hardware. Can the Switch 2 muster a similarly impressive lineup? <em>Mario Kart 9</em>, which certainly looks like what’s been revealed in the Switch 2 preview trailer, would make for a great start. </p><p>One thing that might help is a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-master-chief-collection-ps5-switch-2-port-1851737175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-master-chief-collection-ps5-switch-2-port-1851737175">steady drumbeat of third-party ports from Xbox, Ubisoft, and others</a></span>.

It looks like the Switch 2 could launch with <em>Mario Kart 9</em>. One of the most notable differences between the game we saw and previous <em>Mario Karts</em> is Donkey Kong. If you look at the gorilla racer in the background of different shots, you’ll notice he looks pretty similar to his <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie </em>incarnation, rather than  the classic design seen in games like <em>Mario Kart 8</em>. Some fans have observed that Mario’s proportions seem to be a little more cartoony and similar to what we saw in the recent <em>Super Mario Wonder</em> as well. So while Nintendo didn’t officially put a name to the footage, it’s a pretty reasonable leap to assume this is <em>Mario Kart 9</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,196626,196698" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Fans have been combing through the brief bits of footage to determine some of the playable racers, and the roster we can see includes: Mario, Luigi, Bowser, Peach, Yoshi, Toad, Daisy, Rosalina, Donkey Kong, and what appears to be Pauline, Toadette, a Goomba, and a Koopa.</p><p>Nintendo has confirmed it will hold a Direct presentation on the system <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848">on April 2</a></span>, and we’ll almost certainly get a better look at the new <em>Mario Kart </em>then.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>During this event, players might learn more about the upcoming console’s capabilities and what new games will be playable on it. The Nintendo Switch 2 release date, pricing and availability should also be revealed on this date, considering the console is set to release in 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The day has finally come as Nintendo has officially announced the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, the worst kept secret in video games.</p>



<p>In a short <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-us/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">two-minute video</a> online (watch below), Nintendo confirmed the full design of the upcoming console. Confirming the look <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/did-dbrand-give-players-another-look-at-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that’s been leaked</a> in recent months. The console comes in black and will feature a more rounded look, a newly designed kickstand with a wider tilt, a new-look dock, magnetic Joy-Con controllers, and more. With the Joy-Cons also being black, the red and blue color of the original appear under the thumbsticks.</p>



<p>There’s also the new button on the right Joy-Con, but its purpose wasn’t confirmed during the reveal video.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As far as games go, the teaser only showed what appears to be a new Mario Kart game running on the console. More information about the console and (likely) its games will be shown during a <strong>Nintendo Direct event on April 2</strong>. One thing confirmed during the reveal is that the Nintendo Switch 2 will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-backwards-compatible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not only play digital</a> Nintendo Switch games, but it will also play physical Switch 1 games. </p>



<p>That said, the company did state that “certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2.” More information on that will come “at a later date”.</p>



<p>Lastly, it was revealed that Nintendo will be holding special “Nintendo Switch 2 Experience” events in April in three United States cities: New York City from April 4-6, Los Angeles from April 11-13, and Dallas from April 25-27.</p>



<p>You can check out the video below.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has officially revealed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, its successor to the wildly popular Switch console. Like the original Switch, the Switch 2 is a hybrid home and handheld gaming console, but with what's expected to be more powerful system specs and several other improvements when compared to its predecessor.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itpcsQQvgAQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/itpcsQQvgAQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the reveal trailer, Nintendo confirmed that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">Switch 2 will be backward compatible</a> with most physical and digital Switch games. "Certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2," the company added.</p><p>More details on the Switch 2 console are set to be revealed in a Nintendo Direct scheduled for April 2, 2025. Games were not a part of this reveal event, although <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-mario-kart-may-have-been-revealed-in-switch-2-trailer/1100-6528850/" data-ref-id="1100-6528850">what looks like a new Mario Kart game was shown</a>. (For a look at what might be on the way, we have a roundup of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">all the rumored Switch 2 games</a>.)</p><p>The trailer did show the Switch 2 controllers in more detail, confirming the new magnetic Joy-Con design. Compared to the first iteration of the Joy-Cons that slid into position via rails, the Switch 2 controllers snap into place on the console.</p><p>All of the other key details on the exact launch date, price, and system specs are still being kept under wraps for now.</p><p>Anyone looking to go hands on with the console won't have to wait too long, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-to-try-the-switch-2-before-its-released/1100-6528849/" data-ref-id="1100-6528849">Nintendo Switch 2 Experience events</a> have been announced. This will be a global event, taking place in multiple major cities.</p><h3>USA</h3><ul><li><strong>New York:</strong> April 4-6</li><li><strong>Los Angeles:</strong> April 11-13</li></ul><h3>Canada</h3><ul><li><strong>Dallas:</strong> April 25-27</li><li><strong>Toronto:</strong> April 25-27</li></ul><h3>Europe</h3><ul><li><strong>Paris:</strong> April 4-6</li><li><strong>London:</strong> April 11-13</li><li><strong>Milan:</strong> April 25-27</li><li><strong>Berlin:</strong> April 25-27</li><li><strong>Madrid:</strong> May 9-11</li><li><strong>Amsterdam:</strong> May 9-11</li></ul><h3>Australia</h3><ul><li><strong>Melbourne:</strong> May 10-11</li></ul><h3>Asia</h3><ul><li><strong>Tokyo (Makuhari):</strong> April 26-27</li><li><strong>Seoul:</strong> May 31-June 1</li><li><strong>Hong Kong:</strong> TBA</li><li><strong>Taipei:</strong> TBA</li></ul><p>Since last year, Nintendo Switch 2 leaks kicked into overdrive thanks in part to third-party accessory marketing. Nintendo had previously claimed that information on the Switch successor would be revealed by the end of its current financial year--which draws to a close on March 31--but it remained quiet on any other details regarding the console.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Switch still has several great games releasing later this year. Donkey Kong Country Returns lands on the console on January 16, strategy fans can check out Civilization 7 in February, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition looks like it'll gobble up dozens of your spare hours, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> could be an exciting return to the pocket monster franchise.</p>
