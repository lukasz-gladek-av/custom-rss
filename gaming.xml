			<p>The ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is closing the year in an excellent state, as the emulator is currently capable of at least booting most major PS4 exclusives.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrutalSam</a> in a new video shared on YouTube, the emulator is in an excellent state, as it is capable of running several PlayStation 4 exclusives like Gravity Rush Remastered reasonably well. A few other games, on the other hand, still have performance issues and visual glitches, but the fact that the emulator is even capable of booting them is impressive in itself. The star of the show in the video is Bloodborne, which was clearly one of the main focuses for the developers of the emulator, seeing how well it runs nowadays when it was barely possible to only get in-game a few months back.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Status of PS4 Exclusives on ShadPS4 Emulator | December 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T4_uOv4pdwg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With Bloodborne running so well on the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator, it was not surprising to see the release of mods that attempt, and mostly succeed, at improving the game's visuals. The most prominent of these mods is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-new-version/">Remaster project by fromsoftserve</a>, which enhances the game's visuals with new features that wouldn't look amiss in an official remaster, which is still nowhere on the horizon despite the massive demand.</p>
<p>More information on the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/">official website.</a></p>

            <p>Charlie the Unicorn creator Jason Steele has hit out at Warner Bros. for allegedly using audio from his viral internet short in a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a> advertisement "without permission".</p>
<p>The teaser - initially posted to social media but since deleted - showed off Reindog's Unicorndog skin, and was captioned "We're going to Candy Kingdom to get the new Unicorndog Variant, Charlie!"</p>
<p>It was accompanied by a video of three Unicorndogs - just like the three unicorns in Steele's video - which allegedly included audio taken directly from the Charlie the Unicorn short.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/23/game-of-the-year-2024-best-narrative/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>What makes a good game? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/22/game-of-the-year-2024-best-gameplay/">Mechanics</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/20/game-of-the-year-2024-best-visual-design/">graphics</a> and compelling characters are all integral, but it’s the narrative that all of these other elements hang upon, like an apple tree bearing fruit. A convincing, emotional and intriguing narrative will keep players coming back, and will make a game live on in their memory long past they’ve forgotten how pretty a mountain was or what buttons to press. 2024 has seen its fair share of engrossing stories, but one title stood head and shoulders above the others.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor: Refantazio</a> is built on the legacy of the Persona series, and, if you’re searching for reasons why it’s an incredible piece of storytelling, that tells you everything you need to know. Studio Zero took many of the overarching ideas from the school-based series and transplanted them into a fantasy world that brims with imagination, while staying close enough to our world to ensure that its questions about race, racism, religious fanaticism and democracy hit home every single time.</p>
<p>The grand narrative sees you take the reins following the king’s death, and with his only heir cursed into incapacity, the violent and power-hungry Louis attempts to take control. However, the king foresaw the power vacuum that he’d leave. Instead, he paved the way for a magically-infused election, where the most popular person in the kingdom would become king. You’re thrust into the midst of this, setting out to right wrongs, challenge preconceptions, and build a following, with both the vibrant and personable characters you help on your way, and the populace at large.</p>
<p>Metaphor: Refantazio is constantly surprising, with many moments that will shock and challenge you, all the while pushing you ever forward towards glory and power that you never asked for. To say too much more would ruin some of the game’s best moments, but rest assured, this is by far the most powerful, emotional and exquisitely-crafted story of the year.</p>

<h2>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth – Runner-up</h2>
<p>We all know that feeling where something incredible comes to an end, and you see the next act take to the stage. “Oh god,” you think.”How are they going to follow that?” Cast your mind back a few years and you’ll remember thinking the same after FF7 Remake came to a close.&nbsp;Little did we know that when Rebirth took the stage it would knock our expectations out of the park.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">FF7 Rebirth</a> follows Cloud and friends as they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0MvE3Q43Gs">escape to the country</a>, desperately seeking to defy the winds of fate and prevent what we all know is coming. There is a lot of ground that we know it has to cover, and a lot of expectations that the devs know they have to meet. The devs, too, must have wondered how they were going to follow that.</p>
<p>If they did, it never shows. We’re been gifted a beautifully paced game, with an expanded (and heavily tweaked) version of the story we all know and love. The narrative additions all add a welcome dimension and depth to the characters we grew up admiring. Though it is effectively a new story, it remains faithful in all the ways that matter.</p>
<p>Cast any fears for Icarus aside: Rebirth is a genuine delight.</p>
<p><em>–&nbsp;Nic B</em></p>
<h2>Threshold – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Some games impress with their epic narratives spanning dozens of hours and a myriad of locations and characters. Others convey their story through casting fantastic voice actors to lend gravitas to emotional and exciting dialogue. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/26/threshold-review/">Threshold</a>, on the other hand, takes us back to basics, taking place as it does in a single small environment and with the minimal amount of characters. What it does offer, however, is a focused and psychologically fascinating narrative that unpacks itself through a series of unanswered questions and mysteries.</p>
<p>You find yourself manning a remote outpost with the responsibility of blowing a whistle to ensure that a huge train runs on time. Where are you? Why are you there? What is the train carrying? Where is it going? All of these questions and more occupy your mind as you carry out the basic duties of your job but things are not as simple as they seem. You have to bite into glass canisters of oxygen to survive as the air is so thin so the longer you go the more bloody the onscreen lips indicator gets. You find mysterious notes from a former worker hidden around the station. And as the game progresses some of the answers to your questions are revealed but in a way that only leads to more questions.</p>
<p>While a relatively short and focused experience, the questions raised and the narrative buildup in Threshold will stay with me for a long time as it’s a game that uses the interactivity of the form to tell a unique story.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-winter-twitch-drops-2024/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-winter-twitch-drops-event-starts-december-30.1068003/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-winter-twitch-drops-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has revealed that Escape from Tarkov’s Winter Twitch Drops campaign will start on December 30, all but confirming that the wipe will take place a couple of days before. It’s a tradition at this point – these campaigns always start a day or two after the game has undergone a platform-wide reset known as a ‘wipe’.</p>



<p>This wipe will be accompanied by the 0.16 update, a supersized overhaul that promises to introduce a slew of new weapons, balances, and a rework of Customs, one of the game’s fan-favourite maps.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-with-the-wipe-comes-a-drop">With The Wipe Comes a Drop</h2>



<p>On the Escape from Tarkov website, it was revealed that the Winter Drops campaign will run from December 30 to January 4, and then the Escape from Tarkov Arena drops campaign from January 4 to January 8.</p>



<p>The developer advised streamers <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/event/wintertwitchdropsevent?utm_source=x_post&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=winter_drops_24-25&amp;utm_term=link_1&amp;utm_content=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to enrol if they want to participate</a> in the campaign, with content creators being assigned time slots based on their availability. It’s easy to envision some of the biggest streamers who’ll get a spot in the Winter Drops campaign – this is the time of the year when they make the most money.</p>



<p>The likes of Landmark, Pestily, WillerZ, Glorious, StankRat, Gingy, and Trey will likely all be doing round-the-clock Tarkov streams in support of the wipe and the Twitch Drops campaign.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed what rewards viewers will receive, but last year, users had to rack up dozens of watch hours to unlock random gift drops in Escape from Tarkov. Some viewers unlocked thousands of rounds of ammunition, while others got packs of noodles or something to that effect.</p>



<p>Battlestate wrote on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With the approach of the New Year holidays, one of the most anticipated events of the year for our community is kicking off — the annual Twitch Drops Event. This is a great opportunity to receive in-game gifts and enjoy the festive season.</p>

			<p>2024 was a pretty damn good year for fans of shooter games. Not the best we can recall, granted, especially with the absence of big IPs like Halo and Battlefield, but it still offered lots of fun through various triple-A titles that mostly delivered on their promise, arguably <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2023-solid-transitory-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassing 2023</a> when it comes to this genre's output.</p>
<p>All the titles we picked (except STALKER 2) offer some kind of online feature, which isn't surprising given how shooter games and multiplayer go hand in hand. Most of them are also set in science fiction/post-apocalyptic worlds, with the exception of Call of Duty. Without further ado, here's our shortlist of the best five shooters released in 2024, ordered by release date. Stay tuned for all the other genres, as usual.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/helldivers-2-art-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Helldivers II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/helldivers-2-not-enough-patriotism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6/10</a>)</h2>
<p>The year of shooter games fans started with a bang thanks to Arrowhead's Helldivers II. Granted, the game didn't get a high score at launch on Wccftech from reviewer Ule Lopez, mostly due to technical issues. However, Helldivers II was a smash hit when it came to sales. By May, it had <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> 12 million copies sold across PC and PlayStation 5, becoming the fastest-selling game Sony has ever published. It might have very well singlehandedly persuaded Sony to always ship live service games day and date on PC, too.</p>
<p>The active user base fluctuated widely throughout 2024, depending on the patches, although an update in September <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-patch-released-playercount-triples-as-a-result/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brought</a> a resurgence of activity. Helldivers II also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-wins-goty-at-tiga-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won</a> Game of the Year at the TIGA Awards.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Warhammer-40000-Space-Marine-2-Review-03-Image-4.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7/10</a>)</h2>
<p>Saber Interactive's Space Marine 2 is another game that didn't review so well on Wccftech, getting just a seven out of ten from reviewer Chris Wray. However, it was a smash hit among fans. Just one day after the official launch, the game had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-already-sold-two-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> two million units. Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/space-marine-2-is-the-2nd-best-selling-game-of-2024-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performed</a> especially well in Europe, where it was the second best-selling new launch of the year (before the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6). By late November, Space Marine 2 had <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-5-million-units-will-get-dlss-fsr-frame-generation-with-next-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broken</a> through the five-million milestone. With a fresh update just <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-obelisk-update-adds-dlss-3-fsr-3-and-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> and many more to come (including planned DLCs), this long-awaited third-person shooter sequel will surely entertain fans well beyond 2024.</p>

<h2>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.8/10</a>)</h2>
<p>The Call of Duty franchise wasn't in a great state following the releases of Modern Warfare II and III. Neither of the games released in 2022 and 2023 really hit the mark among the Call of Duty community, but this year, Treyarch restored CoD to the throne of first-person shooter games with Black Ops 6. In Wccftech's review, Kai Tatsumoto wrote:</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 represents a proper return to form, with Treyarch taking the helm in development once more. This is probably as definitive a Call of Duty title has been in years, with a package that executes well across all three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. While the narrative doesn’t hold up to the spy thriller premise in the lead-up to launch, the online package rounds out the experience well.</em></p>
<p>Activision and Microsoft have <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-the-biggest-ever-says-activision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boasted</a> that it is the biggest Call of Duty game ever in terms of total players, hours played, and matches, though that was kind of a given with its availability through Game Pass.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/stalker-2-art-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8/10</a>)</h2>
<p>The only title on this shooter games list focused solely on single-player, STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl carried the massive hype inevitably attached to its long and troubled development history. Thankfully, Ukrainian developer GSC Game World shipped a game that, despite its bugs and shortcomings, largely maintained its promise of providing a completely unique experience. Here's an excerpt from my review:</p>
<p><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a worthy successor of the original in every regard, good and bad. The vision is the same: an uncompromising game that will often frustrate you, but also offers a unique experience that can hardly be found anywhere else. It's the classic example where the total is more than the mere sum of its parts. Bugs and balance issues are still very much an issue, but they shouldn't stand in your way of playing, especially if you're willing to wait a while for developers and modders to fix them.</em></p>
<p>The team is already preparing a lot of fixes and improvements, and they still have to release the mod tools, the multiplayer, and DLCs.</p>

<h2>Marvel Rivals</h2>
<p>Hero shooter games haven't exactly thrived lately. Concord was arguably one of the year's biggest flops, being <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed</a> just two weeks after its launch, Sony having reportedly spent a $400 million budget for nothing. Overwatch 2 isn't super healthy, either, at least compared to the original.</p>
<p>In this context, Marvel Rivals from NetEase Games looked like it might struggle, especially as it appeared very much like a <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-is-an-overwatch-like-6v6-pvp-third-person-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clone of Blizzard's game</a> ahead of launch. The Marvel franchise also didn't help big triple-A releases such as Marvel's Avengers and Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy.</p>
<p>However, Rivals defied expectations and gained the appreciation of many gamers, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-launches-with-a-bang-thanks-to-444k-concurrent-users-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> and elsewhere. Just last week, the developers <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1869080172814848471" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that over 20 million users have played Marvel Rivals so far, and there's a long list of updates and new heroes planned for the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-review-cult-of-personality<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Legacy” is going to be the word of the day here. <em>Soul Reaver</em>, one of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/6-square-enix-sold-ips-we-want-embracer" rel="nofollow">the cult-iest of cult classics</a>, revered by many for its forward-thinking blend of narrative and gameplay, and a title that – while I didn’t personally play it at release – is one I’m assured was the talk of the town at release. 25 years on, Aspyr have released a fresh modern remaster of the 2 <em>Soul Reaver</em> games, with the support of Crystal Dynamics.</p>

<p>Similar to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered" rel="nofollow"><em>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</em></a> collection released earlier in 2024, <em>Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered</em> is here to celebrate the <em>Legacy of Kain</em> series. Alongside the fresh updates to gameplay and graphics, you also have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-psn" rel="nofollow">a library of fan celebration and developer collaboration</a>, including concept art and fan art of <em>Soul Reaver</em> and its characters, the script for both games, and a litany of cut content in the form of lost levels.</p>

<p>Famously developed during a tumultuous back-and-forth between Crystal Dynamics, and <em>Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen </em>developer Silicon Knights, <em>Soul Reaver</em> tells the story of Raziel, a vampire formerly of Kain’s lieutenants. After he is seemingly killed by Kain, The Elder God resurrects Raziel, tasking him with the execution of Kain, and the assassination of Raziels former comrades. This eventually leads to an uneasy alliance with Moebius, the time-manipulating guardian who features prominently in the series.</p>



<p>It’s a very straightforward story when it comes down to brass tacks, especially since both games are doing different things with the material. In <em>Soul Reaver 1</em>, Raziel’s commentary, along with the general direction of the narrative and its groundbreaking cutscenes, is made to establish an arc and vengefully charged story beats. In <em>Soul Reaver 2</em> however, the lines blur as a timeline-hopping odyssey told almost entirely from Raziel’s perspective, with internalization constantly spewing out.</p>

<p>What’s interesting is how both games differentiate from each other, and how both games utilize what’s already been established. Part of it comes down to the growth of Raziel as a character, as <em>Soul Reaver 1</em> is more about puzzling and adventuring, but another larger chunk just comes from apprehension regarding how the mechanics are implemented. Whatever the case, the problem largely revolves around combat.</p>

<p>In <em>Soul Reaver 1</em>, combat is an arbitrary gimmick revolving around the “true death” of your vampire adversaries. It’s not just that you slash ‘em to death, but you also have to throw them into direct light, an open fire, or maybe just a stake through the heart. Once that’s done, however, you also have to absorb their soul so they simply don’t just respawn given time. Mind you, all of this is absolved once you acquire the titular Soul Reaver.</p>



<p>An energy blade with nearly limitless easy-killing potential, it gets some tweaks in <em>Soul Reaver 2</em> through the implementation of a risk/reward system. Use it too much and it starts to damage Raziel, which makes sense, and forces you to deal with what is easily some of the worst combat ever conceived for a game of this type. There’s no feedback, there’s no true connection, the hitboxes are way too wide, and Raziel’s movement doesn’t account for much survivability, unless you simply swing without locking on. What replaces strategy is sheer tomfoolery and button-mashing.</p>

<p>As a remastering effort, Aspyr has gone through the usual motions when it comes to retaining the source material’s energy. You can switch between the original and remastered graphics on the fly, and the first thing you’ll discover is that the remastered fidelity can be astonishingly toothless. There are some shining moments, like the upgraded designs of Melchiah and Zephon, which add a lot more menace and fear than previously enforced by their 1999 counterparts.</p>

<p>A lot of the time, however, you are merely just staring at slightly refreshed textures, with <em>Soul Reaver 1</em> benefitting, and <em>Soul Reaver 2</em> suffering from it. Both games utilize a dual-world mechanic in the form of Raziel being able to switch between the Material World, and the Spectral Plane, with more emphasis placed on it in <em>Soul Reaver 1</em>. The way the Spectral Plane twists and contorts is shown off brilliantly in its remastered form, as the Eldritch scrawlings are much more detailed, and intimidating.</p>



<p>The Spectral Plane doesn’t get as much airtime in <em>Soul Reaver 2</em>, potentially due to its placeholder as a glorified extra-life depository, given its larger focus on danger. Still, a lot of the graphic upgrades in <em>2</em> tend to muddy up the true direction and atmosphere of the game, which is still phenomenal. The amount of times you’ll simply stop to sink into the fauna, the fire, the cold, and the song is ridiculous, a true testament to how much visual design and audio design are as much of a game as the gameplay itself.</p>

<p>This is where <em>Soul Reaver</em> shines, not in its gameplay necessarily, but in the ease with which Crystal Dynamics were able to create a world, just as true as when it was proclaimed 25 years ago. That’s why it breaks my heart to find that <em>Soul Reaver 2</em> does nothing with it, and that’s largely down to Raziel as a character. Whereas in <em>1</em>, he’s a frightened little imp powered solely by rage and the heartbreak he suffers when venturing through the new world, <em>2</em> turns him into a cocky counterpart, more akin to Sonic The Hedgehog than a brooding anti-hero.</p>

<p><em>Soul Reaver 2</em> is a rare breed of story, where the main character has main character syndrome. The number of times Raziel will walk into a cutscene with his chest puffed out, bragging that he’s finally figured it out, only to see that one of his former handlers or adversaries has to calmly explain the next step. It’s a fascinating showcase of a simpering idiot, who previously sought to learn the proper precautions, and not once is he proven to be the architect. Does Raziel know that? No! Never! But he has a feeling!</p>



<p>With however many issues this remaster has caused to break out of the ground, I feel like this was to be expected. When conversing with a friend, I mentioned how I was playing the remaster, and he was filled with glee at the memories this news brought forth, regaling about how he and his friends all fell in love with the game when it came out, and how they all figured out the puzzles. When I mentioned that I wasn’t having fun with it, his response was, verbatim:</p>

<p>“Oh, God yeah, I wouldn’t play it now, it’s obviously not the same.”</p>



<p>Maybe I shouldn’t be surprised that so much of <em>Soul Reaver</em>’s magic has ironically been lost to time. The combat is a button-mashing mess with no strategy, and <em>Soul Reaver 2</em> tends to focus on the less interesting parts of the world. That being said, for brief moments, <em>Soul Reaver</em> shows timeless offerings in the form of what it was: A world of intricacies, and history, and even in its infamously cut-down state, it manages to showcase it more than many of its contemporaries, even now, and for that? I'm grateful.</p>

But what if the game’s original executive producer, creative director and animation director all rocked up, and said they had the best ideas for making a brand new one?</p><p>“We’re not interested right now, we appreciate it, blah blah blah,” Schofield said of EA’s response.

Not only is the name incredibly similar, but the promotional image could easily be mistaken for that of the actual game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The similarities practically end there, however, as Wukong Sun: Black Legend is a side-scrolling platformer as opposed to Black Myth: Wukong's third-person action. It also requires a meagre 338 megabytes of storage space according to the Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/wukong-sun-black-legend-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eShop</a> page.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/23/screenshot-2024-12-23-111448-1734954590046.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Wukong Sun: Black Myth.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fairy-tail-2-interview-with-original-creator-and-producer-of-the-sequel<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairy-tail-2">Fairy Tail 2</a>, the PlayStation 5／PlayStation 4／Nintendo Switch／Steam title which allows players to relive the climax of the highly popular magical battle fantasy series Fairy Tail, was released on December 13, 2024 (December 12 in Japan and Asia). To commemorate the release, we conducted a special interview with Hiro Mashima, the creator of the original Fairy Tail series, and Hiroshi Kataoka, the producer of the game Fairy Tail 2!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Thank you both for taking time out of your busy schedules to join us today! As Fairy Tail 2 was released on the 12th (in Japan and Asia), to begin with, could you tell us about how this title began – how it was proposed (by Koei Tecmo) to Mashima-sensei?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka: </strong>Four years ago in 2020 we released the first Fairy Tail game, but it only covered up until the Tartaros Arc. The final chapter, the Alvarez Empire Arc, remained as pivotal and unfinished ‘homework’ from the previous game, and we felt that the most exciting part absolutely had to be adapted, but it took us a lot of time to think about the best way to adapt it into a game. Once we had more or less settled on the content that we thought would work, we presented our proposal of the game outline which included both the main story and an original storyline. How did you feel when you first saw it, Mashima-sensei?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> When I saw the proposal this time, while it was an RPG, there were action game-like elements which made me very happy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> This time there can be a chain of combos in battles, so the way it plays is close to an action game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> Yes, the combat system has changed from the previous game! I think it’s really cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka: </strong>I think that one of the strengths of RPGs is being able to take the time to showcase grand, elaborate moves. However, since this game incorporates action-like elements and features fast-paced battles, we faced many challenges in enhancing the visual impact of linking combos without disrupting the gameplay flow. We were able receive permission to create shorter versions of consecutive casting sequences of the same magic spells, which I think resulted in it coming together nicely. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fairy Tail 2 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> As you become a lot stronger on the field, you can instantly knock out enemies with a single hit, defeat 10 or more enemies with special moves and more, so I think the action-like feel has increased significantly, which has in turn really increased the gameplay feel as a Fairy Tail game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei: </strong>Also, I thought the map was great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> It really is vast. When I played it myself and arrived at Hargeon, seeing the port spread out before me was really moving.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> Ooh! I’m looking forward to that!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>When making the fields, did the development team focus on any specific points?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> In this game, the reason we made the world map seamless was to faithfully recreate the situation from the original where the Alvarez Empire is attacking from all sides, enhancing immersion and conveying a sense of journey. In the early stages, players primarily explore the map following the story, but in the later stages, the explorable area expands significantly, offering a strong sense of adventure, so I hope players will try running through the field.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei: </strong>I found it really fun to actually be able to walk around this setting of the Kingdom of Fiore. The placement of the towns are faithfully recreated as they would be in the original series. I hope fans of the series will look forward to that aspect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> Additionally, in this game as players journey through the open field, they will see a lot of interactions among characters so I hope players will enjoy that as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Can you tell us what kind of interactions we can see?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> Since the open field is quite large, just walking around can be a bit boring so we added conversations. Since exploration is done in a party, we included various dialogues that capture the essence of the Fairy Tail guild members. Additionally, for those playing a Fairy Tail game for the first time, we made sure that these conversations can help them understand the relationships between the characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> For example, they even alert you with lines like "I smell treasure" when there's a treasure chest nearby or suggest "Let's take a break" when there's a place to rest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> Wow, that's amazing! It really gives the feeling of traveling with companions, making the journey a lot of fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> For the previous game, you often mentioned wanting a sense of journey, so we were meticulous in capturing that feeling this time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> Also, Plue is hidden throughout the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> “Find Plue,” right!?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> I hope players will try to find him by relying on hearing his voice or from hint dialogues from companions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>We spoke about how the battle system had changed, how about the graphics?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka: </strong>It's been four years since the previous game, so I think the quality of the models and motions have significantly improved! I’d have to say we put the most effort into the facial expressions. While we also worked hard on this in the previous game, the dev team worked hard to make even more variations of facial expressions, so I think we’ve been able to have each character display an expression that best matches the situation for many scenes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei: </strong>The quality is incredibly high, and I was really pleased!　Aside from the models, I think they’re called stills? The single illustrations were all so impressive I’ve lost a bit of confidence (laughs). There was an illustration of Natsu and Zeref facing each other and it had the same impact as the drawings I did back then. Even now, I still think it might’ve been good to use as the box art.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> When I shared that story with the person responsible for it, they were extremely thrilled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>I'd like to ask about the game's story as well. In this installment, players can relive the Alvarez Empire Arc, which is the climax of Fairy Tail. Were there any challenges in developing the story portion of the game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka: </strong>The original series featured many one-on-one battles, but for this game we wanted to create Fairy Tail vs. Alvarez Empire team battles, so we consulted on making small adjustments to the order of battles and development of the story. And we received a lot of advice and suggestions for adjustments to the story development and dialogue to make it even better, so I believe we achieved a very smooth and coherent gameplay experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>By the way, do you, Kataoka-san and Mashima-sensei, have any favorite characters or scenes from the Alvarez Empire Arc?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> The whirlwind of developments in the Alvarez Empire Arc that included the unraveling of mysteries and the resolution of plot twists are what I vividly remember being amazed at every week when it aired. There are so many iconic scenes and lines, but for me, the moment when Erza suddenly stops Natsu and Gray really struck me and that scene is etched in my memory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> Thank you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> For me, I think it would be August. I think that things that were added to the setting later, including the foreshadowing of the battle with August, worked well and it’s a part that I really like. Even if the entire story isn't included, I want the battle itself to be exciting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka: </strong>We've made sure to faithfully recreate the story, and I think the final scene turned out really well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> I'm looking forward to that!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> So you came up with August’s setting later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> I often come up with ideas later on. Of course, even when I say "later," it's usually a few episodes before it's reflected into the story. In the case of August, it worked particularly well. I’ve heard many people say they were completely fooled by it. “It wasn’t Larcade, it was you!" (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> I was completely fooled as well. (Laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei: </strong>August was a very strong character in the original series, so I hope the battle with August is as challenging in the game as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> Yes, he's an incredibly strong character because he can copy magic. Even when reading the original manga, I wondered who would be stronger if he fought Zeref. And of course, he's quite powerful in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei: </strong>It would be a problem if he's too strong, though (laughs).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka: </strong>Otherwise, players might not be able to finish the game (laughs). We've made him quite strong as the final buildup before the battle with Zeref.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> One thing I’d personally like to ask is how long ago did you decide on the content of the final chapter?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> I was quite torn until the end about whether Zeref or Acnologia would be last. Because I expanded the story so much, there were many things that were added later. For example, there's a character named Dimaria who can stop time, and she was so powerful that I couldn't figure out how she could be defeated, so the sudden appearance of "that character" was an idea I came up with afterward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> Oh, really!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> It felt like live storytelling! There are a lot of instances where it would have been better without certain settings... While I have repeated some of these regrets, it’s fun to create a story as you go along!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> And was there any particular reason behind having 12 members in the Spriggan 12?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> Initially, I decided on 12 companion characters who would play active roles. From there, I then decided that each of them would defeat one of the 12 enemy characters. However, Erza ended up defeating two of them. (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> That’s true. (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> In games, it's usually something like ‘Four Heavenly Kings,’ but here we have 12. (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> As the ones making it, I honestly contemplated, "12, huh..." (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> I imagine creating the models must have been a lot of work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka</strong>: But I was determined to make sure that fighting all members of the "Spriggan 12" would definitely happen, so I told the development team from the start, "Fight all of the Spriggan 12! This is a must!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei</strong>: That's wonderful to hear. I'm looking forward to it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: In addition to reliving the original story, this game also includes an original storyline. How did the development of the original story come about?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> From the moment we first proposed the game, we said that we wanted to include an original storyline. And actually Mashima-sensei requested that the original story be very well-developed, so we put a lot of effort into it. For the final boss of the original story, our idea of battling a particular character at the very end was the only part proposed from the very beginning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> I thought all the original scenarios were great. I think it’s clear that a lot of hard work has been put into them!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka: </strong>Thank you. Since the main story is quite serious as it is the final chapter, we wanted something to bring out the lighthearted and lively feel typical of Fairy Tail that would be more casual to play. We even wondered if we might get in trouble for going overboard... (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> It wasn’t a problem at all! (Laughs) It was fun!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka: </strong>That’s good to hear. I’m really happy you enjoyed it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Speaking of original content for the game, in the Digital Deluxe edition, there’s an in-game feature called Atelier Lucy. Could you let us know more about this?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> After the previous game, Mashima-sensei mentioned on X that “it would be nice to have something like an Atelier Lucy," and that’s where the idea began. The IP producer of the Atelier series (Junzo) Hosoi also welcomed the idea, so we proposed it, received approval and made it happen. Since matching the synthesis system in the more recent Atelier series would make it a bit too challenging to play, we’ve put in a simple system, and I believe it’s very fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> That's really great. I also love the Atelier series, so even though what you made this time is a parody, it doesn't feel out of place at all. If there's a sequel, I'd love for it to be fully developed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Would it be good to even have a collaboration title like 'Atelier Fairy Tail'?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> Yes, I’d like that to happen someday (laughs).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> Actually, we’ve included familiar elements from the Atelier series, like Barrel!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> I was really happy when I discovered that. There were quite a few character variations too!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> This game includes also includes a wealth of DLC such as outfits and an additional scenario. Were there any particular aspects you focused on in creating these?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> For the DLC outfits of playable characters, we wanted to create a sense of togetherness, so we included outfits from the 8-Island restaurant where they worked in the original series, formal wear with a wedding motif, and school uniforms to evoke an image of school life. As for the additional scenario, I personally really liked the Battle of Fairy Tail episode, so I thought of combining it with a hot springs theme.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> Every time new outfits were sent over, I would say, "that’s awesome!" I thought it was fantastic that each character had their own unique outfit rather than everyone wearing the same thing. It was incredibly creative and impressive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> There are even characters wearing glasses with the school uniforms. (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei: </strong>The designs are truly amazing! I want everyone to see them all!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka: </strong>We're also considering some absurd battles in the Arena, like fighting Zeref, August, and Larcade simultaneously. Imagine facing six members of the Spriggan 12 at once. (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> Can you even beat that? (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> That's where players will need to level up their characters and hone their skills. (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> That sounds exciting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> To close, could you share a message for those eagerly anticipating the release?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka: </strong>We've kept you waiting a long time since the previous game, but the release is finally here. Our entire team has poured their love for Fairy Tail into this project and with the cooperation of Mashima-sensei and everyone at Kodansha we are finally at completion. We've created something truly enjoyable in of course not only the story, but the gameplay too, so I hope you'll give it a try.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei</strong>: I truly think this work is filled with love for Fairy Tail, and I'm really looking forward to playing it myself, so I hope everyone will look forward to it too.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In recent years, our efforts to recognize the best video games of the past 12 months always come with a caveat: Yes, great games undeniably come out, but things are bad for the industry. The world makes another trip around the sun and things only seem to get more dire and precarious for people who make the video games we know and love. Workers are laid off at an unsustainable frequency, if their studios and projects aren’t shut down entirely. All that we have left to celebrate is the work that talented developers still manage to create in the midst of all this instability, and that’s what we’re here to do. It’s remarkable that even under such circumstances, so many games worth celebrating are still being released, and they deserve to be heralded with as much enthusiasm as ever, if not more. It’s games like these that keep reminding us of how vital, relevant, and extraordinary this medium can be, even if some of the people running the industry are making it so much harder for such games to be made.</p><p>Here’s how we arrived at this ranking: Each member of the <em>Kotaku </em>staff submitted a top ten list, with each game being allotted a point value depending on where it was placed. If someone ranked a game as their favorite of the year, it would receive 10 points, with the second-place game receiving nine, the third getting eight, and so on. Once the results of those ballots were tallied, there was some deliberation about the presence and placement of a few games, and in the end, we landed here. Without further ado, here are <em>Kotaku</em>’s top 15 games of 2024.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a5211c87e43b01f3e0a7380473e15549" data-recommend-id="image://a5211c87e43b01f3e0a7380473e15549" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iris holds a bloody knife at someone off-screen while saying &quot;Did I not give you life?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Iris holds a bloody knife at someone off-screen while saying &quot;Did I not give you life?&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sunset Visitor</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a5211c87e43b01f3e0a7380473e15549" data-recommend-id="image://a5211c87e43b01f3e0a7380473e15549" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iris holds a bloody knife at someone off-screen while saying &quot;Did I not give you life?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody"><em>1000xRESIST</em></a></span><em> </em>is so dense and rich in themes that trying to sum it all up here in a few paragraphs feels like a disservice to just how much developer Sunset Visitor’s narrative adventure explores in its dozen or so hours. What starts off as a sci-fi exploration of identity in a society made up entirely of clones ends up interrogating so many ideas that its thesis could be articulated in as many ways as its diverging clones view the world. Despite everything it explores, <em>1000xRESIST</em> feels singular in its vision, building upon its most basic ideas to deliver anime-inspired melodrama that leads to out-of-this-world conclusions grounded in the human desire for connection.</p><p>So much of <em>1000xRESIST</em> is depicted through the memories of one woman, with her clones viewing and interpreting it all through their own eyes. Even then, however, they are limited by her perspective. <em>1000xRESIST</em> ends on a note that suggests history can be defined by the victors in any conflict, no matter how just one’s cause might be. Its final moments ask you to remember what it means to hold that power and decide what to do with it. As much as <em>1000xRESIST </em>juggles, it’s all in service of making you understand the position you’re put in during that final segment. You can resist something a thousand times over and not know what to do when you’ve finally won. <em>1000xRESIST</em>’s ability to concisely reach that conclusion is a testament to what Sunset Visitor achieved. Lesser games would have caved under the weight of communicating so much narrative and thematic depth in such a short experience. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-recommend-id="image://117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man whose burnt face is covered in bandages looks at the screen as an emergency screen flashes in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man whose burnt face is covered in bandages looks at the screen as an emergency screen flashes in the background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wrong Organ</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-recommend-id="image://117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man whose burnt face is covered in bandages looks at the screen as an emergency screen flashes in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Wrong Organ’s psychological horror game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195"><em>Mouthwashing</em></a></span> excels at packing heaps of mental anguish into a small space without once losing its grip on the point it’s trying to make. Its excruciating two hours tell the story of a delivery crew shipwrecked in space not losing their humanity, but rather facing the worst parts of what it means to be human.</p><p><em>Mouthwashing </em>has been a hard game to sit with since I played it in November. It deals with the unbearable weight of the human condition while showing how the corporate machine grinds us into the worst versions of ourselves. But it never gives the worst person in its story the space to divert the blame for their actions, even as they try. Is every person’s life boiled down to the worst thing they’ve done? Are we not pieces of every person we’ve met and every experience we’ve been through, pieced together to form something that looks like a person? Can the pain we’ve caused be wiped away by painkillers shoved down the throats of those we’ve hurt?</p><p>Take responsibility. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d6aa99bdb090b493c4ee51f0ac9bdb81" data-recommend-id="image://d6aa99bdb090b493c4ee51f0ac9bdb81" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The cast of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth stands in front of a cabin and looks at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The cast of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth stands in front of a cabin and looks at the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->RGG Studio</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d6aa99bdb090b493c4ee51f0ac9bdb81" data-recommend-id="image://d6aa99bdb090b493c4ee51f0ac9bdb81" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The cast of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth stands in front of a cabin and looks at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I love a game filled with profound or thought-provoking moments.

My time spent with <em>Infinite Wealth</em> also reminded me that I don’t always need to find some emotionally overwhelming or intellectually fascinating reason to be enthralled by a game, I can just have goofy fun with loveable characters in relatable situations.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269"><em>Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em>:<em> </em>The <em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></span></p><p>Well, as relatable as the life of ex-Japanese gangsters can be. <em>Infinite Wealth</em> does have some serious elements, such as the protagonist’s complicated relationship with the world around him and the strange, uncertain conditions of his birth. But it also navigates perfectly innocent and silly stuff, like a first date gone wrong, the absurdity of the gig economy, and being inebriated with friends.</p><p><em>Infinite Wealth</em> is also a hell of a good RPG. Combat in particular is excellent, fusing turn-based actions with real-time positioning that allows you to do things like line up attacks and send enemies flying into one another. The game also handles its side content particularly well, with objectives and activities that are more than happy to get out of the way of the main story if you’re not interested in tackling them. But if you do dive in, you’ll find some wildly satisfying and engaging elements to engage with, such as an entire resort management sim, a <em>Pokémon</em>-like collect-and-battle mini-game, and more.</p><p>As a newcomer to the <em>Yakuza</em> series, I was also delighted to find the story very approachable. On occasion, the game would reference previous events in the series that’d largely go over my head, but on the whole, the game was plenty capable of delivering a coherent, if remarkably silly, tale of ex-gangsters trying to survive normal life without getting sucked back into the hell of it all. — Claire Jackson</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="730b31dc405adffad5753b9a7a65a18e" data-recommend-id="image://730b31dc405adffad5753b9a7a65a18e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="James looks up at something off-screen in a dark room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="James looks up at something off-screen in a dark room." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="730b31dc405adffad5753b9a7a65a18e" data-recommend-id="image://730b31dc405adffad5753b9a7a65a18e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="James looks up at something off-screen in a dark room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you had a time machine and warped back to 2022 and told me that the Bloober-developed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482"><em>Silent Hill 2</em></a></span><em> </em>remake would be not only good, but one of the best games of the year upon its release, I’d laugh. (Well, first I would ask you about the time machine, then I would giggle.) Nobody outside of Bloober and Konami had any confidence in this project and yet, when it finally launched in 2024, it ended up being a triumphant, confident, interesting, and worthwhile adaptation of the original PS2-era release<em>.</em></p><p>In some ways the remake plays it safe, while in others it experiments with puzzles and pacing (not always successfully…), and the result is a remarkably faithful, sometimes predictable, but always engaging horror game that<em> Silent Hill 2</em> veterans will enjoy. And even more impressively, newcomers to the franchise are likely to not only admire<em> Silent Hill 2</em>’s remake but walk away from it wanting to play the original version, too. And importantly, the<em> Silent Hill 2</em> remake is fucking scary in a way other modern horror games sometimes aren’t. A remarkable game that will be talked about and played for years to come. — Zack Zwiezen</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="81f09a32349fb86171d51723817270cb" data-recommend-id="image://81f09a32349fb86171d51723817270cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Senua looks out at a plain with mountains in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua looks out at a plain with mountains in the background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="81f09a32349fb86171d51723817270cb" data-recommend-id="image://81f09a32349fb86171d51723817270cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Senua looks out at a plain with mountains in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I was not ready for where <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em></a></span> was going to take me.

Many of the game’s moments can be examined from multiple angles, including the conclusion, which throws many of <em>Hellblade 2</em>’s fantastical elements into a contemplative place of uncertainty. What even <em>is </em>real? What are the heroic deeds on display in this game? Is it a vanquishing of giants? Or is it something deeper, more internal? <em>Hellblade 2</em> invites this kind of thought.</p><p>And while the first game was rightly celebrated for its unique depiction of mental illness through the use of binaural audio which brought the voices in Senua’s mind to life (making headphones for it and this sequel a must), I found that this game takes that aspect further, with the voices in Senua’s mind persistently raising doubts in ways that really get inside your head. As someone who struggles daily with complex anxieties and traumas, I found <em>Hellblade 2 </em>deeply relatable. Though I don’t experience the same kinds of mental illnesses Senua does, the game accurately gives voice to what it’s like to wrestle with your own thoughts in complex, obsessive ways.</p><p>It may have a short runtime, and it might have made some sacrifices to the gameplay that made its predecessor so beloved, but taken on its own terms, <em>Hellblade 2</em> is a memorable and powerful experience. — Claire Jackson</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a00a13b0ace77b0c88d5da819461f60f" data-recommend-id="image://a00a13b0ace77b0c88d5da819461f60f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sephiroth and Cloud stand alongside SOLDIER forces in a dark, rainy area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sephiroth and Cloud stand alongside SOLDIER forces in a dark, rainy area." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a00a13b0ace77b0c88d5da819461f60f" data-recommend-id="image://a00a13b0ace77b0c88d5da819461f60f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sephiroth and Cloud stand alongside SOLDIER forces in a dark, rainy area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a></span> is like a 17th-century Baroque painting: grand, ornate, ostentatious, and confounding.

What is the point of all those freaking minigames? Endless minutiae rendered with the flare, expertise, and grand designs of ancient masters.</p><p><em>FFVII Rebirth</em> is a game that I found relentlessly engaging despite these questions. “It makes no damn sense…compels me though,” I thought to myself so many times while playing. Some games are greater than the sum of their parts. <em>FFVII Rebirth</em>’s parts are greater than the sum of most other games. It’s not quite a faithful, one-to-one remake of the middle section of the original game, nor is it a risky and bold departure. Rather, it’s a maximalist walking tour through a rich sci-fi fantasy world, blown up in evocative, beautiful, and occasionally heart-wrenching detail.</p><p>The card-based minigame Queen’s Blood is amazing. The flow of combat and the incredible camera work, especially during summons, represent the height of interactive spectacle. I can almost forgive the Cait Sith Shinra Mansion crate sequence because of Chocobo Racing, the Junon parade, the Gold Saucer VR play, and every other mini-game/ quick-time event hybrid that didn’t suck. But where <em>FFVII Rebirth</em> excels most is in giving timeless video game avatars the space to grow into regular people and break out hearts all over again. — Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fecfd06fbf48af183f600b14c98629cb" data-recommend-id="image://fecfd06fbf48af183f600b14c98629cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1914" data-height="1077" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The cast of different games from UFO 50 surround the logo against a red background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The cast of different games from UFO 50 surround the logo against a red background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mossmouth</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fecfd06fbf48af183f600b14c98629cb" data-recommend-id="image://fecfd06fbf48af183f600b14c98629cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1914" data-height="1077" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The cast of different games from UFO 50 surround the logo against a red background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A staggering achievement and, for my money, the year’s most surprising, captivating, and incredible game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ufo-50-review-retro-games-steam-1851649865&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ufo-50-review-retro-games-steam-1851649865"><em>UFO 50</em></a></span><em> </em>is actually a collection of 50 games, all released in the 1980s by developer UFOSoft. The thing is, however, that UFOSoft never actually existed. Instead, these are new games, a wonderful smorgasbord of games in different genres—role-playing games, platformers, side-scrolling action games, games in which you explore interesting worlds and find nifty upgrades, and more.</p><p>Diving into <em>UFO 50 </em>is a wonderfully stimulating and sometimes bracing experience: you come across both the intimately familiar and the unfamiliar, games that require you to take a step back and grapple with their various elements as you come to grips with them. Some players have found this frustrating, or even called it evidence of bad game design. I couldn’t disagree more. Perhaps it’s that I’m old enough to remember the games of the 1980s vividly myself, and to recall how, in that era, running up against mechanics or systems you didn’t immediately understand was commonplace. For me, this process is often part of the fun; it feels like a real process of discovery, tinkering with a game until just how it works and what it’s asking of you becomes clear. It’s a kind of discovery that’s become quite rare in games today, but <em>UFO 50 </em>embraces it.</p><p>Of course, that wouldn’t matter much if the games in <em>UFO 50 </em>weren’t good enough to make all that experimentation worth it, but they are. Particular favorites of mine include <em>Grimstone</em>, a JRPG with an Old West-themed setting; <em>Valbrace</em>, a first-person dungeon-crawling RPG that switches to third-person action for combat; and <em>Barbuta</em>, UFOSoft’s “first” game, a slow-paced, mysterious adventure ostensibly from the early 80s. Each new discovery in <em>Barbuta </em>was a wonderful revelation, and eventually completing it (without looking up hints on the internet) was my most rewarding gaming achievement of the year. Alongside those, I also adored some of <em>UFO 50</em>’s breeziest and most accessible action games: <em>Cyber Owls </em>fuses the thematic zaniness of games like <em>Battletoads</em> to an assortment of gameplay types, from top-down, <em>Metal Gear</em>-esque infiltration to <em>Bad Dudes</em>-style side-scrolling punch’ em up; and <em>Seaside Drive </em>bathes you in glorious, summery vibes as you shoot down everything from attack helicopters to giant, flying wizard-sharks while speeding down a coastal road in a red sports car. <em>UFO 50 </em>is a thrilling reminder of how varied and creative video games can be, and it’s the one game this year that, more than any other, reminded me why I love this medium so much. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="772cb70f8a31b29e16f74bbb00e59a6f" data-recommend-id="image://772cb70f8a31b29e16f74bbb00e59a6f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kay Vess walks toward a pair of Storm Troopers interrogating a civilian." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kay Vess walks toward a pair of Storm Troopers interrogating a civilian." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="772cb70f8a31b29e16f74bbb00e59a6f" data-recommend-id="image://772cb70f8a31b29e16f74bbb00e59a6f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kay Vess walks toward a pair of Storm Troopers interrogating a civilian." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A key moment I remember distinctly in<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a></span><em> </em>was flying over to Tattooine, landing, and then walking into the famous cantina seen in the original<em> </em>1977 film. Moseying around its iconic bar was incredible. It’s something I’ve always wanted to do since seeing the original film as a kid. And then, I left the bar and kept walking out into the rest of the city. And then past the city. Into the dunes and rocky cliffs; areas never seen in any <em>Star Wars</em> movie or show before. That was maybe even more mind-blowing. Finally, I had a giant, photorealistic recreation of <em>Star Wars</em> and I was free to wander about it, discovering both iconic locations and spots never before seen. That’s when I knew <em>Outlaws</em> was one of my favorite games of 2024.</p><p>Sure, the game’s story is very<em> Star Wars</em>-y and I like it a lot. Yes, the gunplay feels wild and loose in a way that reminds me of the barely choreographed action of the first film. And of course, I adore Nix—your in-game pet. All of that stuff is great. But a lot of <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>isn’t. The forced stealth sections, the space battles, the clunky speeder bike, and the janky open world.</p><p>But whatever, I don’t care about any of that stuff because I was able to mingle through a crowded market on Tatooine and grab some sci-fi street food at a nearby vendor, all while recognizable <em>Star Wars</em> aliens walked by me. <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> lets me truly immerse myself in a franchise I love so much, and that’s enough for me. — Zack Zwiezen</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a3d5c4a07aa23ee2f7ff3dc63978b250" data-recommend-id="image://a3d5c4a07aa23ee2f7ff3dc63978b250" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A comic-like collage depicts someone leaving a baby at a doorstep." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A comic-like collage depicts someone leaving a baby at a doorstep." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Furniture &amp; Mattress</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a3d5c4a07aa23ee2f7ff3dc63978b250" data-recommend-id="image://a3d5c4a07aa23ee2f7ff3dc63978b250" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A comic-like collage depicts someone leaving a baby at a doorstep." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Half the games on this list are giant releases that are trying to give you a little bit of everything. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/arranger-role-puzzling-adventure-review-puzzle-game-1851600269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/arranger-role-puzzling-adventure-review-puzzle-game-1851600269"><em>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure</em></a></span><em> </em>is a bite-sized gem that repeatedly riffs on the same core concept, and doesn’t stick around long enough to trip over itself. Thinking back on developer <em>Furniture &amp; Mattress’</em> sublime puzzle-driven adventure, I think it’s been long enough now since my first playthrough that I no longer remember all the solutions to its environmental puzzles and complex boss fights, and it was so magical the first time through that I’m seriously contemplating a revisit.</p><p><em>Arranger</em> is the type of game that can be described with words but is best understood in motion. There’s something intuitive about how its grid-like paths shuffle around as you move through them. So many of its puzzles can be solved just by feeling your way through its world as it shifts beneath your feet. By the time you’ve spent just a few minutes with <em>Arranger</em>, you come to understand how to navigate its terrain and manipulate it to your needs. One sign of good puzzle design is that you don’t need a giant text bubble to explain it, and <em>Arranger </em>is at its best when it just lets you exist in its ever-moving space and figure it out. Doing so remains one of the most satisfying experiences in the genre, and if the clever puzzles weren’t enough, the heartfelt writing woven into every challenge keeps the world fresh beyond its moving floors. — Kenneth Shepard </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="41192b8691be6ea26a2af158d54b9a53" data-recommend-id="image://41192b8691be6ea26a2af158d54b9a53" data-format="jpg" data-width="1329" data-height="747" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A squad is surrounded by enemy alien forces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A squad is surrounded by enemy alien forces." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Arrowhead Game Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="41192b8691be6ea26a2af158d54b9a53" data-recommend-id="image://41192b8691be6ea26a2af158d54b9a53" data-format="jpg" data-width="1329" data-height="747" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A squad is surrounded by enemy alien forces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Some games are overwhelming in their scope and intricacy; others, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a></span>, are pretty straightforward but manage to get a ton of mileage out of doing a few things extremely well. Arrowhead Game Studios managed to take a very simple idea—shooting tons of aliens in open fields—and turn it into one of the most tense, funny, and memorable experiences of the year. Other multiplayer games might get in their own way, clogging up the gameplay-to-fun pipeline with all sorts of unnecessary and overcomplicated junk. Not <em>Helldivers 2</em>.</p><p>While it’s stayed fresh for almost a full year now thanks to a scary cadence of new updates, patches, and immersive in-game storytelling and content drops, the core appeal is the same as it was on day one: drop down onto a planet, meet some randos, and run, laugh, die together. No other game in recent memory has made scraping through hell and high water feel quite so exhilarating, earned, and enduringly surprising no matter how many times you keep doing it. <em>Helldivers 2</em> is precise, punchy, and endlessly entertaining. It’s a masterclass in modern live-service gaming, but with all of the heart, artistry, and joy of an old-school arcade classic. — Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="12ada48800ab199050afe7848481efaf" data-recommend-id="image://12ada48800ab199050afe7848481efaf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Heismay looking like a cool guy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Heismay looking like a cool guy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="12ada48800ab199050afe7848481efaf" data-recommend-id="image://12ada48800ab199050afe7848481efaf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Heismay looking like a cool guy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-review-pc-ps5-xbox-persona-atlus-1851665876&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-review-pc-ps5-xbox-persona-atlus-1851665876"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a></span><em> </em>really couldn’t have come out in a more appropriate year.

There are fewer people to meet than in the studio’s other games, but <em>Metaphor</em> focuses its energies on establishing a strong thematic throughline that unites the characters, and Atlus achieves that here more effectively than it ever has in the past. Each conversation you have, mission you take on, and battle you face feed into that goal, and it makes every moment of <em>Metaphor </em>feel like it matters in a genre that has typically thrived in the meaningless mundane.</p><p>But its overtly political story of fighting prejudice and injustice isn’t just about being ideologically opposed to those ills. <em>Metaphor</em>’s greatest achievement is in how it manages to weave threads about political activism and fantasy-based escapism together to create a pointed story about how we retreat into fiction when shit gets hard. Even if it’s lacking in subtlety and has its moments of poor judgment (looking at you, Catherina subplot), we need stories like <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>when things are bad. We can’t retreat into fiction and call it activism, but we can use it as inspiration and encouragement for the real action we must take. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="626ae449663028840a290d83c01b7cd2" data-recommend-id="image://626ae449663028840a290d83c01b7cd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Balatro table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Balatro table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->LocalThunk</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="626ae449663028840a290d83c01b7cd2" data-recommend-id="image://626ae449663028840a290d83c01b7cd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Balatro table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Poker sims have been a stalwart of gaming for as long as I can remember, going back as far as those pixelated demos on magazine coverdiscs for <em>Deluxe Strip Poker II</em>.

Surely it at least came out in 2023! But no, its triumphant release was indeed in February of 2024, and it’s certainly been the one game I’ve come back to most frequently since.</p><p><em>Balatro</em> takes the rogue-ish elements of a deckbuilder like <em>Slay the Spire</em>, but puts them into a deck made up of traditional playing cards, eschewing all the usual dressings of a fantasy setting. It’s poker rules, kinda, except where in the right conditions you can make a straight with just four cards and that skips over a number. Or the much-coveted five-of-a-kind.</p><p>Something that most interests me about <em>Balatro</em> is how—aside from wrinkles introduced by the numerous rule-changing Jokers that can be found—the main adjustment that’s made to your game between attempts is within <em>you</em>, rather than via a tweaked deck. You get better at it. You develop new tactics and approaches, adapting on the fly based on the opportunities that come your way on any given run, and inevitably grow more skilful. That’s so much more rewarding than the game essentially getting easier because of unlocks you added, as is often the case in this genre.</p><p>It’s also stupidly clicky, and the “one more go” factor registers dangerously high.

The fourth RPG in the fantasy franchise makes a hard pivot into action and succeeds brilliantly, delivering fast-paced, expressive, engaging combat which rivals that in many of its contemporaries. It also brings in an almost entirely new cast of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-companions-origins-2-inquisition-veilguard-1851702114&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-companions-origins-2-inquisition-veilguard-1851702114">memorable companions</a></span> while trying to wrap up over 15 years of story, and somewhere in the midst of all that, it has to make good on a cliffhanger that has been hanging over the franchise for a decade. Somehow, <em>The Veilguard</em> manages to pull off all of the above with a level of refinement not seen in anything BioWare has done before. <em>The Veilguard</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347">has been divisive</a></span>, but even so, here I am, writing about it as #2 on our 2024 Game of the Year list.</p><p>I came into <em>The Veilguard</em> jaded, feeling that BioWare had lost the plot in its constant attempts to make <em>Dragon Age </em>an anthology series, each with a different protagonist, even as it focused on presenting a world influenced by your heroes and their decisions. Some of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s greatest failings are in its inability to marry an anthology structure with the choice and consequence BioWare has become synonymous with, but what it loses in a lack of carryover from decade-old games—importing only a handful of decisions from its direct predecessor—it makes up for in being probably the best foundation for a brighter future the series has had since <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>.</p><p><em>The Veilguard</em> is all about wrapping up loose ends and paving the way for the next generation of <em>Dragon Age </em>heroes. Some of the game’s most moving moments are ones in which it feels like you’re watching an origin story unfold as the heroes of before pass the torch to the next young whippersnapper doomed to save the world. New hero Rook is one of the best-realized heroes BioWare has ever created, giving you some of the most <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-character-creator-free-download-1851713224&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-character-creator-free-download-1851713224">thorough tools</a></span> yet to define who your character is in ways that extend beyond how they fight and what they look like. But despite how much wonderful specificity and detail you can bring to your own Rook, their story is universal for long-time fans of BioWare’s fantasy series. It’s not all great, as there’s an unnerving sense at times that Rook isn’t the one who should be here to watch history be uncovered. But the long-hidden truths they unearth about the world of Thedas are by turns satisfying, thrilling, and shocking, and <em>The Veilguard </em>manages to wield the uncertainty about Rook’s worthiness to pave the way for one of BioWare’s best finales.</p><p>Each tale it tells on the way to its climactic battle, whether it be Neve Gallus fighting for the city she loves or Davrin uncovering Grey Warden history, feels like a fresh start for this world. Given <em>Dragon Age</em>’s past, it’s hard to tell if <em>The Veilguard </em>is setting the series up to finally shed the weight of its long, overarching lore, or if it is ready to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-rook-choice-import-da5-5-1851705496&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-rook-choice-import-da5-5-1851705496">finally use it to its advantage with more forethought</a></span>. But for the moment, <em>The Veilguard </em>did exactly what it needed to do. It put BioWare back on track with <em>Dragon Age</em> to do what it does best: create worlds for us to inhabit and define who our heroes are. We’re given a space to create, destroy, fall in love, hold violent grudges, fight for what we believe in, support those around us, and ultimately save the world we’ve helped define. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="901f86210209edc2fc137855ca2d50dd" data-recommend-id="image://901f86210209edc2fc137855ca2d50dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kratos bot holds his axe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kratos bot holds his axe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="901f86210209edc2fc137855ca2d50dd" data-recommend-id="image://901f86210209edc2fc137855ca2d50dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kratos bot holds his axe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Astro Bot</em> combines the best of 3D <em>Mario</em> platforming and <em>Crash Bandicoot</em>’s arcade-y death gauntlets into a gorgeous, whimsical, and fun adventure through an elaborate, sci-fi amusement park. It feels like a much bigger game distilled and refined down into its most important, impactful, and revelatory parts. Each moment is designed to spark joy, from the simple pleasures of pulling on a string and having what it’s attached to explode into a cloud of confetti to elaborate, multi-stage boss fights against giant octopuses and robot genies.</p><p>Platformers are an old genre born of the limits of long forgotten hardware, and they aren’t always breeding grounds for surprise and innovation. But even constrained by familiar frameworks, <em>Astro Bot</em> works tirelessly to insert clever ideas and extract maximum satisfaction from them before quickly moving onto the next carefully crafted setpiece. The results can sometimes be so effortless, it almost feels like you’re gliding through the game rather than actually playing it. And that’s when Astro Bot gets smashed, zapped, or popped, waking you from your comfortable slumber so that you can experience the delight of eventually slipping back into the game’s well-worn grooves like a marble gliding through a Rube Goldberg machine made from bubble gum plastic and fond memories. — Ethan Gach </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been confirmed: Johnny Silverhand and ‘V’ from Cyberpunk 2077 are heading to Fortnite soon. It seems bizarre that a character who was iconic for rebelling against corporations and consumerism would appear in a game like this, but here we are. It hasn’t been confirmed when the characters will arrive in Fortnite, but it should be soon.</p>



<p>In a short teaser uploaded on social media, Epic Games revealed the characters – the female variant of V, and the standard model of Johnny Silverhand, who Keanu Reeves famously played in the 2020 open-world RPG.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-night-city-meet-fortnite">Night City, Meet Fortnite</h2>



<p>This will be the second time that Keanu Reeves has appeared in Fortnite. In 2019, the actor was introduced to the Fortnite universe as John Wick, arguably one of his most famous roles to date, beyond playing Neo in The Matrix franchise.</p>



<p>He’ll surface in Fortnite as Johnny Silverhand, one of the most major characters in Cyberpunk 2077 and the catalyst for the events that unfold throughout the game. Also being added is ‘V’, the game’s protagonist. While neither gender is canonical, Epic Games has opted to include the female variant in the upcoming crossover.</p>



<div><article><p><span>We’re expecting some guests from Night City 🌆 </span></p></article></div>







<p>It’s not yet confirmed what’s coming in the bundle, but we’ve seen snippets online showing Cyberpunk 2077’s ‘Mantis Blade’ weapons as a pickaxe replacement.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1hjz19e/cyberpunk_x_fortnite_collab_skins_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a leak on other social media platforms</a>, the character models were reportedly revealed, along with the blades, a back bling, and weapon wraps.</p>



<p>Will you be securing something from the Cyberpunk x Fortnite crossover? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Palworld’s Feybreak update has arrived with v0.4.11, and it introduces a new weapon called Meowmeow as the first instalment of their Terraria collab. The update also introduces a new island, fresh features, areas, pals, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-palworld-s-meowmeow-is-a-bullet-firing-melee-weapon-nbsp">Palworld’s Meowmeow is a “Bullet Firing Melee Weapon”&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Through the Feybreak update, players can now try out Meowmeow from Terraria in Palworld. This is a “small tease of the collab,” with more to come in 2025. For those wondering, this “Bullet Firing Melee Weapon” is actually a sword that makes cat sounds when you attack. When the player swings the blade, a cat projectile with a rainbow trajectory is thrown at the enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-feybreak-island-new-mechanics-and-more">Feybreak Island, New Mechanics and More</h2>



<p>The next big part of the Palworld update is the Feybreak Island itself, a land filled with new mysteries, challenges and goals. Additionally, there’s a new faction that you need to look for on this island, the Feybreak Warriors. These pesky individuals have taken over the island with the power of their missile battery camp.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The update has also added new mechanics such as Expeditions, Research, Predator Pals, and Bounty NPCs. Players also receive a new raid called Xenolord, where they must defeat a mechanical dragon controlling the Xeno army. There’s also a Random Pal mode that randomises Pal Spawns. You can filter it by region or keep it entirely random for some chaos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Palworld Feybreak update adds much more content, such as the ability to create new weapons, the addition of new strongholds and stronghold bosses, items, unique skills, player changes, increased cap level, bug fixes, and so on.

<p>That's according to creative director Jonathan Dumont, who told <a href="https://ew.com/assassins-creed-shadows-naoe-backstory-fastest-assassin-we-ever-made-exclusive-8762696">Entertainment Weekly</a> that she will have a Naruto run in which she'll "lean forward, arms bent, sprinting at full speed".</p>

<p>"Naoe's the fastest Assassin we ever made," he added. "She runs super fast, she has a lot of gadgets to keep her stealth so that she doesn't have to fight often. We wanted to satisfy that for players that come in for that ninja-Assassin game."</p><p>Dumont wouldn't be drawn on further story points, but did say: "She will start a bit of a path of vengeance or fulfilling a promise that she made to her family. As she discovers a world in need, she begins to really value the community values her father taught.</p>
<p>"Can she make a better world? [She realises] they are people who cannot defend themselves, which is tied a little bit more to the models of the [Assassin] Brotherhood.</p>
<p>"[Naoe] was shielded by her father from what's happening in the world, and it comes crashing down," Dumont added. "She is pushed into war. She doesn't know much about her origins. Her father's been training her, but she doesn't know much about her mother, who's been gone. But as a cool proverb from Japan says, 'a frog in a well knows nothing of the sea'.</p>
<p>"She is tossed into the real world, and through that, she will learn that she is not just a shinobi, that there is a little bit of a lineage or at least some mystery about some sort of different type of shinobi. They're Assassins, so she's somewhat linked to that."</p>
<p>It's from her father, Dumont said, that Naoe receives her Hidden Blade.</p>
<p>Interestingly, whilst Naoe is super stealthy and can pull off the signature Leap of Faith if there's a handy pile of shrubbery or hay nearby, co-lead Yakuke can't.</p>
<p>"He doesn't do the Leap of Faith," Dumont said. "He just crashes right into the haystack, and he hurts his butt, too. So, it's pretty funny."</p>
<p>This dual perspective is to ensure fans of both the older and newer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a> are satisfied.</p>
<p>"A lot of people like Assassin's at the start with the stealth approach: hiding in the shadows and the crowd. Then we have a little bit more of the action-oriented ones... Odyssey, Origins, and Valhalla," Dumont added. "We try to satisfy both types of players, but also try to not dilute too much of what they like about it."</p>
<p>We also recently learned that Assassin's Creed Shadows will take a fresh approach to how it handles branching story and offer a mode "that allows a choice-free narrative".</p>
<p>In answer to questions from fans around how the game will balance the ability to make narrative decisions with fans' desire for a single representation of how Shadows' 'historical' narrative plays out, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-has-a-canon-mode-story-option-without-narrative-choices">Dumont revealed the game would feature a "canon mode"</a>.</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-reflects-on-series-struggle-to-tell-consistent-modern-day-story-after-desmond">Eurogamer heard from Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté on how the franchise will move forward with a more unified, well-maintained story</a> - and how its modern day portion will now feel more integral after years of being treated like an afterthought.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Black Ops 6 is getting a Double XP sweep starting tomorrow, December 24. Although it hasn’t been announced by Treyarch (or any Activision studio), there’s a listing for a Double XP event on the Black Ops 6 menu, and it says it’s starting tomorrow. This will be the latest in a long line of such events that have run since the game dropped in October.</p>



<p>Some could argue that Treyarch has put on <strong>too many </strong>Double XP events, reducing the efficacy of the ‘special period’ that allows players to get more out of their grind. Others have argued that the Double XP events are ‘fixed’ and that they don’t offer the full boost of experience points you’d expect.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-xp-incoming">More XP Incoming</h2>



<p>The next Black Ops 6 Double XP event is set to start tomorrow, December 24. That’s per a placeholder on the Black Ops 6 menu – it’s yet to be announced by Activision.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 has started struggling in recent weeks, ebbing away from the claims that it’s the ‘best Call of Duty game in years’, and that’s mostly because the title is <strong>plagued </strong>with cheaters. It was admitted by the Call of Duty team that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-anti-cheat-not-good-enough/">they ‘missed the mark’</a> with the game’s anti-cheat mechanic, which means it’s hard for anyone to have any faith in the product right now.</p>



<p>To that end, some pro players and streamers have started abandoning Black Ops 6 in favour of other games. Most recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-nadeshot/">Nadeshot gave up on streaming</a> Black Ops 6 and relocated to Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>In any case, Black Ops 6 is getting a new Double XP event from tomorrow, December 24. It comes at a time when many new players – the age-old ‘Christmas noobs’ – will be joining the ecosystem. However, thanks to SBMM – which definitely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-black-ops-6-have-sbmm-answered/">exists in Black Ops 6</a> – you won’t bump into them unless you’re pretty awful at the game.</p>

<p>A recent report suggested that Sega, the Japanese gaming giant, could produce a standalone game subscription service based on the extensive library it has built up over the years. This would likely see its games withdrawn from similar subscription schemes live today, capitalising on the growth of the operating model.</p>



<p>The gaming world is no stranger to such service. Today, Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, Rockstar Games, PlayStation, and Xbox all offer gaming-based subscription programs.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-undisclosed">Undisclosed</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgnj7e8028o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with the BBC</a>, Sega’s president, Shuji Utsumi, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re thinking something – and discussing something – we cannot disclose right now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He was talking about subscription-based products, and reportedly mentioned that they’re ‘very interesting’ and that Sega is ‘evaluating some opportunities’.</p>



<p>These days, the average gamer is surrounded by subscription-based schemes, and the rise of the live-service game has meant that we’re all putting money into a pot every few weeks over a long period, rather than paying for something once and then never again.</p>



<p>It’s one of the most common operating models in the gaming world right now.</p>



<p>Between Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus, some 80 million gamers worldwide are subscribed to a service that delivers free games every month and gives them access to repositories filled with games both old and new. </p>



<p>Ubisoft has a service that operates in much the same way, as does Electronic Arts with EA Play.</p>



<p>Sega entering the subscription market might not be the move everyone had on their cards, but why shouldn’t it? It’s free game and the market is wide open for such schemes right now.</p>



<p>Sega has been running since the 1960s, and in the 1990s, it really dominated the gaming industry. There are <strong>a lot </strong>of classic franchises sitting in that Sega library that would flesh out a subscription service quite nicely.</p>

<p>A reputable movie insider has said that more Indiana Jones games are in development.</p>



<p>That’s according to DanielRPK, who <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1870926309842473117?t=nxgc-3ez5wVn75-3JoS6Hg&amp;s=09" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweeted</a>, “Looks like we’re getting more Indy games.”</p>



<p>While there isn’t much to go on at face value, DanielRPK has had a knack for getting some tidbits from movies and games over the years, so his comment should suggest that some projects could have been greenlit behind the scenes.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, it’s only been two weeks since the Indiana Jones and The Great Circle released, so whether or not the game’s positive reception and/or sales led to more games being approved remains to be seen.</p>



<p>One thing is for sure, though – if the games were approved recently, we’re likely several years away from seeing another released.</p>



<p>The game description for Indiana Jones and The Great Circle reads, “Uncover one of history’s greatest mysteries in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle™, a first-person, single-player adventure set between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark™ and The Last Crusade™. Get ready to don your fedora and whip as you step into the shoes of the legendary archaeologist — Indiana Jones™. Embark on an epic globetrotting adventure in a race against enemy forces to uncover the secrets of the mysterious Great Circle.”</p>

We’re talking this year.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately for Dead Space fans, EA said it wasn’t interested, with Schofield suggesting projections for how many copies Dead Space 4 would have to sell to make the venture worthwhile were perhaps a key factor in the decision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We didn’t go too deep,” Schofield explained. “They just said, ‘We're not interested right now. We appreciate it blah blah blah, and you know we know who to talk to.’ So we didn't take it any further. And we respected their opinion. They know their numbers and what they have to ship and all that so yeah.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stone added that the video game industry’s high-profile struggles and its subsequent risk aversion has made projects such as Dead Space 4 a particularly hard sell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The industry is in a weird place right now,” Stone said. “People are really hesitant to take chances on things. So you got to take it with a grain of salt. Who knows, maybe one day. I think we'd all love to do it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah,” Schofield continued, “we got some ideas.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'd make a Dead Space 4,” Stone declared.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, it sounds like Dead Space 4 is an unlikely prospect, with EA focusing on its enormously successful sports games, The Sims, the revival of Battlefield, and Respawn’s ongoing projects, including the third Star Wars Jedi game. BioWare recently released Dragon Age Veilguard and is working on Mass Effect 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA released the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-remake-review">well-received Dead Space remake</a> in 2023, but since then EA hasn’t said anything about a potential Dead Space 4. The last mainline game in the franchise, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-space-3">Dead Space 3</a>, came out over a decade ago, in 2013.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
