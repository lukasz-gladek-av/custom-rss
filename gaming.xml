<div><p>Today, performer and cultural consultant KP Upadhyayula launched a crowdfunding campaign for Project Dastan. It is an ambitious project designed to uplift diverse voices within nerd culture. Furthermore, it is one of the first projects under a new creative-owned platform, Moonbeam.</p>
<h2>The Project Dastan Backerkit Campaign</h2>
<p>According to its campaign page, the goal of <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/kp11-studios/project-dastan?ref=bk-discover-search">Project Dastan</a> is to produce the first TTRPG actual play show in India. The show will feature local talented artists, writers, technicians, and producers, including professionals from Bollywood and Tollywood. The show's campaign will be in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder 2e</em></a>, and draw inspiration from the culture and history of India and South East Asia.</p>

These include Project Director Upadhyayula, whose work includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-beacon-membership-service-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Critical Role</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/eldritch-automata-cosmic-horror-mecha-ttrpg-blows-up-on-backerkit" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Eldritch Automata</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/crooked-moon-gets-over-10000-funded-on-kickstarter" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Crooked Moon</em></a>, and Creative Director Amaan, co-host of <em>The Infinite Tavern</em> podcast.</p>
<p>The campaign also has support from larger companies within the tabletop community. These include Paizo Inc, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/roll20-demiplane-acquisition-officially-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Roll20</a>, DriveThruRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/we-talk-about-digital-ttrpg-tools-candela-obscuras-and-demiplanes-future-with-ceo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Demiplane</a>, and Foam Brain Games.</p>
<p>Besides producing an actual play, Project Dastan wants to promote the creative and storytelling prowess of people from around the world. To directly quote the campaign:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a time when creators are endangered due to AI, corporate layoffs, exploitive streaming platforms, etc, we hope that we can be a place for mutual growth for our creators, not just through visibility but also through monetary support.</p>
<p>On top of that, we hope to use this momentum to help create the very first, high-production value Indian TTRPG actual play, using studios IN India, as well as local talents and crew. We want to tell an authentic story, while also showing the world that there is so much that the non-western world has to offer!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This creative community-driven ethos pairs with the fact that Project Dastan is being cross-promoted alongside Backerkit campaign: <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/collections/the-moonbeam-collection">Moonbeam</a>. Moonbeam is a new creative-owned, tabletop focused live streaming platform. One dedicated to creator and community empowerment and fair monetization.</p>

            <p>
Vampire Survivors, the minimalist survival RPG from developer Poncle, is joining Apple Arcade in August, along with Temple: Run Legends and  Vision Pro update for Castle Crumble.
</p>
<p>
Vampire Survivors has, of course, been available on iOS as a free-to-play release for some time, but its Apple Arcade version (Apple Arcade being Apple's £6.99/month game subscription service for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV) will be ad-free and include some paid DLC.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/vampire-survivors/id6478975337">Vampire Survivors+</a> (the '+' being Apple's way of denoting a game has previously been available on its App Store, usually with in-app purchases) will bundle in its Legacy of the Moonspell and Tides of the Foscari paid expansions. Whether the game's Emergency Meeting and Operation Guns DLC, both currently available for Vampire Survivors non-Apple Arcade release, will show up for subscribers at a later date isn't yet clear.
</p>

<p>
Vampire Survivors+ joins Apple Arcade on 1st August, and it'll be accompanied by <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/temple-run-legends/id1670483159">Temple Run: Legends</a>. This new version of the popular endless runner is the first game in the series to introduce levels, and will feature 500 of the things in story mode, alongside 10 different playable characters, leaderboards and achievements support, plus special events. Oh, and there's an endless mode if you start to feel nostalgic.
</p>
<p>
And finally for August's Apple Arcade additions, albeit arriving later on 29th August, there's that <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/castle-crumble/id1616814625">Castle Crumble</a> update for Apple's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-unveils-3499-augmented-reality-vision-pro-headset">Vision Pro mixed reality headset</a>. The core game is a physics-based puzzler in which players attempt to destroy castles across different eras - including Ancient, Medieval, and Aztec - by flinging spells and explosives at them. The Vision Pro version is that but in "spatial" form, enabling players to "tear down fantastical castles with every swish and flick of their fingers, and in any physical space they desire."
</p>
<p>
So yes, Apple Arcade subscribers can expect the above to join the service's approximately 200-strong games catalogue this August.

In the case of <em>Destiny</em>, Nexon has even been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/first-descendant-destiny-2-warframe-plagiarism-copy-1851580751&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/first-descendant-destiny-2-warframe-plagiarism-copy-1851580751">accused of ripping off art assets</a></span> directly from the game.

At one point, he even likens it to mac n’ cheese, and though the comparison is slightly favorable than it sounds (because who can hate on mac n’ cheese), it isn’t glowing still.</p><p>Nexon is known for making games that are often riddled with microtransactions, and which play like knockoffs of bigger, existing titles. Most of the chatter I’ve heard about the game has been centered on its apparently exhausting microtransactions. Having glanced around for some idea of how bad it is, the shit that <em>The First Descendant </em>is trying to pull is <em>not </em>okay. </p><p>The going price for some of its ultimate skins could pay for any number of things such as: a few simple meals, groceries, several drinks for you and some company at your closest happy hour, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-summer-sale-best-biggest-deals-deep-discounts-pc-1851564737&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-summer-sale-best-biggest-deals-deep-discounts-pc-1851564737">countless games on the Steam Summer Sale</a></span>, a day at an amusement park, a decent chunk of an affordable flight, or you know, a bill or two.</p><p>Players have not been crazy about these prices, as well as the long list of things that the game manages to monetize. They have, however, been frothing at the mouth for some of <em>The First Descendant</em>’s sexier skins and characters, such as Ult Bunny, which comes complete with a tiddy window. So I don’t know, man. You win some, you lose some. Here’s a sampling of some of the players’ complicated (and occasionally horny) thoughts on <em>The First Descendant.</em></p><figure id="" data-id="4085c23e0de3c706d2291edc3c0cc217"

<p>Season 2 of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has been delayed just two days before it was set to drop. The new season will now come July 25, according to Rocksteady.</p>



<p>“Update: Task Force X, we’ll be adjusting the release timing for the next season, [Suicide Squad] Season 2 will now launch on July 25. Thank you for your patience,” the <a href="https://x.com/suicidesquadRS/status/1810750789301735804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studio posted on the game’s</a> official Twitter account.</p>



<p>As far as the reason for the delay, nothing was given. Suicide Squad Season 2 features a new playable character — Mrs. Freeze — along with new gear, missions, maps, and more. As of writing, a trailer for the new season has yet to be revealed. For what it’s worth, the trailer for Season 1 was released a week prior to the launch. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Rocksteady for comment as to why the season was delayed on such short notice. Should a response be received, this article will be updated.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Overwatch 2 x TRANSFORMERS | Crossover Event Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Reinhardt players may be happy to hear that his Mythic Bound Demon weapon skin changes based on their gameplay. The skin will show "dynamic effects" that respond to their actions, including "charging into battle or holding the line." The Mythic Bound Demon will be available later this month, on July 23.</p><p dir="ltr">Going forward, players will occasionally be asked to take part in a survey on their phone or PC. This is in hopes of helping "identify areas where the game can be improved." On top of that, a new audio cue is being introduced that'll let players know when they're shooting enemies health, shields, or over health.</p><p dir="ltr">Below are the official patch notes for Overwatch 2.</p><h4 dir="ltr">HERO UPDATES</h4><p dir="ltr">GENERAL</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Armor flat damage reduction increased from 5 to 10 per projectile.</li><li dir="ltr">Enemy health bars now display when they are at their Low Health threshold.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: The armor changes have had a positive impact on which heroes and damage types are slowed down by armor health. We're increasing the damage reduction on it to further widen the pool of heroes that are significantly affected by armor's defense.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Tanks</h2><p dir="ltr">Tank Role Passive</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Ultimate generation reduction increased from 30 to 40%.</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback resistance reduced from 50 to 40%.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: Dealing damage to Tank heroes will be slightly less rewarding with the increased reduction to ultimate generation and will help to balance out the increased healing they may receive with the change to the Damage role passive in this patch. While the knockback resistance was generally useful for tank heroes and their emphasis on positioning, it was also reaching the point where it was difficult for players to tell if knockback abilities were having any effect on them.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>D.VA</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comment: The maximum duration of Defense Matrix is increased by half a second by reducing the rate at which the resource meter drains when in use, so it won't take longer to regenerate. The increased damage on Micro Missiles will help the ability feel relatively more impactful against larger health pools.</p><p dir="ltr">Defense Matrix</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Maximum duration increased from 3 to 3.5 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Micro Missiles</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Explosion damage increased from 4 to 5.5 damage (from 126 to 153 max damage with direct impacts)</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>DOOMFIST</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: Most of Doomfist's survivability is through his excellent mobility, but this boost to his passive Overhealth generation will enable him to stay in the fight longer before disengaging, especially when hitting multiple targets with his abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">The Best Defense…</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Overhealth gained per target increased from 35 to 40 HP.</li><li dir="ltr">Delay before Overhealth begins to drain increased from 1 to 3 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>JUNKER QUEEN</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: Junker Queen is relatively small and fast for a Tank hero, so Commanding Shout doesn't need a ton of bonus health to be effective. The increased wound healing better rewards her for managing her abilities well.</p><p dir="ltr">Commanding Shout</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Overhealth increased from 150 to 175 HP</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Adrenaline Rush</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Wound damage self-healing multiplier increased from 2 to 2.5x</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>MAUGA</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: Cardiac Overdrive is Mauga's primary tanking ability that keeps him in the fight, but the previous duration was difficult to counter. It is now a more potent effect with a shorter duration to increase the importance of choosing both the right moment to use it as Mauga and when to try mitigating against it as an enemy.</p><p dir="ltr">Overrun</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Knockback damage increased from 25 to 30</li><li dir="ltr">Stomp damage increased from 60 to 75</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Cardiac Overdrive</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Duration reduced from 5 to 3 seconds.</li><li dir="ltr">Lifesteal increased from 60 to 100%.</li><li dir="ltr">Damage reduction increased from 30 to 40%.</li><li dir="ltr">Allies now receive only half of the lifesteal and damage reduction effect value.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>ORISA</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: The Fortify and Javelin Spin abilities were weakened further than necessary when Orisa was overly dominant. She has not been performing well since then but in this patch where we're broadly adjusting how impactful the role is. So, there is room again to return some of Fortify's effectiveness.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortify</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Duration increased from 3.5 to 4 seconds</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>RAMATTRA</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: The Pummel damage adjustment is notable as it reduces the number of punches required to knockout a 250 health hero.</p><p dir="ltr">Nemesis Form</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Bonus armor increased from 225 to 300.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Pummel</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Pummel damage increased from 60 to 65.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>REINHARDT</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: One of the core design goals for Reinhardt is to be the hero that shields his team. In the past we've reduced the barrier health significantly in order to improve other offensive aspects of his kit to better fit the fast-paced gameplay of Overwatch 2, but perhaps it was too much. We still want to avoid barriers feeling mandatory due to how useful they can be and keep tank diversity at a healthy level. However, with this patch looking at the tank role in particular, we're increasing Reinhardt's barrier health again and will evaluate further.</p><p dir="ltr">Barrier Field</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Maximum health increased from 1400 to 1600.</li><li dir="ltr">Barrier regeneration rate increased from 140 to 160 health per second.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Charge</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Wall impact damage increased from 275 to 300.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>ROADHOG</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: The Pig Pen ability wasn't very useful outside of being used in the Chain Hook combo so we're increasing its potential threat if an enemy stays within its area.</p><p dir="ltr">Pig Pen</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Area damage after activating increased from 30 to 45 damage per second.</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery time reduced from 0.55 to 0.4 seconds.</li><li dir="ltr">Cooldown now begins immediately when used instead of after a short delay.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>SIGMA</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: Sigma is a tank that does not currently have an issue with survivability when cycling between managing his barrier, Kinetic Grasp, and weapon range. We are however increasing the damage of Accretion to bring back more of the threat it used to pose and increase the satisfaction in landing it, as it also did not benefit from the global increase to projectile sizes.</p><p dir="ltr">Accretion</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Impact damage increased from 40 to 80 (120 damage total).</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>WINSTON</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: Winston is one of the top performing tanks at the moment, though when considering how satisfying the individual abilities within his kit are, the Tesla Cannon secondary fire felt underwhelming for how long it took to charge, so it'll now be a bit more fluid. We also still want Primal Rage mode Winston to be killable, but adding some health to it will help avoid some of the extreme situations where it could happen too quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">Tesla Cannon</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Secondary fire charge time reduced from 1 second to 0.85 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Primal Rage</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Maximum health gained increased from 500 to 700.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>WRECKING BALL</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: Wrecking Ball has excellent mobility and survivability and will now be more efficient in transferring some of that survivability to his teammates, should he choose to return to them. We're also making the automatic reload in ball form match his manual reload timing for a smoother transition between modes.</p><p dir="ltr">Quad Cannons</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Automatic reload time while transformed reduced from 2 to 1.6 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Adaptive Shields</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Allied Overhealth transfer ratio increased by 50% (Use up to 50 Overhealth per target to grant allies up to 75 HP).</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>ZARYA</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: Increasing the health on these barriers also means the total energy Zarya can gain per barrier is increased, so this is a boost to both her offensive and defensive capabilities.</p><p dir="ltr">Particle Barrier</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Health increased from 200 to 225.</li><li dir="ltr">Duration increased from 2 to 2.5 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Projected Barrier</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Health increased from 200 to 225.</li><li dir="ltr">Duration increased from 2 to 2.5 seconds.</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">DAMAGE</h2><p dir="ltr">Damage Role Passive</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Now only half as effective against Tank heroes (10% healing reduction).</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: With Tank heroes being the frontline, they have this healing reduction effect nearly all of the time and are generally the most reliant on incoming healing to support them as well. The damage role passive is providing an important function to game overall, but its effect on tanks survivability and pace of gameplay is more impactful relative to the other roles. As such, we are reducing its potency against Tank heroes.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>ASHE</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: This Big Omnic Butler tanks a lot of incoming fire and will now be more resistant to knockbacks and critical damage.</p><p dir="ltr">B.O.B.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">B.O.B. now gains the Tank role passive ability.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>CASSIDY</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: With his current tuning Cassidy is performing well in too many aspects between his range, burst damage, and survivability, leading to him being a dominant choice among the Damage heroes by an overwhelming amount. The gameplay goal for Cassidy is to be the sturdier, close-range hitscan who is more proficient at dealing with high mobility flankers. With this in mind, we're pulling back the effective falloff range of his weapon to help align him with those gameplay goals and to open up more hero variety from the Damage role.</p><p dir="ltr">Peacekeeper</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Primary fire falloff range rescaled from 25-35 meters to 20-30 meters.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>PHARAH</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: This is a reversion back to Pharah's Concussive Blast from before her recent rework. Dealing even a small amount of damage with this ability increases her lethality significantly and made it too reliable in finishing off low health targets, due to its wide area and fast projectile speed, without waiting the full recovery to fire another rocket.</p><p dir="ltr">Concussive Blast</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Explosion damage reduced from 30 to 0.</li><li dir="ltr">Explosion knockback radius increased from 6 to 8 meters.</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback increased by 11%.</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">Support</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>ANA</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: Rather small change here but we'd like to minimize the amount of time Tanks can be taken out of the fight for and they are also the easiest targets to hit with Sleep Dart.</p><p dir="ltr">Sleep Dart</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Duration of effect on Tank heroes decreased from 3.5 to 3 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>ILLARI</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: Illari will still see this UI alert but allies generally don't need to as it could occur fairly often and be distracting.</p><p dir="ltr">Healing Pylon</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Allies no longer see the "Destroyed" UI when Healing Pylon breaks</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>ZENYATTA</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Developer Comments: We're reducing the cost of Transcendence as Zenyatta was impacted more than most by some of the changes in this patch.</p><p dir="ltr">Transcendence</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Ultimate cost decreased 10%.</li></ul><h4 dir="ltr">BUG FIXES</h4><p dir="ltr">General</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Fixed ranked progress bar UI not showing progress for Bronze 5.</li><li dir="ltr">Fixed voice and text chat not functioning on PC with console players.</li><li dir="ltr">Fixed in a previous update - Weekly and Daily Challenges would get reset to 0 after relog for some players.</li><li dir="ltr">Fixed in a previous update - Screen tearing on PlayStation® 5 during large fights.</li><li dir="ltr">Fixed in a previous update - Season 11 Voice Lines could be heard by anyone at any distance.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Heroes</p><p dir="ltr">Cassidy</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Fixed Deadeye tracking phased targets when revealed by Infra Sight.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">D.Va</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Fixed an issue with Self Destruct hitting targets behind barriers or collision.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Kiriko</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Fixed teleporting to Echo as clone ends making the "Swift Step" ability to break for the remainder of the game.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Lifeweaver</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Fixed an exploit with Lifeweaver tree hiding Symmetra turrets in the payload.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Roadhog</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Fixed Roadhog's weapon model/placement being largely higher wearing 'Kaiju' skin.</li></ul>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">When the second act of Echoes, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s current content Episode, drops on July 16, it's going to refresh the game with a few significant changes. Among them are new weapons for players to chase and new Artifact mods that will add some big enhancements to sniper rifles and Solar weapons, giving a chance for new builds for players to use during the next six weeks.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie gave a sense of what's coming in Act 2 in its recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCmAyvFa-dQ&amp;ab_channel=Destiny2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">livestream</a>. The new act brings three new Battlegrounds activities that will continue to advance the story, while also adding more guns for players to chase in Episode activities. There are also five new Artifact mods for players to earn and unlock, and some significant balancing changes coming to the game, as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The new guns coming to the game are pretty notable. One is Aberrant Action, a new Solar rocket-assisted sidearm, a gun archetype that has quickly become one of the best in the game. Aberrant Action can roll both Incandescent, which sets enemies on fire, and Heal Clip, which heals you when you reload based on the kills you scored, which already sounds extremely overpowered. There are only two other rocket-assisted sidearms--essentially, pistols that shoot rockets--currently available, and both are excellent, so this is going likely to be the best weapon in Act 2, and possibly the entire episode.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie showed off two other Act 2 guns. The first, Corrasion, is an Arc pulse rifle with the newish Heavy Burst archetype, which fires a powerful two-round burst. The second is Perfect Paradox, a shotgun we haven't seen in the game since the Season of the Dawn in 2020. Bungie says it'll include its old, classic set of perks, as well as new ones that have been added to the game since its original release.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside the opportunity to use new weapons, the new mods coming to the Echoes Artifact have the potential to change PvE gameplay in some significant ways. The five mods are focused on boosting Solar weapons and sniper rifles, so guns like Whisper of the Worm are going to become pretty strong in Act 2. That'll give players a reason to use some new weapons and craft new builds to take on high-level content.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's the list of new mods and what they do:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Anti-Barrier Sniper: Sniper Rifles can stun Barrier champions.</li><li dir="ltr">Authorized Mods: Scavenger -- Reduces the cost of Scavenger armor mods.</li><li dir="ltr">Incendiary Rifle Rounds -- Solar sniper precision hits scorch targets.</li><li dir="ltr">Solar Fulmination -- Solar ignitions do increased damage and have a larger radius.</li><li dir="ltr">Sniper's Meditation -- Sniper hits grant stacking bonuses to sniper damage, stability, and reload speed for a short time. Heavy ammo sniper rifle hits count as more than one.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Finally, Bungie outlined a few balancing changes to weapons coming in Act 2. To further enhance the usability of sniper rifles, Bungie is cutting the amount of flinch you receive for taking hits by half in PvE activities, which should make hitting targets a little easier. Scout rifles are getting a 30% damage buff in PvE to make them more effective, which should make Timeworn Wayfarer, the Episode's Solar scout rifle, significantly stronger. And Eriana's Vow, a Barrier-punching hand cannon, is getting its damage against those Barriers increased by 67%, which will make its ammo economy feel a little better.</p><p dir="ltr">Also on the docket for Destiny 2 is Solstice of Heroes, the game's summertime event. Solstice brings unique guns and armor pieces that are only available during the event, and Bungie showed off concept art for how this year's armor will look. Bungie said the look is meant to evoke the idea of exploration and discovery.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24194234/summer-games-done-quick-2024-recap-peanut-butter-the-dog<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24187364/summer-games-done-quick-watch-live-sgdq">Summer Games Done Quick</a> concluded over the weekend, raising $2.5 million for Doctors Without Borders. While the figure didn’t break any records, the speedrunning charity event hit a major milestone, reaching <a href="https://twitter.com/GamesDoneQuick/status/1809041320071287138?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1809041320071287138%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc">a lifetime total of over $50 million raised</a> across all events and charities in its 10-plus-year history.</p><p>With the general news out of the way, let’s talk about the highlight of the weeklong stream: a shiba inu named Peanut Butter.</p><p>You may remember him. He was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24040350/awesome-games-done-quick-2024-how-to-watch-twitch">a major highlight of Awesome Games Done Quick 2024,</a> when he became the first dog to participate, running <em>Gyromite</em> with the assistance of his owner, JSR, and a custom controller. Peanut Butter and JSR completed the run remotely, but for their Summer Games Done Quick run, they attended in person with a brand-new controller and a new game: <em>Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball </em>for the Super Nintendo.</p><p>I was really worried about this in-person run. To play the game, JSR, with the help of some kibble, instructs Peanut Butter to hit a button with the correct timing to either strike out a batter or hit a home run. The patience and concentration required to perform complex tricks like that is probably stressful enough for a dog, even without the disruption of a large and loud crowd of people. But Peanut Butter managed the distractions beautifully. Whenever the dog’s attention started to wane, JSR refocused him with the ultimate treat: some cheese on a stick.</p><p>Halfway through the run, it was looking grim for Peanut Butter, who was down 0–1 in the sixth inning. But after loading the bases, we all held our breath as we waited to see if Peanut Butter would finally score. He did, and the energy from the crowd was so infectious, I felt it three time zones away.</p><p>There was a moment when it didn’t seem like Peanut Butter would complete his objective to win the game. Tied and in extra innings, any score from the computer would immediately result in a loss. But Peanut Butter proved he is the best of boys, winning the game in dramatic fashion with a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 12th inning, scoring with Ken Griffey Jr. himself. The hype was so great it couldn’t be contained to just the Games Done Quick audience, and pretty soon Peanut Butter’s exploits appeared on <a href="https://www.espn.com/video/clip/_/id/40502570">ESPN.com</a> and Canadian sports channel Sportsnet.</p><p>There are, of course, other fun runs to watch in addition to Peanut Butter’s Big Baseball Score. The <a href="https://youtu.be/AN8Gr0C6MZI?si=LMzY5enBvV9TWEV0"><em>Super Metroid</em></a><em> </em>race was pretty exciting and incredibly close. There’s a <a href="https://youtu.be/ypBqN1VXx8Q?si=FdO9Vq61AZm_FGgx"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a> run done <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/30/23982661/baldurs-gate-3-patch-5-details">on the hardest difficulty</a> and without exploiting any glitches. And there’s a run of <a href="https://youtu.be/QfzOc97vYEk?si=nJrTRhHPrC1KQ9XY"><em>Super Mario 64</em></a> where the runner is blindfolded and every star’s location is randomized. Every run is available as <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40gamesdonequick">a VOD on YouTube</a>, and with over 150 runs, you’re guaranteed to find something interesting. </p><p>It sounds a little saccharine, but there’s something sublime about watching a dog play video game baseball with thousands of other people. I have an incredibly soft and tender spot for dogs, especially ones that look like and are as smart as Peanut Butter. It’s hard being around them, even through a computer screen, without getting completely overwhelmed. And though I had to do it through a curtain of tears, watching Peanut Butter eased a grief I still can’t name directly even a year later. </p><p>What a good boy.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It also likely means that some of these worlds will be larger than older <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games, like <em>Syndicate or Unity</em>. It’s nice to hear that traveling around these planets was a main focus for the team and that it won’t take up too much time thanks to your speedy hoverbike. And players won’t end up fast traveling everywhere all the time because it takes too long to reach places, a problem in many open world games. </p><p>Previously, Ubisoft had suggested that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-how-big-time-to-beat-30-hours-1851536051&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-how-big-time-to-beat-30-hours-1851536051"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> won’t take 100 hours to complete</a></span>, like some previously published Ubisoft open-world games, and instead many players will likely reach the end after about 30 hours or so. </p><p>“So we don’t want things to be just big for big sake,” explained Gerighty. “We need it to be contained, always fun, always proposing different activities. So the traversal of the whole thing had to feel like a journey, a commitment when you get on your speeder and you want it to go from one end to the next.”</p><p>  <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> launches on August 30 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. </p><p><strong>Pre-order <em>Star Wars Outlaws:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Outlaws-Limited-Exclusive-PlayStation/dp/B0D187PJHJ/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-planets-list-size-how-big-4-5-minutes-1851583277&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0D187PJHJ" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/379647/864200/12050?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fstar-wars-outlaws%2F645ba713a9ce0448bffa4c12.html%3F_gl%3D1%2A8j5zra%2A_ga%2AMjMxNzc2NTMwLjE3MTI2OTI0NjQ.%2A_ga_C4N5020N2R%2AMTcxMjY5MjQ2NC4xLjEuMTcxMjY5MjQ3My41MS4wLjA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/379647/864200/12050?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fstar-wars-outlaws%2F645ba713a9ce0448bffa4c12.html%3F_gl%3D1%2A8j5zra%2A_ga%2AMjMxNzc2NTMwLjE3MTI2OTI0NjQ.%2A_ga_C4N5020N2R%2AMTcxMjY5MjQ2NC4xLjEuMTcxMjY5MjQ3My41MS4wLjA." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cl0KUA0uAJz&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cl0KUA0uAJz" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/five-things-to-know-before-playing-zenless-zone-zero/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/zenless-zone-zero-reaches-50-million-global-downloads-hoyoverses-latest-success/">Zenless Zone Zero </a>is the latest free-to-play game release from Chinese developer miHoYo, who is responsible for creating titles such as Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail. If you plan on getting stuck into the brand-new gacha game (available for PC, PlayStation 5, Android, and iOS), here are five things you should know before playing Zenless Zone Zero.</p>
<h2>Before You Start Playing Zenless Zone Zero, Read This</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WCCFzenlesszonezero2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Getting stuck into a brand-new gacha game can be very overwhelming. There are lots of new materials and resources that you have to work on collecting to ensure you can pull the best characters. However, what may work for someone may not work for you, and you may find the underdog a better character than someone hugely popular.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Utilize the Coffee and Noodle Shop</strong>. Once you've unlocked it, make sure to visit it often. By visiting the Coffee and Noodle House, you can purchase buffs that can replenish your battery charge and get some free materials.</li>
<li><strong>Test out the Agents before upgrading them</strong>. Luckily, with the Hollow Deep Dive System, you can test out the Agents to see if you like their damage output and abilities. Some of the characters may not mesh with you, and it's important to take them on a test drive before committing your precious resources to one you may not even like!</li>
<li><strong>Learning to dodge and counter is crucial</strong>. The windows you are given to dodge and counter enemy attacks are incredibly slim. Every enemy type will be different, too. However, it is essential to learn to time them perfectly, as it can make or break a situation.</li>
<li><strong>ZZZ is free to play, but you can purchase items with real currency</strong>. This can be a huge issue for many people, as they start off by spending only a little, but it all adds up over time! Keep track of your spending, and remember that this game is completely free to play. There are no pay-to-win elements in this game.</li>
<li><strong>Save your Polychrome</strong>. Polychrome is a premium resource given to you, so you can buy Master Tape to roll on banners to unlock new characters. However, you want to avoid spending it on the standard banners at all costs. Instead, save it up so that you can exchange it to get the Encrypted Master Tape, allowing you to roll on event banners as and when they happen.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are some of the top tips you should remember before getting stuck in Zenless Zone Zero. Be careful; the game is a real time sink! Good luck, and have fun.</p>

You’ll (most likely) first see Apsaras, surrounded by demons kneeling before her. According to her, she wants to protect these demons by forcing them to acknowledge their weaknesses and seek protection from her circle of gods. Meanwhile, Leanan Sidhe wishes to enrich the lives of weaker demons and help them realize their dreams, even if it winds up cutting their lives short.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Both ask you to assassinate the other, since they view each other as dangerous and disingenuous.

As per <em>Shin Megami Tensei </em>tradition, many of your decisions will push you towards the Law or Chaos alignment. If you’re familiar with <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>’ grid-alignment system, you’ll have a general baseline of what these terms mean in this universe. However, for those new to <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em>, know that <strong>Law and Chaos do not necessarily mean “good” and “evil.”</strong></p><p>In short, <strong>Law in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> is synonymous with the status quo.</strong> If you make decisions that uphold the hierarchy of the old god(s) ruling over humanity, go against the ideology of “survival of the fittest,” and value peace over individuality, your alignment will veer towards Law. </p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>the Chaos alignment predominantly focuses on freedom</strong>. This typically includes rebelling against the powers that be, enriching yourself when you can, and seeking to revolutionize the world. This isn’t a complete description of each alignment, but those are the overarching ideals.</p><p>That said, the impact of alignment is fairly subdued in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em>. Without divulging into spoilers, this mechanic primarily exists to dictate which ending you <em>should </em>get in the Canon of Creation and which ending you <em>will </em>get in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-girls-hand-tips-1851540115&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-girls-hand-tips-1851540115"><em>Canon of Vengeance</em></a></span>. But don’t worry, <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance </em>isn’t hiding a robust branching narrative a la <em>Mass Effect</em> or other games with more complex alternative narrative outcomes.</p><h3 id="h510"><a id=""></a>So which alignments do Apsaras and Leanan Sidhe represent?</h3><p><strong>Siding with Apsaras will push your alignment towards Law, whereas choosing Leanan Sidhe is the Chaos-friendly option</strong>. That said, you have ample time to tilt your alignment towards whichever side you want before this mechanic even matters. You’ll find quests that follow this exact formula as you progress, complete with the reward of recruiting a free demon to your party. </p><p>If you’re playing the Canon of Vengeance, Yoko will also comment on your choice. She’ll stick with you regardless of what alignment path you pick, but if you feel a kinship with her, know that she generally prefers Chaos-aligned options when given a choice.</p><figure id="" data-id="6e307c52a0250ce07b0970ffd1595752" data-recommend-id="image://6e307c52a0250ce07b0970ffd1595752" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character talks with Apsaras, a demon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player character talks with Apsaras, a demon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->ATLUS / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6e307c52a0250ce07b0970ffd1595752" data-recommend-id="image://6e307c52a0250ce07b0970ffd1595752" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character talks with Apsaras, a demon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h511"><a id="stats"></a>Apsaras and Leanan Sidhe’s stats and abilities</h2><p>If you don’t care about the story implications of your decision, you can base your decision on which demon you’d prefer in your party instead. To be clear, <strong>you can get both Asparas and Leanan Sidhe once your level is high enough</strong>.

She has access to the single-target Bufu and the party-wide Mabufu, which comes in clutch for the early game–fter all, AoE attacks remain fairly scarce until you reach roughly level 20. Additionally, Apsaras learns Patra (which heals ailments) and Tarunda (an attack debuff), which lets her play support. This is especially helpful on the Canon of Vengeance path, since you’ll encounter an early-game boss whose signature attack is a party-wide charm spell. Since <strong>Apsaras is fully immune to Charm</strong>, she is uniquely qualified to counter this mechanic.</p><p>However, <strong>Apsaras is weak to fire</strong>. That  makes her a liability in the game’s first major boss encounter.</p><figure id="" data-id="39cfd3e58b321cd4f9d52d89c0483a6a" data-recommend-id="image://39cfd3e58b321cd4f9d52d89c0483a6a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leanan Sidhe's character screen shows her various stats, moves, and abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Leanan Sidhe's character screen shows her various stats, moves, and abilities." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->ATLUS / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="39cfd3e58b321cd4f9d52d89c0483a6a" data-recommend-id="image://39cfd3e58b321cd4f9d52d89c0483a6a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leanan Sidhe's character screen shows her various stats, moves, and abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Meanwhile, <strong>Leanan Sidhe specializes in inflicting status ailments and healing</strong>. Marin Karin inflicts the Charm status ailment on one enemy, which has boosted odds of succeeding thanks to her Burden of Talent passive ability. She even regenerates MP when inflicting status ailments thanks to her Curse Siphon<strong> </strong>skill. However, I’d argue the real star of Leanan Sidhe’s kit is Media as party-wide healing is invaluable in tough battles, and up until this point, you’d only have access to Angel’s signature move Humble Blessing for team healing. </p><p>Leanan Sidhe also learns Mudo and Mamudo, allowing her to target enemies weak to dark magic with her high magic stat. All told, Leanan Sidhe is surprisingly versatile out of the box.</p><figure id="" data-id="24d9804f029a103504feffafe1e508db" data-recommend-id="image://24d9804f029a103504feffafe1e508db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character talks to Leanan Sidhe, a demon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player character talks to Leanan Sidhe, a demon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->ATLUS / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="24d9804f029a103504feffafe1e508db" data-recommend-id="image://24d9804f029a103504feffafe1e508db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character talks to Leanan Sidhe, a demon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h512"><a id="choice"></a>Should you pick Apsaras or Leanan Sidhe?</h2><p>If alignment isn’t a concern, I’d say your decision depends on your party make-up and your story path. <strong>If you’re playing the Canon of Vengeance, I’d recommend Apsaras</strong>. The combination of Charm immunity and access to Patra just helps so much against that one certain boss. Also, Apsaras’ resistances are a good early-game fit for your protagonist’s affinities, so using her early means you’ll get her Essence sooner.</p><p>That said, <strong>if you need party-wide healing, Leanan Sidhe is a great pick</strong>. She provides solid damage and potentially invaluable support depending on your team composition.You can’t go wrong with using her. Status ailments are also more helpful than you’d think in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em>, so access to charm is no small thing either.</p><p><br>Frankly, I wound up using <em>both </em>Apsaras and Leanan Sidhe throughout the early game. They’re valuable, bring helpful tools to your party, and are well worth the cost of fusing them. So no matter what you’ll pick, there’s no wrong answer here. You’ll be able to get whichever demon you missed in just a few levels anyway.  </p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The new PS Plus July 2024 games for the Extra and Premium tiers have leaked, and they are quite good.</p>
<p>The information once again comes from reputable deals leaker 'billbil-kun', who <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/playstation-plus-extra-premium-juillet-2024-voici-un-apercu-des-nouveaux-titres-qui-vont-bientot-rejoindre-le-catalogue-de-jeux-54974" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> the upcoming new title for Sony's subscription service on French deals website Dealabs. According to the leaker, this month's new additions for the Extra and Premium tiers include fan-favorite <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crisis-core-final-fantasy-vii-reunion-the-price-of-freedom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/remnant-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remnant 2</a>. Other titles are said to include Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous – Enhanced Edition, Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord, No More Heroes 3, and Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes Complete Edition.</p>
<p>Aside from Remant 2, it's possible that Remnant: From the Ashes will also be added to the service, but according to the leaker, the information about this title also being included isn't 100%.</p>
<p>As always with these kinds of leaks and rumors, the information hasn't been officially confirmed by Sony just yet. Going by this leaker's track record, however, it's only a matter of time before Sony's official announcement will follow. Going by previous monthly announcements, the new PS Plus titles are expected to be officially announced tomorrow with the games being added to the tiers next week on July 17th. We'll update you as soon as we learn more about the next batch of PS Plus games.</p>
<p>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion was released for PC and consoles back in 2022. This remaster was released to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Final Fantasy VII. Here's what we wrote about the remaster in our launch review:</p>
<p><em>"With vastly enhanced visuals and audio, a major combat overhaul that finally makes the game fun to play, and a great ending, Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII – Reunion is, without a doubt, one of the best remasters released in recent years. While some of the original's issues haven't been addressed, such as the bad story pacing and mediocre writing, they shouldn't stop any Final Fantasy VII fan from getting the game. The price of freedom is steep, but it is one worth paying."</em></p>

<p>Sony is getting set to announce the July additions to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog, but before that happens, a few of the games set to be added have been leaked.</p>



<p>According to the ever reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/playstation-plus-extra-premium-juillet-2024-voici-un-apercu-des-nouveaux-titres-qui-vont-bientot-rejoindre-le-catalogue-de-jeux-54974" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun and dealabs</a>, Remnant 2 and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 Reunion are set to be added to the collection this month. The announcement of the July games, the report says, is expected to come on Wednesday, July 10. The games are expected to be available starting July 17.</p>



<p>In addition to those two headliner games, other games expected to be added to the service include Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord, No More Heroes 3, Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes Complete Edition, and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous – Enhanced Edition.</p>



<p>Other games coming to the catalog weren’t revealed in the report, but, on average, Sony adds about 12-15 games per month to the service. So, we could expect to see at least six to nine more games announced.</p>



<p>Last month the catalog <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-game-catalog-gets-14-games-in-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saw 14 games added</a>, including Monster Hunter Rise, Crusader Kings 3, Football Manager 24, and more.</p>



<p>The PlayStation Plus Game Catalog is available to all subscribers of PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium. Those with Premium usually get access to additional classic games.</p>

<p>MrBeast just revealed (yet again) that his next video is his ‘best video yet’. This weekend, he’ll publish one of the most star-studded videos he’s ever produced, featuring fifty of the biggest content creators in the world, sealed in a glass cube and being made to compete for a $1 million prize.</p>



<p>It’s not clear from the video what the challenges will be, but it was said that the $1 million prize is ‘for their subscribers’, and while fifty enter, only <strong>one </strong>streamer will be successful.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-huge-lineup">Huge Lineup</h2>



<p>In the trailer for MrBeast’s next video, which will drop this Saturday, one of the most monumental lineups imaginable is standing front and centre, ready to win the $1 million grand prize. Here are some of the most notable personalities taking part in the challenge video:</p>



<ul>
<li>Pokimane</li>



<li>Kai Cenat</li>



<li>Bella Poarch</li>



<li>The Botez Sisters</li>



<li>KSI</li>



<li>Logan Paul</li>



<li>Ludwig</li>



<li>FaZe Rug</li>



<li>Lazarbeam</li>



<li>Sketch</li>



<li>Speed</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a veritable smorgasbord of energetic content creators, which means that the level of drama is set to reach epic proportions. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s a glass cube full of somewhat ostentatious streamers who have all had their fair share of issues with controversies, scandals, and ego-fuelled rises to stardom. It’ll be interesting to see how it plays out given the stock taking part in the challenge.</p>



<p>From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sketch-confirms-of-leaks-real-stream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sketch’s recent OnlyFans leak</a> to Speed’s tortured experiences at the hands of his fans in Europe, plenty has blown up recently to take some of these creators to the tops of news feeds worldwide.</p>



<p>Jimmy isn’t wrong – it could be his best video yet.</p>

It was one of the major reasons many disliked Destiny 2's seasons, the game's previous approach to delivering new stories between major expansions.</p><p dir="ltr">Seasons would break up stories into weekly tidbits that could usually be finished up within an hour or two, forcing players to wait days for the next installment like a weekly TV show and often feeling artificially drawn out for no good reason. The new Episode structure was meant to replace the season approach by dividing stories into larger six-week acts that would change the game up more often.  In Echoes Act 1, however, the story was still dished out in small bits week by week, making it feel like a season by another name.</p><p dir="ltr">Narrative director Alison Luhrs said on the stream that Bungie heard that feedback from players and agreed. As such, all three of the story beats for Act 2 will drop at the same time--at the launch of the act--and the same goes for Act 3. The idea is that players can work through the story at their own pace; if they want to binge it all on the first day, that's up to them.</p><p dir="ltr">The upside of the act structure seems to be that it allows the game to be even more responsive to what's happening in the story. Bungie showed off two of Act 2's new Battlegrounds activities, which take place on Nessus and have players hunting for answers by delving underground. The Battlegrounds feature altered locations that were first introduced at the end of Act 1; at the end of that story, a white Radiolaria lake on Nessus was drained, revealing a whole new area beneath it. The Battlegrounds will explore what's changed there, with players heading underground to find out where all that Radiolaria went, and why.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Luhrs, the act will also take players back to explore one of Destiny's "most storied locations," while the game continues to tell the story of Saint-14, who is struggling with his identity after an encounter with the mysterious apparent villain of Echoes, a being known as the Conductor.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the Battlegrounds themselves, they should see some pretty intense fights. Senior activity designer Ryan Harris said the team is trying to differentiate Battlegrounds from Strikes by making them more combat-intensive, with as many as 40 enemies on screen at a time and new bosses specific to the activities. These include Vex Wyverns that will come at players in pairs and feature the new behavior of teleporting to flank players and avoid attacks. There might also be a boss with, as Harris put it, the biggest health pool he'd ever given one.</p>

<p>In 1994, Hewlett-Packard released a miracle machine: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_200LX">HP 200LX</a> pocket-size PC. In the depths of the device, among the MS-DOS productivity apps built into its fixed memory, there lurked a first-person maze game called <em>Lair of Squid</em>. Intrigued by the game, we tracked down its author, Andy Gryc, and probed into the title's mysterious undersea origins.</p>

<p>"If you ask my family, they’ll confirm that I’ve been obsessed with squid for a long time," Gryc told Ars Technica. "It’s admittedly very goofy—and that’s my fault—although I was inspired by <i data-stringify-type="italic">Doom</i>, which had come out relatively recently."</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Lair of Squid</i>, you're trapped in an underwater labyrinth, seeking a way out while avoiding squid roaming the corridors. A collision with any cephalopod results in death. To progress through each stage and ascend to the surface, you locate the exit and provide a hidden, scrambled code word. The password is initially displayed as asterisks, with letters revealed as you encounter them within the maze.</p>

<p>Buckle up for a tale of rogue coding, cephalopod obsession, and the most unexpected Easter egg in palmtop history. This is no fish story—it's the saga of <em>Lair of Squid</em>.</p>
<h2>A computer in the palm of your hand</h2>
<p>Introduced in 1994, the HP 200LX palmtop PC put desktop functionality in a pocket-size package. With a small QWERTY keyboard, MS-DOS compatibility, and a suite of productivity apps, the clamshell 200LX offered a vision of one potential future of mobile computing. It featured a 7.91 MHz 80186 CPU, a monochrome 640x200 CGA display, and 1–4 megabytes of RAM.</p>

<p>I've <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/gear-envy-my-collection-of-500-plus-pieces-of-computer-and-gaming-hardware">collected</a> vintage computers since 1993, and people frequently offer to send me old devices they'd rather not throw away. Recently, a former HP engineer sent me his small but nice collection of '90s <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-golden-age-of-hp-palmtop-pcs">HP handheld palmtop computers</a>, including a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_95LX">95LX</a> (1991), <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.net/display_item.php?hw=198">100LX</a> (1993), and 200LX.</p>
<p>HP designed its portable LX series to run many MS-DOS programs that feature text mode or CGA graphics, and each includes built-in versions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_1-2-3">Lotus 1-2-3</a> spreadsheet, a word processor, terminal program, calculator, and more.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/3010/hp-95lx-games-from-compuserve-in-the-1990s">owned a 95LX</a> as a kid (a hand-me-down from my dad's friend), which came with a simplistic overhead maze game called <a href="https://archive.org/details/TigerFoxV2.11990EverettKaserAction"><em>TigerFox</em></a>. So imagine my surprise in 2024, when trawling through the productivity and personal organization apps on that 200LX, to find a richly detailed first-person maze game based around cephalopods, of all things.</p>
<p>(I was less surprised to find an excellent built-in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/how-bill-gates-minesweeper-addiction-helped-lead-to-the-xbox/"><em>Minesweeper</em></a> clone, <em>Hearts and Bones</em>, which is definitely a more natural fit for the power and form of the 200LX itself.)</p>
<p><em>Lair of Squid</em> isn't a true <em>Doom</em> clone since it's not a first-person shooter (in some ways, it's more like a first-person <em>Pac-Man</em> without pellets), but its mere existence—on a black-and-white device best suited for storing phone numbers and text notes—deserves note as one of the weirdest and most interesting pack-in games to ever exist.</p>
<p>Just after discovering <em>Lair of Squid</em> on my device earlier this year, I <a href="https://x.com/benjedwards/status/1786944643701125358">tweeted</a> about it, and I extracted the file for the game (called "maze.exe") from the internal ROM drive and sent it to DOS gaming historian <a href="https://ko-fi.com/dosnostalgic">Anatoly Shashkin</a>, who put the game <a href="https://archive.org/details/LairOfSquidHP200lx">on The Internet Archive</a> so anyone can play it in their browser.</p>
<p>After that, I realized that I wanted to figure out who wrote this quirky game, and thanks to a post on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.classicdosgames.com/interviews/everettkaser.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.classicdosgames.com/interviews/everettkaser.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">RGB Classic Games</a>, I found a name: Andy Gryc. With some luck in cold-emailing, I found him.</p>
