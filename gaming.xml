  <p id="TQzm7M"><strong>Tribal quests</strong> are one of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/22381941/beginners-job-subscription-teleport-mount-shadowbringers-endwalker"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a>’s more rewarding <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24118981/reset-daily-weekly-times-server-time">dailies</a>. Formerly known as “beast tribe quests,” these quests involving helping out the other races of Eorzea by beating down baddies that might be giving them grief, or helping them rebuild an area using crafting and gathering.</p>
<p id="VT3eWy">Below, we detail how tribal quests in <em>FFXIV </em>work, along with their rewards and how to unlock all of them.</p>

<hr id="e4Ke81">
<h2 id="8Lgdsm"><strong>Tribal quests in FFXIV, explained</strong></h2>
<p id="525F1Z">Tribal quests are daily quests you can complete to earn reputation and specialized currency. There are more than a dozen different tribes in <em>FFXIV</em> and they all offer different quests and rewards. These are great dailies to do to earn chunks of EXP, as some tribes focus on combat, whereas others focus on crafting or gathering.</p>
<p id="1NxgEW">You can accept a total of <strong>12 tribal quests per day</strong> and each tribe will give you up to <strong>three quests per day</strong>. If you rank up with that tribe, they’ll give you an additional three more to complete.</p>
<p id="eaL4L6">For each quest you accept and turn in, you’ll get some <strong>reputation points</strong> with that tribe. After amassing a certain amount of points, you’ll rank up with that tribe, allowing you to complete another quest and access more rewards. You can check your reputation from your character screen. You’ll need to use the currency you get from completing the quests to buy the rewards (like the aforementioned mounts and minions).</p>

<p id="Q2xL5f">Most of the quests are as simple as accepting the assignments, talking to an NPC, and then either taking out enemies, riding a mount to certain locations, crafting items out of given materials, or gathering certain things from nodes.</p>
<p id="g0TTwG">Note that the tribes from <em>A Realm Reborn</em> have some gimmicks that later tribes do not. The combat tribes may require you to complete specific FATEs in the area to finish them. For Ixali crafting quests specifically, you need to have the given set of Ehcatl Wristgloves equipped while you’re making their crafts.</p>
<p id="Tk5Ivz">Once you hit bloodsworn rank with all the tribes per expansion, you’ll unlocked the <strong>allied tribal quests</strong> for that expansion. (This is with the exception of <em>Shadowbringers</em> tribes, which have no allied quests.) These are just regular story side quests (not dailies) and there are exclusive rewards like emotes locked them.</p>
<hr id="qnOmah">
<h2 id="yBbbdR"><strong>Notable tribal quest rewards in FFXIV</strong></h2>
<p id="e2YSyK">Each tribe has some keystone rewards behind it.

<p id="h7lqHf">Before unlocking any tribal quests, you’ll need to complete the <strong>level 41 main scenario quest “In Pursuit of the Past.”</strong> You’ll also need a combat, crafting, or gathering job of appropriate level, depending on which tribe you’re trying to unlock.</p>
<p id="if7N3r">As usual, the quests to unlock this content will be marked with a blue quest marker with a plus sign on it, so you should keep your eyes out for those.</p>

                <p>A sequel to Aerial Knight's Never Yield has been announced during IGN Live, appropriately titled We Never Yield. We Never Yield builds upon and continues the story of the game's previous entry alongside adding new features that were not present in the game's previous entry such as voice-acting and local multiplayer.</p><p>We Never Yield continues the story of Wally and Lone, twin brothers who were destined to receive their family treasure. This time around, Wally and Lone will be attempting to work together to resolve their issues from the previous entry. "You do not see a lot of Black characters resolving trauma with each other," developer Neil Jones said. With dual protagonists, players can still play solo, but the game becomes easier by playing with another person, where players can use two separate controllers or have half of a portion of the controller or buttons assigned to that individual.</p><p>Even though We Never Yield is a sequel, players do not need to play the previous entry to catch up on the story, since the initial 10 minutes will cover the plot of Never Yield alongside that game's ending. One of the most game-changing features this time around is the addition of The Power of Kings, which is a meter built up after bypassing a few obstacles that can be used to create a dash, but by waiting until the meter is completely filled--invulnerability is gained (with the summoning of a crown) to smash obstacles in your way for more challenging sections in the game.</p><p>Hub areas allow the twin brothers to take a breath, speak with one another, change outfits, and lore tablets allow deeper knowledge into the game's kingdom of its founding, creation, and worldbuilding.</p><p>We Never Yield releases on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ps4/" data-ref-id="5005-120">PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ps5/" data-ref-id="5005-128">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/xbox-series-x/" data-ref-id="5005-129">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pc/" data-ref-id="5005-19">PC</a> this July.</p>

<p data-characters="287" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s been roughly three weeks since <em>Helldivers 2</em> got its last major update, but the streak is getting ready to end. Arrowhead hopped on Discord to tease what’s coming with next week’s <em>Helldivers 2</em> update, which will include visible supply lines and more than 100 fixes.</p> <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">The info was delivered in typical Arrowhead fashion: As a meme. Community Manager Thomas “Twinbeard” Petersson was the one to drop the hint, saying “So about that patch, here’s a little something. It’s Friday after all.” </p> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/helldivers-2-patch.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;552&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;431&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Arrowhead/<em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via Arrowhead/<em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via Arrowhead/<em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="192" data-current-count="192" data-injectable="false">Among the most requested features from the community is the ability to see supply lines on the galactic map. According to the post, those are finally coming with a way to view attack origins. </p> <h2 id="h-helldivers-2-s-next-patch-changes-up-patrol-spawns-and-more" data-injectable="false"><em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s next patch changes up patrol spawns and more</h2> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="true">Arrowhead ended its weekly update streak last month, stating it wanted to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-patches-may-slow-down-as-arrowhead-plans-to-take-its-time-with-the-next-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slow things down</a> and take its time to get patches right. It’ll be the first since May 14. No, the June 1 hotfix that addressed the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-dark-matter-mission-is-getting-a-hotfix-to-address-all-the-bugs-and-the-bugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dark Matter mission</a> doesn’t count. </p>
 <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">Based on the above meme, it looks like the update is pretty meaty. The developer has been addressing the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-theorists-dig-into-how-patrol-spawns-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patrol spawn system</a> since April, but the tweaks implemented appeared to make things worse. Petersson later responded, saying the developer <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-devs-are-finally-reverting-frustrating-patrols-and-spawn-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned to dig into the issue </a>and fix spawn rates. </p> <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="537" data-injectable="true">The upcoming patch will include such a fix and much more. There will also be the inclusion of invite-only lobbies and Super Samples appearing in level 6 difficulty matches. Overall, Arrowhead is bringing more than 100 changes with the update.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Arrowhead</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">The patch will hopefully start to address the myriad issues that have followed the game for some months now. Players in the community have lobbied concerns regarding <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/arrowhead-ceo-admits-helldivers-2s-balancing-isnt-what-it-should-be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game balance</a>, patrol spawns, and weapon nerfs. The creator of Arrowhead, Johan Pilestedt, also <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-ceo-steps-down-so-he-can-focus-more-on-actually-making-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped away from his role as CEO</a> to work more closely on the game’s development as the company’s new chief creative officer (CCO). </p>
 <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="222" data-injectable="false">It’s hard to say when the patch will arrive, but chances are good it’ll be early next week. Arrowhead was dropping updates every Tuesday or Wednesday, so it’s safe to say that it could be either of those.</p> <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="false">The patch sounds like it’ll be a good one. Players have been asking for visible supply lines since the day they learned <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-community-figures-out-the-invisible-supply-line-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the feature existed</a>. Personally, I’m excited for weapon balance changes. More to the point, I’m hoping they finally fix my Eruptor. I miss my boy.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/talisman-fifth-edition-announced-by-games-workshop.892944/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/talisman-fifth-edition-announced-by-games-workshop<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has announced a new edition of one of their games. However, it isn't one of their more popular war games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a>. It is <em>Talisman Fifth Edition</em>, a new refined version of the beloved fantasy board game.</p>
<h2>The Talisman Fifth Edition Announcement</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/06/07/talisman-returns-with-a-glorious-new-5th-edition-and-the-same-classic-gameplay/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop explains what <em>Talisman Fifth Edition</em> will contain. Originally titled <em>Talisman: The Magical Quest Board Game, </em>the board game was designed by Robert Harris and released in 1983. Over those 40+ years, it has received expansions and updates, its prior edition was released in 2007.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-fifth-edition-board-set-up.jpg?itok=FgdcRHZE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-fifth-edition-board-set-up.jpg?itok=RSLJrbNN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to go back and stake your claim.</figcaption></figure><p>Overall, the main game remains unchanged. Two to six players choose a character and embark on a quest to claim the Crown of Command and rule the land. You roll dice to traverse a large board, level up, get powerful loot, followers, and spells, and confront an encounter deck packed with enemies and allies. A single game can be finished in 60-90 minutes.</p>
<p><em>Talisman Fifth Edition</em> will feature new quality-of-life improvements to the game as well as brand-new artwork. As for what those improvements entail, the post is light on detail. However, it confirms that the Elder Dragon and Crown of Command work smoother. In addition, levelling up is a lot quicker.</p>
<p>The base game will be produced by Avalon Hill. It will contain 12 classic characters, 100 adventure cards, 24 spells, and special colored cones to demonstrate stat improvements</p>
<p>Games Workshop also highlighted the first major expansion for <em>Talisman Fifth Edition</em>. The expansion, <em>Talisman Alliances: Fate Beckons</em>, mixes up the core experience with co-op. Players will work together to overcome five Trials. These Trials will be introduced in Legacy format as five linked games.</p>
<p><em>Talisman Fifth Edition</em> is available for pre-order. It is currently being sold at an MSRP of $59.99 and will be available July 1. <em>Talisman Alliances: Fate Beckons</em> will be available later in the year.</p>

And then everyone who buys a PS5 gets a free digital copy of Astro’s Playroom, a short game that lasts between <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/83361" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three and five hours</a>, depending on how many of the collectibles you want to get.</p><p>The new game, simply called Astro Bot and developed (like the others) by Team Asobi, kicks off when a group of robots’ PS5 mothership is attacked, scattering the robots throughout the galaxy. Your job as Astro is to go around to all the planets and collect your friends. The games have lots of fun platforming to execute, with grappling hooks and hover-jumps and all kinds of fun things. There are also plenty of alien and robotic enemies and bosses to take on. </p><h2>Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadow-release-date-collectors-edition">Assassin's Creed Shadows Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Astro Bot Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-release-date-editions">College Football 25 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-ps5-pc-release-date-preorder-bonus">Concord Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-collectors-edition-preorder">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/luigis-mansion-2-hd-preorder">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-release-date-special-editions">Madden NFL 25 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/master-detective-archives-rain-code-plus-is-up-for-preorder">Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Plus Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-release-date-collectors-edition">Metaphor: ReFantazio Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-release-date-deluxe-edition">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-stories-collection-preorder">Monster Hunter Stories Collection Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-special-editions">Star Wars Outlaws Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-release-date-collectors-edition">Super Monkey Ball: Banana Rumble Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/in-praise-of-compton-s-cookoff-in-psychonauts-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content"><p><span>Via Double Fine productions/Seam user K174n</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The idea to write about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hWPtumg_Js">Compton's Cookoff </a></span><span data-testid="content-text">came to me in a flash while I was looking at a draft of my colleague Holly's intro post for cooking week here at Game Developer. One phrase showed up: "cooking and performance anxiety"—that immediately made a beeline for my own gray matter, stirring memories of playing the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Psychonauts 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> level wherein the player guides anthropomorphized audience members/ingredients (bear with me here) through a wild death trap of a kitchen to please harsh reality TV food judges and them... battle them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If that sounds wild, it's supposed to! The Psychonauts games are all about literally jumping into the mixed up jumble of characters' brains, helping them deal with psychological trouble. There's a generous dose of humor here, and a lot of heart and empathy for every character in the world. Each level is a trippy, cartoonish vision of a character's mind, and Compton is a traumatized former psychonaut who has locked himself away for fear of causing harm to anyone ever again. He is all but eaten alive by his own anxieties, something I was immediately drawn to (my own OCD says hello).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Truly, what better way to represent that in an adventure-platformer like Psychonauts than a nightmare obstacle course kitchen that requires players to simultaneously juggle cooking tasks in different areas of the arena: a massive blender, a terrifying stove, a horrifying slicer—that's the subject of an especially cutting joke, given the ingredients' cheerful dispositions. It's strong level design on both a pure gameplay level and a narrative one. Success requires combining platforming feats of fancy with a multitasking element (most recipes require you to have multiple ingredients in various stages of prep at a time), and a countdown clock breathes down your neck the whole time. There is an element of risk vs. reward to juggle in each section: slower, safer ways to tackle the tasks, and faster, riskier strategies that may pay off big time: or cause you to lose precious seconds. The pressure, in every way, is on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The narrative framing complements this perfectly. We're shooting a reality competition with these awful judges (who are also goats and hand-puppets: again, just go with it) who look for every excuse to up the drama and make it tough on their poor contestant. A lot can go wrong, and will! In between escalating rounds of the level, players contend with "commercial breaks" where they need to beat down waves of enemies, and boss fights with the judges themselves vomiting mayhem upon the battlefield. It's a lot, yes! But it's funny, deeply weird, and incredibly memorable.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A novice chef in the ">A novice chef in the <span>Psychonauts 2</span> kitchen</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I was keen to reminisce about Compton's Cookoff without even knowing the context of how it came to be: my colleague Bryant pointed me towards relevant episodes of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRlI72bsNRc&amp;list=PLIhLvue17Sd70y34zh2erWWpMyOnh4UN_">Double Fine Psychodyssey</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the 25+ hour documentary from Player 2 Productions documenting </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Psychonauts 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s very long journey. The stage actually came from a smaller project lead by one of the documentary crew, in his first game development endeavor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In one episode, studio director Tim Schafer breaks down just how herculean a task it is to build a Psychonauts "brain:" "The things you have to achieve to be a Psychonauts level [are] like, all this good platforming and stuff, but also, like, try to make it something people haven't seen in a game before," he says. "Have it completely tell somebody's emotional journey in the landscape, you know? Have it feel right narratively. Have it really be surprising and fresh. It's a lot of pressure to be original in a level."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's fascinating to watch the documentary and see filmmaker Asif Siddiky pitch the idea of an epic cooking challenge, go through a wild trial by fire in creating a functional prototype (with a professional team helping him at each step). Later, he's tapped to work as a level designer and fashion that prototype into this full-blown stage of the game—something so memorable and notable that my own mind shot it straight out of the proverbial toaster on reading a simple phrase, three years later.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Honestly, it's inspirational. The Psychonauts series has a special place in my heart for a few reasons—the quality of the level design (and level design-as-character design), the narrative, the overall weird and wonderful worldview on display in every little element. Knowing that this particularly exercise on anxiety and overcoming grief was born from a new designer's own brain gives me serious hope.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-clicker-games-like-banana-to-play-now/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-clicker-games-like-banana-to-play-now<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="442" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Simple free-to-play clicker game <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923300/Banana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Banana</a></em> has quickly grown into one of the most played games on all of Steam, cracking the Top 10 actively played with over 100,000 current players at the time of this article. For a lot of players, this is the first clicker game they’ve really gotten into. Thankfully, there are tons of other great clicker games already out there. Here are the best clicker games like <em>Banana</em> that you can play right now.</p> <h2 id="h-best-clicker-games-like-banana" data-injectable="false">Best clicker games like <em>Banana</em></h2> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">All of these games have one thing in common: they are clicker games. This typically means the game is built around clicking a lot to make a number go up while receiving upgrades to automate and increase the productivity of your clicking. Here are some of the best clicker games similar to <em>Banana</em> that are out now:</p> <figure data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <h3 id="h-cookie-clicker" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1454400/Cookie_Clicker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cookie Clicker</a></h3> <p data-characters="647" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true">Considered by many to be the origin of clicker games, Cookie Clicker by Orteil originally released as a browser-based web-only game. The premise is simple: click on a cookie to receive a cookie. This is a cookie world, after all, so the cookies you receive can then be spent to purchase upgrades to enhance your cookie clicking. At first, you’ll purchase additional clickers that will automatically click the cookie for you, eventually getting Grandma’s, Cookie Farms, Cookie Factories, Cookie Banks, and even Cookie Fractal Engines and Idleverses. You’ll be getting so many cookies you won’t know what to do with them all.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h3 id="h-idleon-the-idle-rpg" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1476970/IdleOn__The_Idle_RPG/">IdleOn – The Idle RPG</a></h3> <p data-characters="505" data-current-count="805" data-injectable="true"><em>IdleOn</em> is a great clicker game option if you’re looking to mix your clicker with some MMO features. A persistent online world, <em>IdleOn</em> allows players to skill up a variety of skills as if they are playing an RPG. With the MMO features, you can join other players in the clicking madness in a side-scrolling <em>Maple Story</em>-like atmosphere where you’ll take on monsters, craft equipment, and even take part in professions like Fishing and Mining. All under the gameplay loop of being a clicker game.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h3 id="h-spaceplan" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/616110/SPACEPLAN/">Spaceplan</a></h3> <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="708" data-injectable="true"><em>Spaceplan</em> is probably one of my favorite clicker games of all time. While most games in the genre have endless loops and never-ending gameplay via Prestige modes, Spaceplan is actually a contained narrative experience. Clicking in Spaceplan progresses time as you build up a colony of Potatoes—no that’s not a type—that eventually becomes spacefaring. It’s a fun journey well worth your time.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h3 id="h-ngu-idle" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147690/NGU_IDLE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NGU Idle</a></h3> <p data-characters="495" data-current-count="795" data-injectable="true"><em>NGU Idle</em> starts as a rather basic clicker game; you train your stats by filling up a bar, before fighting bosses. As you defeat bosses, you’ll unlock more systems and features that further increase your power and allow you to fight even tougher bosses. Eventually, you’ll unlock systems like equipment and blood magic which gives an RPG-like mechanic to this clicker game. The clicking aspect in <em>NGU Idle</em> is quickly replace with idling, but the core concepts of the game are similar.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h3 id="h-realm-grinder" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/610080/Realm_Grinder/">Realm Grinder</a></h3> <p data-characters="595" data-current-count="895" data-injectable="false">Originally released for browser as well on Kongregate, <em>Realm Grinder</em>is a massive clicker game that manages to introduce unique gameplay into the genre. You start with a few different factions unlocked and will progress their realm via clicking, idling, and upgrades in order to unlock more buildings and eventually more factions. Each time you prestige you have the option of changing your faction, each having its own playstyle including both active and idle play. It’s a great sense of progression as you consistently unlock new features and systems that change up the gameplay elements.</p>

                <p>Activision has confirmed more details on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, and specifically a Hollywood actor who is playing a role in the game. Y'Lan Noel, who starred on the TV series Insecure and the movie The First Purge, is lending his voice to a new character in Black Ops 6.</p><p>Activision marketing boss Tyler Bahl confirmed this to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-voice-actor-ylan-noel-xbox-showcase-1236028659/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, saying Noel is playing an unspecified character seen in the game's key art.

Players are asked to consider if what they have been told is in fact true. While Black Ops 6 is rumored to take place decades ago during the Gulf War, Bahl said its themes may be relevant still today.</p><p>"When we started to break this down, especially for today, in this moment, there's digital media being altered, there's things changing all the time," Bahl said. "I think one of the themes of the game is around, is the government working against you? Can I trust what I'm reading? Can I trust what I'm seeing?--just like the game is going to feel once players are able to play."</p><p>In addition to the new character played by Noel, Black Ops 6 is expected to bring back popular Black Ops characters like Adler and Woods. Black Ops 6 is rumored to launch in late October and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-on-game-pass-could-be-a-concern-for-sony-analyst-says/1100-6524017/" data-ref-id="1100-6524017">will come to Game Pass on day one. </a></p><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for more on Black Ops 6 in the days ahead.</p>

<p data-characters="332" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>The Expanse</em> is one of the modern juggernauts of the science fiction genre books. This is in part due to the excellent space storytelling and near-realism from authors Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck under the pen name James S.A. Corey. However, this popularity and success are also because of the equally highly recommended TV series. </p> <p data-characters="182" data-current-count="182" data-injectable="false">If you’re missing <em>The</em> <em>Expanse</em> these days, here are 10 <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-sci-fi-books-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">science fiction books</a> we’ve enjoyed that come the closest to capturing the grounded and darker tone of this beloved series. </p> <h2 id="h-hyperion-cantos" data-injectable="false"><em><a href="https://geni.us/V6pwhY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Hyperion Cantos</a></em></h2> <figure data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="598" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true">This sci-fi series from Dan Simmons encompasses four core books and a number of short stories. It is set up well enough that half the books feel like one series while the other half feels separate but connected. <em><a href="https://geni.us/V6pwhY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Hyperion Cantos</a></em> also has one of the most flexible and weird storytelling systems, with writing styles changing between novels. For instance, the first book has a <em>Canterbury Tales</em>-style split between main characters while the second book is told through a series of dreams. Some of these parts, especially the divided point-of-view storytelling, are reminiscent of <em>The Expanse’s</em> style.</p>
 <h2 id="h-lord-of-light" data-injectable="false"><em><a href="https://geni.us/1FTwr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Lord of Light</a></em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="750" data-injectable="true">Roger Zelazny came out with <em><a href="https://geni.us/1FTwr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Lord of Light</a></em> in 1967 as a collection of seven different short stories following a crew of humans who mutated their bodies to gain supernatural powers to survive in their new world. The heavy imagery and symbolism make for a complex tale with several different characters and ideas to keep up with. In this vein, it feels quite a lot like <em>The Expanse</em> with all of the rotating characters and POVs you have to keep up with. </p>
 <h2 id="h-dune-series" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/Aj8Ve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Dune</em> Series</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="785" data-injectable="true"><em>The Expanse</em> may feel a bit more grounded in its science fiction at times than the legendary Frank Herbert’s widespread <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/frank-herbert-dune-reading-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dune</em> series</a>, but there is no denying the monumental <a href="https://geni.us/Aj8Ve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Dune</em> novels</a> likely played some part in inspiring <em>The Expanse’s</em> creation. Everything from the wide set of characters to the intense focus on politics and society go together so well in both series. Not to mention, <em>Dune</em> has the unique benefit of both offering <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/science-fiction-books-like-dune/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a novel</a> and adaptation form, similar to <em>The Expanse</em>.</p>
 <h2 id="h-remembrance-of-earth-s-past-trilogy" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/0CWyTeC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Remembrance of Earth’s Past</em> Trilogy</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="753" data-injectable="true">Also known by the name of its first novel, <em><a href="https://geni.us/Nc5z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Three-Body Problem</a></em>, this series from Cixin Liu takes place throughout human history as Earth discovers and engages with the Trisolaran alien race. That premise alone gives off <em>The Expanse</em> vibes. However, it is also similar in the fact it has its own ongoing TV series adaptation, which is quite engaging. Those who like both versions of <em>The Expanse </em>might enjoy this trilogy’s book and streaming versions.</p>
 <h2 id="h-ender-s-game-series" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/pVI1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Ender’s Game</em> Series</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="755" data-injectable="true">The first novel in this series, <em><a href="https://geni.us/R3ORI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Ender’s Game</a></em>, gives me the most <em>Expanse</em> vibes compared to sequels. Its smaller focus on a group of students at a military academy in space simultaneously allows for rich character development while also still containing massive twists for the universe as a whole. In this way, this sci-fi series reminds me of some of the earlier <em>Expanse</em> books. But all of the novels in this series from Orson Scott Card are worth a read.</p>
 <h2 id="h-chronicles-of-the-dread-empire-series" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/ru9s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Chronicles of the Dread Empire</em> Series</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="723" data-injectable="true">This science fiction series comprised of eight novels begins with <em><a href="https://geni.us/ru9s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">A Shadow of All Night Falling</a></em> from Glen Cook. This is a long series and an early one from the sci-fi author so it has a pretty slow pace and some awkwardness at times. However, if you get past all this, the world-building and character development is incredible, as it takes its time to truly invest the reader in its universe, much like <em>The Expanse</em> series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-yoshida-interview-on-dawntrail-story-lore/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ffxiv-yoshida-interview-on-dawntrail-story-lore<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="435" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The next big<em> Final Fantasy XIV</em> update is almost here as early access approaches on June 28, kicking off a new era of the MMO after weaving a decade’s worth of storytelling. Even for the most enthusiastic of lore hounds, that’s quite a long time to remember so many little details, but during the expansion’s recent media tour rounds, director and producer Naoki Yoshida had a few suggestions on lore details to study.</p> <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="219" data-injectable="false">Perhaps it goes without saying, but <strong>stop reading now</strong> if you would rather go into <em>Dawntrail</em> knowing as little as possible. The details below contain spoilers for<em> Endwalker</em> and little breadcrumbs leading into Version 7.0.</p> <figure data-current-count="519" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Square Enix YouTube</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">After spending a full day playing<em> Dawntrail</em>, I wrapped up by attending the <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> Q&amp;A where Yoshida answered a few regarding the fifth expansion. Among those questions, Yoshida took a moment to answer Destructoid’s, carefully explaining what <em>FFXIV </em>details he’d recommend lore enthusiasts brush up on before playing. </p> <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true">“I’m sure people have already played this,” Yoshida said. “But the most recent Alliance Raid, Myths of the Realm, would probably allow for some background information into more of the lore.”</p>
 <p data-characters="152" data-current-count="152" data-injectable="false">While Yoshida’s recommendation to complete <em>Endwalker’s</em> latest 24-man wasn’t much of a surprise, his follow-up was far more intriguing:</p> <blockquote data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false"> <p>“Can people name all of the 14 seats of The Convocation? Perhaps that would be a good place to start in terms of digging into XIV lore. To prevent any spoilers, I think we’ll stop there!”</p> </blockquote> <p data-characters="541" data-current-count="897" data-injectable="true">For context, the director has made teases like these in the past, and they’re often vague, though helpful, tips for players trying to recall hundreds of hours of story content. Prior to<em> Endwalker’s </em>2021 launch, Yoshida told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/final-fantasy-14-director-recommends-these-raids-for-making-the-most-out-of-endwalker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer</a> that he recommended completing the Bahamut, Alexander, and Omega raids before jumping in. After experiencing the expansion’s conclusion, I can’t imagine going through without knowing those details, but some raid stories are still segmented from the Main Scenario as optional content. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Square Enix YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="758" data-injectable="true">Players who strictly stick to the MSQ may want to dig into the quests and side stories involving the Myths of the Realm quest series and relevant mentions of the Convocation of Fourteen. Following along with the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-every-alliance-raid-ffxiv/">Alliance Raid</a> is easy enough by following Journal assignments, but you may need to search a little harder for refreshers on the Convocation. They were the governing body over the Ancients’ pre-sundered world, possessing immeasurable power. </p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">The most straightforward mentions accessible in the MSQ are in ‘Etched in the Stars,’ a quest from the <em>Shadowbringers</em> ending, Patch 5.3. Then again in <em>Endwalker</em> upon reaching Elpis, you can speak to Emet-Selch during the quest ‘Their Greatest Contribution’ and ask to learn more about the Convocation. </p> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="false">As for how it all links up, I’ve got a few ideas of my own, but I’m keeping my expectations tame. I’ve been wrong more often than not on where Final Fantasy XIV would take us next, and I would have never guessed how the last expansion cleverly tied in some of its earliest reveals. </p>

		<p>It’s that time of the year when marketing departments hold their heads and cry because Jimmy from the web team pressed a button a bit early. In this case our Jimmy looks after the 2K Games website and he put up a banner advertising the unannounced Civilization VII.</p>



<p>Our guess would be that the game will be revealed tonight as part of the Summer Games Fest.</p>
<p>It has been quite a while since the last Civ, as Civilization VI was released on PC way back in 2016. It was subsequently ported to Switch, PlayStation, Xbox and even mobile devices. We gave the Switch version <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/12/03/civilization-vi-switch/">9/10 in our review.</a></p>
<p>“The Switch version is just the base game, but that’s more than OK,” said Nick. “There’s plenty to sink your teeth into, providing hours upon hours of unique experiences, accompanied by a divine soundtrack to really get you in the mood for building nations.”</p>

<p>Geoff Keighley’s Summer Games fest kicks off tonight, June 7th, and ahead of the show he took to Twitch for a Q &amp; A session, during which he tempered expectations for the show. “There will be, definitely, new announcements,” he said, “but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans.”</p>
<p>“There definitely are things that are being announced but this is not a show that has a lot of like ‘coming in 2026’ or ‘2027’, or teasers for games that are years and years out… That’s generally what I would say in terms of expectation setting.”</p>
<p>Metaphor: Refantazio and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wild/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>&nbsp;are confirmed, along with indie games made “single devs”. Also in the show will be Kingdom Come 2: Deliverance and a trailer for some “cool DLC.”.&nbsp; Batman: Arkham VR from Camoflaj is also confirmed along with Dragon Ball Sparking ZERO and a trailer for the Among Us animated show.</p>

  <p id="aJ1goo">Finding the <strong>Dectus Medallion locations</strong> in  <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23921448"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> takes a bit of effort — and more than a few risks — but the payoff is worth it if you want safe passage to Altus Plateau.#</p>
<p id="vihTB6">The <strong>Grand Lift of Dectus</strong> bypasses a mini-dungeon, dangerous cliffside paths, and a tricky boss fight and drops you at Altus Plateau’s southern end (mostly) free from harm.</p>
<p id="xk5APk">Finding the item that activate the lift is a bit of a riddle, but our <strong>Dectus Medallion</strong> <strong>locations </strong>guide breaks down where to look and how to get both pieces without much hassle.</p>

<p id="OXboDE">You can pick up the Medallion’s left half pretty early in Elden Ring, with the location found within <strong>Fort Haight, </strong>found in the east of Limgrave. <strong>The map calls it Fort Haight West</strong>, which is a little misleading. There’s no eastern variant of the mini-fortress, so the one in Limgrave is the only one you need to deal with.</p>
<p id="CPqsRG">The first challenge is actually reaching Fort Haight. Skeleton warriors wielding swords and shields bar your way, and a ballista perched atop the fort’s walls will periodically fire arrows at you. Use the wooden barricades for protection against the ballista, and carefully make your way around the fortress’ southern side. </p>

<p id="9JSXpG">Inside Fort Haight, you’ll find more enemies milling about — some wolves, a few skeletons with exploding pots, nothing too overwhelming until you reach the ramparts. If you’re struggling with enemies inside the fort or outside, I recommend leveling up (our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22951034/rune-farming-limegrave-level-up-gatefront-ruins-stormgate-stormhill">rune farming locations</a> guide can help here) and trying again. Aim for level 10 or higher, if you can. Tempting as it may be to use your <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23022025/best-summons-spirit-ashes-how-to-upgrade">Spirit Ashes</a> to force your way through, you’re better off saving your summons for the battle against the fort’s mini-boss on the ramparts.</p>
<p id="YIQksq">That boss is a knight who uses the Bloody Slash ability, which flings an arc of blood at you and, if it hits you too often, inflicts the bleeding status. Bleeding is a quick way to end up at the nearby Site of Grace again, so focus on a defensive playstyle where you dodge, sweep in for a few attacks, and retreat to safety again. Magic users and those with ranged weapons will have an easier time, and having your Spirit Ash around gives the knight something to target who isn’t you.</p>
<p id="XRXpuA">You’ll get the Bloody Slash Ash of War — a useful ability that scales on Arcane and may inflict Bleed on your opponents — and complete <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23002158/nepheli-loux-potion-questline-location-quest-puppet-throne-room-kenneth-haight">Kenneth Haight’s quest</a> after defeating the knight and clearing out the fortress.</p>

<p id="MEaxJd">The medallion’s right half is a little trickier to get on paper, but a handy trick and a bit of planned recklessness cut most of the trouble out. The <strong>Dectus Medallion right location is in Fort Faroth</strong>, a location in Caelid at the Greyoll Dragonbarrow Site of Grace. If you haven’t been here already, it’s an excellent place for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22951034/rune-farming-limegrave-level-up-gatefront-ruins-stormgate-stormhill">Rune farming in Elden Ring</a> — so long as you don’t mind killing a defenseless, old dragon to get them.</p>

<p id="h6Up4G">Fort Faroth itself is a bit of a nightmare. The ground level is home to several bats, who stun you with soundwaves, and harpies, who fling poison at you and, even when you’re at high levels, can turn you into Tarnished dust with just two or three hits. A build that’s high Vigor, Endurance, and Strength could probably rush through and easily deal with the enemies inside, but if you’re piecing the Dectus Medallion together early in the game, you probably don’t have that build.</p>

Step inside, use the jellyfish or lone wolves summons to distract the bats and harpies, and run to the back of the room. It’s almost literally a straight shot — take a slight left after rounding the first wall — so there’s little chance of getting lost.</p>

<p id="gAHfh2">Climb the ladder, and <strong>open the chest at the top to find the Dectus Medallion’s right half</strong>. The enemies down below won’t follow you up, in my experience. You can try escaping across the roof behind you, though two ghostly knights will manifest and do their best to strike you down, or you could try climbing down and running through the ground level again.</p>

<p id="GyA1t9">Once you have both medallion halves, <strong>head to the Grand Lift of Dectus at the northern end of Liurnia’s Bellum Highway </strong>— found at the north-east part of Liurnia of the Lakes, and not far from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22994833/caria-manor-boss-location-level-map-dragon-sword">Caria Manor</a>.</p>
<p id="g4U4t8">Activate the Site of Grace there, if you haven’t already, and step on the circular platform between the four statues. <strong>The game prompts you to lift the medallion</strong>, and then a cutscene plays where the elevator rises and drops you off at the southern end of Altus Plateau — right behind two massive golem enemies. Ignore them, turn left, and activate the Point of Grace nearby.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/delta-force-hawk-ops-aims-to-be-3-tactical-military-shooters-in-one<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>There was a lot that came out of my hands-on time with Delta Force: Hawk Ops that I didn’t expect. I didn’t know it was a top-to-bottom reboot of the 1999 series of military shooters, re-imagined meticulously in Unreal Engine 5. I would have never guessed it was attempting to strike out at not one, not two, but three different current shooter sub-genres all at once. And I would have never imagined that my short time with it would leave me anxious to play more of its heavy tactics-focused running and gunning.</p><p>Developer Team Jade’s Head of Studio Leo Yao answered my most obvious question first: “How did a Chinese studio get their hands on such an American franchise?” Long story short, THQ Nordic acquired the assets from the original developer NovaLogic back in 2016, and it was lost in the Embracer Group slurry until it was rescued by Tencent a few years ago. “I’ve always had a soft spot for the series,” Yao told me, adding that outside of personal attachment, the team saw a lot of potential in reviving the franchise in 2024. They aren’t simply redoing the original game with shiny new coat of paint, either. They’re expanding it into a massive game with three distinct experiences: a large-scale, team-based PvP mode; an extraction shooter a la DMZ or The Cycle; and a single-player campaign with hopes of recapturing the magic of military shooters of yesteryear.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Delta Force: Hawk Ops - June 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>A lot of that potential is in the series’ 2003 adaptation of the book Black Hawk Down, about the Battle of Mogadishu. Yao told me that as the most recognizable entry in the series, it served as the perfect point of re-entry, and the best place to start the re-imagining process. The first big change being that this version of the single-player campaign will be based on the Ridley Scott film of the same name, complete with the rights to footage. He wouldn’t give me details on how any of this would integrate into the campaign, or the fact that the rest of the game’s near future tech and aesthetics would potentially change the story based on an event from the early ‘90s. Nor did I get any hands on time with it specifically, but he did mention that it is the team’s goal to make it a challenging and intense FPS experience where bullets are extremely lethal and being caught out of position could spell disaster.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This version of Delta Force's single-player campaign will be based on the Ridley Scott film Black Hawk Down.</p></div><p>I spent most of my time with Havoc Warfare, Hawk Ops’ take on Battlefield’s Breakthrough, where attackers must take points of interest from defenders, pushing their zones of control further and further back until they’re completely run off the map. The first big difference between Hawk Ops and games like it is in the loadout screen. I had the option between four different characters, each with a suite of special abilities, weapons, and tools that made them unique from one another – much like the Specialists in the Call of Duty series, but with three or four unique actions per character. I warmed up with Kai, who is mostly your standard assault gunner who can speed himself up temporarily, but also has a handy rocket barrage that's great for clearing out tight spaces. I really got to sink my teeth into some more tactical options with Terry, who can use drones to scan for targets and immobilize them for a brief period, as well as set mines to trap enemies moving on objectives. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The map I played had some key fortified areas where using a little recon in advance of an assault really made the difference between taking an objective and getting stopped at the line. Unfortunately, I played in matches that were populated mostly by bots, and without pings or commands it was nearly impossible to coordinate these skills between players to make big gains, but the potential for comboing abilities for huge payoffs is written on the wall. Team Jade told me that other maps will test your squad’s tactical awareness even further as they’ll introduce mixes of indoor and outdoor objectives and verticality, as well as vehicles and weapon placements that can help teams get an edge or keep defenses solid.</p><p>Before you even choose your characters, though, you can fiddle with your loadout, or spend the in-game currency to buy some of the dozens of weapons and gear pieces available. Something remarkable about customizability in Hawk Ops is that not only do weapons have a ton of potential to add bits and bobs to them, all of which have some sort of consequence on gameplay, but each one of those pieces can be further customized, too. And not just colors, materials, or textures, but the actual size of pieces like barrels and cheek guards can be adjusted to make even more minute tweaks to weapons. I don’t think I have it in me to fine tune the lengths of all my favorite gun suppressors, but for those who are looking for an extra layer of optimization, Hawk Ops has what you need.</p><h3>Dukes of Hazard</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Item progression gets a little more complicated when you get to Hazard Operation, the extraction shooter portion of Hawk Ops. Weapons and mods can be bought from a greater marketplace (and can be meticulously modded as in other modes) but can be permanently lost if you’re downed while deployed. Yao smirked when I mentioned the prospect of a player losing a gun they spent an unreasonable amount of time preening over it in an abrupt hail of bullets. “The risk/reward elements of extraction shooters will be very present.” If you come across someone else’s precious weapon while in the field and don’t see the same value in it yourself, you can resell it on an open marketplace for in-game currency, a feature also present in games like Escape from Tarkov.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When you deploy into Hazard Operations mode, your goal is to scoop up anything valuable and take it back to base to sell.</p></div><p>When you deploy into Hazard Operations, your goal is to scoop up anything valuable and take it back to base to sell. This could be other player’s prized weapons and armor, or rare treasures that only serve the singular purpose of being really valuable when resold, like a fancy futuristic VR console or some sort of super fancy high-tech medical equipment that I found on my journey. Clearly marked spots on the map highlight lockboxes that have a higher chance of containing something valuable, and are likely hotspots for enemy player activity. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Between these points of interest are various encampments, natural features like caves and cliffs, and old corporate buildings repurposed as fortifications for the many AI mobs that exist to put your life and your stuff in danger. These regular enemies will never be as significant a threat as other players, but they do at least keep the pressure on you to move with caution, as well as providing opportunities to earn basic equipment like ammo and health to keep you topped up on longer deployments. Not all of these NPC enemies are pushovers, though. Boss enemies with high health and rarer loadouts exist on the map to grant players added challenge in exchange for a higher chance of great loot. The one I found was draped head to toe with body armor and had several goons attacking my flank, but with a sound strategy heading up into its lair, I found a way to conquer it.</p><p>Though I could only try out one map, Yao and team assured me that multiple maps would be available to drop into at launch, each with their own layouts and points of interest. Something they really intrigued me was how character selection can affect your odds of survival. I was guided to choose the medical support character, as he had self-heals and a couple of reliable smoke deployment options to keep your movements hidden from dug-in threats. I can’t help but wonder how choosing someone like Luna with her Hawkeye-like trick arrows would fare in such an environment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Delta Force: Hawk Ops might share a lineage with the old PC series of the same name, but it doesn’t share much of a resemblance. Its single player mode is revamped from the ground up with modern tech, old-school difficulty, and the blockbuster Black Hawk Down film as both reference and inspiration. Its two multiplayer offerings – a large scale objective based crawl and a dynamic extraction shooter – help highlight how Hawk Ops’ level design and characters put team composition and tactical decision making ahead of twitch shooting. Will all of its ambitions come together in a game that has the chops to steal you from your current forever game? Time will tell.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

These are Visions of the Traveler, a bunch of little Travelers that are hidden around the Pale Heart and that you can pick up to trigger new dialogue from various characters. The Visions also earn you a Triumph, and some other reward we're not quite sure about yet (but we'll update this when we do).</p><p dir="ltr">You can't start picking up Visions of the Traveler until you've completed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-campaign-missions-list-and-how-long-to-beat/1100-6524012/" data-ref-id="1100-6524012">The Final Shape's story campaign</a> and begun exploring the destination in its entirety. Once you've fully unlocked the Lost City's Tower location in the Pale Heart, you'll find the room at the south side where you can store the Visions. Each of the columns here will provide you with clues as to where to find the Visions of the Traveler in each of the areas of the Pale Heart, as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's a complete rundown of where to find every Vision of the Traveler in the Pale Heart.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Vision_1___The_Landing">Vision 1 - The Landing</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314788-20240607093811_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314788" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314788-20240607093811_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314788"></a><figcaption>This little pool is immediately below and to the left of the transmat zone when you spawn in.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314788-20240607093811_1.jpg"></figure><p>This one's pretty simple. Start at The Landing's transmat zone and immediately turn left to head toward the edge of the area. Ahead and to your right should be an elaborate scaffold and sitting area; to your left, lower down, is a small pool of water, hugging the edge of the building. Drop down into the pool and you'll find the Vision.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314789-20240607093832_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314789" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314789-20240607093832_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314789"></a><figcaption>You almost can't see the spot because of the transmat icon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314789-20240607093832_1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Vision_2___The_Blooming">Vision 2 - The Blooming</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314790-20240606005105_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314790" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314790-20240606005105_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314790"></a><figcaption>This Vision is up pretty high, so you'll have to find a reliable path to climb the tree in which it's settled.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314790-20240606005105_1.jpg"></figure><p>You need to look up to find this Vision. It's nestled in the branches of a tree at the east side of The Blooming. Use the transmat zone in the area and then head toward the easternmost path that leads out, toward The Seclusion. When you start to see the orange crystal marking the path out, look up into the dead trees above you to spot the Vision. It's a bit of a climb to reach, but you can use the rocks of the nearby cliff wall to get you started.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314791-20240606005109_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314791" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314791-20240606005109_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314791"></a><figcaption>The big dead tree you're looking for is almost at the exit of The Blooming toward The Seclusion.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314791-20240606005109_1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Vision_3___The_Impasse">Vision 3 - The Impasse</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314792-20240606005550_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314792" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314792-20240606005550_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314792"></a><figcaption>The Vision is right out in the open in The Impasse, but it looks like a piece of the landscape.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314792-20240606005550_1.jpg"></figure><p>Start at the transmat zone for the Impasse and you're already almost to this Vision of the Traveler, which is hiding among Pyramid buildings in a ring.

 <p data-characters="404" data-current-count="404" data-injectable="true">Alongside these 30 milestone rewards, you can get leaderboard ranking prizes with additional dice, cash, and sticker prizes. However, gaining these rewards requires gaining more points than other players on the leaderboard, so you’re not guaranteed the top prize. Regardless, the rankings give you another opportunity to get extra items, so it’s worth watching the list to see where you land.</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-score-points-in-the-monopoly-go-resource-run-tournament" data-injectable="false">How to score points in the&nbsp;Monopoly GO&nbsp;Resource Run tournament</h2> <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="239" data-injectable="false">During <em>Monopoly GO’s </em>Resource Run tournament, scoring points requires landing on railroad spots. Every railroad tile initiates one of two minigames, Landmark Shutdown or Bank Heist, that reward points based on the following outcomes:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true"> <li>Shutdown – Blocked: Two points</li> <li>Shutdown – Success: Four points</li> <li>Bank Heist – Small: Four points</li> <li>Bank Heist – Large: Six points</li> <li>Bank Heist – Bankrupt: Eight points</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">Although the minigame’s result is mostly random, the main gist of it is that you’ll gain more points if you take more money from the opposing player. A good rule of thumb for Landmark Shutdowns is to go for inactive players with no shields whenever possible. As for Bank Heists, this is almost entirely luck-based, so you’ll mainly have to hope you get a bankrupt result to maximize your points.</p>
 <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="false">Outside of these minigames, your goal is to use mechanics like your dice multiplier to increase how many points you get from railroad tiles. After all, rolling 100 dice at once and bankrupting another player can give you 800 points, which will skyrocket you through the first few tournament reward tiers. Take advantage of resources like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/working-monopoly-go-free-dice-roll-links/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free dice links</a> and ongoing events to keep your dice supply high so you can get as many rewards as possible during this two-day tournament.</p>

<p data-characters="341" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Somehow, it’s been over 10 years since <em>Volgarr the Viking </em>delivered its brutal brand of hack-and-slash platforming. Now it’s <a href="https://twitter.com/DigitalEclipse/status/1798764585916436712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back for another round</a> of glorious battle in <em>Volgarr the Viking II</em>, which is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and GOG on August 6, 2024.</p> <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="146" data-injectable="false">You can see some of what developer Crazy Viking Studios has learned since releasing its debut game back in 2013 in the announcement trailer below.</p> <figure data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Volgarr the Viking II Announcement Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9Vch58Howw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="452" data-current-count="452" data-injectable="true">It’s wild to think about how many similarly challenging indie games have been thrust into players’ hands since the original <em>Volgarr </em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-volgarr-the-viking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a>. The space is more crowded than ever before, and it’s also full of a ton of quality efforts within the same genre. As such, Crazy Viking Studios has evolved in some ways and is looking to offer players the means to hone their skills before putting them to the ultimate test on the battlefield.</p>
 <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">Among those modern upgrades are features like practice mode, checkpoints, save profiles, and even the option to run through with unlimited continues. These additions may not wholly sate <em>Volgarr</em>‘s bloodlust, though, so you’ll eventually want to try a run without them to see everything the sequel has to offer. As the description states, foregoing these “modern comforts” will allow you to unlock everything <em>Volgarr the Viking II </em>has to offer.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2195140/Volgarr_the_Viking_II/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Volgarr the Viking II</em></a> was initially unveiled as part of this week’s Guerrilla Collective showcase. It’s nice to see the release date land in that August sweet spot, giving us plenty of time to sharpen our steel again with the first game before diving into the second.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173763/msi-claw-7-lunar-lake-roadmap-claw-2-claw-3-claw-4<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re still under the impression that an original MSI Claw might be a worthy purchase, I beg you to reconsider. MSI has now announced <em>not one but two </em>successors to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review">the embarrassing handheld</a> that are coming this fall — and hinting it might show off <em>yet another one</em> at CES in January.</p><p>MSI already revealed an eight-inch Lunar Lake version <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170904/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-lunar-lake-battery-computex">dubbed the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</a> at Computex this week, but the company will put Intel’s Lunar Lake into a new seven-inch version at the same time<em>. </em>MSI Claw product management director Clifford Chun revealed the existence of that handheld <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dj3AZcoA-vCY">in an interview with <em>PCWorld</em></a> and explained that both devices should arrive with the launch of Intel’s more efficient Lunar Lake chips this fall.</p><p>Lunar Lake not only has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23933156">up to 50 percent more GPU performance</a> than the current Meteor Lake — it requires substantially less power for the same performance. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23935783">One early demo showed it drawing 10 fewer watts</a>, which could translate to a notable increase in battery life. Plus, the Claw 8 can fit a far larger battery pack at 80 watt-hours vs. the 53-watt-hour pack of the original. </p><p>Every Claw 8 in the US will come with that 80-watt-hour pack, says Chun, though he says it’s optional elsewhere.</p><p>Both the new Claw 8 and Claw 7 will have revised bumpers, more responsive versions of their drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks, two Thunderbolt 4 ports, and an easier-to-replace SSD, says Chun — still the small M.2 2230 type, but they’ve been moved out from under the fan. Chun says they’ll ship with better Intel drivers this time around. Chun did not clarify whether the new seven-incher will have the larger 80Wh battery as well.</p><div><p>“We’re already planning Claw 2, Claw 3, Claw 4.”</p></div><p>Both will cost a similar amount to the current MSI Claw, says Chun, so expect them around $700–800.</p><p>MSI is completely committed to handheld gaming PCs, says Chun. “We’re already planning Claw 2, Claw 3, Claw 4. We have a long two-year roadmap down already. We’ll continue pushing new form factors, new ideas, maybe even new CPUs.” </p><p>But not necessarily AMD: “We’re not aiming to go to AMD yet, but you know, maybe in Claw 3, Claw 4?” He hints that future handhelds are likely to be a similar size or larger: it tried five-inch and 10-inch handhelds but found them too small and too heavy respectively, though a 6-inch is possible. “Six-inch, seven-inch — you can’t really tell the difference,” he told <em>PCWorld</em>. </p><p>Weirdly, Chun suggests the poor showing of the original Claw came as a surprise. “We thought the seven was perfect at launch,” he says, talking about how it was a surprisingly “steep learning curve.” But he says MSI is listening and wants to rapidly fix things.</p><p>“We really believe in handheld devices. Keep coming, keep letting us know, we listen, and we’ll improve.” That’s not much comfort to the original buyers who picked up a Claw mere months ago, but maybe it’ll mean good competition in the future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’ll be away from home, but I’m thinking of bringing my console with me expressly so I can play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/destiny-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/destiny-2"><em>Destiny 2</em></a></span><em> </em>and finish this fight. The road here has been difficult, both for fans of the series and its developers, so it’s a big moment for one of gaming’s biggest communities. I’m glad to be here and be a part of it.</p><p>I’ve been playing <em>Destiny </em>since the first game’s alpha test dropped us into the remnants of Old Russia and I fought my first Fallen Shank. I remember taking on <em>Destiny</em>’s first strike, the Devil’s Lair, and thinking it was the pinnacle of gaming. I came back for the beta, and was there on September 9, 2014 when <em>Destiny </em>launched. I still remember the week that Vault of Glass was introduced to the game. Me and my high school friends took on the challenge of our first raid and slammed our heads against the game’s byzantine leveling system as we squeezed our builds for any extra damage we could in order to overcome Atheon’s DPS check. We’d talk strategies in the back of our geometry class and run home to test them out. Some of those fireteam members are still some of my closest friends to this day, and that clunky, unpolished game remains a core memory of a defining era of my life.</p><p><em>Destiny</em>’s come a long way since then, and dammit, so have I. I’ve fought back the Fallen time and time again and eventually turned them into allies. I’ve gained the respect of a celebrated Cabal leader. I killed the fucking Taken King, his stupid-ass son Crota, and the rest of his godforsaken lineage. I lost the Light, got it back, and embraced the Darkness. I spent the later part of my teenage years and all of my adult life playing <em>Destiny. </em>This game has endured the most crushing defeats of my life, and it’s also been there to complement some of my greatest victories. For fuck’s sake, I cover this game for <em>Kotaku </em>now. This was <em>the </em>dream when I started playing it ten years ago. I’ve shared it with countless of my favorite people, and I can’t wait to share it with even more folks down the line. I don’t know what’s in store for either of our futures beyond this point, but I’m sure we’ll figure it out. — Moises Taveras</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2ad3436a34244aecea552bddd74315f3" data-recommend-id="image://2ad3436a34244aecea552bddd74315f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Soldiers stand in the middle of a power plant." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Soldiers stand in the middle of a power plant." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2ad3436a34244aecea552bddd74315f3" data-recommend-id="image://2ad3436a34244aecea552bddd74315f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Soldiers stand in the middle of a power plant." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Be gay, get killstreaks</p><p>The problem with preferring to play multiplayer shooters is that it’s really hard to consistently play more than one of them at a time.

That’s me right now, plugging away at <em>A Realm Reborn </em>because I’ve just heard <em>so</em> <em>much</em> good stuff about what lies beyond, and at times, it does feel like a bit of a slog. </p><p>Still, even if the narrative isn’t sweeping me away, I can see it all serving as necessary set-up for things that might pay off in big ways in the expansions that await me. And I’m enjoying the lovely and varied world, maybe the game’s greatest asset. I hope the talented and hardworking artists and visual designers who created the architecture, the objects, and the environments that give each region such a rich and distinctive feel were paid very well for their work, because that, more than anything else, is what’s keeping me playing right now. I particularly love being in the forests of Gridania when dusk falls; the vibes, as they say, are immaculate. Also, I just ran a dungeon set in a haunted manor, which made for a wonderful change of pace from the more “dungeon-y” dungeons I’d done up to this point. So I don’t intend to be like the man in the meme and turn back any time soon, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t really eager to get to the better stuff (or so everyone says) that awaits. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4ebdab21d1a53ad2742483849e253f29" data-recommend-id="image://4ebdab21d1a53ad2742483849e253f29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A composite image shows a spartan from Halo and a guardian from Destiny 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A composite image shows a spartan from Halo and a guardian from Destiny 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->343 Industries / Bungie / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4ebdab21d1a53ad2742483849e253f29" data-recommend-id="image://4ebdab21d1a53ad2742483849e253f29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A composite image shows a spartan from Halo and a guardian from Destiny 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> <em>Halo</em>: Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck YMMV), <em>Destiny 2</em>: PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck Nope)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Shoot things!

Personally, I am loving the loop, having a madcap fight which causes all manner of meters to fill up which unlocks so much stuff I absolutely don’t care about but am glad I unlocked anyway.

I also sat down with game director, Naoki Yoshida, to chat about the team’s goals in representing other cultures.</p><div data-video-id="195905" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="195905,191558,192610" data-current="195905"><div><p>Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21419.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Though I remain wary of how <em>Final Fantasy 14 </em>might handle the thornier aspects of depicting cultures close to my own Dominican heritage, much of what I was shown does at least indicate that <em>Dawntrail </em>will make for yet another exciting and deep expansion to everyone’s favorite critically acclaimed MMO.</p><h2 id="h6426"><a id=""></a><strong>Grab your floaties y’all, it’s summer vacation</strong></h2><p>It’s a running joke in <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> that just as things seem to be settling down and characters implore the Warrior of Light (your player character) to rest after saving the world <em>again</em>, another conflict arises that keeps them from getting their well-deserved break. The same seems to be true of <em>Dawntrail</em>, which pulls them to a whole new land to tK TK WHY,. But this latest important mission hasn’t stopped <em>FF14 </em>director Naoki Yoshida from telling players to envision <em>Dawntrail</em> as the Warrior of Light’s summer vacation. </p><p>Tural, the new land featured in <em>Dawntrail</em>, seems as appropriate a place as any to spend a summer break. It’s tropical and looks warm as hell, and many of the cultural touchstones that Tural takes inspiration from originated in Mesoamerican countries, like Mexico, where white people are known to vacation. The team has also promised a ton of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-raids-field-operations-1851512773&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-raids-field-operations-1851512773">fun new arcs</a></span>, including a tournament storyline that I’m sure folks will enjoy and more. Though the preview build that was made available to us was limited in how much of Tural (and its people) we could see and interact with, it looked and felt like a true slice of Central America, rather than a cheap caricature.</p><p>This was a specific concern of mine, as well as my joint interviewer and colleague <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/OhMyMithrandir&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/OhMyMithrandir" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate Sanchez</a></span> of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://butwhytho.net/2024/06/ffxiv-dawntrail-yoshi-p-interview/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://butwhytho.net/2024/06/ffxiv-dawntrail-yoshi-p-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>But Why Tho</em></a></span>. As Latinos, we’re used to our cultures getting bastardized by dishonest lenses or lazy writing, which often reduce us to tropes and mechanisms rather than see us as diverse and distinct people. Each of us are radically different versions of what a person might call a <em>latino</em>, and we always hope that we’re acknowledged and understood as part of a much larger and richer tapestry than our two individual (and different) backgrounds. </p><p><em>Final Fantasy 14</em>, and Yoshida himself, have faced tremendous backlash in the past over the perceived whitening of previously dark-skinned characters, as well as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ffxvi-square-enix-naoki-yoshida-ff16-release-date-1849744847&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ffxvi-square-enix-naoki-yoshida-ff16-release-date-1849744847">conspicuous lack of diverse characters</a></span> in both <em>14</em> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/review-final-fantasy-16-ffxvi-ps5-rpg-release-date-1850558485&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/review-final-fantasy-16-ffxvi-ps5-rpg-release-date-1850558485"><em>Final Fantasy 16</em></a></span>, which Yoshida produced. It made his answers to our questions refreshing, and a little relieving, even if the game still has to prove itself.</p><h2 id="h6427"><a id=""></a><strong>Weaving a tapestry</strong></h2><p>During our interview, Sanchez asked Yoshida about<em> Dawntrail</em>’s specific inspirations, considering the lengths of the Latin Diaspora, which saw Latin American people spread across the world, forming their own cultures and dialects. <em>Dawntrail </em>and Tural feel shaped by two distinct forces: the team’s desire to explore someplace new and different from what it’s always known, and the feedback that it’s received over the curious absences of other perspectives and kinds of people in <em>FF14</em>. According to Yoshida, the team had already been doing exhaustive research into Latin American regions of the world, but as he also jokes, “I’m sure a lot of players have wanted to see tacos being featured in the game.” With cultural touchstones like food in mind, and a narrative that supposedly centers “understanding,” the team set about creating a world that tries to honor Latino culture and its multitudes.</p><figure id="" data-id="59c85a358c214cdfbecb3903c4276d56" data-recommend-id="image://59c85a358c214cdfbecb3903c4276d56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a town in Tural, Dawntrail's new land.

When he tells us that he wants to gauge fan reactions and continue to tell the kind of stories that they want, or when he mentions earlier in the interview that player feedback about implementing Latin American perspectives helped shape <em>Dawntrail</em>, I believe him. He’s molded <em>FF14 </em>to its audience time and time again, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse, and <em>Dawntrail </em>doesn’t seem particularly different in this regard. Question the efficacy of his efforts all you want (I will continue to), but he clearly places <em>FF14</em>’s community first. Because of that we now have tacos, female Hrothgars (Latina queens), the land of Tural, and what I hope will be an honest portrayal of cultures like my own.</p><p>It may come across as a joke, but Yoshida and his team are quite proud of how they’ve treated aspects like food, which are huge touchstones for any culture. Various towns and villages around Tural, such as the hub of Tuliyollal, will have their own respective foods that differ from each other, so don’t expect to find the same dishes or exports in Urgopacha that you would elsewhere., .There will be melting pots, but the team is also taking the time to make sure Tural is broadly representative of many of the real differences in Latino cultures. And for the record, those are some Latino-ass names for those locales, so on first whiff at least, <em>Dawntrail</em>’s passing the smell test.</p><h2 id="h6428"><a id=""></a><strong>Time for a summer job</strong></h2><p>As is par for the course, <em>Dawntrail </em>not only adds a whole new section of the world to explore but entirely new jobs for players to adopt as they tackle Tural’s new challenges. These jobs are the melee-focused DPS Viper and the ranged-DPS Pictomancer, which are so visually and tonally distinct from one another that it’s hard picturing them as a part of the same expansion.</p><p>The Viper has a rogue, swashbuckling pirate vibe to them. If you’ve seen the promotional materials for <em>Dawntrail</em>, then you’ve seen the stand-in for the Warrior of Light in the Viper’s garb. The Viper’s gimmick is <em>complicated</em>, and so is making the most of the Viper’s extensive kit and skillset. Their weapon has two shapes, beginning in a one-handed form before one of your weapon skills transforms it into dual blades more fitting of an archetypal RPG rogue.</p><p>Whereas most jobs quickly settle into familiar skill rotations that can churn out the most damage, the Viper’s rotations are complex and branching. You can wail on the same command and get a satisfying combo going, but changing even one step of it for an alternative attack might generate an entirely different buff and subsequent effect. For most classes, this could be confused for a dropped rotation, but Viper feels infinitely more improvisational in the way that most of its individual skills still feed into its deeper capabilities. It will certainly require someone with a deep understanding of how to maximize DPS to wring everything from the Viper class.</p><figure id="" data-id="84ea2323db736e54442ac03246b7f6e9" data-recommend-id="image://84ea2323db736e54442ac03246b7f6e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a Viper, one of Dawntrail's new jobs, using their weapon in its single-blade form." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a Viper, one of Dawntrail's new jobs, using their weapon in its single-blade form." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="84ea2323db736e54442ac03246b7f6e9" data-recommend-id="image://84ea2323db736e54442ac03246b7f6e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a Viper, one of Dawntrail's new jobs, using their weapon in its single-blade form." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The entire time that you’re attacking as a Viper, you’re also building two gauges. One allows them to generate and store three charges of the aforementioned weaponskill that transforms the singular blade into dual swords, unlocking a whole new set of abilities that can generate even further combos. By the time that I got comfortable with the Viper, I was able to maintain lengthy combos without any dropped inputs that featured various weapon transformations. The job’s second gauge keeps track of something called Serpent’s Ire, which generates a certain amount of meter based on the rotations that you pull off. Getting to 50 (or half of the gauge) allows the Viper to go into a high-powered state that transforms most of their existing abilities into moves called generations and legacies. You’ll see skills labeled first through fourth generation, and you’ll want to do them in order, but every use of a generation move will also unlock a complimentary follow up legacy technique. In this situation, I fell back on a combo that executed the current generation and its accompanying legacy before moving onto the next until I had an eight-step combo which culminated in a pure burst of energy and a hefty chunk of damage to whoever was on the receiving end.<br></p><p>Viper is easily the most involved DPS I’ve ever played, especially considering the fact that I’m so used to jobs like Samurai where I’m able to just check out for the most part. It certainly runs the risk of alienating folks who were hoping for something flashy and immediately accessible, but I think if you’re looking for a deep job that requires an immense amount of thought and micromanaging, Viper will do the trick.</p><p>Pictomancer isn’t a straightforward gig either, but it’s at least a few difficulty notches below Viper’s branching combos. Pictomancer’s skills are all colors that are approximations of spells and elements seen in <em>FF14</em>, such as the color red and fire. The execution of a combo ending in blue will generate charges that can be used to deploy Holy, otherwise known as white here, and players can also use area-of-effect variants of the same colors to also generate the same charges while taking out multiple creatures.</p><p>Pictomancer can completely swap their palette though, allowing for entirely different elements which generate a darker charge used to deploy Comet instead of holy. While players can bounce between the palettes, Pictomancer’s most wild gimmick allows it to draw aspects of monsters and make them real, such as a damaging gale from a monster’s wings or the sting of its bite. First the player has to draw the aspect to unlock its skill, which adds the drawing to a series of canvases on screen. For example, the Pictomancer can draw a comically large hammer, which they then expressively swing like a cartoon character. Filling every canvas eventually allows the Pictomancer to deploy a high-damage attack that combines them all, but upon its use, the canvases are cleared to begin the cycle again. And this is only just scratching the surface of the Pictomancer’s intimidating range of abilities.</p><h2 id="h6429"><a id=""></a><strong>Business as usual</strong></h2><p>For all of its extravagances and new jobs to play with, the main content of the preview, a lone dungeon, was the most familiar part of the whole <em>Dawntrail </em>affair. Beginning in the midst of a chase along a river, the dungeon moved through much of the same motions of dungeons I’ve encountered before, and players shouldn’t expect much to be different here, though it was still an exciting mission by all accounts.</p><figure id="" data-id="6b72ac39eaaa7d04446baff9d3e8f4dd" data-recommend-id="image://6b72ac39eaaa7d04446baff9d3e8f4dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the dungeon I was able to play, Ihuykatumu.

You begin the dungeon chasing another ship on the river." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You are routed through a series of three boss fights, and each has their own set of mechanics that need mastery for you to survive. The first fight was pretty standard, attacking with large AoE techniques that needed to be dodged while simultaneously doing damage. The second fight featured a monster that would summon large vines from underground and risked flattening players.Without the usual ground markers telegraphing their attacks until the last minute, you had to actually size up the vines and the directions they were facing in order to avoid heavy damage or being reset if you were playing solo. The final fight featured my favorite mechanic of the entire dungeon, which was a moving tornado that also then shot out AoE techniques in a star like pattern around it, which called for precision to avoid.</p><p>I had a blast playing through it numerous times over, and its last fight was a particularly delightful, dizzying dance, making <em>Dawntrail</em>’s dungeons about up to snuff with the exemplary stuff you’ve come to expect from the game by now.<br></p><p>Elsewhere, I got to see some of 7.0’s other shiny new features, such as the overhaul of <em>FF14</em>’s graphics. Though I’ve never found the game to be anything short of pretty, MMOs aren’t often known for their visual fidelity, especially as far as character models and environments. But <em>FF14</em> has taken some mighty big steps with 7.0, which renders Tural’s countryside with stunning vivacity. Fields are much more lush as well and even just the detail on my beautiful female Hrothgar character (also new to <em>Dawntrail</em>) was several notches above the models currently in the game. Fidelity isn’t usually a point of emphasis for me, but I can’t deny that <em>FF14 </em>has successfully glowed up, and even more changes will continue to roll out over the course of the next few years.</p><p>All in all, <em>Dawntrail </em>is shaping up to be a promising expansion. Though Yoshida’s warned that it may not necessarily mark the start of <em>FF14</em>’s next sweeping saga, it is still a big step for the game and its team, which appears to be stepping out of its comfort zone with Tural. I will be watching it carefully, but if our conversations have illuminated anything, it’s that the team’s aware of what a big deal it’ll be to get this right. So much else about the expansion, including its intense new jobs and vibrant locale, that this team knows what it’s doing. Now all that’s left to do is see if <em>Dawntrail </em>successfully gives its players the best summer break ever when it arrives on July 2, 2024.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This article is based on the play of an in-development build of FINAL FANTASY XIV: Dawntrail, and content in the final version is subject to change.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-summer-game-fest-price<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a61006534/summer-game-fest-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report from Esquire</a> – <a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corroborated by Kotaku</a> – has laid out the pricing structure of Summer Game Fest, and it ain’t cheap. Beginning at $250,000 for one minute of trailer time, Keigh-3 Keigh-sees some developers and publishers pay up to $550,000 for 2.5 minutes. Is it worth the steep price of entry? On this week’s episode of Aftermath Hours, we discuss that.</p><p>This week, we begin by talking about Summer Game Fest’s significance in the wider landscape of video games and how, on one hand, it acts as a flashpoint that briefly gets multiple gaming subcultures on the same page, but on the other, it’s no E3. That in mind, should developers spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to be part of it? Opinions are predictably divided. Then we talk about SGF-adjacent announcements like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dragon Age</em>’s puzzling name change</a> and <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s long-awaited <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/we-had-3-writers-play-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-here-are-9-things-one-of-us-found-but-the-others-didnt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay reveal</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we move on to a discussion of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg’s report on<em> Suicide Squad</em>’s fraught development</a>, which culminates in the birth of a new segment: These Guys Should Not Be In Charge. Speaking of, we then segue elegantly into a conversation about <a href="https://aftermath.site/variety-gaming-coverage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety’s pivot (back) into games coverage</a>, which mirrors <a href="https://aftermath.site/rolling-stone-glixel-savvy-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone’s recent games renaissance</a> – albeit with less Saudi money involved. Finally, we talk about <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-team-fortress-2-fixtf2-bots-botspam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valve’s continued mishandling of <em>Team Fortress 2</em>’s bot crisis</a>, a story that resurfaces about once per year because, well, Valve still hasn’t solved the problem! And if that’s not enough for you, we close out by getting mad about trains.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can buy a Summer Game Fest slot and use it to advertise blogs.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Kotaku reported that some smaller indies and also the big companies get in for free?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, so the big companies get in for free for a pretty obvious reason: They bring the eyeballs. What companies that are mid-tier and smaller are paying for is the ability to siphon off some of that attention and be part of something where people will remember their game alongside this major announcement from Big Company X. It will always be intertwined. People will always be like “What’s going on with that game that I remember, that stands out from the crowd, because it was part of this major showcase?” That part at least makes sense to me even if, from a cost-benefit analysis standpoint, I’m like, I don’t know about that, man. That’s a lot of money for a few minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> What it makes me wonder is, if the big companies don’t have to pay, who is paying $550,000. What company is that?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Probably the double-A companies, the Saber Interactives of the world.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Is that a good use of your money?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I saw some PR people talking online, and they seemed to think it was. On one hand, yeah, it’s a lot of money; on the other, this could be a singularly defining moment for the narrative surrounding your game. It could be the thing that puts it on the map and keeps it on the map for years to come. For some games that never end up in that place – that never get a chance to be on the map – yeah, [it’s an appealing proposition].&nbsp;</p><p>I think it’s a roll of the dice, though. There’s also a chance that based on the way the show is organized and everything like that, you could have your game get shown and then it gets stomped by a much more significant trailer. People immediately forget that your game was ever there. I saw people online talking about how longer segments tend to do better. Like, if you’ve got a little short trailer that gets sandwiched between two longer ones, it probably gets forgotten. But if you take up some actual screen real estate, people are not gonna forget, for better or for worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Yeah, you’re paying a lot in this era of booming development costs. It’s a lot of money. But I guess we don’t know what it costs to be in the Game Awards.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>We do. These are similar to the prices that Keighley charges for The Game Awards.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Esquire also pointed out that Keighley is the only person officially on paper on The Game Awards LLC or whatever it’s called. But surely, obviously other people paid and involved in the show must cost a great deal of money too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, and he hires production crews, rents out these massive theaters. I doubt that the show itself is cheap to produce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Yeah, I don’t think he’s rolling around in a vault full of money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I mean, I do think he’s rich, but I don’t think he’s pocketing most of this.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>People were talking about this in the comments to my blog – and the Esquire piece pointed this out, too – about how little we know about him as a person. He doesn’t even have a “personal life” Wikipedia section. And I’m tainted with this disease where I want to understand what everybody is like and think the best about them, and so I respect that for him. I respect that he has strong boundaries around his private and public lives, and he deserves that, and I admire that, and I want him to have that. But is he real? Does he live in LA? What is his life? What does he do? What is one fact about him as a guy?</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Is he Canadian? These are very basic questions you can probably just ask somebody who knows him.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Who knows him?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> But the idea of treating him like he’s a woodland creature or something like that [is funny].</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>It’s sort of admirable that he’s both the product and not the product. His blankness lets these games shine even though he is the focal point. It’s a very elegant dance. I respect that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>His parents were involved with IMAX. We knew that because he got put on an award show much earlier in his life – when he was, like, a teenager – so he’s always been in this scene.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Typical IMAX baby.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Somebody in chat said he doesn’t actually do anything. He just waits until the next award show. I imagine him like an RPG character, selecting the “wait” option in the menu and setting it to 180 days from now. And then he just sits down like Geralt from <em>The Witcher</em>, kind of kneels, and that’s it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I don’t mean to be mean, but he does have a <em>Skyrim </em>NPC-like affect to his eyes. He does look like he’s going to say, “Fine greetings to you.” He’s got a flat affect. He’s so identified with his job that it’s hard for me to conceptualize him as a real person because I’ve never met him. It’s sort of like when you’re like “When I leave school, my teacher just lives under the desk.” You see them at the supermarket, and it’s fucking weird.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I’ve never seen his physical body [in person]. It’s like that time that I saw Jeff Bezos in The Washington Post office, and it was like, oh, he’s a real man with a body, and that body is in a space where my body is.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I saw Geoff on the sidewalk at… I wanna say GDC one year. Some event where he would be, but kind of in incognito mode. But it was funny because he walked by, and this is when he was still following me on Twitter – he’s since unfollowed me – but I said, “Hey Geoff!” and he sort of grunted and kept walking.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>And then he unfollowed you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Right then and there. It would’ve been great if he turned around, pulled out his phone, opened Twitter, went to my profile, and showed it to me as he unfollowed me. And then just walked away after that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>That would be nice, yeah.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I would dine out on that story for years.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> And he would deserve it. Good for him. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The bundle includes 27 items from the Black Library, and there are some real gems here, as well as the start to several series. These books are in ePUB and MOBI format, which means that they can be read digitally on an ereader or browser.</p>
<p id="RnmYQw">The highlights include some anthologies from the Horus Heresy, a sprawling prequel series that takes place 10,000 years before the main 40K setting. <em>Lupercal’s War</em>, <em>Cthonia’s Reckoning</em>, and <em>Sons of the Emperor</em> all include tales from the Heresy.</p>
<p id="fuwXhC">If you prefer more modern stories, there’s some absolute bangers that take place in the dark millennium. <em>Fire Caste</em> by Peter Fehervari is one of my favorite 40K books; it’s <em>Apocalypse Now</em> through a grimdark, far future lens. <em>The Lords of Silence </em>by Chris Wraight<em> </em>follows the corrupted Death Guard, Chaos Space Marines in service to the Plague God Nurgle. You might think that’s an unrelatable point of view, but Wraight does a fantastic job at getting the reader invested in these characters. <em>Valedor</em> by Guy Haley is also considered to be one of the best novels about the Aeldari.</p>
<p id="2CRYQ1">In addition to these books I’d heartily recommend, there’s a wealth of literature I haven’t had the chance to pore through yet, like <em>Dark Apostle</em>, <em>Space Wolf</em>, <em>Lucius: The Faultless Blade</em>, <em>The Talon of Horus</em>, <em>Ice Guard</em>, <em>Avenging Son</em>, and <em>Titanicus</em>.</p>
<p id="kuUWCu">There’s also a selection of books from the <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, the wildly inventive and imaginative setting that was born out of the original Warhammer Fantasy Battles. I, for one, am looking forward to learning about history’s biggest hater in <em>Nagash: The Undying King</em>, by Josh Reynolds.</p>
<p id="h1VdRb">If you’re a fan of Warhammer, but aren’t sure where to start when it comes to the massive Black Library, this bundle is a great — and relatively inexpensive — option. The Bundle will end on June 27.</p>
