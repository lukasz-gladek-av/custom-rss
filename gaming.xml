            <p>
It's been almost a year since Saber Interactive last shared an update on its long-in-the-works and reportedly troubled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a> remake. But despite the ensuing radio silence, it's now insisting, "Everything that we have talked about is still in development."
</p>
<p>
A Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-announced-for-ps5">first announced for PlayStation 5 and PC</a> back in 2021, with developer Aspyr at the helm. Since then, however, the project has been dogged by rumours of difficulties behind-the-scenes, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-in-serious-trouble-and-delayed-indefinitely">report in 2022 claiming it was "in serious trouble"</a> and "delayed indefinitely".
</p>
<p>
Shortly after that report, it was confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-confirms-aaa-project-has-switched-studios-following-report-of-kotor-trouble">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine developer Saber Interactive had taken over development duties</a>, but still nothing has been seen of the project since its initial unveiling. More <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-reportedly-not-in-active-development">reports of its apparent demise</a> surfaced in 2023 - although those were quickly rebuffed - and the project's future was called into question again last year when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-to-sell-star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-developer-saber">Saber Interactive split with parent company Embracer Group</a>.

<figcaption>Here's how the KOTOR remake was announced back in 2021.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p82vauAdgv8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Saber's most recent comments on KOTOR came last April, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kotor-remake-alive-and-well-says-saber-interactive-ceo">company boss Matthew Karch insisted the remake was "alive and well"</a> - but with almost a year of radio silence now past since then, doubts have begun spreading through the fan community again. All of which brings us to the present, and Saber's latest tacit assurances the KOTOR remake remains in development.
</p>
<p>
Following this week's news that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-already-in-the-works-and-its-promising-an-even-more-immersive-experience">Saber is now starting up development on Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 3</a>, studio chief creative officer Tim Willits <a href="https://x.com/TimWillits/status/1900374508113961250">took to social media to reassure fans</a> that it's other announced games remain unaffected. "Saber Interactive is one of the largest independent developers in the world," Willits wrote. "We are working on numerous games across many different genres. Everything that we have talked about is still in development. We will share information on upcoming games when we have something cool to share."
</p>
<p>
That, then, bodes well for the ever-elusive KOTOR remake, but it's far from the only game previously confirmed to be in development at Saber. The studio is also working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-carpenters-toxic-commando-is-a-co-op-fps-with-80s-vibes-action-humour-and-horror">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jurassic-park-survival-will-revisit-locations-from-1993-film-but-also-introduce-new-ones">Jurassic Park Survival</a>, both scheduled to launch this year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-new-turok-game">new Turok</a> and Avatar: The Last Airbender games also on the way.
</p>
<p>
And as for the newly announced Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 3, that sounds like it's still some considerable way out. The studio has said it still plans to support Space Marine 2 "in the coming years" while it continues work on its "even more immersive" sequel.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/gdc-2025-travel-visa-san-francisco-donald-trump-mahmoud-khalil<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As far as statements of intent go, it’s hard to make a more definitive one than what the Trump administration has done to Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/columbia-university-protester-mahmoud-khalil-immigration-arrest-5ae6eeb3ac95f190a505abebc4ee0944" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snatching a legal US resident</a> away from his family, stripping him of his rights, and detaining him with intent to deport, all for the non-crime of exercising his First Amendment rights by helping lead protests against Israel’s genocide of Palestinians. This follows previous weeks in which the Trump administration passed down <a href="https://aftermath.site/kennedy-center-nea-trans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous anti-trans edicts</a>, made moves to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-quest-conquer-canada-confusing-everyone-rcna195657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annex Canada</a>, imposed tariffs that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/14/investing/stocks-trump-wall-street-tariffs/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threaten to crash the US economy</a>, and began an ongoing project to <a href="https://aftermath.site/elon-musk-treasury-protest-diablo-path-of-exile-cheating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dismantle the federal government</a>. You can understand, then, why some game developers would be hesitant to enter the United States, even if it means missing out on career-defining opportunities.</p><p>The annual Game Developers Conference takes place next week in San Francisco, and while the event has received <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/27/23679081/gdc-2023-price-affordability-game-developers-conference" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ample criticism for prohibitively high prices</a> and other accessibility issues over the years, it remains an important event for developers from all over the world to gather, network, and share knowledge. But as of the past few weeks, some developers are canceling their plans to attend.</p><p>"I had flight tickets, hotel, and pass all lined up and decided to cancel last week due to the possibility of being turned around at the border for being trans – which according to a recent <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5189226-texas-bill-transgender-rights-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memo</a> can be considered fraud," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/loa-gunnars.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lóa Gunnars</a>, an independent game designer and educator based out of Reykjavík, Iceland told Aftermath. "I’ve been planning [to attend GDC] for about four months, and [it] would have been my 10th year there. ... GDC is incredibly valuable to me. I studied game design [at] NYU, and GDC is my main way of staying connected to the North American game industry, a place where I meet old friends and make new connections."</p><figure><blockquote><p>In the Republican US, they could grab me and make me go away, and nobody would be able to do shit even if they tried.</p></blockquote></figure><p>In other cases, more specific headlines generated by the Trump administration’s smash-and-grab tactics have developers un-packing their bags. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ramiismail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rami Ismail</a>, an indie developer, speaker, and consultant formerly of Vlambeer, told Aftermath that immigration agents' abduction of pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil solidified his decision to keep his distance from a conference he's been critical of in the past.</p><p>"I can barely get into the US under the Democrats," Ismail said. "The Republicans are straight up disappearing people, mate. I'm Egyptian. I know what disappearing is: Little van shows up, gone you are. In the Republican US, they could grab me and make me go away, and nobody would be able to do shit even if they tried. I think if anyone with Western privilege would be worried about going to Egypt, they should now be equally worried about going to the US. These things are random, unfair, and without recourse."</p><p>Others, like <em>Subnautica Below Zero</em>, <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>, and <em>Assassin's Creed: Freedom Cry</em> writer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jillmurray.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jill Murray</a>, who is based in Montreal, are maintaining a healthy distance from the increasingly bad ol’ US of A out of senses of both solidarity and self-preservation.</p><p>"[The breaking point] was seeing how afraid trans and BIPOC friends were of crossing the border. I take it seriously and don’t really want to go where they can’t go," Murray told Aftermath. "My biggest personal factor is that I’ve been self employed for a very long time, and that can make me face more questioning. With a trade war on, it doesn’t feel like the risk is warranted – even if I’m facing mounting pressures to network, given the overall situation of the industry."&nbsp;</p><p>Vivid Foundry founder Tanya Kan and game trailer maker Gary J Kings, two developers who are residents of Canada, kicked off a discussion of the difficult choice many international developers face in regard to GDC <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/garyjkings.bsky.social/post/3lk6w64e4os2u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Bluesky</a>. Both cancelled their plans this week after hearing the story of Becky Burke, a British tourist who’s been <a href="https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article301877574.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detained in an ICE facility for two weeks</a> due to visa issues, unable to voluntarily return home. Burke’s father has called the situation <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2025/03/11/british-tourist-detained-us-canada/82267160007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“a nightmare.”</a></p><p>"[Burke's] case highlights the system's cruelty by detaining her in inhumane conditions,” Kan told Aftermath. “From there we looked at other factors and came to the conclusion that the political climate was devolving too rapidly for us to not feel anxious whilst needing to be in our top form at GDC."</p><figure><blockquote><p>It doesn’t feel like the risk is warranted – even if I’m facing mounting pressures to network, given the overall situation of the industry.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Trump’s escalating trade war with Canada – the goal of which sure seems to be annexation of a sovereign nation – has many Canadians bunkering down on their side of the border.</p><p>"The straw that broke the camel's back was the President's constant and repeated economic and military threats to Canada, including tariffs and especially annexation," BancyCo co-founder <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjaminrivers.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Benjamin Rivers</a> told Aftermath. "Since a vast swath of Canadian businesses have decided to remove American products and pivot to non-American services, and citizens are increasingly opting out of travelling to the US, we thought it was only prudent to do the same. So instead of attending events like GDC or PAX, we've opted to spend our marketing budget on events in Canada, Europe, and Asia."</p><p>Rivers by no means relishes having to steer clear of a country where many friends reside, but in times of political upheaval, safe is far preferable to sorry.</p><p>"We know that American friends and colleagues don't support what the government is doing, and we'll dearly miss meeting them at events like GDC,” he said. “But it seems insane to travel to a country that has all but declared you its enemy, and in which random innocent travelers are already being detained, so we've opted to not cross that border for the foreseeable future."</p><p>Conditions, unfortunately, do not look to be improving, even in supposed liberal strongholds like California, which finds itself under the shaky stewardship of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/14/gavin-newsom-steve-bannon-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">right-wing-guest-hosting</a> podcaster-in-chief Gavin Newsom. What, if anything, can GDC and other, similar events do? Most developers believe the obvious answer is the best, fraught with logistical concerns though it might be: move.</p><p>"It might help a bit if the GDC talks were live [streamed] so at least it’s possible to follow along online conversations. But even when they did for covid it just [wasn't] the same; active participation during talks and the mingling between events are the important bits," said Gunnars. "A more central Europe conference [might be GDC's best bet]? I’m not sure why GDC Europe never held the same appeal."</p><figure><blockquote><p>I don’t think the industry in the US has had to grapple with the possibility of becoming less central before, but I think it’s a real possibility now.</p></blockquote></figure><p>“It would be nice to see the industry decide to convene elsewhere on a rotating basis,” said Murray. “I hope there’s an opportunity here for other conferences to grow, and for international organizers to reach out to each other and combine resources and ideas to capture some of that magnetic mass attraction GDC has always had. I don’t think the industry in the US has had to grapple with the possibility of becoming less central before, but I think it’s a real possibility now.”&nbsp;</p><p>Despite how quickly things are accelerating, the fact is that the current climate in the US didn’t come out of nowhere. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chhopsky.tv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christina Pollock</a>, a developer who's worked on series like <em>Call of Duty</em> and has, at various points, resided in Brisbane, San Francisco, and Vancouver, told Aftermath that she’s faced visa issues when it comes to entering the US since 2020. She’s not alone.&nbsp;</p><p>"Every year we hear the same story from developers from all around the world that two things hold them back from GDC: the cost of visiting SF and difficulty with US visas,” Pollock said. “Plenty of other North American industry conventions successfully rotate through cities and venues. SIGGRAPH, NANOG et al have had successful events in Canada. … If GDC is willing to break away from its home venue and look towards Toronto or Vancouver, I think they'll find that organizing events internationally isn't nearly as difficult as people might think. The game industry is already a global community; our premiere conference should reflect that."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-suikoden-book-boss-fight"><h3>The Suikoden Series Is As Relevant As Ever</h3></a><p>"It does something the original Star Wars movies did really well, which is showing normal people doing exceptional things"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tim-sweeney-epic-ceo-elon-musk-brainworms"><h3>Log Off, Tim Sweeney</h3></a><p>Again, if I had $5 billion you would never see or hear from me ever again</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/people-can-fly-reaches-agreement-to-develop-a-new-game-based-on-sonys-ips/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Polish developer People Can Fly <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313-raport-biezacy-nr-4-2025-zawarcie-pda-z-sony-delta-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today a new agreement with Sony to develop a prototype based on one of the PlayStation company's franchises. The game's codename is Project Delta, which really doesn't give away much.</p>
<p><em>The Production Agreement provides that work on the Product will be carried out in the so-called ‘work-for-hire model’., i.e. work performed by the Company as a developer on commissioned by and on behalf of the Publisher, in return for which the Company will receive from the Publisher an agreed remuneration.</em></p>
<p><em>In accordance with the Production Agreement, work on the Product will be divided into stages (milestones). The detailed terms and conditions of cooperation between the parties regarding the implementation of and payments for milestones are set out in an appendix to the Production Agreement (milestone schedule). The scope and provisions of the Production Agreement do not deviate from the provisions of the Production Agreement.</em></p>
<p>People Can Fly is far from new to this kind of collaboration. In June 2023, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-project-possibly-in-development-at-people-can-fly-with-30-50-million-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that they had partnered with Microsoft to create a game based on one of their IPs. Given their past (they worked with Epic on the original Gears of War trilogy and even led the development of the 2013 spin-off Gears of War: Judgment), it was a safe bet that it would be another Gears title. Indeed, in late January, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-is-being-co-developed-by-people-can-fly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the game is Gears of War: E-Day, co-developed with The Coalition.</p>
<p>There's no mention of the project's budget here, though, unlike with the Microsoft collaboration. Anyway, the studio's pedigree sits squarely in the shooter genre, with games like Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/outriders-great-fun-while-it-lasts-despite-some-flaws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outriders</a> in their development history. As such, PlayStation fans are already hoping that Sony has provided the green light for a new Resistance or Killzone game since Insomniac and Guerrilla Games are now busy with other work. Both sci-fi franchises have languished for over a decade despite having very interesting settings.</p>
<p>In other People Can Fly news, the Polish studio recently <a href="https://x.com/MauroNL3/status/1900143444686754187?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1900143444686754187%7Ctwgr%5E995914a35dfa617a5376732855cd9431d9ff1720%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmultiplayer.it%2Fnotizie%2Fpeople-can-fly-abbandona-realta-virtuale-project-bison-sara-suo-ultimo-gioco-vr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it will phase out its publishing business of Virtual Reality games, citing the lack of investments in the area even from the VR platform holders. The developer will now focus on traditional triple-A development, whether with self-publishing, work-for-hire, or co-development models.</p>

Dark Odyssey is the real headline here, as it includes a war chest of cosmetic treats for all God of War Ragnarök owners across PlayStation 5 and PC. It’ll arrive as a free update March 20.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything included in Dark Odyssey features a clean, black-and-gold look that will no doubt have Kratos and co looking better than ever as they tear their way through Norse mythology. Atreus and Freya both receive their own cosmetic sets as part of the patch, too, as do a variety of the player’s shields and weapons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The show-stealer, though, is a Dark Odyssey appearance and armor set for Kratos that hearkens back to a skin originally only rewarded to players who managed to beat God of War 2 on God Mode difficulty. Players can claim the content in any Lost Items chest in the base game or immediately in God of War Ragnarök’s roguelike Valhalla mode after the update drops. The patch will also finally introduce the option to customize the appearance of Kratos’ weapons without sacrificing each weapon’s respective ability.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">God of War Ragnarok Dark Odyssey Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dark Odyssey Armor &amp; Appearance for Kratos</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Dark Odyssey Kratos Appearance</li><li>Dark Odyssey Armor Set for Kratos (Dark Odyssey Breastplate, Dark Odyssey Bracers, Dark Odyssey Belt) </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dark Odyssey Companion Armor  </strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Dark Odyssey Vestment for Atreus</li><li>Dark Odyssey Witch Frock for Freya </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dark Odyssey Weapon Appearances &amp; Attachments</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Dark Odyssey Leviathan Axe [Appearance] &amp; Dark Odyssey Knob [Attachment] </li><li>Dark Odyssey Blades of Chaos [Appearance] &amp; Dark Odyssey Handles [Attachment]  </li><li>Dark Odyssey Draupnir Spear [Appearance] &amp; Dark Odyssey Hind [Attachment]  </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dark Odyssey Shield Appearances &amp; Rönd</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Dark Odyssey Guardian Shield [Appearance]</li><li>Dark Odyssey Dauntless Shield [Appearance]</li><li>Dark Odyssey Stone Wall Shield [Appearance]</li><li>Dark Odyssey Shatter Start Shield [Appearance]</li><li>Dark Odyssey Onslaught Shield [Appearance]</li><li>Dark Odyssey Spartan Aspis Shield [Appearance]</li><li>Dark Odyssey Rönd</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">God of War Ragnarök released in late 2022, so one simple update was never going to do the series’ 20-year history justice.

So it's little surprise that amid an ongoing, calamitous conflict with the Illuminate, players are poring over the messages for hidden details.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not caught up with the running narrative in Helldivers 2, here's a quick catch-up: developer Arrowhead has the Illuminate back and pushing the lines of galactic warfare as the latest threat to Super Earth. The eerie foe is using a massive black hole to slowly consume entire planets, pushing it to <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1890025104643678643" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angel's Venture</a> and, now, <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1900413203336560904" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moradesh</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ironically, the black hole was initially created on Meridian <em>by </em>Super Earth, in an effort to wipe out a Terminid Super Colony. Arrowhead's got a particular penchant for "yes, and"-ing the outcomes of the galactic campaigns. The slow build to right now, with the Illuminate pretty much pushing a black hole slowly towards Super Earth, is the latest in a long line of dominoes.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>MORADESH EVACUATION WARNING<br>EVACUATE PLANET<br>MORADESH EVACUATION WARNING</p><p>MORADESH EVACUATION WARNING<br>EVACUATE PLANET<br>MORADESH EVACUATION WARNING</p><p>MORADESH EVACUATION WARNING<br>EVACUATE PLANET<br>MORADESH EVACUATION WARNING <a href="https://t.co/G4vpaIgLpz" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/G4vpaIgLpz</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1900413203336560904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">So, now we're here: Moradesh is evacuating, and Helldivers are anticipating the next step of this cataclysmic campaign. Yet some are digging into the evacuation orders, trying to suss out a hidden meaning from the messages Arrowhead is broadcasting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reddit user Pinglyadya shared an image of what looks like an egg, hidden in the Moradesh videos. In the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1jayjpb/comment/mhpnxc5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comments</a>, they go further, breaking down the potential morse code strings into dots and dashes, surmising that it all results in a few different codes: "045a5, 06efbc, e1b5f0 then 21232. We don't know what this is the code to but have fun."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The "06EFBC" code caught attention <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1jawqur/comment/mhpoqeq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in another thread</a>, as it could correspond with the hex code for a shade of teal called Last Straw.

                <p>Although <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket/" data-ref-id="5000-649113">Pokemon TCG Pocket</a> has been extremely successful since its debut last year, not everything in the game is popular with players. Case in point, the trade tokens introduced in late January were met with an extremely negative response, in part because players had to destroy their duplicate cards to earn them. Now, the game's developers, Creatures Inc. and DeNA, have revealed that they will be getting rid of the trading tokens and replacing them with another in-game currency.</p><p>As shared on <a href="https://community.pokemon.com/en-us/discussion/17262/trading-feature-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pokemon's official site</a>, trade tokens will be completely removed from the game by this fall. In their place, shinedust will now be the currency used to trade cards. Any trade tokens that remain in players' collections after the switchover will be converted to shinedust.</p><p>Shinedust will only be required for trades involving cards with three-diamond, four-diamond, or one-star rarity. However, the exact breakdown of the cost in shinedust wasn't disclosed. Shinedust is automatically earned when players get a card they already have registered in their Card Dex. Since Shinedust will be used for trades, the developers are looking into increasing the amounts that are given to players.</p><p>The in-game trading function will also receive an update in the future that lets players share the cards they want to trade for, which should make the trading process go more smoothly. The devs also stated that they are investigating how they can let players swap cards that aren't currently able to be traded, including promo cards and two-star rarity cards.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-reveals-triumphant-light-expansion-as-it-surpasses-100-million-downloads/1100-6529756/" data-ref-id="1100-6529756">Triumphant Light</a> expansion for Pokemon TCG Pocket launched at the end of February, as the game passed 100 million downloads. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-set-to-be-acquired-by-saudi-arabias-scopely-in-3-5-billion-deal/1100-6530064/" data-ref-id="1100-6530064">Pokemon Go developer Niantic's gaming division was purchased by Scopely</a> in a $3.5 billion deal.

            <p>
God of War's Kratos has had a busy life: he's birthed a teenager, slain the gods, and grown the kind of luscious beard that would make a lumberjack fume - all that and he's only 20 years old! And to celebrate Kratos and the God of War series' big two-oh, Sony is releasing a free update for 2022's Ragnarök that'll include some classic-inspired skins.
</p>
<p>
Starting next Wednesday, 20th March, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> players on PC and PlayStation can download a free update adding, among other things, the Dark Odyssey armour and appearance for Kratos - both inspired by the classic black-and-gold skin players could unlock after beating 2007's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-war-2">God of War 2</a> on God Mode difficulty. There's the swirly shoulder sheen and glowing white eyes of the anniversary skin itself, plus the Dark Odyssey Breastplate, Dark Odyssey Bracers, and Dark Odyssey Belt - all of which can be accessed from any Lost Items chest in the base game or automatically while in Valhalla.
</p>
<p>
Players can also apply Dark Odyssey appearances to the Guardian Shield, Dauntless Shield, Stone Wall Shield, Shatter Start Shield, Onslaught Shield, Spartan Aspis Shield, and Rönd. And over in the weapon corner, there are Dark odyssey appearances for the fully upgraded versions of the Leviathan Axe, Blades of Chaos, and Draupnir Spear. All these come with their own Dark Odyssey attachments, so if you fancy giving Kratos a Dark Odyssey Knob, have at it. Sony notes all the above will gain the 'Edit Appearance' feature in next week's patch.

<p>
And as for companions, the black and gold aesthetic carries over to two bits of Dark Odyssey armour for Freya and Atreus. There's the Dark Odyssey Witch Frock for Freya, which comes with some fetching golden tassels, and the largely leather-based Dark Odyssey Vestment for Atreus.
</p>
<p>
That's everything in God of War Ragnarök's free update, but the 20th anniversary celebrations are set to continue in other realms - most specifically, the actual Earthly one. As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/14/celebrate-god-of-wars-20th-anniversary-with-god-of-war-ragnarok-dark-odyssey-collection/">detailed in Sony's announcement</a>, there's a two-volume God of War retrospective book on the way, alongside art prints, t-shirts, an exhibition at California's Gallery Nucleus, and 67 inches of World Serpent to enjoy. The latter comes in the form of a Jörmungandr plushie that's also a hand puppet and even includes a little magnetised Leviathan Axe crammed into its mouth.
</p>
<p>

"Back in 2005 when the first God of War released, no one at Santa Monica Studio anticipated the success this series would have," adds Sony. "Every creative endeavour carries the hopes of those who shaped it that they might be able to carve a legacy in the industry. What makes those hopes a reality has always been the support of players who chose to pick up the game and go on a journey with us." Here's to another 20 years Kratos; may your beard never retract inward.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mezen-board-game-inspired-by-siberian-artisans-announced-by-arcane-wonders<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arcane Wonders has announced the launch of the <em>Mezen</em> board game. This puzzle tile-based tabletop game is based on the art style developed by traditional Siberian artisans, providing players a hands-on learning experience of this part of the world.</p>

<h2>The Mezen Board Game Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Mezen</em> board game is inspired by the meze style of painting, which emerged in the mid-eighteenth century. This style is characterized by distinct shades of red and white and imagery centered on fire, water, creatures and plants found in nature, the sun, the moon, and protective symbols.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mezen-board-game-game-pieces.jpg?itok=IRJ5g4s0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mezen-board-game-game-pieces.jpg?itok=T3vgOZ8t 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Players step into the role of one of these craftsmen creating intricate ornamental paintings to order. Players will take turns flipping tiles and earning points. Whoever earns the most points by the end of the final round is declared the winner.</p>

<p>These tiles are maneuvered over a 5x5 board. Each round starts with the active player choosing one of the animals on the tiles. All players then choose a group of one or more tiles with that animal to remove from their grid and flip over. Next, they slide the tiles above the open spaces down and place the newly flipped tiles back in the open spaces at the top.</p>

<p>Once this is done, everyone will score the current round's scoring objective. These objectives include revealing symbols or completing the image of an animal. These objectives are dealt to players through a deck of cards. Once five rounds are done, players get one point per black tile shown on their board. After the 10th and final round, players score one point per white tile&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Mezen</em> board game was created by Nikita Sorokin and Maria Stahkevich and developed by Hobby World. It is the latest board game to join Arcane Wonders' diverse tabletop catalog which includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/arcane-wonders-announces-onstage-trick-taking-game-about-theater-troupe" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Onstage</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/video-game-champion-brings-retro-game-collecting-fun-to-gaming-tables" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Video Game Champion</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ito-card-game-getting-western-localization" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Ito</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is available now at an MSRP of $39.99 on Arcane Wonders webstore and Amazon.</p>

Today, <em>Star Wars: Hunters</em> developer Zynga announced <a href="https://starwarshunters.com/news/sunset-on-vespaara/">the game will be sunset on October 1st</a>.</p><p><em>Hunters</em> is a class-based arena shooter featuring original characters (or at least they <em>seem</em> original, who knows with folks named Babu Frik running around) from throughout the <em>Star Wars</em> universe. It had a soft launch in select countries in 2021, but didn’t get a global launch on mobile and the Nintendo Switch until June 2024. This means that the game officially lived a scant 16 months before it inevitably goes offline. That short time though is downright luxurious considering <em>Specter Divide</em> lasted roughly six months before it will shut down sometime in the next 30 days.</p><p>The developers do have some parting gifts for players before the galaxy winks out on <em>Star Wars: Hunters</em>, though. The current season will be extended an additional three weeks and the game will still release a new hero April 15th. Then the developers will keep the ranked leaderboards running until the game shuts down in October.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Last year, Zynga debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-hunters-is-available-to-play-for-free-now/1100-6523925/" data-ref-id="1100-6523925">Star Wars Hunters</a>, a free-to-play 4v4 shooter that introduced new characters and placed them in deathmatches in familiar locations from across the Star Wars universe. However, less than a year after its launch, launch, Zynga has announced Star Wars Hunters will shut down this fall.</p><p>On the official <a href="https://starwarshunters.com/news/sunset-on-vespaara/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Wars Hunters site</a>, Zynga shared the news that the game will receive its final update on all platforms on April 15.

Afterwards, the servers will be shut down, servers will be shut down, rendering it completely unplayable. Zynga also thanked fans for their support and promised to be transparent during the game's final months.</p><p>"We understand this news may be disappointing and want to assure you that this decision was not made lightly.

		<p>Zynga has announced that it will be shutting down Star Wars Hunters on October 1st, with the final season dropping on April 15th. The shutdown will come near enough four years after Star Wars Hunters first soft launched, which occurred in November 2021 in some countries. The game then released worldwide in early 2022. The full statement regarding the shutdown can be read below.</p>

<p><em>Dear Hunters,</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for your incredible support and for being part of the world of Vespaara. After careful consideration, we want to let you know that the final content update for Star Wars: Hunters on all platforms will be on April 15th. The game will remain playable until October 1st, 2025, when the game’s online servers will be shut down.</em></p>
<p><em>We understand this news may be disappointing and want to assure you that this decision was not made lightly. Your passion and dedication to the game and its community have meant the world to us, and we are committed to providing visibility and updates throughout the transition process.</em></p>

<p><em>Please find below a few important dates regarding this announcement.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>March 25th, 2025</strong>&nbsp;– Season 5 will be extended by three weeks. We will re-run events and shop bundles from the Season, and the Ranked Season will also be extended, giving players more time to hit Kyber 1 rank.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>April 15th, 2025</strong>&nbsp;– Final content update will be released for free and in-game purchases will be disabled across all platforms. New Support Hunter, Tuya, will join the battle as part of the final update. Tuya will be available and playable for all users immediately at no cost, along with a slate of additional in-game content. We will continue to run a final Ranked Mode leaderboard for players to compete in and run all battlefields and game modes in rotation.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>October 1st, 2025</strong>&nbsp;– Online servers will officially shut down, and Star Wars: Hunters will no longer be playable beyond this point.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for being a part of this incredible journey and for the time you’ve spent playing Star Wars: Hunters.</em></p>
</div>
<p>The FAQ regarding Star Wars Hunters shut down has confirmed there will be no refunds for purchases of the Arena Pass and Crystals, with players instead encouraged to use all the items they have before the game closes. The game will remain downloadable from app stores until October 1st.</p>

The patch is live on Xbox and PC and it fixes a lot of tiny bugs and other issues. But the biggest news is that all players will now be a bit more powerful thanks to some extra upgrade points. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On March 13, Obsidian released patch 1.3 for <em>Avowed </em>on both Xbox and PC.

The list is so big that Obsidian had to split it. Heck, it’s so big that I couldn’t even fit the entire thing in this post. Given its size <em>and </em>the fact that it contains some spoilers, instead, I’ve just included the spoiler-free highlights. </p><p>And the best news is that players will now receive an additional talent point at levels 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30. Don’t worry if you’ve already leveled up past these milestones, as the extra points are being given out retroactively, too. I loved <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-open-world-steam-deck-game-pass-60fps-how-long-1851765353&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-open-world-steam-deck-game-pass-60fps-how-long-1851765353"><em>Avowed</em></a></span>, but I did feel like it was a bit stingy with talent points which let you unlock and upgrade new abilities and spells. These six extra points will help out a lot!</p><p>Also buried in the massive patch notes post is a hint from Obsidian about future updates. The developer says that in the coming weeks it will release a roadmap for <em>Avowed </em>that will share some of the plans the studio has for the game over the next year or so. Will we get a confirmation of DLC? Or a new talent tree? I hope so, as I want more <em>Avowed to play! </em></p><p>Anyway, here are the non-spoiler patch notes for <em>Avowed’s </em>latest update.

<p>New documents have revealed that People Can Fly and Sony Interactive Entertainment have signed a deal to create a prototype for a game based on Sony’s IP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by Zuby_Tech on <a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/1900605141914444110/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), People Can Fly and Sony have signed a “prototype development agreement.” The prototype in question is for a “new video game codenamed Project Delta,” which is based on one of Sony’s IPs.&nbsp;It is unclear which Sony IP Project Delta is based on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Sony and People Can Fly deal states that the latter will be hired through a “work-for-hire model,” meaning they will work as developers for Sony for an “agreed remuneration.” The production agreement states that the game’s development will be divided across milestones. </p>



<p>People Can Fly was recently announced as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/people-can-fly-is-co-developing-gears-of-war-e-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-developer on Gears of War: E-Day</a>, a month after the studio laid off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/people-can-fly-announces-layoffs-impacted-120-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">120 staff members</a>. The studio also cancelled its longtime game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/people-can-fly-cancel-project-dagger-after-years-of-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Dagger</a>, in April last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a PlayStation logo was recently spotted on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-logo-spotted-on-starfield-creation-club-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfield’s Creation Club</a> website. Also, a new job listing suggests another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-yet-to-announce-live-service-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-service multiplayer</a> game is in the works. What are your thoughts on Sony and People Can Fly entering this deal?

                <p>Although Assassin's Creed Shadows won't be available through Xbox Game Pass, at least at launch, there will be a perk for subscribers. Game Pass Ultimate members who purchase Shadows will have have the ability to play the game through Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p><p>Microsoft just revealed this feature as part of its <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/play/gallery/buy-and-stream" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“stream your own game”</a> perk for Ultimate tier subscribers. However, this only applies to digital copies of games, not physical ones. "Stream your own game" is different than Xbox’s own Play Anywhere program, which gives players both native Windows PC and Xbox versions of games if they purchase either one.</p><p>Certain games in the Game Pass library can be streamed, but not all of them. If a game leaves Game Pass, it can normally no longer be streamed even if it's been purchased. That makes this feature particularly useful, although it remains unclear how widely it will be supported. Some other games that are part of the "stream your own game" feature are Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Cyberpunk 2077, and Life is Strange: Double Exposure.</p><p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches on March 20 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. The game was also just confirmed to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-support-steam-deck-at-release-ubisoft-confirms/1100-6530082/" data-ref-id="1100-6530082">Deck Verified</a>, meaning that It can run properly on Steam Deck. For PlayStation players, those who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-on-ps5-pro-will-have-an-extra-fancy-ray-tracing-mode/1100-6529947/" data-ref-id="1100-6529947">play the game on PS5 Pro</a> will have access to advanced ray-tracing modes to enhance its visuals.</p><p>Those who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-collectors-edition-strategy-guide-is-discounted-at-amazon/1100-6527284/" data-ref-id="1100-6527284">preorder Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> will receive the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-release-its-expansion-in-a-much-different-way/1100-6529019/" data-ref-id="1100-6529019">Claws of Awaji expansion</a> that will be released later this year. However, the expansion will still be available to purchase separately at a later date.</p><p>In GameSpot’s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-feels-like-the-series-trying-to-come-to-terms-with-its-warring-halves/1100-6528968/" data-ref-id="1100-6528968">Assassin’s Creed Shadow preview</a>, we said, “If the superb world design, art direction, and music are any indication, I'm inclined to go into the full experience with hopeful expectations.”</p>
