<p>As reported by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/high-on-life-2-leaked-for-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Everything</a>, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GGDYYH1V?tag=nlife-20" rel="sponsored noopener">full Amazon page</a> for the Switch 2 version — complete with box art, price, and a release date of 20th April 2026 — popped up earlier today. It'll be a Game-Key Card release and you can even pre-order the game right now, despite the fact the port hasn't been officially announced.</p>
<p>It looks pretty official, though, and since the game is coming to other platforms on 13th February, even the two month wait seems believable.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ztmxvp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>If this is your first time hearing about High on Life 2, then let's fill you in via its Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong><br>
You’ve done it. You’ve taken down an intergalactic cartel, brought humanity back from the brink of extinction, and hunted dangerous bounties to the far corners of the galaxy. Bounty hunting has brought you fortune, fame and love; but when a mysterious figure from your past reappears and puts a price on your sister’s head, your cushy life gets thrown into chaos.</p>
<p>Do you have what it takes to risk it all and bring down an intergalactic conspiracy that once again threatens your favorite species (humans)?</p>
<p><em><strong>High On Life</strong></em> RETURNS as you and your beloved rag-tag team of alien misfits shoot, stab, and skate your way through gorgeous, dangerous worlds all across the galaxy to blow up the EVIL pharmaceutical conglomerate hell-bent on putting price tags on HUMAN LIFE!</p>
<p><strong>FEATURES<br></strong>- BLAST your way through enemies with an arsenal of charismatic alien firepower in high-octane hyperactive combat.<br>
- Kickflip alien cops in the face and grind your way to freedom with your brand new SKATEBOARD.<br>
- Get up close and personal with an eccentric cast of bizarre and subversive lifeforms voiced by an ALL-STAR COMEDY CAST.<br>
- Wreak havoc at the galaxy’s biggest convention, an alien zoo for humans, and a luxury futuristic cruiseliner on your cosmic quest to TAKE DOWN BIG PHARMA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first game is already available on Switch 1 &amp; 2, so a Switch 2 port makes sense for the sequel. We'll keep an eye out for an official announcement.</p>
<p>The original game was conceived by Justin Roiland, co-creator of <strong>Rick &amp; Morty</strong> who also founded developer Squanch Games in 2016, so that should give you an idea of the humour in this series. Roiland is not involved in the sequel, as in 2023, he stepped down as CEO of the company following charges of domestic violence and sexual assault.</p>
<p>Our sister site Pure Xbox reviewed the original back when it released, and it's safe to say that <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/reviews/xbox-for-pc/high-on-life">they didn't mince their words</a>. Let's hope the sequel is an improvement...</p>

<p>The love the modding community is pouring into the game - releasing mods that significantly improve the experience with enhanced visuals, such as the <strong>HD Reworked Project</strong>, whose <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hdrp-nextgen-edition-2026-wind-simulation-more-detailed-characters/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">new version is set to launch this year</strong></a>, along with new features - is also behind its enduring popularity.

<p>Besides supporting these other mods, <strong><em><a href="https://rejuvenate.gitbook.io/witcheronline/general-information/features">The Witcher Online</a></em></strong> features equipment sync thanks to which each players will be able to see their their equipped armor, swords, crossbow, scabbards, hair style, and face mark, full movement and combat sync corresponding to <strong>Geralt's</strong> animations, emotes that other players can see using corresponding emote commands in the console, statuses display and more.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hazelight-studio-josef-fares-next-game-better-than-split-fiction/</link>
            <guid>1404676</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Hazelight Studios</strong> has made a name for itself by creating excellent couch co-op games, with the team's latest release, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/">Split Fiction</a></strong>, being one of 2025's best games, earning it several nominations at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">The Game Awards</a></strong>, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/">DICE Awards</a>,</strong> and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">Golden Joysticks</a></strong>. It was even one of <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">Wccftech's picks for our Best Games of 2025</a>, and according to the studio's creative director, <strong>Josef Fares</strong>, the studio's next game will be "<em>better than Split Fiction</em>."</p>



<p>This comes from a recent interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would">The Game Business</a>, where Fares talked about a lot more than just what he expects from the studio's next game. He talked about how the team at Hazelight is consistently raising its bar, which is why he added, "<em>I feel extremely confident of everything we’re doing. I can easily say that our next game is better than Split Fiction</em>."</p>



<p>That confidence comes from the culture that has been built at the studio since its debut game, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Hazelight currently stands at a team of <strong>80 people</strong>, and keeping as much of that team together since its founding has been a key part of the studio's success, as they've all grown together with Josef Fares leading the charge with his "<em>F*** s*** up mentality, without f***ing up</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Split Fiction’s Josef Fares on Clair Obscur success, AI fears and EA’s reputation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v9WyRvP53_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Hazelight's games are known for being creatively supercharged, which Fares credits to his ability to "<em>wake up the creative monster</em>" inside the developers at Hazelight. A task easier said than done, though, as we're often the ones to get in our own way.</p>



<p>"<em>People put a lot of limitations on themselves, and it’s mainly coming from their mind</em>. <em>Once you stop listening to that, shit will start happening. And how do you do it? Well, first, you practically push that person… in a nice way, obviously. You say, ‘not this’, ‘let’s do that’. ‘that’s been done before, let’s try this way’. And eventually they come into this ‘f*** s*** up’ mentality where they’re like, ‘okay, there are no limits’. And then you make that person feel confident that there really are no limits. People have so many possibilities inside them, and that’s not only for creating games, but in general. It’s just, stop listening to this [points to head] and just feel it instead.</em>"</p>



<p>Fares also discussed how the studio has had incredible commercial successes. Split Fiction <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/">sold <strong>4 million copies at launch</strong></a>, and its prior release, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/">It Takes Two</a>,</strong> sold over <strong><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/it-takes-two-sold-over-20-million-copies-and-won-goty-but-hazelights-josef-fares-says-all-the-numbers-looked-really-really-bad-before-the-co-op-studio-became-this-really-big-developer/">20 million copies as of March 2025</a>.</strong> But those numbers weren't achieved with the studio following trends or trying to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microtransactions-are-stopping-creativity-reckons-josef-fares/">put microtransactions into everything.</a> It came from the team at Hazelight keeping what's best for the game at the heart of all its decisions.</p>



<p>"<em>Every decision, every single decision, taken by Hazelight will be based on what we feel is great for the game. We’re not going through data thinking what will sell or not sell. That’s not how we do it. I’m not saying that the business is not important. It’s important to combine them together. If you lean in too much on either side, either too much on creativity or too much on business, it’s going to be bad for the game</em>."</p>



<p>On the topic of following trends, Fares also spared a few words on the hottest topic in the industry, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/find/?wp_searchable_posts%5Bquery%5D=genAI">GenAI</a>. </strong>"<em>We have been working with AI for a long time in game development. The problem is the generative AI</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>If [an AI tool] is helpful to get your vision out there, I don’t see why we shouldn’t look into it. But… it’s the generative AI that people are a bit like…It’s really hard to answer. If you look at Midjourney, for instance, when it came out it was so impressive. And five years later… the bar hasn’t gone up much. Maybe this is the limit of it.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>You get someone generating a game concept and saying, ‘oh look what might happen in five years?’ But who knows? In five years, maybe it’s going to be like Midjourney… not much better</em>. <em>At the end of the day, you still need someone that has a vision or idea of what game it is. I don’t see AI taking over. I don’t. But it’s really hard to answer. Who knows what happens in the future?</em>"</p>

<p>According to GI.biz, the aforementioned voluntary redundancy program "had some takeup", but Ubisoft deemed "additional steps" were necessary in order to further cut costs.</p><p>An internal email sent by Ubisoft to staffers apparently states that the layoffs are nothing to do with staff performance and that the direction of both studios remains the same.</p><p>Just in case you need a reminder, Massive Entertainment is the studio behind 2024's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/star-wars-outlaws" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fdd3085d-9457-4fdd-8120-72f7ba52b3c0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>, and it's also the developer responsible for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0d6d339e-943d-4392-8a44-bd5f8ec47fda" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em></a><em> </em>and the <em>Division </em>franchise.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a>'s early access <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-release-time-and-date">went live a short time ago</a> as I write this. While plenty of folks look to have gotten in already, its devs have issued some guidance for the many others who've reported running into error messages or having their downloads stick.</p>
<p>The team lead by Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme who've swiftly resurrected the Minecraft-esque sandbox after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">buying the rights from Riot Games</a> had predicted launch day might see some teething troubles due to a bottleneck of eager Hytalers, and it certainly seems those concerns weren't misplaced.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While some of the errors folks have run into early doors trying to get into Hytale have been at the point of purchase - here's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-error-a-basket-with-that-identifier-does-not-exist-fix">handy guide on how to deal with at least one of those</a> - a bunch of reported having things go pear-shaped while trying to download the game via its launcher.</p>
<p>Cue a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/523059903812599811/551337246364532737">Discord server</a> full of people spamming error messages. So far the Hypixel team are working on fixes, but the main bit of advice at this early stage is simple. "If you are seeing launcher downloads being stuck / error. Please restart the launcher," Hytale tech director Slikey has posted. "Global distribution is still rolling, so you may need to keep trying."</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">If you are seeing really weird stuff, please reply to me.</p>— Slikey (@slikey) <a href="https://twitter.com/slikey/status/2011095876270203181?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Meanwhile, folks with "really weird stuff " are being encouraged to reply to his tweet. While Hytale's Discord server doesn't appear to have a dedicated channel for those seeking help solving issues or getting advice on fixing bugs, its general game discussion channel has seen a bunch of posting to that effect in the past hour or so.</p>
<p>Honestly, if you're able, I'd give it an hour or two to settle down before trying to hop in if you're keen not to spend time having tech doors potentially slam in your face. Maybe <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-doom-running-in-hytale-before-its-even-out-thanks-to-modders">watch a modder play Doom in Hytale</a> on repeat if that helps. We also have a guide to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-hytale-on-steam-deck">installing the latter on the Steam Deck</a> if you need such a thing.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-evolution-art-characters-raichu-2000659297</link>
            <guid>1404658</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Game Freak’s established promotional pipeline for </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games has the company using 3D renders, rather than hand-drawn art, to reveal new monsters ahead of each game’s launch. Anyone who cares about getting good assets of these new critters knows that this is the purgatory The Pokémon Company puts us through as we wait for the gorgeous illustrations we’ll get post-release, which resemble the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ken-sugimori-original-art-red-blue-gold-silver-1850352781"><span>old Ken Sugimori art</span></a><span> that you see featured on database sites like </span><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Raichu_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"><span>Bulbapedia</span></a><span>. Today, January 13, we finally got the art drop for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span> and its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106"><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i></a> <span>DLC. And oh boy, there’s some beauts here.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the art is of the several dozen new Mega Evolutions added in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>and its expansion, but it also includes official artwork of some of the major characters who show up later in the game and weren’t part of the initial marketing push. Notably, this includes Lysandre, Grisham, and Griselle, ex-members of the villainous Team Flare, some of the only truly “secret” characters who are crucial to some of the late game reveals. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-game-characters-of-2025-2000655443"><span>Lysandre</span></a><span> in particular was kept under wraps, given he was long presumed dead after the events of </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. I suppose The Pokémon Company is ripping that bandage off. You had three months to play the game, so the aged, immortal version of Lysandre we get in </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>might start showing up in more marketing material now that he’s being acknowledged through official channels.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But the real treat is the good art we finally have of all the Mega Evolutions, including my boy </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>Mega Raichu X</span></a><span>, the meme king </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-horizons-anime-mega-starmie-friede-episode-2000654235"><span>Mega Starmie</span></a><span>, and some of the lesser-known transformations that debuted in the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC. Click through to see them all.</span></p>

 <p><span>Yesterday, The Pokémon Company announced the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-pokemon-pikachu-date-price-mega-bloks-teaser-1851770713"><span>official Pokémon x Lego collaboration models</span></a><span>, including sets for Pikachu, Eevee, and a disgustingly expensive one of the Kanto starters. If you </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/comparing-legos-new-200-pikachu-set-to-mega-bloks-50-version-2000658904"><span>compare them to the Mega Bloks models</span></a><span>, though, you might decide to buy those cheaper sets instead.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagates-xbox-storage-expansion-card-drops-below-0-12-per-gb-at-a-new-year-record-low-as-amazon-clears-out-the-best-selling-ssd-2000656513</link>
            <guid>1404652</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="1023">Gaming has a file size problem. In recent years, we’ve seen video games reach overwhelmingly large sizes. This is particularly true for many big-budget games developed by Western AAA studios. Take <em data-start="286" data-end="308">Oblivion: Remastered</em>, for example, which has a file size of over 120GB. It’s hard to even imagine how much space <em data-start="401" data-end="422">Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will occupy when it’s eventually released. With games consuming such vast amounts of storage, it’s a challenge for players—especially since consoles like the Xbox Series X still come with only 1TB of internal storage. If you want to play more than just a few games, you’ll find yourself constantly managing space by deleting and reinstalling titles, which isn’t exactly convenient. A far better solution is to invest in a dedicated external storage drive. Seagate offers one that’s made specifically for the Xbox Series X and Series S, and it’s currently available at a significant discount for a limited time.</p>
<p data-start="1025" data-end="1395"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6128/">Amazon is offering three versions of Seagate’s Xbox expansion card at reduced prices right now</a>. The 1TB model, typically priced at $160, is on sale for $149, giving you a $11 discount. The 2TB version has dropped from $260 to $230, saving you $30.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6128/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1397" data-end="1743">Since the Xbox Series X comes with just 1TB of storage, adding one of these Seagate drives will either double, triple, or even quintuple your available space for Xbox games—depending on which model you choose. This extra storage will make a huge difference if you want to keep a variety of games installed without constantly managing your space.</p>
<p data-start="1745" data-end="2146">Installing the Seagate expansion card is incredibly simple. Unlike the PS5, which requires users to open the console casing to install an SSD, the Seagate drive for Xbox Series X and S plugs directly into a dedicated slot at the back of the console. No tools are needed. Once it’s plugged in, you can select whether you want to save new games to the internal storage or to your Seagate expansion card.</p>


<h2 data-start="1745" data-end="2146">Swap Between Games With Ease</h2>
<p data-start="2148" data-end="2610">What’s more, games saved to the Seagate drive perform just as well as those stored on your Xbox’s internal storage. A major selling point of the current generation of Xbox consoles is Quick Resume, which allows you to suspend one game and switch to another without losing your progress. You can jump from a high-speed race in <em data-start="2495" data-end="2512">Forza Horizon 5</em> to a quick match in <em data-start="2533" data-end="2548">Rocket League</em>, then return to your original&nbsp;<em>Forza&nbsp;</em>race right where you left off.</p>
<p data-start="2612" data-end="2975" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Seagate’s expansion cards are officially licensed to support Xbox’s Velocity Architecture, which powers Quick Resume. This means any game you store on the Seagate drive will benefit from Quick Resume, just like games stored on the internal drive. Whether you’re downloading a new title or moving an existing one, the experience will remain seamless and efficient.</p>
<p data-start="2612" data-end="2975" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With lots of massive titles set to release this year such as <em>GTA VI</em> and <em>007 First Light</em>, now is a great time to expand your Xbox storage. Grab Seagate’s Xbox expansion card for as little as $160 for a limited time.</p>

            <p>Before 2026 heats up, we've got several small and mid-sized game releases coming our way fast, but unexpected arrivals like <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</a> could be making the coming weeks busier than initially anticipated.</p>
<p>Publisher Daedalic Entertainment has just unveiled a new 'combat deep dive' trailer (which you can watch below) and locked a February 18 launch for the game, which is now coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> too. As for the price tag, it's targeting $39.99 / £34.99 / €39.99, with a Deluxe Edition adding "five additional missions, two new recruitable heroes, and three new technologies" at $49.99 / £44.99 / €49.99.</p>

<a aria-label="Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown | Combat Deep Dive" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7K9_Kn6fvEU?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7K9_Kn6fvEU?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7K9_Kn6fvEU?autoplay=1" title="Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown | Combat Deep Dive">

<p>Trapping the full experience behind the Deluxe Edition aside, this "story-driven survival strategy game" has been looking refreshing ever since it was first announced. Strategy games, narrative journeys, and survival experiences are all common nowadays, but it's stranger to see them all come together while using a famous sci-fi property to boot.</p><p>In many ways, Across the Unknown is taking cues from older Star Trek games that had players taking command of starships and entire crews, and that applies to the combat as seen in this trailer (surprisingly involved if you ask me). That said, the bigger scope and focus on what-if scenarios could set it apart from past strategy games set in the iconic universe.</p>
<p>Moreover, the full gameplay loop appears to be quite varied; players can expect scenes which are all about decision-making as well as exploration, management, research, and combat. For each section, <a href="https://www.gamexcite.de/">Gamexcite</a> has leaned on systems and mechanics which look familiar; hopefully, the final result will please trekkies and the more casual crowd alike.</p>
<p>Though the game seems like a perfect fit for Nintendo Switch 2's handheld mode given its chill and menu-heavy rhythm, don't forget it's coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S too. In fact, those platforms have received a demo you can check out before purchasing.</p>

            <p>Be very, very quiet. I'm hunting bugs. Or so will say the folks who don the gear of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s next warbond. It's dubbed Redacted Regiment and it's all about looking stealthy in a tactical fashion. As opposed to simply trying to hide in a corner because you're a coward, as I've unashamedly done numerous times while serving Super Earth.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491587748125214428">next gear pack</a> for the shooter's set to arrive on January 20th, and marks the first proper new addition its gotten since the calendar flipped over in 2026. So, what sort of kit is it delivering in return for hard-earned super credits? Well, in two words, sneaky shit.</p>
<p>Both of its primary weapons - the R-72 Censor and AR-59 Suppressor - are rifles with integrated quietening tech. I mean the latter's literally named after said quietening tech, so you probably guessed that. The Censor's aimed at taking down targets at medium range, while the Suppressor has a longer reach. The armour sets which accompany these armaments are similarly sneaky. The RS-89 Shadow Paragon set's your standard light tactical infiltrator getup, complete with 15 million pockets, while the RS–67 Null Cipher set provides medium protection thanks to angular metal planting designed to ditch radar detection.</p><p>They come with a "Concealed Insertion" booster, which whacks up a smoke screen to emerge through when your hellpod touches down, completing the hushed hitman ensemble. Rounding things out are a sidearm in the P-35 Re-Educator pistol, which shoots dart that make enemies delirious. Then, there are a couple of explodey things in the form of a backpack full of C4 as a stratagem and a mine which lures foes to it before enboomening.</p>
<p>It all looks decently fun, but I'd say it's a bit too dry to mirror the wackier warbonds which I reckon are where Helldivers 2's slapstick shootery really shines. No <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-warbond-is-full-of-funky-alien-tech-including-a-somewhat-stable-wormhole-teleportation-pack">wormhole teleportation packs</a> to be seen here, though I suppose if every set of new gear had one, it wouldn't be as special.</p>
<p>Odds seem good that once this warbond's live, Arrowhead might start cracking into whatever regimen of new battle scenarios or galactic threats they have planned for the game's unending war this year. Things have been fairly quiet since the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/giant-new-bug-worms-of-helldivers-2-i-will-find-you-and-i-will-watch-someone-else-kill-you">Into the Unjust update</a> and subsequent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-install-size-reduction-effort-yields-131gb-in-cuts-and-you-can-try-the-slim-build-right-now">technical tweaks</a>, so it feels like Super Earth's finest are due having another big twist flung their way soon.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-prime-docking-station-14-port-160w-crashes-to-lowest-price-of-the-year-now-cheaper-than-during-last-holidays-2000659243</link>
            <guid>1404604</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Anker’s Prime Docking Station is a 14-port hub that can power your laptop and accessories and drive dual monitors from a very small footprint. It comes in a sleek, vertically oriented case that can be placed on your desk. Up front, it has ports for charging your devices, and on the back side, ports for data, video, and networking access. There is also a small LED screen that shows which ports are currently active and how power is being distributed. The device can handle both power and data transfer simultaneously, with a maximum of 160W of power distribution and 10 Gbps of data speed, making it a powerful tool for organizing your various accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">Click here to purchase the Anker Prime Docking Station for $170 on Amazon, discounted from its regular retail price of $270. This is a savings of $100, or 37% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A quick and easy way to perform cable management with all your devices</h2>
<p>The Anker Prime Docking Station includes four USB-C ports, five USB-A ports, dual HDMI ports, an Ethernet jack, and audio jacks. The two USB-C ports on the front of the dock can deliver up to 160W of power and charge up to two devices simultaneously. Each port can provide up to 100W to a single compatible laptop, allowing you to charge your laptop while working. The rear USB-C and USB-A data ports support transfer speeds up to 10 Gbps, enabling faster transfers of large files between external storage devices and your computer. Since all your peripherals are attached to the docking station via a single upstream USB-C connection, you don’t have to unplug any peripherals when you disconnect your laptop.</p>



<p>The Anker Prime Docking Station features dual HDMI outputs for connecting multiple external monitors to your laptop. For example, you can connect two separate 4K monitors at 60 Hz, giving you ample space to spread out multiple applications across both. Alternatively, if you prefer a simple layout, you can connect a single monitor and still have the second HDMI port available for a television or projector.</p>
<p>The Anker Prime Docking Station is compatible with USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt laptops that support DisplayPort Alt Mode and USB-C Power Delivery, including but not limited to: many Windows 10, Windows 11, and Chrome OS laptops. Mac laptops can also use the dock; however, the two external monitors will mirror each other instead of providing a traditional three-monitor desktop environment. Note that the dock is not compatible with Linux laptops, and some gaming laptops may require their own chargers to operate at optimal levels. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">At a discounted price of $170, down from $270, the Anker Prime Docking Station is an effective way to convert a single USB-C port into a powered 14-port desktop configuration.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Given the very loud fallout from </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>series finale</span></a><span> and a portion of the horror show’s fandom descending into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><span>a mass hysteria</span></a><span> in believing that a secret ninth episode </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-conformity-gate-secret-netflix-crash-2000658155"><span>might fix the whole season</span></a><span>, I have to wonder if there were any conversations at Netflix about not releasing the </span><i><span>One Last Adventure: The Making of Stranger Things 5 </span></i><span>documentary that went live on the streaming service yesterday, January 12. Already, every word that series creators the Duffer Brothers had been uttering in interviews </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><span>was being picked apart</span></a><span>, and now the conspiratorial mindset fueling that scrutiny has been given a lot of new wood to burn by the documentary.</span></p> <p><span>The two-hour documentary includes behind-the-scenes footage of the writers’ room and table readings, as well as the set of the show during shooting. In a world where </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>hadn’t been combed through by fans looking for any proof that a secret episode was coming, it could have been viewed as a surprisingly honest look at all the moving parts a production of this scale has to contend with. But there’s a segment of </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fans looking for any explanation as to how it all went wrong, and the documentary sure has a few moments that fans are latching onto.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the things people are pointing out are mostly speculative. In one section, the Duffer Brothers are shown with what fans believe to be </span><a href="https://x.com/PopCrave/status/2010896631034707994"><span>ChatGPT</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://x.com/SThingsMeme/status/2010679300282871909"><span>Reddit tabs</span></a><span> open on a computer while writing the script for a season five episode. The Reddit logo is pretty clear in one shot, but the ChatGPT one is more contested. Even so, these tabs being open doesn’t actually confirm anything, but detractors are running around with accusations that the Duffers used ChatGPT or relied on fan discussions on Reddit when making important creative decisions, all based on…open tabs? Let’s be serious.</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><span>As for more substantial stuff, a few scenes in the documentary have caught the eye of people critical of the season, and more specifically, of the Duffer Brothers. At one point during filming of the finale, Montana Maniscalco, the key production assistant on the show, says that the episode isn’t completely written yet, with the presumptive takeaway being that the Duffer Brothers must still be trying to figure out how the season is going to end this late into production.</span></p>

   <p><span>Other scenes of note include a moment in the writers’ room in which writer Paul Dichter said that there should be more monsters in the finale’s climactic battle, even going so far as to name the Demogorgon from season one as a potential foe for the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>crew to face in the final fight. He says it would be “crazy” if there was nothing there. Well, if you saw the finale, you know that’s exactly what happened, and it seems Dichter’s feedback was “ignored.”</span></p>

   <p><span>In another clip, Maya Hawke is seen discussing a moment her character shares with her girlfriend Vickie. Their relationship is a secret at this point in the story, and we see Hawke is saying she wants to have this conversation “in a whisper.” This, too, is being read in the most bad faith way, with the narrative being that Hawke is having to “remind” the crew about things the writers “forgot” about characters, rather than actors sharing ideas on how things should be played because they’re a part of this process, too, and might have opinions.</span></p>

   <p><span>I don’t mean to be dismissive of people who didn’t like the ending, but I have “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asthkXjWWQ0"><span>played these games before</span></a><span>.” I know what it’s like to be searching for any justification for your disappointment and projecting narratives onto some pretty normal interactions in a creative space. I can’t speak for why they ignored Dichter’s note about the monsters, but Hawke’s point about tweaking that scene? That shit happens all the time in movies and TV. We had this same conversation when James Gunn and David Corenswet </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/auz1txQ5WVc"><span>had a debate about some lines in the </span><i><span>Superman </span></i><span>movie</span></a><span>. People reacted to it as if it was a “fight,” but this is literally just something that happens when you’re collaborating with someone else on a creative project.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I know the confirmation bias is too embedded in the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fandom right now, with people still holding out hope that there’s another finale locked away in a vault somewhere waiting to fix everything. Y’all can keep fighting ghosts, but I do hope that the people who are still caught up in this conspiratorial cycle find their way out of it.</span></p>

<p>Helldivers 2 is getting a new Warbond called Redacted Regiment on January 20, 2026; here’s what you need to know about it. </p>



<p>Arrowhead Game Studios is back again with a new Warbond for players to try out. The last few Premium Warbonds saw developers introduce features such as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2s-next-premium-warbond-will-introduce-a-minigun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">minigun</a>, the return of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-x-killzone-returns-as-a-legendary-warbond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killzone collaboration</a>, and more. The latest Premium Warbond will focus on suppression technology and spec ops fashions. </p>







<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-redacted-regiment-weapons-and-stratagems">Helldivers 2 Redacted Regiment Weapons and Stratagems</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Helldivers 2 Redacted Regiment Premium Warbond will introduce two primary weapons for players to try out. The first is a mid-range precision rifle with an integrated suppressor called R-72 Censor. The other is a fully automatic assault rifle with a non-removable suppressor called AR-59 Suppressor. There’s also a dart-firing P-35 Re-Educator, which releases “a chemical agent that induces delirium in organic targets and delirium-like malfunction in inorganic ones.”</p>



<p>Coming to the Stratagems, first up is the B/MD C4 Pack, a backpack that comes with six adhesive C4 charges and a wireless detonator. The other is the TM-01 Lure Mine, a throwable anti-personnel mine that attracts enemies by producing sounds and flashing lights. The mine will detonate when the target enters its proximity. </p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-redacted-regiment-cosmetics">Helldivers 2 Redacted Regiment Cosmetics</h2>



<p>First up are the Helldivers 2 Redacted Regiment, and players get two of them this time. First up is RS-89 Shadow Paragon light armor, which comes with “multitudinous pads and pouches to hold all your tactical EDC items”. The other is the RS–67 Null Cipher medium armor, which has been coated with “a radar-absorbent polymer and null-signature heat baffle to turn you into a real sensor ghost.” Both armours feature Reduced Signature passive, which results in reducing the player’s noise level and also the range the enemy can detect them in. </p>



<p>There are two new capes as well, the Pillar of the Abyss and Triangulation Veil capes. Additionally, a new victory post called Target Sighted and a new player title, [Redacted], have been added as well. Lastly, there’s a new booster called Concealed Insertion, which deploys a smokescreen from your Hellpod in impact, allowing you to enter stealth mode as soon as you land. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop has addressed the long wait for Henry Cavill’s Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe, insisting that Amazon is in control of the delivery of the adaptation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Superman actor and Warhammer 40,000 lover Henry Cavill is set to star in and executive produce the live-action Warhammer 40,000 adaptation for Prime Video.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cavill's Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe is shrouded in mystery, and Games Workshop itself has cautioned fans not to expect to see anything of it for some time. But it is now over three years since Games Workshop’s deal with Amazon was announced, and fans have yet to see anything of it, or hear anything tangible about it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In its latest financial results (the long and short of it is that Games Workshop is doing tremendously well and making loads of money), CEO Kevin Rountree addressed the elephant in the room: just what is going on with the Amazon stuff?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We continue to work on some exciting projects that will bring Warhammer to screens like never before,” Rountree said, keeping his cards close to his chest. “Our live action endeavour is still in development with our partners: Amazon MGM Studios, Henry Cavill and Vertigo. It is the nature of these things to take several years, and while we wish we could tie down a release the way we can with our core business, the reality is that, as with any licensing deal, delivery is not in our control. We leave it to our partners to manage their own businesses.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That doesn’t help fans much, to be honest. But at least we know the project is still in the works and hasn’t been lost to the Warp. Fans have spent the last few years in a state of enduring excitement about the prospect of finally seeing Warhammer 40,000 brought to life in live-action form across films and TV shows — and with Cavill steering the ship, they’re confident it will be done right. Hopefully we'll get some details, including who Cavill himself will play, soon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, condensing the vast scope of Warhammer 40,000 into films and TV shows while sticking to a reasonable budget may prove a challenge. Warhammer 40,000 is a highly detailed setting with multiple factions, thousands of years of war played out on a galactic scale, and, at the heart of it all, enormous Space Marines who often fight against even bigger monsters. We’re talking space battles that can last hundreds of years, gargantuan land battles that can consume entire planets, and the Warp, a place so unknowable that it can be pretty much anything you can imagine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In that context, what story will Cavill tell? Does it need to be more grounded than a big galactic epic? We’re left with scraps to mull over, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-the-mere-mention-of-an-nda-by-a-games-workshop-author-has-sparked-all-sorts-of-speculation-about-what-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-might-be"><u>recent comments from Dan Abnett about NDAs and upcoming books</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In June last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/henry-cavill-says-hes-enjoying-the-challenge-of-creating-the-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-it-is-a-tricky-ip-and-a-very-complex-ip-and-thats-what-i-love-about-it"><u>Cavill himself touched on the “complexity” and “trickiness” of adapting the Warhammer 40,000 IP</u></a>. But, he insisted, he’s loving the challenge, which for fans will be great to hear. Bringing Warhammer to life "is a dream come true," Cavill said, "but it's different from what I've done before, in the sense I haven't had my hand on the tiller of things before. It's wonderful doing that. It is a tricky IP, and a very complex IP, and that's what I love about it. The challenges that come with putting this on the page in a way that is doing justice to that complexity, that trickiness, and that nuance, is a challenge I'm enjoying enormously."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Rountree did have one solid bit of news to deliver: a standalone Warhammer Age of Sigmar episode is in the works. Age of Sigmar is the fantasy portion of the Warhammer universe, as opposed to Warhammer 40,000's far future setting. This new episode follows on from the hugely popular Warhammer 40,000 episode for Amazon’s animated anthology series Secret Level, which starred Titus from Space Marine 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it sounds like there’s more to come from a potential Secret Level Season 2. “After a successful collaboration with Amazon MGM Studios and Blur for Secret Level (a high-end animated anthology show), we are now meeting with writers to determine our next step to continue the momentum gained from that episode,” Rountree said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the meantime, work is almost complete on a standalone Warhammer Age of Sigmar episode. Again, for Prime Video. We will update you further when we have more significant milestones to share.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

He said GW staff are barred from using it to actually produce anything, but admitted a “few” senior managers are experimenting with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rountree said AI was “a very broad topic and to be honest I’m not an expert on it,” then went on to lay down the company line:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We do have a few senior managers that are [experts on AI]: none are that excited about it yet. We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorised use outside of GW including in any of our competitions. We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective, the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are allowing those few senior managers to continue to be inquisitive about the technology. We have also agreed we will be maintaining a strong commitment to protect our intellectual property and respect our human creators. In the period reported, we continued to invest in our Warhammer Studio — hiring more creatives in multiple disciplines from concepting and art to writing and sculpting. Talented and passionate individuals that make Warhammer the rich, evocative IP that our hobbyists and we all love.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop owns and operates a number of hugely popular tabletop war games, including Warhammer 40,000 and Age of Sigmar. Its core business is selling miniatures and box sets that are used by fans to play these games, but there are a number of other creative aspects of the hobby that Games Workshop invests in, such as book selling, art sales, and animation production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/displate-denies-warhammer-40000-ai-art-accusations-says-red-flags-in-official-fulgrim-poster-are-the-result-of-human-error">Displate was forced to deny that one of its pieces of official Warhammer 40,000 artwork was the product of generative AI</a>, insisting “red flags” spotted by fans were the result of human error.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-horus-heresy-book-era-of-ruin-gets-warhammer-40000-lore-fans-talking-with-tantalizing-insight-into-the-carrion-emperor-and-the-golden-thrones-true-nature"><u>The Warhammer 40,000 setting is in many ways built upon the evocative and enduring art drawn by the likes of John Blanche</u></a>, who shaped its "grimdark" aesthetic alongside other key Games Workshop staff. This official, human-made Warhammer 40,000 artwork is beloved by fans, most of whom take a dim view of the mere whiff of generative AI “art” sold or released in any official capacity by either Games Workshop itself, or its partners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Games Workshop sells expensive Warhammer 40,000 ‘codex’ rulebooks that are packed with stunning official art as well as lore. Any suggestion that this art was created either in part or entirely by generative AI tools would likely cause a community uproar.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/13/ow852ulpdo731-1751405677082-1766411683253-1768309174083.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The God-Emperor, by John Blanche.

            <p>Oh, Funko Pop. What have you done? Well, unless my eyes are deceiving me, I think you may have let slip a yet-to-be-aired and potentially pivotal plot point for the second season of Amazon's Fallout adaptation.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of spoilers (past and perhaps future) for Fallout season two below.</strong></p>

<p>Images of an <a href="https://x.com/AmusementTimeYT/status/2010966559385329789">all-new</a> <a href="https://x.com/FunkoPOPsNews/status/2010946498477928916">Funko Pop</a> based on Amazon's Fallout series have started making the <a href="https://pops.today/television/1915-caesar">rounds online</a>, and correct me if I am wrong, but they appear to show Macaulay Culkin's character Lacerta Legate as Caesar. That is to say, the head of the Fallout faction known as Caesar's Legion.</p>
<p>Caesar's Legion plays a not insignificant part in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>, which large parts of the show's second season is based on.</p>
<p>In the show, we meet Caesar's Legion when naive and trusting vault dweller Lucy gets captured by the faction, and popped up on a crucifix to think about what she has done (which was answer a cry for help, damn this wasteland!). We also discover that the Legion is in the midst of a civil war, following the death of the faction's founder. There are now two members who are vying to be the heir, or the new Caesar.</p><p>However, neither of the two potential faction leaders look anything like the upcoming Caesar Funko Pop, which you can see below. Instead, this model looks a lot more like Culkin's high-ranking Lacerta Legate. So, I am going to hazard a guess that something is going to go down at some point during the series' next four episodes, and Lacerta Legate ends up as the man on top.</p>
<p>To compare to the games, in Fallout: New Vegas, players who follow the Legion questline all the way through the end can either cure Caesar of his illness, or kill him. If he dies, Lucius - the leader of the Praetorian Guard - takes over, at least until the finale.</p>
<p>So, do you hope Lacerta Legate becomes the leader of Caesar's Legion in the Fallout show?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong> will be laying off <strong>55 people</strong> at its <strong>Massive Entertainment</strong> and <strong>Ubisoft Stockholm</strong> studios, a new report from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-laying-off-55-roles-at-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-as-cost-cutting-continues">GamesIndustry.Biz</a> has revealed. It's the second cost-cutting move from the company this month, after it <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-ubisoft-halifax-claims-decision-had-nothing-to-do-with-studio-unionizing/">shut down its Halifax-based studio, which saw <strong>71 people</strong> left without a job</a>.</p>



<p>According to the report, the news was delivered to staff through an internal email that cited the move had nothing to do with the developer's performance at either studio, and had all to do with Ubisoft believing the cuts to be necessary after a "<em>mapping of the future roadmap</em>" for the company.</p>



<p>The email added that the "<em>long-term direction for the studios remains unchanged</em>," as Massive continues to work on several <strong>The Division</strong> projects, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-in-production-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-division-1-ubisoft-massive/">The Division 3</a>, </strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-survivors-division-resurgence-ubisoft-gamescom-2025/"><strong>The Division 2: Survivors</strong> and <strong>The Division: Resurgence</strong></a>. There's also a potential fourth project (besides more The Division 2 expansions) with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-definitive-edition-seemingly-leaks-ubisoft/">The Division: Definitive Edition</a></strong>, though it's not yet clear what exactly that project will look like.</p>



<p>These cuts are also hitting Massive and Stockholm despite the fact that the email also reportedly states the studios are working on an "<em>unannounced innovative tech project</em>" that will "<em>play a central role in the development</em>" of the Snowdrop Engine, the game engine built by Massive Entertainment that's been used for recent titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-nintendo-switch-2-demo-this-year/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tom-clancys-the-division-2-loot-capital/">The Division 2</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Last year, Ubisoft kicked off 2025 by laying off <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/"><strong>185 people</strong> and shutting down its Leamington-based studio</a>. It then followed that up with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-massive-entertainment-layoffs/">cuts at Massive Entertainment</a> and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">Ubisoft RedLynx Studio</a>. It's beginning 2026 in a similar fashion, with <strong>126 people already cut just 13 days into 2026.</strong> Meanwhile, the company <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">recently closed a deal with <strong>Tencent</strong> to establish a new venture, <strong>Vantage Studios</strong>,</a> which will now house the company's biggest IPs, including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.</p>

<p>Level-5 will no doubt be pleased with <em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em>'s performance, especially given what a long road it's been to get here (and not one with a guaranteed chance of victory, either).</p><p>Originally known as <em>Inazuma Eleven: Heroes' Great Road</em>, the game has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-heroes-great-road-delayed-until-2021" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="291efc63-1f35-4892-bcb7-01502230543a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> numerous times, and a Western release was by no means guaranteed until Level-5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-will-come-west-new-trailer-details-revealed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c93004cd-65c8-4edc-afb5-782c92344e4c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced one in 2023</a>.</p><p>Just like its predecessors, <em>Victory Road </em>is an RPG that combines tactical soccer battles with overworld exploration.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dysons-carboat-handheld-vacuum-drops-to-a-record-low-now-priced-like-a-budget-cleaner-2000659256</link>
            <guid>1404550</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you have a car or boat, it can be difficult to keep things tidy if you don’t have an appropriately sized set of tools. A handheld vac is just what you need to save the day. We’ve found one that you’ll absolutely love using, and it won’t break the bank. The Dyson Car+Boat Handheld Vacuum delivers strong cordless suction in a compact form factor that’s perfect for tight spaces, using Dyson’s digital motor and cyclone technology to maintain consistent performance from start to finish. This handheld vacuum weighs about 4.2 pounds, making it easy to maneuver around vehicle interiors, storage compartments, and other confined areas without strain.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6749/">Head over to Amazon to get the Dyson Car+Boat Handheld Vacuum for just $229, down from its usual price of $299. That’s a discount of $70 and 23% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6749/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Compact Design With Serious Suction</h2>
<p>Designed specifically for mobile environments, the vacuum has super strong suction as well as a mini motorized tool that uses a rotating brush bar to lift dirt and hair from upholstery and carpets. A Crevice tool helps reach narrow gaps between seats or along trim lines, while the Combination tool transitions between a wide nozzle and soft brush for dusting hard surfaces.</p>
<p>These attachments connect directly to the vacuum body, so you don’t lose them somewhere else. Plus, the bin holds about 0.14 gallons of dirt and debris and uses Dyson’s point-and-shoot mechanism to get rid of extra dirt.</p>



<p>Cordless operation plays a major role in how this vacuum fits into real-world cleaning routines, eliminating the need to manage cords or find nearby outlets. The balanced handle design keeps weight centered in the hand, which helps during longer cleaning sessions across multiple surfaces. Two power settings let you prioritize either maximum runtime or increased suction depending on the mess you are dealing with. That means the vacuum is super flexible. It can handle loose dust, sand, pet hair, and embedded debris with confidence.</p>
<p>Battery performance remains consistent throughout the cleaning cycle, with fade-free suction designed to deliver steady airflow until the charge is depleted. Recharging is handled through the included charger, and the vacuum is ready for repeated use without complex setup. Plus, it has washable filters so you don’t have to keep spending money on things like that.</p>
<p>Beyond cars and boats, the vacuum adapts well to stairs, furniture, shelves, and other areas where larger machines feel cumbersome. The compact body makes storage simple, and switching attachments is quick when moving between different surfaces. Dyson includes a two-year warranty, adding reassurance around long-term reliability and support.If you want an easy to use vacuum that’s perfect for keeping your car or boat (or other vehicle or small space) tidy, this is a great choice to get started with.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-server-status-explained/</link>
            <guid>1404544</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hytale coming back from the dead has revitalized an expectant community and is sure to bring in a lot of players. However, it’s not ideal if the Hytale servers aren’t cooperating, and this guide has the latest.</p>



<p>Servers, servers, servers, you both love them and hate them. Without them, you don’t get to play online games, but with them, there’s the constant headache of relying on them <em>to</em> work. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-expects-one-million-players-at-early-access-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale’s early access</a> is very much a game in its infancy, and initial player count figures are expected to be high.</p>



<p>If you’re struggling to get on Hytale, here’s the latest on the game’s servers and potential issues.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-the-hytale-servers-working-right-now">Are The Hytale Servers Working Right Now?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As of January 13, the servers are working and operational, but it might take you some time to get into the game.</strong></p>



<p>Launch day for any new, hyped online game is always a wild one. Having the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/download-hytale-launcher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale Launcher</a> installed is one thing, but your place in the game’s servers rests entirely on Hypixel’s server’s shoulders.</p>



<p>It was never expected to be plain sailing on day one, and it will take time to iron out the kinks and see just how many people log in at first.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-access-hytale-servers">How To Access Hytale Servers</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quite simply, you need to be patient and wait for your chance to access the Hytale servers, as they are overloaded with players and likely working at, or beyond, capacity.</strong></p>



<p>Check for developer updates and comments on X. The <a href="https://x.com/Hytale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hytale X</a> page is a great source for new updates and announcements on the game, and you should also check founder <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Simon Collins-Laflamme</a>‘s X page, as they post regularly about the game.</p>



<p>You should also keep checking back with this Insider Gaming server status page, as it’ll be updated with new tweaks if there are any outages or significant changes to the game’s servers.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-can-t-i-download-the-lastest-update-or-patch">Why Can’t I Download The Lastest Update Or Patch?</h2>



<p><strong>Again, the reason you can’t download the latest patch is that the servers are overloaded, making it difficult for you to get the required space and memory to download the contents.</strong></p>



<p>Are you having any difficulties accessing the Hytale servers? Have you experienced any unusual error messages or login issues? Share your thoughts and scenarios through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, where you can communicate with other Hytale players to see if there are solutions to be discovered.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Duckov and Tarkov Collab Could Be Coming Soon]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-tarkov-collaboration-coming/</link>
            <guid>1404541</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Extraction shooter fans everywhere are preparing for a collaboration that writes itself. Recently, the Escape from <strong>Duckov </strong>team posted a cryptic image and message on social media talking about the game’s <strong>first </strong>collaboration event. The image was decoded quickly enough by fans, and it looks like <strong>Escape from Tarkov characters </strong>will be headed into the duck-themed extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Escape from Duckov was released in October 2025 and quickly sold millions of copies, soaring to a peak concurrent player count of 301,000 users on Steam. It’s a satirical, tongue-in-cheek stab at the unwelcoming extraction genre, and it parodies Escape from Tarkov, the hyper-challenging shooter, in multiple ways.</p>







<h2 id="h-are-tarkov-and-duckov-joining-forces">Are Tarkov and Duckov Joining Forces?</h2>



<p>In a recent post on social media, the Escape from Duckov folks from Bilibili and Team Soda posted an image showing one of the game’s duck-like characters studying a whiteboard.</p>



<p>On that whiteboard, we see two perfectly normal ducks turn into something threatening. One is wielding a large hammer and wearing an armored vest, while the other has rippling muscles and a large rifle.</p>



<p>The post was accompanied by a message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>【Two ……. interconnected memory …… bloodline …… exceptional combat …… instability.】</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is almost a direct reference to <strong>Tagilla </strong>and <strong>Killa</strong>, two of Escape from Tarkov’s most iconic boss characters. They’re brothers (interconnected memory and bloodline), and one has exceptional combat skills, while the other is somewhat unstable.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>【Two ……. interconnected memory …… bloodline …… exceptional combat …… instability.】</p><p>QUACK! 🦆 Our FIRST in-game collab is coming! Guess what will arrive in Duckov. </p><p>Comment with your prediction — a weapon, an object, a crossover character… anything​ — and get… <a href="https://t.co/oOD86cYMlX">pic.twitter.com/oOD86cYMlX</a></p></div>— Escape from Duckov (@GameDuckov) <a href="https://twitter.com/GameDuckov/status/2010653800777081200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The collaboration effectively writes itself, and it means we could see these two characters emerge in a game <strong>other than </strong>Escape from Tarkov for the first time.</p>



<p>On October 22, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, praised Escape from Duckov’s successful launch and one million copies sold in just a few days. Little did we know that would be a precursor for things to come (or potentially come, at least).</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Escape from Duckov has maintained a relatively solid player base on Steam, standing at around 11,000 peak players every day. Escape from Tarkov is primarily played via Battlestate’s proprietary launcher, so it’s hard to tell how many people are playing it, but 26,000 or so were playing at the time of writing <strong>on Steam alone</strong>.</p>







<p>Are you excited to see an Escape from Tarkov and Escape from Duckov collaboration? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you hope will happen.</p>

    <p><span>Character creation, Partners, combat, Formae, and more.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Bandai Namco Entertainment [6,821 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/bandai-namco-entertainment">Bandai Namco</a> has released a nine-minute overview trailer for <em><a title="Games > Code Vein II [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/code-vein-ii">Code Vein II</a></em>, which features a deep dive on character creation tools, Revenant combat, and an expanded look into the game’s various environments. <span id="more-1018887"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details, via Bandai Namco:</p><blockquote><p>The overview trailer spotlights key features that players will utilize to survive  the post-apocalyptic world in <em>Code Vein II</em>. Combat in the game has been expanded, introducing new depth and strategy through enhanced Drain Attacks, Formae, and the Partner System. Drain Attacks are offensive maneuvers used to extract Ichor, an essential resource that fuels the player’s most powerful abilities. Using this Ichor allows players to unleash powerful attacks called Formae, which includes Weapon Formae that modify attacks and grant buffs, Bequeathed Formae that summon unique weapons for devastating strikes, and Defensive Formae that offer critical blocks, counters, and evasive maneuvers. Jails are specialized artifacts worn on the player’s back and further shape combat by altering stats, modifying Drain Attacks, and providing tactical advantages based on the encounter. </p><p>The trailer also highlights the Restorative Offering, a mechanic where partners can restore the fallen Revenant Hunter with recovered health, though a cooldown leaves them temporarily incapacitated and unable to assist in battle. Newly added to the weapon roster, <em>Code Vein II</em> features the Twin Blades and Rune Blades, joining returning favorites such as the Bayonet, Halberd, Hammer, and Greatsword. These weapon types are supported by the expanded Blood Code system, which allows players to shape their combat style by unlocking and swapping between different Revenant power sets as they progress. Boosters allow players to unlock new key attributes and activate traits tied to Blood Codes and equipment, enabling players to create specialized playstyles.</p><p>Ahead of launch, players can dive into the <em>Code Vein II</em> Character Creator Demo starting on January 23, 2026. Offering 64 save slots that transfer directly into the final game, the Character Creator Demo allows players to experience the game’s deep customization system for the game’s protagonist Revenant Hunter, where players can customize their characters to great detail with a vast array of settings for body type, hairstyle, facial expressions, accessories, makeup and more. Players can also visit the hot spring at the MagMell Institute to view their character in different lighting environments and use Photo Mode to capture and save their creations.</p><p><em>Code Vein II</em> features a deep narrative where players and characters are bound by blood, fate, and destiny, set in a future where the last remnants of humanity and Revenants struggle against a world on the verge of collapse. The player’s journey will span across haunting, post-apocalyptic landscapes including the flooded ruins of the Sunken City, The Undead Forest, the Corroded Scar, the isolated MagMell Island, and more. As the story unfolds, players will encounter legendary heroes, Revenants whose destinies intertwine with the world’s survival. The game also features distinctive gameplay for an action RPG, where players use blood drained from enemies to unlock a variety of powerful skills, build strategy for combat with Blood codes, and use unique weapons and equipment called Jails to overcome challenging foes and epic bosses.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>When Mushy relogged onto her Animal Crossing: New Horizons island after years away, she expected the weeds, cockroaches, and angry villagers. She didn't expect a blast from the past when she checked in on her ex-partner's room, which was designed like a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1pxaxut/forgot_my_ex_made_his_home_into_a_jail_sell_over/" rel="nofollow ">jail cell.</a></p><p dir="ltr">"He had a weird sense of humor and once he saw that there were jail items in the game--jail bars, wallpaper, toilets-- he thought it would be hilarious to turn his island home into a jail cell," she told GameSpot. "I helped him gather the items too."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Animal Crossing: New Horizons – 3.0 Update and Switch 2 Edition Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">She hadn't remembered helping him after New Horizons launched in March 2020, but everything came rushing back when she logged on for the first time to prepare for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/animal-crossing-new-horizons-everything-new-in-update-3-0/2900-7399/" data-ref-id="2900-7399">3.0 update</a> coming on January 15.</p><p dir="ltr">"After a little roaming around I came upon my ex's old island home and I remembered how it was decorated. This was extra hilarious and ironic since a few months after our break up, he ended up in jail in real life and is still there to this day," Mushy said with a laugh. "So, all in all, my ex manifested his future in jail on my Animal Crossing island."</p><p dir="ltr">Animal Crossing: New Horizons doesn't reset when you stop playing. It doesn't erase past decisions or smooth over absences. Instead, it waits. Returning years later means confronting creative choices, emotional baggage, and memories left exactly where they were. As players log back in ahead of the January 15 update, many are realizing their islands have been holding onto more than furniture layouts.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4633819-forgot-my-ex-made-his-home-into-a-jail-sell-over-3-years-v0-hv08qz8jst9g1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4633819" data-ratio="0.56203703703704" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4633819-forgot-my-ex-made-his-home-into-a-jail-sell-over-3-years-v0-hv08qz8jst9g1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4633819"></a><figcaption>Mushy hadn't visited her island in 3 years and 7 months | Credit: Mushy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4633819-forgot-my-ex-made-his-home-into-a-jail-sell-over-3-years-v0-hv08qz8jst9g1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Players who stepped away years ago are reopening save files and running headfirst into the past. They're pulling weeds and repairing relationships with villagers, but they're also revisiting islands built during the pandemic and the years that followed. These spaces function as digital time capsules, preserving routines and aesthetics from a period when Animal Crossing felt essential.</p><p dir="ltr">For many players, Animal Crossing wasn't just a game during 2020 and 2021--it was a coping mechanism as the COVID-19 pandemic raged. Islands were structured around daily check-ins, online meetups, and familiar rituals when the outside world felt unstable. Logging back in now means rediscovering those habits without the context that made them necessary. Bulletin boards still display old messages. Homes remain decorated for long-passed events. Villagers comment on absences measured in years.</p><p dir="ltr">Animal Crossing makes time visible in a way few games do. Villagers acknowledge your absence. Weeds accumulate. Neglect leaves a mark. That design choice turns returning into something more personal than simple nostalgia. It's not just about remembering how things were--it's about seeing proof that time moved forward without you.</p><p dir="ltr">At the same time, Animal Crossing: New Horizons never truly went dormant. A dedicated community has continued to play daily, decorating seasonally and maintaining relationships with villagers they've known for years. For those players, the January update isn't a return--it's just the next step.</p><p dir="ltr">That divide became especially visible at the start of 2026. While some players were reopening old islands, others rang in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-years-eve-games/2900-7374/" data-ref-id="2900-7374">new year</a> standing in their town square, counting down the final seconds with their villagers. Screenshots of midnight celebrations spread online, showing islands that never stopped evolving. For these players, Animal Crossing remains part of their daily routine.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4633885-unnamed%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4633885" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4633885-unnamed%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4633885"></a><figcaption>Players are revisiting their custom landmarks</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4633885-unnamed%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The upcoming update has brought both groups back into the same conversation. Lapsed players are cautiously reopening save files. Everyday players are preparing their islands for new content. Both are engaging with the game from very different emotional places, shaped by how long they've been away.</p><p dir="ltr">For some, returning has been especially difficult. Over the years, players have used Animal Crossing to build <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-players-are-remembering-loved-ones-in-game/1100-6482592/">memorials</a>, preserve important moments, and create <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/letters-and-flowers-how-games-memorialize-loved-on/1100-6473761/#comments-block-33482638">spaces tied to people they've lost</a>. Revisiting those areas ahead of the update has been both painful and meaningful. Gardens remain untouched. Homes stay frozen in time. The game offers no prompt to move on--only the option to continue.</p><p dir="ltr">That's what makes this wave of returns feel significant. Animal Crossing isn't just drawing players back with new features, and these islands aren't just neglected towns--they're records of who players were when they last logged off.</p><p dir="ltr">As January 15 approaches, players are reopening digital spaces filled with memory, grief, comfort, and growth. And in doing so, they're discovering that Animal Crossing didn't just wait for them to come back--it remembered everything.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Resident Evil Requiem is easily one of the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/video-podcast/2026/01/09/drafting-our-most-anticipated-games-of-2026-the-game-informer-show" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="76ac02fb-38b3-4fdf-8dc3-0df0a2bcbf85" data-entity-substitution="canonical">most anticipated video games of the year</a>, and luckily, its February release is right around the corner. While a big Game Awards trailer <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/leon-kennedy-takes-the-stage-in-resident-evil-requiem">finally confirmed the rumors that Leon S. Kennedy would be playable</a>, there's still plenty fans don't know about this game. We'll be getting some more news soon, however, as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/residentevil.capcomusa.com/post/3mcbhyqjx3s2l">Capcom has just announced</a> a Resident Evil showcase for later this week, January 15, at 2 PM PT/ 5 PM ET.</p><p>The stream will be available on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/capcomusa">Capcom's Twitch channel</a>. You can also view a short teaser for the event below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VXQveAdzC74"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VXQveAdzC74" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Tune in on January 15 at 2pm PT / 10pm GMT for the Resident Evil Showcase and be one of the first to see brand new gameplay and news for Resident Evil Requiem," the YouTube description for the trailer reads. Capcom's website also reveals that the stream will be <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/twelve-minutes/twelve-minutes-review-stuck-in-hell">12 minutes</a> long. The event is technically just called "Resident Evil Showcase," implying there might be room for non-Requiem related announcements, but 12 minutes doesn't quite feel like enough time to cover multiple games. We'll know for sure when the showcase airs this Thursday.</p><p>For more Requiem, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/12/resident-evil-requiem-devs-say-grace-and-leons-sections-are-almost-equally-split-detail">read about how protagonists Leon and Grace share the spotlight</a>, check out our <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/27/capcom-doesnt-think-of-resident-evil-7-8-and-9-as-a-trilogy">interview with the developers at Gamescom</a>, and then see what we thought about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/06/11/back-to-raccoon-city">how the game feels to play</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/13/capcom-sets-resident-evil-requiem-showcase-for-thursday]]></content:encoded>
