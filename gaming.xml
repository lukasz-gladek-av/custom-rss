		<p>The indie hit horror game, The Mortuary Assistant, is coming to console with the expanded and enhanced Definitive Edition release.</p>
<p>The Mortuary Assistant – Definitive Edition will be available across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch on 2nd August 2024. It will also be a free update for the PC version of the game.</p>

<p>Launching for PC in 2022, The Mortuary Assistant gained a quick following for all its spooky, haunted vibes – this always goes down well with Twitch streamers.</p>
<p>The game puts you in the role of Rebecca Owens, a graduate in mortuary sciences and new apprentice at River Fields Mortuary, but as if having to work with corpses wasn’t already eerie and unsettling enough, it quickly becomes clear that the mortuary is afflicted by an otherworldly spirit or creature. A phone call from the mortician themself makes it clear that you’re now trapped inside and cannot leave.</p>

<p>There’s a bunch of new features and content for the Definitive Edition, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embalming only mode – embalm unlimited bodies</li>
<li>New Haunt Events</li>
<li>Additional Lore</li>
<li>New bodies to embalm</li>
<li>New Valentine’s Day seasonal event (Stop by the mortuary in February)</li>
<li>New achievements</li>
<li>Multiple Bug and Stability Fixes</li>
<li>Performance Improvements</li>
</ul>

            <p>
Atlus has released an official Persona 5 coffee line, so you can set up your own iconic Café Leblanc.
</p>
<p>
In collaboration with Jade City Foods, the coffee line includes three different roasts: the Café Leblanc dark roast, Phantom Thieves of Hearts medium roast, or Shujin Academy light roast.
</p>
<p>
The dark roast offers chocolate and caramel notes, the medium roast has fruity acidity, and the light roast has a cherry and chocolate flavour. All are available as whole beans or ground.

<p>

Café Leblanc serves as the base of operations for Persona 5's cast of Phantom Thieves, where the protagonist (Joker) can whip up a brew. It's well known for boosting your SP.
</p>
<p>
The café is also known for its curry, so it's fitting that Atlus is also releasing a line of hot sauces alongside the coffee.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
These sauces are - suitably - named after the game's fire spells (Agi, Agilao, Agidyne) as well as the characters Joker, Violet, and Crow. Flavours range from roasted jalapeno, to scotch bonnet, and reaper. 
</p>
<p>
Just be careful with those. As my mother always says, "a tickle on the tongue means a tingle on the bum".
</p>
<p>
All items are available on the <a href="https://jadecityfoods.com/">Jade City Foods website</a>: £15 per sauce, or £16 for a bag of coffee. It's US based but shipping is international. There are also bundles available for multiple items.

</p>
<p>
And if Persona 5 isn't your thing, there are other foods available based on the likes of Naruto, Cuphead, and Ghost in the Shell too.
</p>
<p>
Atlus itself is busy working on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-3-reload-episode-aigis-the-answer-will-release-in-september">Persona 3 DLC Episode Aigis</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atlus-gives-us-a-peek-at-rpg-metaphor-refantazios-story">forthcoming new RPG Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>.

            <p>The Mortuary Assistant is finally coming to all consoles on 2nd August, 2024 – two years to the day the influential indie horror hit PC.</p>
<p>Called The Definitive Edition, the base game has been spruced up to include new haunts, bodies, embalming-only mode, and numerous stability and bug fixes.</p>

<p>In The Mortuary Assistant, you take on the role of Rebecca Owens, a newly graduated apprentice at River Fields Mortuary – but the job is not quite what it seems.</p>
<p>"Late one night you are called in to handle some embalmings," developer DreadXP teases. "When the Mortician, Raymond, calls the mortuary when you arrive, you soon realise this is a night like none other, and there’s no escape from the demonic forces plaguing the mortuary."</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-mortuary-assistant-is-getting-a-companion-piece-movie-adaptation">The Mortuary Assistant is getting the silver screen treatment</a>.</p>
<p>The indie horror - which has been a huge hit since it launched in August 2022 - was reportedly plucked for an adaptation before the full game released earlier this month.</p>
<p>Director Jeremiah Kipp says the film will be a "companion piece" to the game, and Kipp hopes to "retain the minimalist setting in and around the mortuary, the fascination with the process of embalming, and the nerve-shredding terror of the gameplay".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-hammerfell-setting/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Very little is currently known about The Elder Scrolls VI, but some recent findings may have provided a rather solid hint regarding the game's setting.</p>
<p>As spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TESVI/comments/1e6fxao/bethesda_employees_pinterest_account_is_still/#lightbox">Reddit</a> by nitsuaztnarf, an active Pinterest account from a Bethesda Game Studios employee contains a lot of pins for concepts for the upcoming new entry in the series. Judging from these pins, it definitely feels like the game will be set in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-hammerfell-targeting-2025/">Hammerfell</a>, a vast province located in the west of Tamriel, covered by jungles, wooded mountain ranges, subtropical grasslands, swamps, and deserts.</p>
<p>While this could have been a whole lot of nothing, what makes this The Elder Scrolls VI-related finding interesting is how the profile has been mostly pinning fantasy-related images and concepts since the release of Starfield, indicating these have been indeed pinned for the new entry in the series, and the fact that the profile was set to private a few hours after it was shared on Reddit, an attempt to hide something that wasn't supposed to be discovered.</p>
<p>Very little is known about The Elder Scrolls VI. The game was announced in 2018 together with Starfield, but it is still at least <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-five-years-away/">five years away</a>. According to Todd Howard, it will be the<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-ultimate-fantasy/"> ultimate fantasy world simulator</a>, so it should be a big step forward compared to its predecessor.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls VI is currently in development. A release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>

<p>The highly anticipated Pirates of the Caribbean collaboration in Fortnite, which was launched <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-pirates-of-the-caribbean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier than expected</a>, is now officially underway. Players will receive the v30.20 hotfix for Fortnite today, introducing the content of the Cursed Sails event.

<h2 id="h-cursed-sails-quests-and-event-pass">Cursed Sails Quests and Event Pass</h2>



<p>Fortnite players will obtain Cursed Sails Quests, which they must complete to earn rewards in the Cursed Sails Pass. Completing Cursed Sails quests will fetch players Cursed Gold. The quests have been divided into eight parts and will go live on alternate days between now and August 2.

<p>Players will also observe some changes on Fortnite Island during the Cursed Sails event. A new mythic weapon called Ship in a Bottle can be found around Shipwreck Shallows’ pirate ship. Players can open the bottle to summon a cursed ship that can ram through opponents, builds, and the environment. Additionally, Pirate Cannons, the Flint Knock Pistol and other treasures have been unvaulted and can be found across the BR island.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>

<!-- cache hit 92:single/related:87963907aecae3bbb7e1b88b4075e717 --><!-- empty -->
<p>The FTC says the across-the-board price increases that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/microsoft-asks-many-game-pass-subscribers-to-pay-more-for-less/">Microsoft recently announced</a> for its Xbox Game Pass subscription service tiers represent "exactly the sort of consumer harm from the merger the FTC has alleged" when it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/report-ftc-will-file-to-block-microsofts-69b-activision-blizzard-acquisition/">sought to block Microsoft's merger with Activision</a>. In <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453.121.0_1.pdf">a letter to the court</a> posted as part of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/ftc-appeal-in-microsoft-activision-case-shows-us-regulator-isnt-giving-up-yet/">an ongoing appeal by the FTC</a> in the case, the federal regulator alleges Microsoft's moves are a clear example of "product degradation" brought about by "a firm exercising market power post-merger."
</p><p>The letter's primary focus is on the soon-to-be-discontinued $10.99/month Console Game Pass tier. That's being replaced with a $14.99/month Game Pass Standard tier (a 36 percent price increase) that no longer includes "day one" access to all of Microsoft's first-party titles. To maintain that key benefit, "Console" subscribers will have to spend 81 percent more for the $19.99 Game Pass Ultimate tier, which also includes a number of additional benefits over the current $10.99/month option.</p>
<h2>Is this “based on the acquisition”?</h2>
<p>The FTC notes that these changes "coincide with adding <em>Call of Duty</em> to Game Pass’s most expensive tier." Previously, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/sony-calls-microsofts-3-year-call-of-duty-sharing-offer-inadequate/">Microsoft publicly promised</a> that this Game Pass access to Activision's ultra-popular shooter would come "with no price increase for the service based on the acquisition."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>It's that "based on the acquisition" clause that's likely to give Microsoft some wiggle room in arguing for its planned pricing changes. Inflation is also a sufficient explanation for a large portion of the price increase in nominal terms—the $14.99 Microsoft charged for a month of Game Pass Ultimate <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18296816/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscription-pricing-release-date-rumors">when it launched in 2019</a> is the equivalent of $18.39 today, according to <a href="https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=14.99&amp;year1=201906&amp;year2=202406">the BLS CPI calculator</a>. When Microsoft raised the Game Pass Ultimate monthly price from $14.99 to $16.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23768400/microsoft-xbox-series-x-xbox-game-pass-price-increase">just last year</a>—just before the Activision merger was finalized—the company said in a statement it had "adjusted the prices to reflect the competitive conditions in each market."</p>
<p>Microsoft might have a harder time finessing the alleged "degradation" inherent in going from the discontinued Game Pass Console tier to the new, more expensive Game Pass Standard tier. True, the replacement does include the online multiplayer benefits of Game Pass Core, which could previously be purchased separately. But the removal of the long-promised day one access to first party games will heavily reduce the value most subscribers get from the new option.</p>
<p>It's now been over a year since the FTC <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/ftc-appeal-in-microsoft-activision-case-shows-us-regulator-isnt-giving-up-yet/">first announced it intended to appeal</a> the ruling that effectively stopped <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/report-ftc-will-file-to-block-microsofts-69b-activision-blizzard-acquisition/">its attempted injunction</a> against the merger deal. While Microsoft and Activision have moved forward with their merger since then, courts <a href="https://www.crowell.com/en/insights/client-alerts/ftc-wins-reversal-in-whole-foods">have reversed similar mergers on appeal</a> even after a merger deal has fully closed.
</p><p>Elsewhere in its letter, the FTC makes note of previous arguments that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/microsoft-cancels-blizzard-survival-game-lays-off-1900/">Microsoft's recent round of nearly 2,000 Xbox-focused layoffs</a> is a sign of "reduced investments in output and product quality" post-merger.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has announced the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> Grand Festival, a final Splatfest for their ink-splatting online shooter that will take place in September and run for an extended 72-hour period.</p>
<p><iframe title="Splatoon 3 – Grand Festival is coming! (Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TAZohLilNjM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Beginning on 13th September and running for three straight days:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start date &amp; time</strong> – Friday 13th September 1AM UK time</li>
<li><strong>End date &amp; time</strong> – Monday 16th September 00:59AM UK time</li>
</ul>
<p>The Grand Festival is the biggest ever Splatfest that the series has featured, and from the announcement trailer, it absolutely leans into that with a grand music festival taking place with all the music acts from the series to date dancing and singing on stage to a huge crowd.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s really all about the battling, and the three-way question that the Grand Festival will ask is: What is the most important to you? Past, Present or Future?</p>

<p>In a twist to the usual Splatfest questions, it’s the idol groups that will represent the three themes. The past is the Squid Sisters, the present is Off the Hook, and the future is Deep Cut.</p>
<p>The deep suspicion is that, as with the final Splatfest for Splatoon 2, the community-driven answer to this question will determine the future of the series. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/09/splatoon-2-final-splatfest-july-order-chaos/">Splatoon 2’s finale asked players to choose between order and chaos</a>, and with chaos winning, Splatoon 3 moved the story to a rather desolate new location of Splatsville, AKA the “City of Chaos”. If past or future win, we could see a potential Splatoon 4 go in some really wild new directions.</p>
<p>To mark the moment, Nintendo is also releasing <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1814212474263994518">two new sets of Splatoon amiibo</a> on 5th September: the Side Order Set featuring Pearl &amp; Marina, and the Alterna Set with recoloured Callie &amp; Marie.</p>
<p>It will be bittersweet to say goodbye to these regular events for the Splatoon community, and I admittedly regret not playing enough of the game in the past couple years, as good as the game is.&nbsp;For our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/07/splatoon-3-review/">Splatoon 3 review</a>, I wrote: “Splatoon 3 is a bit like your mum making your favourite meal when you head home for the holidays. It’s been a few years since the last game —&nbsp;while there have been some great improvements and additions, it’s the same old Splatoon we know and love, and that’s still pretty great.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-24-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.4 release date, along with some of the new content that's coming your way when the turn-based gacha RPG's latest update drops.</p>
<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-23-release-date">June's Version 2.3</a>, Version 2.4 arrives on July 31st, bringing with it a new map in the form of The Shackling Prison, along with the chance to recruit two new five-star characters into your team.</p>
<p>The Shackling Prison is a "formidable facility" whose entrance lies hidden beneath the water's surface. It's where Xueyi and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-reveals-new-playable-character-hanya">Hanya</a> carry out their duties, and it's also the home of many of the realm's most notorious criminals, not to mention wolflike monsters known as the Borisin.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.4-release-date-the-shackling-prison.jpg?itok=m-B9shGl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.4-release-date-the-shackling-prison.jpg?itok=OnygzUoH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Shackling Prison is home to some of&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>'s most notorious criminals, and you'll get to explore it in Version 2.4.</figcaption></figure><p>Two new characters are also making their debut in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.4, and they're both five-star characters, too.</p>
<p>First up is Yunli, a Physical-type swordswoman who follows the Path of Destruction. Her Counter ability allows her to deal damage to enemies when she's attacked, and she also gains access to a Parry state after using her ultimate, taunting enemies and reducing the damage she takes.</p>
<p>The second new character in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.4 is Jiaoqiu, a Fire-type foxian healer following the Path of Nihility. His attacks have a chance to burn enemies, and his ultimate exacerbates the effects of his regular attacks' burn.</p>
<p>These characters will debut during this Version, alongside reruns for five-star characters <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-introduces-new-five-star-character-huohuo">Huohuo</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-introduces-new-character-sparkle-and-she-goes-from-cute-to-crazy">Sparkle</a>.</p>

<p>HoYoverse has also announced a collaboration with the anime&nbsp;<em>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works</em>, which is due to debut some time in the third quarter of 2025.</p>
<p>Sadly, we don't know the details of that collaboration yet, but HoYoverse says more will be revealed in the coming weeks, so watch this space.</p>
<p>In the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.4 arrives on July 31st across <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

The offer is available now and runs through July 28 for the action-adventure game.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a few caveats, however. On <a href="https://register.ubisoft.com/afop-trial/en-US?_gl=1*i0a86z*_gcl_au*MTEyOTA3NjYyMC4xNzIxMzk2ODY2*_ga*MTc5OTgwMzQ2Mi4xNzIxMzk2ODY4*_ga_C4N5020N2R*MTcyMTM5Njg2Ny4xLjEuMTcyMTM5Njg5Ni4zMS4wLjA." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Ubisoft blog post</a>, it's noted that the Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora free trial will last either five hours for players or until they "reach Hometree in 'The Aranahe Clan' main quest." Additionally, only single-player functionality is part of this offer, meaning co-op isn't available. An online connection is a requirement, as well.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Progress made in the free trial will carry over for people who decide to purchase Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Ubisoft is sweetening this transition by offering up to 50% off the game, though double-check that price and edition before buying.</p><p dir="ltr">Another reason for the free trial is because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-sky-breaker-dlc-continues-the-story-in-july/1100-6524137/" data-ref-id="1100-6524137">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora just received The Skybreaker DLC</a> earlier this week, which picks up the story from the end of the base game.

                <p>Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> is set for release in 2025, and given how massive the game's launch is expected to be, many are wondering how it could affect titles from competing companies. Ubisoft, for its part, has said it's looking forward to GTA VI's release because when a game as big as GTA VI comes out, it helps the market overall.</p><p>"What we see, generally, when GTA is coming, is that more people come to play. So generally it's positive on the overall market," CEO Yves Guillemot <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/atyzrozr/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said during Ubisoft's latest earnings call</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Guillemot went on to say that historical trends for Ubisoft's business bear this out. He said Ubisoft's games enjoyed "very good sales" around the time that GTA V came out in 2013, while its titles also performed well when the GTA V re-release for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S launched in March 2022.</p><p>"It is something that is counter-intuitive but is working for us in general," Guillemot said.</p><p>The company went on to say that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/" data-ref-id="5000-172624">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a>, which was released a month after GTA V in 2013, enjoyed record sales for the series at the time. Ubisoft's overall philosophy is to focus on delivering high-quality game experiences even when the competition is strong, the company said.</p><p>Ubisoft has not, however, announced its full game release pipeline for 2025, so it's too soon to say what Ubisoft game might be competing with GTA VI. The game is set for release during Fall 2025, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">every Rockstar game in the past decade has been delayed</a> so there is a chance this happens again with GTA VI.</p>

		<p>Mr. Blue Sky is out and about as we head into the weekend, so I’ve got fans pushing air around to try and keep the house cool enough to consider making more heat with consoles and PC gaming. Thankfully I’m not playing the most graphically intensive games, continuing on with SteamWorld Heist 2 and dabbling with a few other things that you’ll hear about soon…</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> reported in first to say that he’s played a pretty smorgasbord of The Lord of the Rings The Third Age, Neverwinter Nights 2, Mount and Blade: Bannerlord, and The Last of Us Part 2. That’s a lot of fantasy and gritty battling!</p>

<p>Even more varied and in very different ways was <strong>Aran’s</strong> week, which featured a preview for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/ea-sports-fc-25-preview-what-a-rush/">EA Sports FC 25</a>, which is “more of the same, but Rush is fantastic”, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/tmnt-splintered-fate-review-nintendo-switch/">TMNT: Splintered Fate</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/19/rack-and-slay-review/">Rack and Slay</a> for review – a decent Hades clone and a billiards-bashing roguelike respectively. For his own enjoyment, he bored himself with The Turing Test, continued picking up collectibles in AC Mirage, and has started to replay&nbsp;Enslaved Odyssey to The West, “which is just as good as I remember.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> beat Skyrim for the very first time, after more than a decade of varying attempts, but he’s tempted to go back in to complete some of the side quests. That’s bumped Cyberpunk 2077 to the top of his playlist, where he’s kept chipping away at the story, and in search of something different to play on Steam Deck, he’s started Dragon Quest XI and is eyeing up Fallout: New Vegas.</p>


<p>It was the “excellent but traumatic” Conscript for <strong>Steve</strong>, a survival horror game where surviving is just as horrific as not. He countered that with the review of the bitesized speedrunning delights of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/nintendo-world-championship-nes-edition-review/">Nintendo World Championship: NES Edition</a>. He also had his Retroid Pocket out to play the “underrated” Breath of Fire series, and is preparing to play Flintlock off Game Pass.</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2, of course, but he’s also been reviewing Thank Goodness You’re Here!, which you’ll hear more about later this month, and stomping deeper into RoboCop: Rogue City – “It’s <em>exactly</em> what a RoboCop game should be like. It’s slow, clunky, and plays like something from the 80’s, but also makes you feel like RoboCop with his thundering pistol that literally minces punks.”</p>

<p><strong>Reu</strong> has been rampaging through everything that Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail to wrap up our review of the game, which you’ll get to see very soon, and we’ll rounding things out with <strong>Dom</strong> for this week. He’s been a busy little bee jumping between shadows for our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/15/schim-review/">SCHiM</a> review, as well as working towards reviews of Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, which he’s been playing quite “merrily” and Hot Lap Racing.</p>
<p>And with that, what have you been playing this week?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-45-parabellum-bloodhound-trailer-shows-off-va-11-hall-a-devs-new-game.931836/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-45-parabellum-bloodhound-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>VA-11 Hall-A&nbsp;</em>developer Sukeban Games has released the debut trailer for its newest project&nbsp;<em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound</em>, and it looks exactly as strange and wonderful as you'd expect.</p>
<p><em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound&nbsp;</em>was first unveiled by Sukeban Games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/45-parabellum-bloodhound-sukeban-games">earlier this month</a>, with the developer unveiling the project alongside a host of GIFs and images showing off its aesthetic.</p>
<p>Now, however, the first trailer for the game has been revealed, giving us a glimpse of a game that looks like it's inspired not only by Square Enix's classic survival horror-RPG&nbsp;<em>Parasite Eve</em>, but also by Suda51's cult hit&nbsp;<em>Killer7</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/45-parabellum-bloodhound-trailer-slums.jpg?itok=V9-i_JST 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/45-parabellum-bloodhound-trailer-slums.jpg?itok=apEKW_o3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound&nbsp;</em>has those immaculate PS1 vibes.</figcaption></figure><p>The new trailer shows a game with stylish PS1-style graphics and an art style reminiscent of an edgy '90s anime (in the best possible way, of course).</p>
<p>We also get to see a glimpse of the combat, which, in keeping with the game's "Active Time Action" tagline, seems heavily inspired by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Parasite Eve&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Vagrant Story</em>.</p>
<p>It's all soundtracked by music that put me in mind of the likes of&nbsp;<em>El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron</em>, or perhaps the work of&nbsp;<em>NieR</em>'s Keiichi Okabe. In short, this is one you're going to want to play if, like me, you're unashamedly and constantly drowning in PS1 nostalgia.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the&nbsp;debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound&nbsp;</em>below. If it doesn't make you want to play the game, just watch it again until it does!</p>

<p>Sadly, we don't have any kind of release date or window for&nbsp;<em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound</em>; back when it was announced, Sukeban said it would be finished when it was ready, so it might be a while before we get to play this one.</p>
<p>It's also the project on which Sukeban has chosen to focus its energies, which means that&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/n1rv-ann-release-date-delayed-indefinitely"><em>N1RV Ann-A&nbsp;</em>release date you've been waiting for</a> is probably not going to materialize anytime soon, either.</p>
<p>We'll bring you more on this one as soon as we get it. In the meantime, you can wishlist&nbsp;<em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014650/45_PARABELLUM_BLOODHOUND__Cyberpunk_Active_Time_Action/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on Steam</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/flintlock-siege-of-dawn-review">Edwin’s been appreciating</a> the acrobatic twist that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn">Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</a> puts on the Soulslite formula, but not everybody’s magical zip-zooping has been going as smoothly. Following the Steam and PC Game Pass releases yesterday, there are widespread reports of heavy stuttering spoiling the fun; I’ve given both versions a test, and indeed, Flintlock does have a serious case of the framerate stammers. Especially the Game Pass build, which is <em>significantly</em> worse for it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Steam version sees occasional hitching, usually when you and your god-fox mate enter a new area for the first time. Classic shader compilation stutter, looks like. On Game Pass, though, performance can also hiccup on attacks, dodges, and double-jumps, more keenly impacting the game’s flow. That’s all on an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-review">RTX 4060</a> with the game running at 1080p, by the by, so well above Flintlock’s recommended settings.</p>
<p>What’s to be done? A <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1832040/discussions/0/4518882879955578724/">pinned thread</a> on the game’s Steam forums suggest any of three remedies: disabling Nvidia Reflex, updating your graphics drivers, and "selecting different Super Sampling options", these being upscalers like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/confirmed-ray-tracing-and-dlss-games">DLSS</a>. The latter will raise average framerates versus native-rez rendering, which might at least hide the stutters a bit better, though I was playing on the very latest GeForce drivers and was still stuttering on an all-too-regular basis. Of the three fixes, the one I had the most unqualified success with was disabling Nvidia Reflex, meaning Flintlock gets to join <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a> in the Games That Allow Input Latency Reducers To Hurt Performance Somehow club. Hopefully the former can find a fix <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/latest-horizon-forbidden-west-pc-patch-finally-fixes-its-weirdest-issue">like the latter did</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>Also – and this is just from my own testing on a single GPU, so your results may vary – I found that reducing Shadow Quality can both soothe the stuttering and deliver a huge boost to performance in general. Starting with Ultra quality, my PC was averaging 55-60fps in most areas, which lept to a mostly wobble-free 90-100fps with shadows on Medium. Consider giving that a go, before cutting back on upscaling quality.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not a new problem, even for Flintlock specifically – the action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>’s June demo was prone to shuddering as well. And as for why the Game Pass version performs worse than Steam’s, this is at least partly explained by the fact that they are literally different versions, owing to Microsoft’s policy of forcing all games available on the Xbox app to go through their own certification process. This can hold up performance patches, and in extreme cases even lead to PC games lacking entire features in their Game Pass build – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> being a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-update-fixes-blackscreen-and-controller-bugs-but-multiplayer-issues-persist-on-game-pass">recent, though no less silly, example</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2024/07/19/paramount-cancels-halo-series-after-two-seasons<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Paramount has canceled <em>Halo</em>, the live-action TV adaptation of Xbox’s flagship franchise, after two seasons. The show’s second season premiered on Paramount+ earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/halo-canceled-paramount-plus-2-seasons-1235952581/">The Hollywood Reporter</a></em>’s sources, <em>Halo</em> showrunners Amblin, Xbox, and 343 Industries are seeking a new outlet for a potential third season, with Paramount reportedly supporting the move.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Paramount+ can confirm that ‘Halo’ will not move forward with a third season on the service,” Paramount said in a statement. “We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work. We wish everyone the best going forward.”</p>

<p>After years of development, <em>Halo</em> premiered on Paramount+ on March 24, 2022, and stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief. Season 1 received a mixed reception from critics and fans, with many lambasting it for deviating from the games’ established lore and characterizations. Season 2, which premiered earlier this year on February 8 and concluded on March 21, was received more positively, with several critics and viewers hailing it as a dramatic improvement. Season 1 currently sits at 70% on Rotten Tomatoes/61 on Metacritic. Season 2 garnered a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes/64 on Metacritic.&nbsp;</p>

Instead, they’ve served primarily as support characters for the male narrative. So Sabrina’s episode is the one I’ve been waiting for, as it brings her superpowered struggles into the spotlight. And it turns out she does what many of us would do, especially as a healthcare worker—she consults a physician to check on her brain.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h4"><a id=""></a>A powerful narrative for Sabrina—almost</h2><p>Sabrina’s powers—being able to push and move objects, or telekinetic abilities— often manifest in anger. While the narrative of Black women being socially unable to express anger is an important one to explore in a superhero narrative, it’s frustrating to see that Sabrina’s powers and related anxiety also make her careless and spaced out. It’s annoying to see that trope as a big part of the powers and the narrative of the only main non-male character.</p><h2 id="h5"><a id=""></a>Dionne: Not in charge of her own destiny</h2><p>The episode also centers women more as it follows Dionne (Adelayo Adedayo) on her workday, away from Michael (Tosin Cole). In her role as a social worker, Dionne connects more threads between superhuman people as she discovers information about a missing woman who wasn’t acting human.<br></p><p>However, as Dionne continues her investigation and fills Michael in, he dismisses her and argues with her for being involved, all while refusing to fill her in on the real reason for his concern and anger: that he’s seen her gravestone. He refuses to give Dionne agency in her own survival, and that makes our golden boy superhero entirely less appealing. It’s hard to root for him if you’re viewing the show through a feminist lens.</p><h2 id="h6"><a id=""></a>Cliffhanger resolved</h2><p>The second episode, which focused on Tazer (Josh Tedeku), ended on a cliffhanger with an imminent threat of violence. The third episode shows the resolution of this scene, with a maze of surprises. This makes the story feel more connected and less episodic, which is increasingly important as Michael uses his time-traveling powers more often. The tighter narrative allows Michael’s disorienting and disruptive powers to enhance the story rather than make it more confusing.</p><h2 id="h7"><a id=""></a>Acceleration and more “random” encounters</h2><p>Michael’s powers also accelerate the narrative of the story, and we experience his confusion whenever he tries to figure out how far ahead he’s jumped. </p><p>As the show goes on, we see the characters have near-misses with each other, then interact more and more directly each episode. In episode 2, we see Andre (Eric Kofi Abrefa) assist Sabrina in an absent-minded moment that could have been fatal. These increasingly tighter connections show how interwoven the characters’ survival, safety—and possibly powers—may be.<br></p><p>Additionally, the increased presence of villain Krazy (Ghetts) moves Sabrina into protective mode, and makes the overall level of violence escalate. The villain exists to further tie the characters’ stories together.<br></p><h2 id="h8"><a id=""></a>Lack of control: powers at will</h2><p>One theme <em>Supacell </em>has explored since the first episode is the characters’ agency over their powers. Some characters, in some instances, can control their powers at will. Other times, those powers seem to work randomly, when they’re near another character more, or as the result of an emotional reaction.</p><p>This lack of control or agency in using the powers they’re given reflects the racial and socio-economic concerns all of the characters discussed in the first episode. In this way, show creator and executive producer Rapman makes a powerful statement about stratification in England and in general.</p><h2 id="h9"><a id=""></a>Sickle cell comes back into focus</h2><p>After the sickle cell plot thread disappeared in episode two, it returns in this installment. Michael again assists his mother at the sickle cell clinic, and Andre speaks with his son AJ (Ky-Mani Carty) about the disease as well. This again draws the connection between the name of the show and the disease, which primarily affects Black people, as AJ points out.</p><p>This confirms the connection between the characters as being genetic, though the show name also reinforces how the characters need to rely on each other for their survival, a message about Black community. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-1896-gets-esrb-rating-possibly-for-next-gen-upgrade/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-1896-gets-esrb-rating-possibly-for-next-gen-upgrade/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>On the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39965/hunt-showdown-1896/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB website</a>, Hunt: Showdown 1896 from Crytek now has an official M Rating for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series platforms.</p>



<p>The rating describes Hunt: Showdown 1896 as “a first-person monster hunting game set in a fantastical version of the Victorian era.” </p>



<p>The ESRB update is likely referring to the impending <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-ps4-xbox-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free update to Hunt: Showdown</a>, rather than a new sequel title. In a <a href="https://press.crytek.com/hunt-showdown-reveals-upgrade-coming-15th-august-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, Crytek previously announced the upgrade is coming August 15, 2024.</p>



<p>This timeline would line up with the new ESRB rating, despite the “1896” addition to the title. But it does imply the next-gen update still appears to be on schedule. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Crytek originally launched Hunt: Showdown in August 2019, an open world shooter that earned ‘Very Positive’ Steam reviews early on. It seemed to be part of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/age-of-the-extraction-shooter-approaching/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surge of extraction-style shooters</a>, with over a dozen under way.</p>



<p>Following the next-gen update, Hunt: Showdown will not operate on the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One. Crytek confirmed the update will offer a “new map, CRYENGINE version 5.11, performance improvements,” a new UX design, and more.</p>



<p>Most recently, Crytek released From the Wilds DLC for Hunt: Showdown on June 27, 2024. The DLC still has ‘Mostly Negative’ reviews from fans, though likely due to widespread reports of technical issues. It added new Hunter variations, weapons, and more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splatoon-3-grand-festival-could-be-the-games-last-big-event.931791/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-grand-festival<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>Grand Festival, a three-day event that's set to be the online shooter's "biggest Splatfest yet". It could also mark the final major event for&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3</em>, if&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 2&nbsp;</em>is anything to go by.</p>
<p>As with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-pokemon-splatfest-kicks-off-next-month">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>Splatfest <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-zelda-splatfest-ink-coming-ahead-of-tears-of-kingdom-launch">events</a>, the Grand Festival will ask you to choose between one of three teams and to duke it out with the others to decide which team is superior. In this case, you're choosing between Past, Present, and Future.</p>
<p>This time around, however, there's a little twist: the teams are represented by some of&nbsp;<em>Splatoon</em>'s most iconic characters in the form of the Squid Sisters, Deep Cut, and Off the Hook.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splatoon-3-grand-festival-splatfest-past-present-future.jpeg?itok=yyt-B1fc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splatoon-3-grand-festival-splatfest-past-present-future.jpeg?itok=7pbXjXKv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Get ready to choose your side in the new&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>Splatfest.</figcaption></figure><p>While Nintendo certainly hasn't given any indication that this will be the final&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>event, past form might lead us to believe that it could be.</p>
<p><em>Splatoon 2&nbsp;</em>was released in July 2017, and its final Splatfest (barring a few reruns of older Splatfest events) took place in July 2019.</p>
<p>The timing doesn't quite line up as well for&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3</em>, since the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-release-date-revealed-for-september">released in September 2022</a>, but this 72-hour event is landing almost two years after&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3</em>'s release, so it could be the game's last big hurrah.</p>
<p>Of course, Nintendo hasn't made any kind of official announcement on this front, so it could also just be a big Splatfest event to celebrate the summer. We'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p><em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>is, as you might surmise from its title, the third game in the&nbsp;<em>Splatoon&nbsp;</em>series of multiplayer-focused third-person shooters.</p>
<p>The game continues the franchise's emphasis on territory control via covering ground with your team's color rather than focusing on kills, and it's also got an expanded single-player campaign and a brand new hub to explore.</p>
<p>Two major DLC packs have been released for&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3</em>. The first reintroduces the Inkopolis Plaza hub from the original&nbsp;<em>Splatoon</em>, while the second, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-side-order-dlc-release-date"><em>Side Order</em></a>, adds a roguelite-style tower-climbing campaign.</p>
<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/splatoon-3-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right now on Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/splatoon-3-review-nintendo-online-multiplayer-at-its-best">take a look at our review here</a> to find out whether you're ink-terested.</p>
