Both appeared in some promotional videos for the episode, and yeah, Mulaney is there, but Roan’s elaborate outfit is the star of the show. The green and gold outfit features a huge crescent headpiece with gold waist pieces stretching out to the side that seemingly double as armrests. The whole fit is something straight out of a fantasy RPG, and folks in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/rocco_botte/status/1852246952647225794&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/rocco_botte/status/1852246952647225794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fandoms like <em>Final Fantasy</em></a></span> are jumping on the jokes. However, <em>Dragon Age</em> is fresh in everyone’s minds and I, too, had to laugh at how Roan’s outfit is evocative of Ghilan’nain, one of the elven gods the player faces in <em>The Veilguard</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="b69755b1a636e143d8bcdc1bd6bd83af" data-recommend-id="image://b69755b1a636e143d8bcdc1bd6bd83af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ghilan’nain looks up at the sky with her arms outstretched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ghilan’nain looks up at the sky with her arms outstretched." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b69755b1a636e143d8bcdc1bd6bd83af" data-recommend-id="image://b69755b1a636e143d8bcdc1bd6bd83af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ghilan’nain looks up at the sky with her arms outstretched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ghilan’nain is a blighted elf, and without getting too into the weeds, that means her body has been twisted into a monstrous eldritch horror. This lady has multiple sets of arms and tentacles, and her face is hidden under a mask connected to a crescent headpiece. In close-up shots you can see her face is just as horrifying beneath the mask, and why she was so willing to become this monstrosity is part of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-solas-memories-wolf-statues-quest-1851687250&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-solas-memories-wolf-statues-quest-1851687250">the story you’ll uncover in <em>The Veilguard</em></a></span>. With the headpiece and tendril-like appendages, Roan’s outfit calls to mind the elven god of guides and navigation, so <em>Dragon Age </em>fans are all making the same joke.</p><p>Ghilan’nain is nothing like Chappell Roan, though.

It’s been revealed that <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is EA’s biggest single-player game launch on Steam to date, outshining even <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em> last year, which topped charts and broke player records for the publisher.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

The day after launch—a work day for most people—saw those numbers sitting around 62,000. Now, I know many people will think 70,000 isn’t all that impressive, as it doesn’t break the top ten most-played games on Steam, but it did surpass <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> for a time, which is no small feat. Even more impressive is that, on day one, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> outsold <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> on Steam, pushing the FPS down a spot on the top seller’s leaderboard.<br></p><p>If you spend any amount of time online today, you’ll find plenty of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347">discourse surrounding <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span>. A vocal minority continues downplaying its significance, claiming the <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> beta test outperforms the full <em>Dragon Age</em> release. Yeah, it does. But <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is a free-to-play, limited beta. So, obviously it’ll outperform a full-price RPG. We can celebrate both!<br></p><p>So, why is <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>outperforming EA’s other single-player hits? It’s a well-crafted RPG with action-combat mechanics, impressive world design, perhaps one of the best character creators in the genre, and an expansive storyline spanning nearly 100 hours to complete. Oh, and it’s Steam Deck compatible and doesn’t require the EA App!<br></p><p>If you’re jumping into <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> this weekend, pay close attention if you want to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-secret-ending-explained-executors-1851686439&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-secret-ending-explained-executors-1851686439">unlock the game’s secret ending</a></span>!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard has just been released and is already off to a great start. It's been blowing up on social media and has received nonstop buzz online. At the moment, it has a Mostly Positive review rating on Steam. This game has been wanted by Dragon Age fans for a long time, as Dragon Age: Inquisition was released in 2014, making it a whopping 10-year wait for Dragon Age: The Veilguard. It's been said that the climate was pretty dire when development first started out and trying to create a new game while trying to cope with a worldwide pandemic was incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>The latest game in the Dragon Age franchise had been in development for years by 2020 and was in deep water by that point. It had been rebooted from a single-player game into a live-service game with heavy multiplayer elements, a component often seen in recent EA games, including games like Anthem. It's said that some employees within the company were referring to the next Dragon Age game as "Anthem with dragons," which is never a good sign. Once Gary McKay took over in 2020, he was determined to make sure that the same mistakes were not made when creating Dragon Age: The Veilguard. In the coming months after he took over, he began to meet with some of the leadership in BioWare and EA and made the decision to take Dragon Age back to single-player.</p>
<p>This information comes from a report made by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-01/-dragon-age-the-veilguard-faced-turbulent-development-high-stakes-at-bioware" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Schreier over at Bloomberg</a>, where Gary McKay's thought process behind this game was explained in detail. For McKay, it made perfect sense to revert the game back to singleplayer, as games like Anthem didn't succeed, but Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was a huge hit with fans of Star Wars and those who weren't.</p>
<p>"Once we made that decision, a lot of things started to fall into place," said McKay. As the development for Dragon Age: The Veilguard progressed, he scrapped games like an Anthem reboot and sold off the rights to Star Wars: The Old Republic. At this time, EA was reorganized, which split the company into divisions of EA Games and EA Sports, which allowed a heavier focus to be put on Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p>Despite the huge successes during development, the game still ended up dealing with a lot of setbacks and obstacles. The pandemic was a huge one, as BioWare had to start hiring people remotely, which "made for cultural challenges," said McKay. As a result of this, the game didn't come out by its original target date; instead, it came out this week. Last summer, we also saw a layoff of 50 people at BioWare, which included some of the company's top names. McKay said in the interview with Schreier that the industry "was all about focus at that time. When you have a really large team, you're always compelled to keep everybody busy all the time. When you have a smaller team, you have the right people in the right roles at the right time; some incredible momentum is gained at that point."</p>
<p>So far, Dragon Age: The Veilguard seems to be performing well, but neither EA nor BioWare have released any numbers at this point. It's uncertain whether they will, but it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-breaks-steam-records-for-a-bioware-and-ea-single-player-game/">currently topping charts on Steam</a>. Maybe this is the boost both BioWare and EA need to start developing some great games in the future, too.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alan-wake-2-still-hasn%E2%80%99t-recouped-all-its-development-and-marketing-costs.1025568/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-recouped-all-its-development-and-marketing-costs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Remedy's Alan Wake 2 was a resounding critical success when it launched last year. It matched the studio's historic highest Metacritic score (Max Payne's 89). Here on Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned</a> a 9/10 score from Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>Despite not aiming to revolutionize the survival horror genre, Alan Wake II is an amazing game that no one who enjoys a good trippy horror story should pass on. Remedy Entertainment really outdid themselves, releasing their best game to date and one of the most immersive gaming experiences of the past few years.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it didn't quite sell Gangbusters. Back in March, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-alan-wake-2-has-recouped-most-of-the-investment-studio-plans-more-regular-sequels-for-aw-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Alan Wake 2 had recouped 'most' of its investment. The latest report that the Finnish company <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/1ef581e9-5f40-4a92-ab0f-0d15844717cd/remedy-q3-2024-business-review.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> today makes it sound like Alan Wake 2 barely went forward—the game still hasn't recouped all the costs.</p>
<p><em>At the end of the quarter, Alan Wake 2 had recouped most of its development and marketing expenses. After the end of the quarter, the second expansion of Alan Wake 2, The Lake House, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-whos-the-real-monster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> on October 22 alongside the Physical Deluxe Edition of the game.</em></p>
<p>Remedy's games were never really huge mainstream hits. Still, two factors probably contributed to the relatively low sales. For one thing, they launched the game only in digital stores, but that's now been rectified, as mentioned above; the retail debut might bring in a few more players. More importantly, Epic Games funded the game's development and therefore secured a permanent exclusive for its own store on PC. This meant no release on Steam, which would have certainly brought in a larger audience. On the other hand, without Epic Games, Alan Wake 2 might not have been made at all.</p>
<p>Anyway, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala also addressed investors on the status of the future projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a>, previously codename Condor, continues in full production with a focus on iterating on the core loop and implementing more of the UI (user interface) for more player clarity based on playtesting feedback.</em></li>
<li><em>Control 2 has progressed well in the production readiness stage and is on track to start full production during 2025. Many of the critical features of the game have been implemented to mitigate production risk, and workflows and pipelines are being tested in preparation for full production.</em></li>
<li><em>Max Payne 1&amp;2 Remake is making steady progress in full production. The development team continues their work, gradually reaching important milestones.</em></li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285513/intel-ceo-lunar-lake-one-off-memory-package-discrete-gpu<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Intel is rolling back one of the biggest changes to its laptop chips in years. Remember how this fall’s Lunar Lake laptops <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24169115/intel-lunar-lake-architecture-platform-feature-reveal">ditched the idea of memory sticks</a>, putting a fixed amount of RAM on the processor package instead? Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger now says that turned out to be a financial mistake, and Intel won’t do it again. Oh, and he may be axing desktop GPUs, too.</p><p>Future Intel generations of chips, including Panther Lake and Nova Lake, won’t have baked-on memory. “It’s not a good way to run the business, so it really is for us a one-off with Lunar Lake,” said Gelsinger on Intel’s Q3 2024 earnings call, as spotted <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-panther-lake-to-launch-in-second-half-of-2025-no-more-memory-on-package-in-future-products">by <em>VideoCardz</em></a>. </p><p>“We’ll build it in a more traditional way with memory off-package, and the CPU and I/O capabilities in the package. But volume memory will be off-package in the roadmap going forward,” he said.</p><p>It may seem a bit of a head-scratcher, because Intel touted Lunar Lake’s on-package memory as a competitive advantage when it came to laptop battery life — boasting that it reduced the power consumption of moving data through the system by 40 percent. </p><p>But on the earnings call, Gelsinger suggested that Lunar Lake was supposed to be more of an experiment, rather than the core of Intel’s laptop efforts it became: </p><div><blockquote><p>Lunar Lake was initially designed to be a niche product that we wanted to achieve highest performance and great battery life capability, and then AI PC occurred. And with AI PC, it went from being a niche product to a pretty high-volume product.</p></blockquote></div><p>Don’t we all want the best performance and battery life from our laptops? Perhaps — but Lunar Lake became a problem for Intel because it relied too much on external partners for the memory chips and wafers from rival TSMC. Last quarter, when Intel announced its mass layoffs and restructuring, Intel’s CFO revealed that Lunar Lake <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24169115/intel-lunar-lake-architecture-platform-feature-reveal">was too costly to help turn Intel’s fortunes around</a>. Gelsinger says Lunar Lake hasn’t shipped 100 million units or anything like that, but it became “a meaningful portion of our total mix.”</p><p>Unfortunately for PC graphics enthusiasts, it seems like Intel’s discrete GPU efforts are similarly seen as a failed experiment now. Gelsinger says he’s focused on simplifying the company’s consumer products now, and dedicated graphics cards / chips are apparently on the chopping block. He said:</p><div><blockquote><p>How are we handling graphics? That is increasingly becoming large, integrated graphics capabilities, so less need for discrete graphics in the market going forward. </p></blockquote></div><div><p>If Intel axes them, it won’t come as a huge surprise — its gaming graphics initiative <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/21/23650611/intel-raja-koduri-gpus-amd-nvidia-apple-leave-ai-startup">only had very limited success</a> with standalone cards, and only ever managed to play <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23911902/intel-arc-a580-announcement-performance-price-nvidia-amd">at the ultra-budget end</a> of the field, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24240173/amd-udna-gpu-ai-gaming-rdna-cdna-jack-huynh">AMD is now threatening even more</a>.</p></div><p>But it’d be a bit of a shame if Intel never manages to get past the letter A — Alchemist — and the gamers waiting for Intel’s Battlemage dGPUs never manage to see its sophomore effort. At least Intel’s Arc graphics efforts, including Battlemage, did trickle down to the increasingly powerful integrated graphics aboard its laptop chips. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But like my high school bully, that towering monstrosity of an MMORPG somehow managed to peak quickly and drop off the face of the planet. Despite the lackluster reception after its first month, Amazon Game Studios didn’t throw in the towel as so many expected of them. Instead, they kept refining the gameplay, redesigning entire zones, and offered players in a handcrafted world with some of the genre’s best gathering and crafting elements. Now, a few years and a single expansion later, the team revamped the experience with <em>New World: Aeternum</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196013" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="316" data-playlist="196013,195805,196663" data-current="196013"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21533.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>What is <em>New World: Aeternum</em>? It’s a total overhaul of the MMORPG, featuring large-scale PvP, a 10-player raid, end-game solo content, a revamped solo experience for story-centric players, better quality-of-life features, controller support…oh, and swimming mechanics. It’s a lot to take in, especially if you’re a returning player willing to give Amazon’s MMO one more shot.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-world-aeternum-classes-attribute-points-consumables-1851669856&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-world-aeternum-classes-attribute-points-consumables-1851669856">How To Get Started in New World Aeternum</a></span></p><p>However, if you are a returning player, remember that to access all of the content in <em>Aeternum</em>, you require the expansion, <em>Rise of the Angry Earth</em>, which retails for $29.99. It’s an expensive entry price for an MMO with a history of mediocrity in many players’ eyes.</p><p>That said, it’s sitting at ‘Mixed’ reviews on Steam following a lackluster launch—yet again—that left many fans fidgeting in their gaming chairs. Most didn’t mind leaving a negative review, though, so we have plenty of those to sift through. Unfortunately, it was tough to find any ASCII artwork or meme reviews this time, which is highly unusual for Steam user reviews. Most people simply wanted to complain about poor UI changes, controller support, and Amazon customer support. Despite the negativity, it’s steadily seen a healthy 40,000 concurrent players since relaunch, albeit a micro-slice of the 913,000 it once saw three years ago.</p><p>If you’re on the fence about whether to play <em>New World Aeternum</em>, here’s a look at the MMO from a different perspective—that of your peers within the gaming community.

Like that 2015 title, <em>The</em> <em>Dark Pictures Anthology</em> seeks to capture the feeling of a horror movie that you can play. In each of the anthology’s titles (of which there are currently four), you’ll be responsible for deciding the fate of each cast member. What makes these experiences so enjoyable are the permutations the story can take depending on your mood. Sure, you could save everybody and let them live happily ever after, but it’s a bit more fun to see just how much mayhem you can cause, even if it means letting the killer take out the entire cast. Choosing your own style also makes the<em> Dark Pictures</em> games perfect to play with a group of friends. </p><p>Because the <em>Dark Pictures</em> games are an anthology, you can pick up any of the four titles first. Each one has its own horror vibe to fit the mood you’re in.

The third title in the series, it’s clearly the one on which Supermassive hit its stride, both in narrative and gameplay. The roughly six-hour experience never lets up, constantly putting pressure on you and the cast. It also has a great star in Ashley Tisdale (of <em>High School Musical</em> fame), and she turns in a pretty fantastic horror performance. </p><p>In addition to the rest of the Dark Pictures games, the Humble Bundle will also net you <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/little-nightmares-is-fun-but-predictable-1794718208&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/little-nightmares-is-fun-but-predictable-1794718208"><em>Little Nightmares</em></a></span>, its expansion, and <em>Little Nightmares 2</em>. For $20 that’s a pretty great belated Halloween treat.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Please stay tuned to the Rockstar Games Newswire for details."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What this refers to are the features contained exclusively in the enhanced release of GTA 5 for PS5 and Xbox Series consoles that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-5-online-ps5-xbox-series-x-new-features-revealed">launched back in 2022</a>. These included everything from graphics setting enhancements to actual new features, including quality of life improvements, a new intro and tutorial, new vehicle upgrades, and a lot more. There's also character transfer features that allowed players to transfer story mode progress and GTA Online characters from prior gen systems to current-gen and even cross-platform, which suggests we may be able to similarly transfer progress to PC now too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an update that's been due for several years now, and fans have been asking for it pretty much since the enhanced editions landed on console.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the community update, which talks about the stuff actually showing up in GTA Online for everyone in December, including new things to do at the Darnell Bros Garment Factory, new missions, vehicles, and some quality of life improvements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's plenty to be getting on with while you wait for GTA 6, which we've learned is still a ways away, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-take-two-interactive">currently planned for fall of 2025</a>.

After Gary McKay took over as BioWare GM, he began to question if that was the right choice, ultimately leading to the decision to reboot the game once again, going back to a single-player design.</p><p>"We were thinking, 'Does [multiplayer/live-service] make sense, does this play into our strengths, or is this going to be another challenge we have to face?'" he said.

its original design as a single-player game.</p><p>"Once we made that decision, a lot of things started to fall into place," McKay said.</p><p>EA's live-service business is booming, as the company just this week reported <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Strong-Q2-FY25-Results/default.aspx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">earning $1.3 billion from live services</a> over the past three months alone. But not every game from EA will be a multiplayer/live-service game. Before Dragon Age: The Veilguard, EA had success with the single-player-only Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-ea-confirms-it-will-continue-to-invest-in-the-series/1100-6494818/" data-ref-id="1100-6494818">sold more than 10 million copies.</a> Its sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-20-best-selling-games-of-2023-in-the-us/2900-4951/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4951">Jedi Survivor, was among the best-selling games of 2023.</a></p><p>Also in the interview, it was revealed that BioWare's other major internal team, which was working on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">next Mass Effect</a>, was called in to help finish The Veilguard and get it out the door. EA's Motive Studio, which is making a new Iron Man game, was also recruited to help BioWare, the report said.</p><p>McKay said he hopes The Veilguard can help BioWare return to its former glory as a "top game studio" following the struggle that was Anthem.</p><p>It's early days, but there are some positive signs already. For one, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Veilguard is getting generally positive review scores</a>, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-biowares-biggest-launch-ever-on-steam/1100-6527529/" data-ref-id="1100-6527529">the RPG is also setting records on Steam.</a></p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard review in progress</a> scored the game a 7/10.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a> is no longer supported on Steam Deck or Linux as a result of cheating, according to EA.</p><p dir="ltr">"Linux is used by default on the Steam Deck," an EA community manager wrote in <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/News-Game-Updates/Dev-Team-Update-Linux-amp-Anti-Cheat/td-p/14217740" rel="nofollow ">a post announcing the change</a>. "There is currently no reliable way for us to differentiate a legitimate Steam Deck from a malicious cheat claiming to be a Steam Deck (via Linux)."</p><p dir="ltr">Apex Legends <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/apex-legends-gets-steam-deck-verified/" rel="nofollow ">introduced Steam Deck support</a> in March 2022, making it one of the only battle royales available to Steam Deck users. The same year, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney said that there were no current plans to make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> accessible on Steam Deck, citing <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1490565925648715781" rel="nofollow ">the very same anti-cheat concerns</a> EA is now raising regarding Apex.</p><p dir="ltr">"The openness of the Linux operating systems makes it an attractive one for cheaters and cheat developers," EA's post continues. "Linux cheats are indeed harder to detect and the data shows that they are growing at a rate that requires an outsized level of focus and attention from the team for a relatively small platform. There are also cases in which cheats for the Windows OS get emulated as if it’s on Linux in order to increase the difficulty of detection and prevention."</p><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, EA "had to weigh the decision on the number of players who were legitimately playing on Linux/the Steam Deck versus the greater health of the population of players for Apex." The Apex Legends publisher says that although the number of players using Linus isn't particularly large, "their impact infected a fair amount of players’ games."</p><p dir="ltr">EA recently announced it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-sequel-isnt-in-the-cards-respawn-focused-on-improving-the-game/1100-6527511/">working to future-proof the game</a> in the hopes of ensuring Apex Legends remains playable for "10 to 15 years," and developer Respawn Entertainment has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-victories-against-cheaters-and-bots-detailed-in-first-of-many-blog-posts/1100-6526001/">increased anti-cheat improvement efforts</a> in recent months. The sudden move to revoke Linux support is likely a part of EA's efforts to stabilize the game ahead of Season 23's launch.</p><p dir="ltr">But there is one option for Apex players who don't want to abandon their Steam Decks: installing Windows.</p><p dir="ltr">"Playing on handhelds, such as the Steam Deck, is still possible if the user opts to install Windows," EA's post noted.</p>

With Atari 50's The Wider World of Atari DLC <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/herere-the-19-new-atari-50-games-coming-in-this-weeks-wider-world-of-atari-dlc">now behind us</a>, it's time to look head (while also looking back because, you know, history) to next week's The First Console War DLC, Atari having now revealed all 19 games coming to the acclaimed digital museum on 8th November.
</p>
<p>
The First Console War charts the rivalry between Atari and it's earliest major competitor, Mattel's Intellivision, through the late 70s and 1980s - a rivalry that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-buys-intellivision-brand-ending-longest-running-console-war">officially came to a close this year</a>, when Atari acquired the Intellivision brand and over 200 games from its portfolio.
</p>
<p>
It's a tale Atari 50 will tell across a brand-new in-game timeline and eight video segments detailing the challenges Intellivision posed to Atari's VCS. It'll feature interviews with the likes of M Network programmer Jane Terjung, Activision's David Crane and Garry Kitchen, video game historians Leonard Hermand and Mike Mika, and more. It'll also include 19 more playable retro games, which Atari has now detailed ahead of release:

The Destiny: Rising Closed Alpha Test will be live from November 1 at 9 AM PDT / 12 PM EDT until December 5 at 11:59 PM PDT / 2:59 AM EDT. To celebrate the opening of the DRCA, an announcement trailer has been released. The trailer is just over two minutes long and shows off the graphical quality of the game and what kind of content players can expect to get into in this mobile game. Here is the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny: Rising | Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nz0dClII69w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For a closed alpha test, there is a surprising amount of content for players to explore. Players will be able to explore the Prologue of the Main Story Campaign, and it has been promised to be spoiler-free, so those who want to play the game at a later date when it releases won't find the story being ruined for them. In total, there are 11 Lightbearers that can expand your roster. Suppose you want to be able to socialize with some of the other players who are participating in Destiny: Rising Closed Alpha. In that case, there will be a social hub-like area called The Haven, as well as a free-roam area called Jiangshi Metro.</p>
<p>Whether this means that there will be in-game communications for players to use and find out the opinions of other players while they are also spending time in the DRCA remains to be seen, and this information will likely be posted to social media, including Reddit, from those who are participating.</p>
<p>In addition to the Prologue, there will also be two Haven Ops Strike Missions, three Public Events to participate in, and a Raid-like, 6-player game mode called Gauntlet. That's not all, as there is also the option to participate in some of the other game modes up for grabs in this Destiny: Rising Closed Alpha. This includes Morgran's Prey, The Realm of the IX, Legacy, and Shifting Gates.</p>
<p>For a closed Alpha test, it seems that a lot of thought has gone into this, and it seems to be shaping up to be a fulfilling experience for those who get to participate. Hopefully, in months to come, the Alpha will be opened up to those in other regions other than the US and Canada. If you want to participate, you can register on <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/news/20241011/41118_1186026.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the website</a>. This closed Alpha test is available for <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-rising-brings-the-sci-fi-franchise-to-mobile-thanks-to-netease/">Android and iOS</a>.</p>

            <p>
Like a plague doctor delicately administering another handful of leeches, Ice Pick Lodge have shared a bit more about the recently announced Pathologic 3, explaining how their plans for the cult epidemic-battling series have progressed since the release of Pathologic 2.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-announced-with-time-travel-mechanic-due-for-release-in-2025">recalled in our announcement post</a>, Pathologic 2 was in fact a remake of the original Pathologic. Like the 2005 game, it was supposed to have three, very different playable characters - the Haruspex, the Bachelor, and the Changeling, each tasked with saving a mucky town of slaughterhouse workers from a vicious infection.

<p>
The Haruspex arrived at launch in 2019, and the other two characters were to follow as DLC expansions, but as Ice Pick <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3199650/view/4468226896061005952">explain in the Steam page</a>, this proved impractical, with development of the Haruspex route taking longer than expected. As such, the Bachelor will form the diseased heart of his own game. Will the same be true of the Changeling, who is capable of healing or killing with a touch? It's still a bit unclear, but that's the hope, yes.
</p><p>
"The game simply grew beyond our concept of DLC," Ice Pick write on Steam. "It will have different gameplay and entirely new features. Instead of one game with three playthroughs using the same gameplay but different storylines (as in the original 2005 release and the Classic HD remaster), we're creating three fully developed games with distinct gameplay and significant differences in narrative.
</p>
<p>
"Now, these are truly three separate protagonists with unique worldviews, perceptions of reality, and distinct tools," they continue. "From a gameplay perspective, this means three different approaches and a complete rethinking of the original scripts."
</p>
<p>
As for the Changeling route, the seeming expectation is that she'll be the heroine of Pathologic 4, but the developers don't want to jump the gun. "We understand that premature promises about the previous Pathologic led to unfulfilled expectations," they write. "We apologize for that and don't want to mislead you in the future. The developer should not be an unreliable narrator - unlike his characters."
</p>
<p>
The post also covers a few of the differences between the Bachelor and the Haruspex, which may be familiar to those who played the 2005 game. "The Haruspex needed to survive, fight, scavenge, rummage through garbage for scraps of bread, and try to save those he held dear along the way," the devs write. "The Bachelor is a man of intellect. Survival is not his primary concern; his goals go beyond what one lifetime could contain. He needs to think, formulate theories, and gather evidence. Ultimately, he must issue commands and observe the results. This distinction will be emphasized through gameplay, mechanics, objectives, soundtrack, and so on."
</p><p>
As you'd hope, people who helped fund Pathologic 2's development according to the original vision of a three-protagonist game will receive keys for Pathologic 3. To be specific, they'll send free keys to "Kickstarter backers and other platforms where support for the game was available during the fundraising stage" together with "Backers from 2014 and 2015". People entitled to two copies will receive two keys.</p>
<p>The game will "likely" be available on all the same platforms as its predecessor, with console launches coming after the PC version. Expect more details closer to release in 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/over-the-garden-wall-10-year-anniversary-fall-show-1851687442<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It has now been almost ten years since <em>Over the Garden Wall </em>first aired on Cartoon Network. The show will officially cross that threshold over the weekend, but that doesn’t mean we can’t preemptively celebrate one of the network’s crowning achievements and most enduring projects. But <em>Over the Garden Wall </em>is more than just a great show led by a great cast (Elijah Wood! Melanie Lynskey!! Christopher Lloyd!!!) with great messages for audiences of all ages: it is also perhaps the single greatest thing you can watch during the fall, and embodies everything I love about the season.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Over the Garden Wall </em>emerged from a deeply weird time in Cartoon Network’s history. I mean that quite literally, because the network was led at the time by some of the strangest shows it has ever boasted from some of the most singularly unique creators of the late aughts and early 2010s. Shows like <em>Adventure Time </em>and <em>Regular Show </em>dominated the airwaves and minds of the network’s viewers, and <em>Over the Garden Wall</em>’s creator, Patrick McHale, even worked on the former in a significant capacity. Cartoon Network became a home for weirdos and screwballs, and despite my fondness for the stuff I grew up with, this was probably its most refreshing era.</p><p>The show follows brothers Wirt and Greg who, after wandering through the woods to get home on Halloween, find themselves in a strange world called the Unknown. In it, all kinds of animals can speak, including a bluebird named Beatrice, and all manner of weird towns and creatures exist alongside people like you and I. Everyone is dressed like they’re out of the 1800s, and the series seems to lift from Americana artwork and folk music. It also cribs heavily from folklore, which lends the Unknown a sense of otherworldly and magical history despite the otherwise short runtime of the show, which clocks in at 120 minutes in total. In one episode, Wirt and Greg are taking a riverboat with a bunch of talking and singing frogs, and in another, they’re rescuing a girl seemingly enslaved by a witch. There’s a haunted mansion, a haunting Woodsman, and an unseen Beast that stalks the woods at night. It’s a strange show, and utterly delightful.</p><p>When I think of the strange and the unknown, my mind first flashes to autumn. That first autumnal chill is utterly magical, and after months of being beat down by the heat, it’s like an otherworldly gift. It’s cold and sharp, but also strangely comforting, and I’d say that <em>Over the Garden Wall </em>is, too. The fall also feels like this deeply transformative time. Growing up, it’s when the new school year begins, ushering in new people and experiences that could profoundly change you. As sure as the leaves change color and fall off of trees, fall invites you to transform with it, and that’s as frightening and strange a prospect as any. <em>Over the Garden Wall </em>is acutely tuned into those notions and anxieties. </p><p>Wirt and Greg have completely different impressions of their time in the Unknown. Wirt treats the autumnal wonderland as a threat to his existence, and fights it every chance he gets. Greg, on the other hand, perhaps blessed by the obliviousness of childhood, welcomes it and its oddities. He adopts a frog which bears many names over the course of the show, and befriends the locals at every opportunity. Similarly, Wirt begins the show as a bit of a reluctant older brother to Greg, perhaps due to the fact that they are actually half-siblings with different parents. He doesn’t lack care or empathy for his younger brother, but he certainly puts a wall between them which comes down as the series progresses. Greg, meanwhile, looks up to and admires Wirt, like younger siblings are wont to do, regardless of circumstance. Over time, Wirt begins to open himself up to the world and the possibility of change with the bravery that his little brother does, and if that ain’t a fairytale ending, what is?<br></p><p>Maybe that’s the thing about <em>Over the Garden Wall </em>actually: it feels like one of our few modern fairy tales. And much like the fairy tales we grew up with, there’s a little something for everybody who gives the show a chance. <em>Over the Garden Wall</em>, like a lot of Cartoon Network’s programming at the time—as well as some series that would follow it, like <em>Infinity Train</em>—is obviously aimed at kids, but it has no problem appealing to older audiences too. I first watched it as a young adult, and it’s only grown more precious to me with every journey back into the Unknown. The impact of the show is so profound that I <em>just </em>saw a Wirt on Halloween, ten years after it first aired, and the cast of that show remain regulars around this time of year.</p><p><em>Over the Garden Wall </em>may begin on Halloween, but the journey that Wirt and Greg take may as well span the entirety of the fall season. So if you’re looking for something bite-sized, endlessly charming, comforting, and great for people of all ages, I cannot recommend it nearly enough. It’s been ten years already, and it truly hasn’t lost a bit of its luster. It may just be timeless. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Maximum Football heads to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691280/Maximum_Football/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Early Access on Steam</a> on November 7, and the game’s director is happy where the gameplay stands as it gets set to launch.</p>



<p>In an exclusive upcoming interview with Insider Gaming, Maximum Games Game Director Micah Brown says that the gameplay is even further along than what he expected at this point.</p>



<p>“I’m feeling really good,” Brown said about the state of things as the game heads to early access. “The gameplay is where we want it to be. It’s further along than I thought it would be.</p>



<p>“Honestly, it plays very, very well. It’s very, very smooth.”</p>



<p>Brown did say that there are still some animations that are being smoothed out, with some coming after launch. However, as a whole, the game is playing exactly how they want it to be at this point in development.</p>



<p>“The multiplayer we’ve been testing is working well,” he continued. “The customization is absolutely amazing and the gameplay is running very well. So I’m really excited. I can’t wait till we launch and see what everybody says.</p>



<p>“It’s going to be wild.”</p>



<p>Brown’s comments on gameplay come as part of a nearly 30-minute sit down talking Maximum Football. Other topics in the upcoming interview include the game’s pricing structure, plans surrounding future updates, encouraging players to try the game, and much more.</p>



<p>When it releases in early access, the base game of Maximum Football will be free for all players. Those who wish access to more modes and options can upgrade to either the Dynasty Edition for $19.99 or the Legend Edition for $39.99.</p>
