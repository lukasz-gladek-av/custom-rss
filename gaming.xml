			<p>It's no surprise that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 would help boost sales, as it's one of the most popular and best-selling game franchises out there. As a result, US games consumer spending is rising once more in the month of October, with the sales being boosted nicely by the launch of Call of Duty. This information comes from<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sales-up-10-following-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-us-monthly-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Circana's monthly report</a>, which says that hardware, software, and accessories sales combined have gone up by 10% year-on-year for a sum of $4.7 billion. Activision confirmed with The Washington Post that with the inclusion of Black Ops 6, the franchise as a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/30/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-500-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whole surpassed 500 million units</a> sold. This statistic makes it one of the best-selling game franchises of all time.</p>
<p>Content represented $4.23 billion of that sum, which is a 12% rise compared to October 2023. Hardware sales were down by 23%, making it a sum of $249 million.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launched and immediately hit number one in the October charts, becoming the third best-selling game of 2024 to date. Subscription spending also increased, which can also be attributed to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, as this was the first game in the franchise to be a day-one release on Game Pass. In the report, Circana stated that non-mobile subscriptions grew by 16% compared to last year, making it evident that Black Ops 6 played a massive part in this. <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-franchise-and-game-pass-records/">Xbox further verified this information</a>, as they announced that the title was breaking records for Game Pass subscriptions at the end of October.</p>
<p>The report also goes on to mention that console content was the biggest contributor to the rise in content spending, providing a 27% increase compared to the same period last year, with the rise being driven by digital full-game sales. Again, Black Ops 6 is to thank for this. Confirmed by Circana's Mat Piscatella, it's been confirmed that PlayStation platforms accounted for 82% of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 total console full game dollar sales during October.</p>
<p>"Over its first two weeks in market, full game dollar sales of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 were 23% higher than the full game dollar sales of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 over its first two weeks in a market a year ago," says Piscatella. Overall, this information isn't too much of a surprise, as Modern Warfare 3 wasn't as well received as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has been.</p>
<p>Along with the new Call of Duty, games like Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, Silent Hill 2, and Metaphor: ReFantazio were amongst the top-selling games from October 6 to November 2.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Virtua Fighter 5 Steam Release Announced, Rollback Netcode Confirmed]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/virtua-fighter-5-steam-release</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/virtua-fighter-5-steam-release-announced-rollback-netcode-confirmed.1043055/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/virtua-fighter-5-steam-release<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that 2006 fighting game&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter 5&nbsp;</em>is getting a Steam release, and it comes complete with a number of enhancements, including one that's very important to the fighting game community.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/SEGA/status/1859960222493671731" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O.</em>, as the Steam version is called, will be coming sometime this winter, although the studio isn't specific about exactly when we can expect the game to arrive on PC.</p>

<p>It'll feature support for up to 4K resolution and 60fps, as well as a host of gameplay balance adjustments. Perhaps most importantly, however, the game will also feature rollback netcode at launch, without which it arguably wouldn't be a viable online title for fighting game enthusiasts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/virtua-fighter-5-steam-jacky-lau.jpg?itok=MEwGlO27 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/virtua-fighter-5-steam-jacky-lau.jpg?itok=DqXUR5Q5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Virtua Fighter 5&nbsp;</em>is coming to Steam with a very important feature.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with rollback netcode, it's essentially a feature in fighting games by which if an online connection is dropped, each player's game state will try to predict what the player was about to do.</p>

<p>It's a little more complicated than that, but suffice it to say that rollback netcode significantly improves the online experience in fighting games. It's used in the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-fighterz-rollback-netcode-ps5-xbox" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-rollback-netcode-will-be-better-open-worlds-detailed" rel="nofollow"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/will-tekken-8-have-crossplay-and-rollback-netcode-katsuhiro-harada-responds" rel="nofollow"><em>Tekken 8</em></a>, so&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter 5&nbsp;</em>including it at launch on Steam makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>Sega says it will be sharing more information about&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O.&nbsp;</em>in the future, so presumably, we'll be getting a release date in the next couple of weeks. I wouldn't be surprised if this year's Game Awards included that info.</p>




<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter 5</em>'s impending Steam release comes just a few weeks after Sega revealed that a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-new-virtua-fighter-game" rel="nofollow">new installment in the franchise is in development</a>, although we don't yet know what it'll look like or when we can expect it to arrive.</p>

<p>It's part of a wider initiative on Sega's part to revive some of its classic franchises, with that initiative also yielding the likes of a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinobi-movie-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Shinobi&nbsp;</em>movie</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crazy-taxi-reboot-open-world-mmo" rel="nofollow">new&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>game</a>, and several more classic Sega IPs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-super-game-old-ip-revived" rel="nofollow">getting new games as well</a>.</p>

<p><em>Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O.&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3112260/Virtua_Fighter_5_REVO/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> sometime this winter. The game is also currently available <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0177-CUSA27065_00-9558212560709500" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on PS4</a> (and on PS5 via backwards compatibility).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-hardware-sales-fell-october-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The trending of falling video game hardware sales in the United States (US) continued in October 2024. The information comes via the latest sales data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>.</p>



<p>Hardware spending fell 23% year-over-year in October from $323 million to $249 million. That follows a year-over-year drop in September of 44% that saw just $251 million in hardware sales. </p>







<p>Like last month, the declining sales were across all three major platforms. The Nintendo Switch, as expected, saw the biggest fall of 38% year-over-year. PlayStation 5 (PS5) had the second-largest drop at 20% while the Xbox Series had an 18% decrease in sales. The fall for the PS5 and Xbox Series wasn’t as much as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-hardware-sales-continued-its-fall-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 45% and 54%, respectively, drop in September</a>, however.</p>



<p>That said, of the total sales, PS5 still was the best-selling console of the month while Xbox Series finished second. Regarding the Switch, it’s clearly a case of whoever was going to buy one, already has one as the run up to the Switch 2 continues.</p>



<p>For 2024 as a whole, hardware sales are down 29% from $3.97 billion in 2023. Still, despite a drop of nearly 30%, hardware revenue sits at $2.82 billion this year.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/despite-call-of-duty-release-college-football-25-is-still-the-best-selling-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Despite Call of Duty Release, College Football 25 Is Still The Best-Selling Game Of 2024</a></h6>



<p>It’s not all down for hardware, however, as video game accessory spending rose 15% year-over-year from $162 million to $187 million. A big reason for that was the PlayStation Portal which, once again, was the best-selling accessory in terms of dollar sales. For 2024 as a whole, accessory spending is up 8% to $2.12 billion.</p>

            <p>The Rogue Prince of Persia's enormous new update, Second Act, is here.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-the-second-act-update-effectively-relaunches-the-game-makes-prince-no-longer-purple">We already knew it would function as something of a full relaunch</a> but today Ubisoft made it official, calling it The Rogue Prince of Persia's "biggest update since launching in early access on Steam and GeForce back in May 2024".</p>
<p>Along with upgraded art work and a changed colour palette, players can expect the wartime city of Ctesiphon to come to life, along with a "significant transformation regarding the Prince, whose colour has been changed from purple to a tone that not only better fits the new direction, but also its genre, setting, and the Prince of Persia series in general".</p>

<p>That said, the "Purple Prince" will still be playable when a set of playable skins arrive in an upcoming update.</p>
<p>"With the Second Act update, players will be able to explore brand-new biomes, the Mines and the Craftsmen’s District, face off against new bosses, and experience a fresh narrative act, while Act 1 received extensive polish," Ubisoft explains. "Additionally, there are new enemies to encounter and many quality-of-life additions, such as difficulty re-balancing, multiple save slots, spirit cinder &amp; gold automatic pick-up and more."</p>
<p>This update also adds of German, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish localisation.</p>
<p>"I think it works because the game has a charismatic star," Chris Donlan wrote of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-definitely-still-room-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia upon its early access launch</a>. "Not charismatic in what he says, perhaps, but in what he does and how he moves. I just love to watch him run."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>STALKER 2 is an extremely demanding game from both a CPU and GPU standpoint, pushing a powerful CPU like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-positions-ryzen-7-9800x3d-competition-against-intel-top-core-i9-14900ks-gaming-cpu/">AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a> to its limits so much that it struggles to hit very high framerates at low resolutions.</p>
<p>A new benchmark shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Compusemble" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compusemble</a> highlights how demanding the second entry in the series by GSC Game World is, especially on the CPU. In the two scenarios the benchmark is set, both of them extremely CPU intensive, a Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU struggles to hit a 100 FPS average even at 1080p resolution. At a higher resolution, such as 4K, the AMD CPU also struggles to keep a steady 60 FPS in both benchmarking scenarios.</p>
<p><iframe title="STALKER 2 Benchmark From 4K to 720p - How Does It Scale With Resolution? RTX 4090 &amp; Ryzen 7 9800X3D" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lmRMU9Y9PFY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Performance concerns on both PC and consoles haven't stopped fans from purchasing the game, as STALKER 2 managed to sell <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/">1 million units</a> in just a few days of availability. While the game stays true to its predecessor and its premise, the game by GSC Game World isn't exactly a game for every sort of player, as Alessio highlighted in his review-in-progress.</p>
<p><em>For now, here's my current take on STALKER 2: this is a game that knows precisely what it wants to be, although that doesn't mean it is balanced enough to be fun all the time. The feeling of playing a stalker thrust into this inhospitable world against seemingly impossible odds is always present, for better or worse. However, unless you're really dying to enter the Zone right away, I would recommend waiting a little longer while the developers (and possibly modders) fix and improve the game further. After all, you've waited this long; what's a few more?</em></p>
<p>STALKER 2 is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. It is also part of the Xbox Game Pass library on both PC and consoles.</p>

That’s perfectly fine too. Keep following us and there might just be some surprises waiting for you later this year.”</p><p>What might those surprises be? Current fan speculation points to upcoming DLC and a potential Xbox Series X/S port. Daniel Wu, the CEO of Hero Games, Game Science’s biggest investor, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-expansion-release-date-1851649348&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-expansion-release-date-1851649348">previously claimed</a></span> an expansion was already in development, with some analysts guessing the DLC might arrive in time for the Chinese New Year at the end of January 2025. More recently, however, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMythWukong/comments/1frwxmk/gs_ceo_feng_ji_formally_answered_on_the_matter_of/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMythWukong/comments/1frwxmk/gs_ceo_feng_ji_formally_answered_on_the_matter_of/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feng Ji said</a></span> that if fans expect an expansion to be of the same quality as the base game, it could take a while. </p><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> coming to Xbox next month seems like a more sure bet. After much back-and-forth about whether the Chinese blockbuster was an unofficial PlayStation 5 exclusive, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-black-myth-wukong-leaked-phil-spencer-confirmed-1851697689?_gl=1*18spot8*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjI4Njg2My4xMi4xLjE3MzIyODc5MTQuNTIuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-black-myth-wukong-leaked-phil-spencer-confirmed-1851697689?_gl=1*18spot8*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjI4Njg2My4xMi4xLjE3MzIyODc5MTQuNTIuMC4w">recently told <em>Game File</em></a></span> that he knew whether or not the game would arrive on his platform but wouldn’t spill the beans. </p><p>One possibility is that we’ll get an announcement at Geoff Keighley’s Game Awards on December 12 revealing that <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> has just been shadow-dropped on Xbox Series X/S. That’s what happened last year with <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. <em>Wukong </em>is also nominated for Best Game at the TGAs, where it could continue its current winning streak. </p><p>Feng Ji does say “surprises” plural, so maybe Game Science has something else planned as well. While <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>reportedly runs better on the recently released PS5 Pro thanks to its beefier specs, it would also be nice to see the visually impressive game get an official Pro enhanced mode. That patch could be another thing the studio is planning before the end of 2024. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sure, you could play Palworld. It’s sort of an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lawsuit-palworld-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alternative to the famous monster-catching franchise</a>, albeit with more automation and firearms. Or, if you grew up playing handheld monster-catching titles, you probably want something more retro, old-school nostalgia to strike that itch. Well, a new Pokemon alternative out on PC, Dokimon: Quest, looks phenomenal!</p>



<h2 id="h-dokimon-quest-is-out-now-on-pc">Dokimon: Quest is Out Now on PC</h2>



<p>Dokimon: Quest, by developer Yanako RPGs, is the first of its kind for the studio. Its previous title, Notice Me Leena-Senpai, is an anime 2D tower defense game that launched in December 2023 in Early Access. It’s still in Early Access, albeit with an official release date coming up shortly. But for now, let’s talk about Dokimon. </p>



<p>First and foremost, it’s available today on Steam as a full release for $19.99 with a limited-time launch discount, bringing the total price down to $17.99.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-dokimon-quest">What is Dokimon: Quest?</h2>



<p>Dokimon: Quest is a retro RPG with an old-school aesthetic that mimics the turn-based battle style and monster-catching and collecting mechanics of everyone’s favorite Pokemon. </p>



<p>The adventure takes place across the Xelos region, a fantasy world in which monsters known as Dokimon roam, along with battlers, or trainers, in turn-based monster-catching and battling gameplay that pairs old-school mechanics from the franchise with modern quality-of-life improvements. </p>



<p>Some key features include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Nine playable characters</strong></li>



<li><strong>Four available save slots</strong></li>



<li><strong>Quest log for easy tracking</strong></li>



<li><strong>8bit + Piano OST</strong></li>



<li><strong>20+ Retro Color Palettes</strong></li>



<li><strong>The ability to edit monster stats</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fast-forward battles with a single key</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Following the success of Palworld in the face of Nintendo, I imagine we’ll see plenty more monster-catching titles release in the coming months and years. Do you intend to jump in the seemingly neverending hype train of such titles? Let us know in the comments below if you intend to give Dokimon: Quest a try!</p>



<hr>



<p>There were rumors of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-palworld-going-free-to-play-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palworld going free-to-play</a>, with microtransactions to support development, but we answer your concerns and questions!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/october-2024-sales-charts-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sparks-xbox-game-pass-subscription-surge<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">82% of full-game Black Ops 6 sales were on PlayStation.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">October was a massive month for new releases, with eight of the top 10 games sold in the U.S. fresh launches. But as usual, none could quite touch the success of Call of Duty, and Black Ops 6 gave the franchise another debut at No.1 even with its inclusion in Xbox Game Pass. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This information comes from Circana's monthly report on U.S. video game spending by dollar sales, which saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> drive overall video game spending up 10% year-over-year to $4.7 billion, per an analysis by Circana's Mat Piscatella. It was the best-selling game of the month and is already the third best-selling game of the year to-date. In its first two weeks, Black Ops 6 sales were 23% higher than last year's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-2023">Modern Warfare 3</a> sales over the same period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, a whopping 82% of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 full dollar sales were on PlayStation 5. But that shouldn't come as a surprise - this number counts full game purchases, and with Black Ops 6 appearing on Game Pass, it's likely most Xbox users took that route instead. But Circana also reports that non-mobile video game subscription spending industry-wide was up 16% year-over-year in October, and this was largely due to Black Ops 6 driving new Game Pass subscriptions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following Black Ops 6 on the sales charts was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</a>, which is now the fourth best-selling game of the year so far, the best-selling Dragon Ball game in the U.S., and the third best-selling Bandai Namco game in history.

BioWare's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> debuted at No.6 after launching on the last day of the month, but was beaten out by both Plaion's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/undisputed">Undisputed</a> at No.4 and fellow RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> at No.5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A few other interesting titles popped into the U.S. charts this month. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-i-vi-collection">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection</a> climbed from 90 last month to 19 this month perhaps due to a recent sale on the Nintendo Switch that dropped the price from a whopping $75 to nearly $55 (it's still going on!). Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sifu">Sifu</a> soared from No.502 last month to No.9 on the Xbox top monthly active users chart, thanks to its recent addition to Xbox Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for hardware sales, it was an unsurprisingly less stellar month. Hardware spending was down 23% year-over-year, with Switch sales down 38%, PS5 down 20%, and Xbox Series down 18%. PS5 remains the best-selling hardware in both unit and dollar sales, and Xbox followed in second as the Switch nears the end of its lifecycle.

On Steam, it has a peak concurrent player count of 117,928, putting it among the most-played games on Valve’s platform. Microsoft does not make Xbox player numbers public.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clearly, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is already a success for GSC even before its first weekend on sale. However, the launch is not without problems, with players reporting a variety of bugs (check out IGN's S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 review in progress to find out more). <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-launches-big-on-steam-as-dev-promises-fixes-for-rough-edges">GSC has promised to sort out what it called S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2’s "rough edges"</a> with a steady stream of patches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Free in-game content is also coming to the game.

GSC said at the time that the extra two months would give the developers the chance to fix "unexpected anomalies," aka bugs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GSC has also been vocal about the challenges the studio faced getting S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 up to scratch after a mixed reaction to its debut public showing last year.

At the time, GSC told IGN it was still targeting a visual quality and level of polish suggested by S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2’s eye-catching 2021 trailer despite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-stalker-2-developers-say-the-war-in-ukraine-russian-hackers-and-death-threats-wont-break-them"><u>the horrendous conditions suffered by the staff amid the war with Russia</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl launched on November 20 after years of development, and it seems to be off to a solid start.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-saw-more-players-this-year-than-its-release-in-2023/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Since its release in 2023, Baldur's Gate 3 has taken the world by storm. It isn't much of a surprise, really, considering how much content and customization there is, as well as some truly lovable (and hateable) characters that you can romance or kill. The main thing is that most things in the game are completely up to you, and you can choose to play the game in a myriad of ways, with each playthrough having the potential to be different from the previous one. When it comes to single-player RPGs, they tend to die off relatively quickly, as people will have completed the story shortly after it comes out. However, Baldur's Gate 3 continues to remain healthy, with a strong and consistent player base. According to Larian's Director of Publishing, Michael Douse, Baldur's Gate 3 performed better this year than it did in 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1859244899847069827" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Douse revealed</a> that the daily peak player counts were up by 3% compared to last year, with average daily users up by 20% and average daily Steam Deck users up by 60%. There are many factors that could be contributing to the fact that Baldur's Gate 3 continues to be popular. A lot of it likely revolves around the fact that Larian Studios has had great community support, and has patched the game where it needs, as well as adding new content. Since it was released, the game has received multiple new endings for the main companions, as well as official mod support.</p>
<p>Even Douse has said that mods are a huge reason as to why more people are playing Baldur's Gate 3. While mods were available on PC previously, they didn't have official support from the developers and required a fair few steps to install, which could lead to your game bricking. However, the developers have now added an official mod manager, which allows people to mod their game with ease and makes the removal of them significantly more accessible.</p>
<p>One of the most monumental moves made by Larian was allowing those on console access to <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-now-available-for-mac-and-consoles/">the mod manager</a>. It's a huge rarity that games on console can get any sort of modding. For example, games like The Sims 4 are notorious for being modded on PC, but that just isn't an option for console players. This was a huge move by Larian and has definitely helped keep the game relevant, as well as their consistent updates to the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-27-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.7 release date has been revealed, so get ready to bid farewell to Penacony and embark on a new adventure to lands unfamiliar.</p>

<p>Version 2.7 of the turn-based gacha RPG officially arrives on December 4th. In&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-26-release-date" rel="nofollow">Version 2.6</a>, you brought the events of a "trailblazing silkpunk saga" to their climax, but now, you'll be wrapping things up in Penacony before heading off to the mysterious land of Amphoreus.</p>

<p>As HoYoverse tells it, you'll be making new memories with your friends in Penacony while Miss Himeko gathers information about Amphoreus in preparation for moving the story to the Eternal Land.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.7-release-date-fugue.jpg?itok=OMjGirLk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.7-release-date-fugue.jpg?itok=LkBMdQK4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As ever, you'll have new characters to add to your team in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>'s latest update.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'd probably expect if you're a&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>fan, you'll have two new characters to add to your roster in Version 2.7.</p>

<p>Your first new character is Sunday, a five-star Imaginary fighter who provides powerful buffs to his team and allows other characters to immediately take action. You'll want to add him to your team if you're looking for some solid support.</p>

<p>Joining Sunday in this update is Fugue, a foxian girl who applies a powerful debuff to enemies. When said debuff reaches zero, enemies take damage, and Fugue's abilities also allow her party members to dish out some extra pain, so she's a valuable addition to any lineup.</p>




<p>Two additional characters will feature in reruns for Version 2.7. In the first half of the update, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-gameplay-trailer-celebrates-release-of-new-character-jing-yuan" rel="nofollow">Jing Yuan</a> will make a return, while the second half will see Firefly once again up for grabs.</p>

<p>A number of other major additions and improvements are set to arrive as part of this update as well, including customizable quarters for the Trailblazer. As HoYoverse prepares for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.0, you'll also get&nbsp;the new Path of Remembrance system and updates to Relics, plus lots more.</p>

<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on PC, PS5, and mobile devices. Version 2.7 arrives on December 4th.</p>

The game at least introduces this concept to you, but later, when you want to find it again, it’s bizarrely concealed.</p><p>To use the points, you have to do something entirely counter-intuitive: Go as if to open a pack. This is genuinely the only place in the game where you can access the feature, and it’s completely unlabeled too. Once you’ve tapped to open a new pack, next to the three pack arts you can choose from, in a tiny circle at the bottom-right of the screen, there’s a picture of...well, it’s a picture of a zippo lighter. Tap that, and then you can buy cards.

Or a guilty face when your own pack deals you exactly the right cards on your first turn.</p><p>Clearly nothing that can be abused, and obviously nothing that lets you send messages, but just a bunch of emojis would make a big difference.

And yet, when you click on them to pick them up...there’s nothing! There’s no little animation to show the hourglass and ticket jumping into our inventory, no sparkly flurry of stars that pops out from the screen—it just fades a bit.</p><p>In a game that’s been designed from the ground up to be a dopamine factory, it’s the most weirdly unsatisfactory moment in your daily play. Given what you gain is so miniscule (an hour off the time before your next Wonder Pick, and another shop ticket to add to the pile), we at least need to be given some positive feedback for clicking the button like a good mouse.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="06f28b5ea8e4de53b0f7743e962454c4" data-recommend-id="image://06f28b5ea8e4de53b0f7743e962454c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bigger binders!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bigger binders!" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="06f28b5ea8e4de53b0f7743e962454c4" data-recommend-id="image://06f28b5ea8e4de53b0f7743e962454c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bigger binders!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you’ve collected any real-life cards from any TCGs, you’ll know that you literally cannot buy a card binder so small that it can only contain 30 cards. Even those teeny ones Pokémon calls “mini portfolios” contain 60 cards! So why do <em>Pocket</em>’s binders limit you to half of that?!</p><p>It’s the most arbitrary choice, especially given a bog-standard three-by-three binder offers 360 slots as standard. That’d be a mess in the current format, obviously, but that brings us to the next point:</p><p>Let binders be binders! Binders aren’t a long, scrolling list. You wouldn’t be able to fit them into your bag. So why not let them be presented a page at a time, and let us flip the pages? It’d be so good! Do that!

It allows you to see a selection of packs opened by other players, pick one, and then choose one of the five cards at random.</p><p>Of course, you’ll pick a pack that has a card you really want in it, and then have a 20 percent chance of actually getting it. So four times out of five, you don’t get what you wanted. That sucks enough on its own, but the game’s insistence on painfully slowly returning you to the screen to watch the rest of the cards flip over, showing you the location of the card you actually wanted, is miserable.</p><p>Perhaps some people want it, want to know where it would have been, so they can cry, “That was the card I was going to choose! Why did I change my mind!” But sensible people would rather not, and it’d be lovely to have an option to have this moment of mocking torture taken away.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0474b5152e23761776e4416a575d5f9f" data-recommend-id="image://0474b5152e23761776e4416a575d5f9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Let me battle from my friends list." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Let me battle from my friends list." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0474b5152e23761776e4416a575d5f9f" data-recommend-id="image://0474b5152e23761776e4416a575d5f9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Let me battle from my friends list." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Battling random people is very simple, and with a billion-trillion players, you never need to wait for a match. But battling someone specific is currently a more convoluted affair. You need to create a password, and then that other person needs to enter the same password, then you have the game search for others using that word to pair up. It works, and that’s all fine, but it could be <em>so</em> much simpler. There’s a friends list! You can click on profiles of people you’ve befriended, view their battle record, see their emblems, number of cards, and unlocked achievements. But you cannot just click to send a battle request. Which is bonkers.</p><p>So, you know, add that.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8528ed5192a41ca4148019b20a667e4e" data-recommend-id="image://8528ed5192a41ca4148019b20a667e4e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fix the whole UI!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fix the whole UI!" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8528ed5192a41ca4148019b20a667e4e" data-recommend-id="image://8528ed5192a41ca4148019b20a667e4e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fix the whole UI!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>What a mess this game is. It’s like new features were added via a game of pin the tail on the donkey, the developers blindfolding themselves before slapping a button or core element into the UI.</p><p>The eight different pages of the Shop, split into three sections, with a page in two of them that’s just completely blank, are indicative of what a muddle everything is. It needs to be screwed up into a ball and thrown away, starting over entirely.</p><p>As mentioned, the option to spend Pack Points is hidden only on the page for opening packs, while buttons to access your own decks appear at random in different places on the screen, in different sections, but then disappear on the sub-pages where you want them most. There are seven different pages of missions (although that goes up and down as events come and go), but for some reason one of them (Themed Collections) is on a button separate from all the other tabs. Absolutely everything is loopy, and it’s far too hard to remember where you’re supposed to go for each disparate element.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b35f61335ba97000f6df54b8d4390f6f" data-recommend-id="image://b35f61335ba97000f6df54b8d4390f6f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Make Premium something worth paying for." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Make Premium something worth paying for." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b35f61335ba97000f6df54b8d4390f6f" data-recommend-id="image://b35f61335ba97000f6df54b8d4390f6f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Make Premium something worth paying for." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>OK, this is where it gets a bit more serious. Of all the strangest choices this deeply strange card game makes, the paid-for Premium Missions are the worst. Asking people for $10 a month, and then offering a handful of desultory tasks with insultingly poor rewards, all easily completed in a couple of days of casual play, feels like a monstrous misstep.</p><p>Rewards are <em>so</em> awful. Giving paying customers a single Pack Hourglass for completing “Open 20 booster packs,” for instance, is gobsmacking. Weeeeeee, a whole hour off before I can open a new pack! However can you afford to be so generous?!</p><p>A battle pass is supposed to be a series of grinds that give players a motivation to keep coming back all season. Sure, there are crazy people who’ll somehow reach level 200 in <em>Fortnite</em> in the first week, but for normies, it’s a long list of rewards given for continued progress, combined with new missions every day, week, and storyline. And it costs less, and lasts three times as long!</p><p>Or for a more direct comparison, look at <em>Marvel Snap</em>. For the fee, you get an enormously long list of unlocks that’ll take you weeks to finish, unlocking the coolest versions of favorite cards, and all manner of other decorative bonuses. In this light, <em>Pocket’s </em>battle pass is outrageous, its embarrassing handful of rewards gained almost immediately (five Mewtwo-themed decorations, and a single Pikachu card), the Premium section of both the Missions and the Shop then just left grayed out and a grim reminder of wasted money for the other 29 days in the month.</p><p>Yes, you get an extra pack a day for this too. That’s not nothing. But it’s also nowhere near enough.</p><p>This desperately needs to be improved, or people are going to bail on it in droves. In fact, the launch version has been so awful that some sort of redress seems in order, an apologetic pile of hourglasses and shop tickets handed to us suckers who forked out in the hope that it would update or improve at some point after the two week free trial.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Meanwhile, your Mage covers you on the heavy-hitting magical damage. Your Thief, meanwhile, can use AOE weapons, learn some of the best out-of-battle abilities in the game, and always has a chance to steal items at the end of battles. Lastly, as you can guess, your Priest will ensure your team’s health stays topped off, and they’ll eventually even learn a resurrection spell that is a borderline must-have in long, difficult dungeons.</p><figure id="" data-id="c817dc2f5a1e2bbd696d8b0f0c7abfe0" data-recommend-id="image://c817dc2f5a1e2bbd696d8b0f0c7abfe0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The party fights monsters in a building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The party fights monsters in a building." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c817dc2f5a1e2bbd696d8b0f0c7abfe0" data-recommend-id="image://c817dc2f5a1e2bbd696d8b0f0c7abfe0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The party fights monsters in a building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This setup covers every base in terms of offense, defense, and support to ensure that you’re rarely in a position where your team doesn’t have an advantage. Additionally, these archetypes provide you with fantastic foundations for class changes later in the game, letting you keep the skills you’ve learned while opening up a path to discover all-new ones, too.</p><p>There are certainly other options you should try if and when you’re comfortable doing so, as <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>’s various vocations all have their uses in battle and beyond. For instance, perhaps it’s worth taking a look at the game’s new Monster Wrangler vocation.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rollercoaster-tycoon">RollerCoaster Tycoon</a> Classic is heading to Switch at the start of next month.</p>
<p>As announced by Atari, the theme park sim will arrive on 5th December, with the Switch version joining its availability on mobile and PC.</p>
<p>The re-release pairs the original RollerCoaster Tycoon with its sequel, bringing updated UI and controls.</p>

<p>These two games are generally considered the best in the series, and even if they're showing their age, their simplicity is charming compared to more recent sim games.</p>
<p>Indeed, it's great timing from Atari just after the release of Frontier's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a>, a game with far more modern enhancements.</p>
<p>Atari is the sole publisher of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series, after<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-has-bought-rollercoaster-tycoon-3-for-7m"> acquiring the rights to the third game from Frontier</a> earlier this year. Atari boss Wade Rosen said at the time this would bring "new opportunities for Atari" and "benefits to the fans of games across the Rollercoaster Tycoon franchise".</p>
<p>This Switch release of RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic (not the third game) is the only follow-up news so far, so it's unclear what's in store for the rest of the series.</p>
<p>For an alternative, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acclaimed-theme-park-management-sim-parkitect-hits-playstation-and-xbox-this-week">Parkitect was released on PlayStation and Xbox consoles</a> earlier this year, following its previous PC release. It's a classic take on the theme park sim genre, akin to RollerCoaster Tycoon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Virtua Fighter is finally making its return to PC with the release of Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. For those who are excited about the return of this beloved franchise, the game is now available to be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3112260/Virtua_Fighter_5_REVO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlisted on Steam</a>. This <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-game-is-in-development-sega-confirms/">news comes after Sega confirmed that a new Virtua Fighter</a> game was in the works just a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; This title is based on Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown and is set to provide players with an optimized gaming experience. The game will be offering support of 4K60 and is the first game in 13 years to feature balance adjustments. The upcoming title is also set to support rollback netcode, which will allow players who don't have access to a wired connection to enjoy a smoother experience on the battlefield and will allow everyone around the globe to participate in heated battles.</p>
<p>At the moment, there aren't too many details that are being revealed about Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O., as Sega is currently keeping it all under wraps. However, it's been confirmed that a 2.0 update is planned for Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown for those who are playing the game on PlayStation 4. To celebrate the announcement of Virtua Fighter coming to PC, the Opening Cinematic trailer has been released to show off some of the content that players can expect from the upcoming title. The video is just over two and a half minutes long and showcases some of the iconic fighters that will be making an appearance in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="VIRTUA FIGHTER 5 R.E.V.O. - Opening Cinematic" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/einEYdj3nAQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O will feature all of the beloved classic game modes, such as Arcade and Rank Match, with the ability to create custom online tournaments and leagues with up to 16 players. For those who are trying to become the best with their Kung Fu skills, you can also watch in Spectator Mode so that you can take notes from the battles you are watching.</p>
<p>According to the Steam page of the game, there will be 19 playable characters, each with their own unique fighting style. Of course, like most modern fighting games, you'll be able to customize them with accessories and costumes that make them feel personalized to you.</p>
<p>Along with the Arcade and Rank Match game modes, there will also be the Training and Versus game modes, providing plenty of variety for those who aren't sure what game mode they want to start with.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. when it comes out?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizkids-announces-new-monster-manual-2024-miniatures-for-dungeons-dragons<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizkids has announced a new line of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> miniatures. These miniatures aren't based on a setting like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wizkids-planescape-whirlwyrm-and-adult-time-dragon-minis-review-not-in-faerun" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Planescape</em></a> or on a module like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-dd-miniatures-review-miska-wolf-spider-is-ready-to-fight" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em></a><em>, </em>but are based on new monsters found in the upcoming <em>Monster Manual 2024</em>.</p>

<h2>The Wizkids <em>Monster Manual 2024</em> Miniatures Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the first wave of the <em>Monster Manual 2024</em> miniatures being produced by Wizkids are two adult dragons. Those two dragons are Adult Black Dragon Corruptor and Adult Red Dragon Tyrant.</p>

<p><em>Monster Manual 2024</em> is the last of three updated rulebooks for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. All three books include updated foundational rules for the fantasy TTRPG, essentially updating the game's rules from 2014's Fifth Edition to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em>.</p>

<p>Those changes have included glow-ups to player classes such as the Monk and making the game's complex rules and charts easier to parse for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dungeon Masters</a>. In that vein, <em>Monster Manual 2024</em> will update classic monsters alongside new entries for players to face.</p>

<p>While this updated <em>Monster Manual</em> isn't available yet, the press release did provide some screenshots of these new dragon miniatures. Screenshots that may provide some insight into how these dragons have changed.</p>

At first glance, the visual design of the black dragon appears unchanged from <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition. Black scales, bull-like horns, acid breath weapon.</p>

<p>But look a bit closer and this dragon has some new attachments. The first is its wings, which have a gnarled design. The tips look like boney claws or talans, which may imply a nastier wing attack in its repertoire. Second is the tail which is now pointed like a scorpion's stinger.</p>

<p>This may hint at a more aggressive use of acid or debilitating tactics, it is called a Corruptor after all. This is a possibility considering disease and poison appears to be getting more focus in the new 2024 ruleset.</p>

Red dragons in Dungeons &amp; Dragons are characterised as vain, prideful, condescending, and covetous of treasure. In that context, Tyrant seems like redundant statement.</p>

<p>But the new design does have some new traits. There's a secondary color of charcoal black running across the entire body, which adds some variety to the dragon's look. It also invokes molten rock or burnt forests, which does make it more menacing at a glance.</p>

<p>The press release corroborates this. It states that Red Dragon Tyrants are drawn to volcanic mountaintops and burning wastelands. Places where they don't just build up their treasure hoards, but their armies as well.</p>

<p>Both of the dragon miniatures in the <em>Monster Manual 2024</em> product line will be available both painted and unpainted. Each dragon takes up a 75 mm base and has an impressive 8-inch wingspan. They will be available in stores July 2025 at an MSRP of $79.99 (Prepainted) and $59.99 (Unpainted) respectively.</p>
