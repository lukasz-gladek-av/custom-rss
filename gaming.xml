			<p>We've repeatedly reported that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 was extremely successful. Saber Interactive's long-awaited third-person shooter sequel <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-already-sold-two-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> two million units in the first twenty-four hours on the market and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-5-million-units-will-get-dlss-fsr-frame-generation-with-next-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> the five-million milestone by the end of November.</p>
<p>It was one of the best-selling games released in 2024, which made it also very profitable for license holder Games Workshop. In their <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/ost7hseic9hc/1alE9DriNd0GJq1SYKn3ZY/e14d3ff03635ea919c569f075b25c60a/2024-25_half_year_report_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half-year financial report</a> published on Tuesday, they explained:</p>
<p><em>During the period, our licensing partners launched two new video games; Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, a third person shooter for PC and console and Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks, a combat racing game. Established games continue to contribute, alongside royalty income earned following the success of Space Marine 2. We recognise that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games. Clearly, we are looking for the next one. We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income. [....] </em></p>
<p><em>Licensing revenue from royalty income increased in the period by £18.0 million to £30.1 million (at constant currency rates, an increase of £19.3 million to £31.4 million). Royalty income is recognised in line with IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’; ‘guarantee income’ is recognised in full at the inception of the contract where the performance obligations of the contract have been met and additional ‘earned income’ is recognised when it can be reliably measured following reporting by licensees. Earned income was £26.1 million (2023/24: £5.9 million), the increase being mainly from Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2.</em></p>
<p>Games Workshop is very much right about the volatility of such successes. There's been a plethora of Warhammer and Warhammer 40K games in the last decade or so, but no title ever came close to this level of commercial acclaim. It won't be easy at all to find another big hit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Saber Interactive plans to expand Space Marine 2 with lots of new content <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-outlines-2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned</a> for the rest of 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-update-011-full-patch-notes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>Update 0.1.1 lands tomorrow, and Grinding Gear Games has revealed the official full patch notes ahead of the update's release.</p>

<p>You can expect an update that's roughly on a similar scale to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-update-010e" rel="nofollow">December's Update 0.1.0e</a>; while there's no single massive feature that will completely overhaul&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s gameplay, there are tons of smaller changes that should result in a smoother experience.</p>

<p>Four new endgame tower map areas have been introduced in the form of Alpine Ridge, Bluff, Mesa, and Sinking Spire, and the Lost Towers map has been revamped in order to make it a little more interesting to explore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-2-update-0.1.1-tower.jpg?itok=tnyqoAUN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-2-update-0.1.1-tower.jpg?itok=EVJA7PK0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>Update 0.1.1 brings changes to the endgame, plus lots more.</figcaption></figure><p>The Arbiter of Ash boss fight has also been redesigned so that you'll have more attempts; rather than only getting to try this boss once, you can now tackle it up to six times, with higher difficulties lowering the number of respawns you get.</p>

<p>Other changes have also been made to this boss fight; the falling flame seed skill can't be interrupted anymore, and the boss is now invulnerable for a longer duration after emerging.</p>

<p>As you might expect, the new&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>update has an absolute ton of changes besides the ones I've listed here, so if you want to see the full changelog, you can check out the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3695606" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes via the game's official forum</a>.</p>




<p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>is, believe it or not, the sequel to the original&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>. Like its predecessor, the game is an action RPG, but unlike its predecessor, it's not free-to-play;&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>started out as a massive update for the original game before its devs realized it was big enough to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-will-be-standalone-game-closed-beta-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">spin off into a separate title</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/path-of-exile-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/path-of-exile-2-game-preview/9ND8N4RW5GHX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Update 0.1.1 lands tomorrow.

            <p>Thousands of people who bought the "N95-grade" Razer Zephyr face mask during the Covid-19 pandemic are finally getting a refund for the dodgy mask, months after US agencies ordered a $1 million payout from the gaming hardware company. The Federal Trade Commission are sending out cheques as we speak. I don't know if I should be glad that a trading standards agency has done its job, or depressed that over 6,700 people thought this mask looked good enough to buy in the first place.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Razer launched their Zephyr face mask during the pandemic, advertising it as a medical-grade N95 mask capable of filtering out the harmful virus. But that was false: the mask was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/razer-to-pay-out-over-1-million-in-refunds-over-its-misleading-and-hideous-zephyr-face-mask">never proven able to do that</a>. It wasn't even submitted to the federal agencies in the United States who could deem it worthy of the important N95 badge of reliability. In other words, this was a case of "deceptively" advertising a false product, say the Federal Trade Commission, who this week are sending out the refunds in the form of cheques and PayPal transfers to 6,764 people who bought the mask.</p>
<p>"Recipients will get a full refund," say the FTC in <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/ftc-sends-more-1-million-full-refunds-customers-deceived-false-claims-n95-grade-zephyr-face-masks">a post explaining that the money is rolling out</a> (as spotted by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/razer-sold-bogus-n95-mask-for-100-in-2021-users-finally-get-refunds/">Ars Technica</a>). "Consumers should cash their check within 90 days, as indicated on the check, or redeem their PayPal payment within 30 days."</p>
<p>The RGB-lit face mask was tried out by tech reviewer Naomi Wu when it first appeared in November 2021. She pointed out the mask's weird design in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDzhGjbvVGc">a video</a> titled "The Razer Zephyr is completely useless - but it has potential". She argued that it was not medically certified as an N95 mask, even if it used the same components as other masks that had passed through the official grading process. Razer's PR department saw the reviewer's remarks and went into something of a tailspin, with the PR chief sending internal emails to ask about the mask, recognising that the unsubstantiated claims were a big problem.</p><p>"Do we have any certifications to back the N95-grade claim? Are we currently in the process of being officially certified/listed as a N95-grade product?... From a consumer and media POV, the key question here is: Does Zephyr offer the same protection as an N95 face mask? If it does, how can we prove that? And if it doesn't, our marketing is misleading."</p>
<p>At the same time, Razer PR were also pressuring the reviewer to change her video's title, which is quite overbearing behaviour from a press perspective. </p>
<p>But lo, the gondola of goofs does not end. During the mask's development, a company called Intertek were hired by Razer to test the mask's filtering capabilities. And thoses tests showed it did not live up to N95 standards. "[We] suggest not to indicate N95," an Intertek employee told Razer, "as it is not relevant to this product, and the claim will cause confusion." Razer seems to have ignored that recommendation.</p>
<p>The FTC, unsurprisingly, took a dim view of all this. "Accordingly, Razer was aware from Intertek, its own employees, and Ms. Wu that their claims regarding the Zephyr’s N95 status were misleading," said the trade body in their lawsuit.</p>
<p>The mask is no longer being sold by Razer, who soon agreed on the settlement of $1 million in refunds with the FTC. Despite all this evidence that piled up <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Razer-PACER-No1-Complaint.pdf">during the FTC case</a>, the hardware company have denied doing anything wrong. </p><p>"We disagree with the FTC’s allegations and did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement," they said in a statement following the FTC's ruling back in May. "It was never our intention to mislead anyone, and we chose to settle this matter to avoid the distraction and disruption of litigation and continue our focus on creating great products for gamers."</p>
<p>Great products? Well, let us be the judge of that. I first heard about the crap mask when James and Alice B (RPS in peace) discussed it on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OR5gfr5Yyxe4oOOzDE0q1?si=f6c5eb4bc85a42bc">the Electronic Wireless Show</a>, delivering some very funny takedowns of the hideous-looking accessory. </p>
<p>"I'm not going to mourn the Zephyr," said James, "besides the fact that it was overstating effectiveness against Covid at a time when people were literally dying of Covid, it's just a stupid product - I hate it. Never mind all the medical tests. It fails the test of: if you wore this while walking down the street would you look like a bellend?"</p>
<p>Razer have since turned their attention to Snap Tap, a keyboard feature that has been banned from several esports tournaments for giving high-level players an unfair advantage when it comes to pushin' buttons fast. Although hardware czar James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inside-snap-tap-the-new-hotness-keyboard-feature-outlawed-by-valve">thoroughly tried it out</a> and says us regular schmucks will experience no such boost. Another point to him for cutting through the noise. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a recent post on Reddit, several RuneScape users started discussing a survey they were privy to from Jagex. The survey pertained to membership changes in Runescape, and it opened with several video clips and then screenshots of <strong>many </strong>options for potential membership packages and tiers.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to notice that some of these tiers and options were nothing short of shocking, with some requesting payment but still including ads, while others put ‘enhanced player support’ and ‘account security features’ behind sizeable paywalls.</p>

<h2 id="h-beginning-of-the-end">Beginning of the End</h2>



<p>It’s not a new concept for RuneScape – the monetisation model has been around for quite some time (more than 20 years), but owing to inflation, the costs are increasing. In a recent survey that was shared on Reddit, it was revealed that Jagex intends to make membership tiers more lucrative and loaded with bonus features, but players have come away from the revelation feeling disappointed.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1i2c8ig/heres_what_the_full_survey_looks_like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on Reddit</a> revealed many membership tiers, which users were requested to give feedback on.</p>



<p>As the tiers went higher, the price rose considerably, with one month sitting at $10.99 for the lowest tier, while the highest tier had a price point of around $32.49 in some images. The features of these tiers also changed dramatically, starting with elements like:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘Ads included’</li>



<li>Mobile-only access</li>



<li>Shorter AFK timer</li>
</ul>



<p>And quickly ascending to features including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Improved data access</li>



<li>Pre-verified account recovery</li>



<li>Name reservations</li>



<li>Pause membership</li>



<li>Enhanced player support</li>



<li>Advanced account security features</li>
</ul>



<p>It sounds obvious, but with these new proposals, the more you pay, the more you get. However, charging around $10 – $14 a month and still including ads in the bundle feels bizarre at best. On top of that, users will be charged up to $15 for additional member characters <strong>per month</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of one of these tier bundles:</p>

<p>Put simply, you could end up paying more than $300 a year to play RuneScape with all the bells and whistles attached, some of which players are arguing should be inherently included in <strong>any </strong>RuneScape account. Paying for security features and player support just feels strange and a little like being cheated.</p>



<p>What do you think of these bundles and tiers? Would you pay this much to play RuneScape? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Guys, it is here. After what feels like days and days (and daaaaays) of page refreshes and thumb twiddling, Nintendo has finally lifted the lid perhaps not fully but some of the way off its much anticipated Switch successor.</p>
<p>Today's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">short trailer for Switch 2</a>, to give it its proper name, is clearly designed to merely whet appetites at this time. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo has announced a Direct in April</a>, when we can expect more details on the console, and maybe even what games we can expect to see (in addition to today's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">confirmation a new Mario Kart game is on the cards</a>).</p>
<p>But, while short, this trailer has seemingly confirmed that the Switch 2's Joy-Cons will boast that previously rumoured mouse functionality. At one point during the trailer, two Joy-Cons can be seen being pushed by an invisable force along a flat service, their wrist straps out the back like little mouse tails. Meanwhile, there seems to be some kind of attachment that gives the side of the Joy-Con a smooth edge.</p>

		<p>Nintendo’s reveal of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> came with a big teaser for what will be easily the console’s biggest game: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-9">Mario Kart 9</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout the short video that showed off the Switch 2’s hybrid design and how it’s been changed compared to the original Nintendo Switch, a Mario Kart game was running on the console’s screen in handheld mode, and when docked. Check it out:</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 – First-look trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxLUf2kRQRE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s plenty of tidbits to dig out of this, most notably that this was a never-before-seen Mario Kart game, featuring a brand new circuit: Mario Bros. Circuit.</p>


<p>Mario Bros. Circuit takes us to a desert location with a proper race track design to it, though a track that quickly veers off the tarmac and onto the baked dirt of the desert, and eventually careening onto a multi-lane highway with traffic on it, where a Yoshi branded motoway-side diner or filling station could be seen as the camera pulled out to show a huge landscape, by Mario Kart standards.</p>

<p>We spotted a bunch of returning characters, taken from the regular cast of playable characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario</li>
<li>Luigi</li>
<li>Peach</li>
<li>Daisy</li>
<li>Rosalina</li>
<li>Toad</li>
<li>Toadette</li>
<li>Donkey Kong</li>
<li>Bowser</li>
<li>Yoshi</li>
</ul>
<p>These characters were driving a variety of different vehicles, including traditional kart/ATV styles, bikes, and a new tracked snowmobile for Rosalina.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">Today’s Nintendo Switch 2 announcement</a> was pretty abstract outside of Mario Kart 9, showing lots of points of comparison how the console has changed from the original Switch design. It shows the added USB-C port on the top of the console, the new kick stand design, the enlarged Joy-Con with new magnetic snap attachment mechanism. The console shares the same hybrid approach as the original Switch with detachable Joy-Con for docked or tabletop play.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 is coming out in 2025, with Nintendo reconfirming that it will have backward compatibility to Nintendo Switch games, both digital and cartridge. Outside of that, details remain sparse, but given how Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has continued to sell and sell and sell, Nintendo has put its strongest foot forward already.</p>
<p>A Nintendo Direct is planned for 2nd April 2025 which will no doubt showcase all of the launch games and give all the juicy launch details and pricing. In the meantime, we’ll have to go back to the rumour mill and speculation…</p>

<hr><h2>Fifth Place -&nbsp;The Rise of the Golden Idol</h2>



<p>Developer: Color Gray Games | Release Date: November 12th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Otton</p>

<p><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em> was easily one of my favorite games in recent years, and thankfully the sequel <em>The Rise of the Golden Idol </em>doesn't disappoint. An exercise in beautiful simplicity,<em> Rise of the Golden Idol </em>is amazing at making you feel like a genius (or idiot for an extended period) when something finally clicks.</p>

<p><em>Rise </em>brought with it some quality of life updates in this detective/investigation game in how information is organized and how you can quickly access it as you try to suss out exactly what happened in any one scene. There are bigger storylines connected in interesting ways, with plenty of callbacks to the original game as well.</p>

<p>If you like logic-based puzzles or really just want to figure out some mysteries, including some murder mysteries here and there, this game is a no brainer.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Fourth Place - UFO 50</h2>



<p>Developer: Mossmouth, LLC | Release Date: September 18th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Austin Suther</p>

<p>If you love the artform of video games, <em>UFO 50 </em>is the game for you. It’s a digital time capsule with 50 individual games, giving us a glimpse at how technology and gameplay evolved during the early years of the medium, warts and all.</p>

<p>There’s a fun little narrative behind the scenes, with this fake company called UFOsoft, running on fake hardware and a bunch of made-up employees in the credits. It’s fun to explore the history of UFOsoft, but the games themselves are, of course, the highlight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’d be here forever if I explained the ins-and-outs of every game within this collection, but just know these can range from quick, arcade-like experiences to full fledged RPGs. <em>UFO 50</em> is a remarkable achievement in game design.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Third Place -&nbsp;1000xRESIST</h2>



<p>Developer: Sunset Visitor | Release Date: May 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p>

<p><em>1000xRESIST</em> is the kind of interactive experience that is few and far between -- a narrative experience that is equal parts strange and personal, profound and intimate.</p>

<p>Across 15 hours, it encompasses the complexities of high school drama, the anxiety of uncertainty in the face of a pandemic, the existential dread of an alien invasion, the hollow comforts of a religious cult, and the complex cracks in the system by revolution.</p>

<p>It is the kind of narrative that is dense with metaphor and layered meaning. The generational gaps of Watcher, All Mother, and Iris. The recursive nature of humanity throughout the centuries: oppression leading to revolution leading to oppression.</p>

<p>While its gameplay features are light, little more than dialogue options, the experience of <em>1000xRESIST</em> cannot be missed by those that love interactive narrative or thoughtful sci-fi.</p>

<h2>Second Place - Animal Well</h2>



<p>Developer: Shared Memory | Release Date: May 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p>

<p>This game caught my eye as soon as it was revealed -- a tease of puzzles within puzzles, upon release it absolutely delivered. With a core game experience presenting a tight, non-linear Metroidvania, you can enjoy the unsettling atmosphere as you hop through the world. For those who enjoy finding collectibles you'll be treated to unique puzzles and gameplay challenges.</p>

<p>If you scratch just a bit further below the surface, the experience is one that only a few games have managed to pull off so far. No matter what level of interest in this game, it's an entertaining and unique experience for every type of player.</p>

<h2>Winner - Balatro</h2>



<p>Developer: LocalThunk | Release Date: February 20th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Blair Bishop</p>

<p>It was somewhat humorous to see the reaction to <em>Balatro </em>in the run-up to awards season. People simply couldn’t believe a game that looked like that could generate enough hype to last throughout the entire year. So they delved in and saw for themselves how this was possible, and they returned changed. Ashamed that they ever doubted that this was possible.</p>

<p>It’s a testament to how well-designed <em>Balatro </em>is. It’s easy to pick up and play, and it’s easier to find yourself lost in it. Striking the perfect balance between casual muckabouts and all-in numbers games, LocalThunk has created something which will be in the space for years to come.</p>

<p>And maybe even after that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The arrival of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">the Nintendo Switch 2</a> heralds some much-needed improvements over its predecessor, especially its Joy-Con controllers. Here’s a quick breakdown of what the announcement trailer showed us about the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons.</p><p>Before the official reveal of the console, there were rumors alluding to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">how the new Joy-Cons would work and their internal mechanisms</a>. The most significant rumor was that they were held to the console via magnets, and in the reveal video, that appears to be the case. The video features the Joy-Con seemingly snapping to a cover as though attracted by a magnetic force.</p><div><figcaption>The new Joy-Cons snap to everything as though powered by magnets.</figcaption> <p><cite>Gif: Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>The video shows that the Joy-Cons have a protrusion that fits into an oval depression in the main body of the console, plugging into ports (with that iconic Nintendo Switch “snap” sound) instead of sliding down rails. There’s also a button at the top of each controller that is ostensibly how the Joy-Cons detach from the main console, but the reveal video didn’t show that in action. According to some of the Switch 2 rumors reported on by <em>The Verge</em>, pressing that button actuates a pin that will push the Joy-Cons away from the console, and in the video, you can see on the inside track of each controller a small circle at the top that looks like it pushes out.</p><div><figcaption>You can see a tiny protrusion at the top of the Joy-Con that is likely what detaches the controller from the console.</figcaption> <p><cite>Gif: Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>The Joy-Cons, like the Switch 2 itself, are larger. In the version of the console shown in the announcement video, they’re black with accents in the traditional red and blue colors from the original Switch. Other elements from the previous Joy-Cons are still there, like the indicator lights and the SL / SP buttons that are visible when the Joy-Cons are being used individually. The left Joy-Con still has its square screenshot button and the right one has the home button, but directly below that is a new button whose function is still unconfirmed.</p><p>The biggest problem plaguing the original Switch Joy-Cons was a condition known as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">Joy-Con drift</a>. Users reported that their analog sticks would display movement without input from the player, kind of like a cursor moving on a computer screen without moving the mouse. Nintendo didn’t share any information about the internal mechanisms powering the Joy-Cons, so we don’t know how susceptible they will be to this problem.</p><div><p>We’ll know more about the Joy-Cons, along with the console and its upcoming library of games, when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24236766/nintendo-switch-2-games-direct-date-time">Nintendo holds its Switch 2 Direct on April 2nd</a>. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After a waterfall of leaks, it was expected that the Japanese company would make an announcement for the official reveal this week, and then went and threw everyone by just surprise-announcing it at 8 a.m. ET without warning. Within that announcement was a screen showing a date for a new Nintendo Direct.</p><p>This will be the first Nintendo Direct since July 2024, the <em>Mario</em> makers having entirely skipped their usual September edition, which only fueled confusion over what was happening with the Switch 2. It’s described as being for the “Nintendo Switch 2,” but doesn’t make clear if this will be purely detailing the console itself (which many had hoped would already be available by April), or games that will be available for it too.</p><p><em>Mario Kart 9</em>, already widely expected to be a release title (given it’s been an extraordinary 11 years since <em>8</em> first came out), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-9-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-trailer-1851740833&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-9-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-trailer-1851740833">is pretty certain to be among them</a></span>, but fans are obviously hoping to see a new tentpole <em>Super Mario</em> title, given it’s been well over seven years since <em>Odyssey</em> shifted the original Switch.</p><p>We know that Switch 1 (as we’ll have to get used to calling it now) games will mostly work on the new system, both physical and digital editions, but obviously there’s going to be great clamor for brand new titles that’ll take advantage of the new system specs which will also hopefully be fully revealed before or during the Direct.</p><p>Best guess: the Direct will be pre-empted with a lot of leaks from stores about dummy boxes and stock expectations for the Switch 2 itself, with a release date revealed in the Direct broadcast. Maybe early May? Please don’t be later than that, Nintendo.</p><p>Until then, more speculating, rumor-pondering and thumb-twiddling.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Nintendo has seemingly revealed what looks like a brand-new Mario Kart game for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> in the console's trailer.</p><p>Near the end of the Switch 2's reveal trailer, Mario Kart footage of Mario, Luigi, Bowser, Donkey Kong, Peach, and Toad driving through a desert track can be seen with a sign that says "Yoshi," which looks to be some sort of restaurant or gas station.</p><p>While the trailer didn't confirm whether this is an entirely original Mario Kart game as opposed to another expanded port of Mario Kart 8, there's some new details that people have picked up on.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
As part of its highly anticipated (and heavily leaked) first look at Switch 2, Nintendo has shared another date for the calendar; the company has confirmed it'll be sharing more information on its new console on 2nd April this year.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">finally unveiled Switch 2 today</a> after weeks of leaks - but its announcement, as expected, was light on detail. It gave a first look at the machine itself - a fairly subtle revision of the original Switch's familiar form factor at first glance - plus a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">tease of a new Mario Kart game</a>.
</p>
<p>
It also reiterated Switch 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">will be backward compatible</a>, and is capable of playing both digital and physical Switch games. Beyond that, though, Nintendo is saving the juicier details for a later date. And unfortunately, it's going to be a bit of a wait, with the company confirming it'll hosting a Switch 2 focused Nintendo Direct on 2nd April this year.

<p>
That'll almost certainly be when the company does its proper deep dive into the console's features (Miiverse 2 please Nintendo, and Street Pass 2 while you're at it, thank you), alongside the full run-down of games coming to Switch 2 at launch and beyond. A new Mario Kart seems a certainty for launch at this point, for instance, and a Switch 2 version of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">long-in-development Metroid Prime 4</a> appears likely too. Additionally, previous whispers have suggested a new 3D Mario is coming later this year. April's Direct should also provide pricing details and a proper launch date beyond its current vague release window of "2025".
</p><p>

In addition to April's Direct, Nintendo has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">confirmed it'll be holding a Switch 2 "world tour"</a> event, giving the public an opportunity to go hands-on with the console and, presumably, its launch line-up of games. That's due to run from early April to June, suggesting the console won't release until sometime after. Exciting times!

		<p>After <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/14/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-heavily-rumoured-for-thursday/">a metric ton of rumours and reports</a>, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> has been revealed, showing off the revised design of the hybrid console sequel and confirming a 2025 launch.</p>
<p>Watch the reveal trailer here, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">a Nintendo Direct for a full reveal set for 2nd April 2025</a>. In-person preview events are also planned and confirmed for major cities around the world from April through May… which would hint at a June launch, wouldn’t it?</p>

<p>Today’s Nintendo Switch 2 announcement is pretty abstract, showing lots of comparison bits and bobs for how the console has changed in comparison to the original Switch. It’s all black, for one thing, with just a pop of neon blue and neon red on the inner cap of the analogue sti cks, but all-black Joy-Con. It shows the added USB-C port on the top of the console alongside the bottom, the new kick stand design that runs the full width, the enlarged Joy-Con with new magnetic snap attachment mechanism, and with a mysterious new button on the right Joy-Con. The console shares the same hybrid approach as the original Switch with detachable Joy-Con for docked or tabletop play.</p>
<p>The one game teased during this video was Mario Kart 9.</p>
<p>Nintendo reconfirmed that it will have backward compatibility to Nintendo Switch games, both digital and cartridge. Some games might not be fully compatible or supported on Switch 2 with more details coming at a later date.</p>

<p>The much-anticipated successor to the Switch has been heavily leaked over the past year or so, but it’s reached a fever pitch in the first few weeks of this year. Already being expected through 2023 and 2024, Nintendo took the unusual step of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-is-coming-this-fiscal-year-but-not-at-nintendo-direct-in-june/">stating repeatedly that it will be announced before March 2025</a>, and clarifying before every stream that they would not be discussing it. Thankfully we can put all that behind us. Kind of. There’s still a lot of information to be confirmed by Nintendo about the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Since then there’s been leaks about the console’s hardware specs, revealing the Nvidia chipset that is set to replace the Tegra X1 within the original Switch to be a modified Tegra T239. There’s also been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R1p1LjHME8">a big discussion over Nintendo’s upscaling patent</a>, suggestions about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/">the use of MicroSD Express for SSD-like read speeds</a>, and just last week at CES, accessories manufacturer <a href="https://x.com/Numerama/status/1876817276143378586">Genki rocked up to the show with a full suite of bits and bobs for the new console</a>, even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks">prompting Nintendo’s lawyers to visit</a> (though Genki state they’ve never signed an NDA or actually seen an official Switch 2.</p>

			<p>After months of rumors and speculation, the Nintendo Switch 2 has been officially revealed today with a new trailer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxLUf2kRQRE&amp;t=18s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The short trailer</a>, which can be watched below, uses the original consoles as a basis to show how the hardware will change in its next iteration with a bigger screen, different Joy-Con controllers, and more. Unfortunately, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/">previously rumored</a>, the new trailer doesn't provide much information on the games, showing only a seemingly new Mario Kart game that has yet to be officially confirmed, and confirming only that the system will be fully backward compatible with both physical and digital original Switch games. The trailer doesn't even provide a precise release window past the generic 2025 window, but thankfully, it seems we won't be left in the dark for a long time, as a Nintendo Direct focused on the Nintendo Switch 2 will be aired on April 2nd.</p>
<p><iframe title="An update from Nintendo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxLUf2kRQRE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Besides providing a better look at the new system in April, Nintendo also confirmed that in select cities around the world, players will be able to get hands-on with the system. These cities include New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Toronto in North America, Paris, London, Milan, Berlin, Madrid, and Amsterdam in Europe, Melbourne in Oceaniakyo, Seoul, Hong Kong, and Taipei in Asia. Ticket registrations, which require a Nintendo Account, will open tomorrow, January 17th. More information on these hands-on events, including dates for each city, can be found <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-switch-2-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide later this year. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>
