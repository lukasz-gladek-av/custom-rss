            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-40m-concurrent-users<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PC gaming platform Steam has broken another major concurrent player milestone, and this one's a big one, likely driven by the success of games like the recently-released&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>.</p>

<p>As spotted by the ever-reliable <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1896195019419111562" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, Steam passed 40 million concurrent players over the weekend, with 40,017,061 players being logged into the platform at one point yesterday. That, naturally, is an all-time record.</p>

<p>Back in August, the release of Soulslike action game&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>helped Steam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-37m-user-milestone-wukong" rel="nofollow">break the 37 million concurrent user barrier</a>, so it's impressive that this weekend's total represents a three million increase on that, especially given&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-18m" rel="nofollow">popularity</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-40m-players-monster-hunter-wilds.jpg?itok=KWdMFCbL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-40m-players-monster-hunter-wilds.jpg?itok=Zqr7iyME 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>has proven a big success story on Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>As SteamDB points out, 12.6 million of those players were currently playing games at the time the site logged the new concurrent player record, which means around 27.4 million were either enjoying other features or idling.</p>

<p>Still, 12.6 million people playing games on Steam at the same time is pretty impressive, and I'm sure Valve will be happy that its digital distribution platform still doesn't really seem threatened by its increasing number of rivals.</p>

<p>So, what games helped Steam reach the 40 million count? Perhaps one of the biggest contributors is Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">attracted over a million players</a> at its peak, going on to become the game with the fifth-highest player peak in Steam's history.</p>

<p>Others include many of the usual suspects;&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2 </em>has enjoyed 1.75 million players over the last 24 hours, and other big hitters like&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dota 2</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint&nbsp;</em>all hit peak player counts in the hundreds of thousands.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/counter-strike-2-steam-40m-players.jpg?itok=F7GXgCeB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/counter-strike-2-steam-40m-players.jpg?itok=4ziorc4F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>has a pretty respectable 24-hour player peak on Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>In other recent Steam news, Valve has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-early-access-update-warning-feature" rel="nofollow">implemented a new feature</a> that informs you if it's been a while since an Early Access game received an update, although the feature seems a little temperamental at the moment.</p>

<p>The latest Steam Next Fest is also underway, and our own Don has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/10-steam-next-fest-best-demos-february-2025" rel="nofollow">compiled a list of some of the best demos</a> the event has to offer.</p>

With two considerable zones to explore, nearly 100 side-quests and activities, and main story missions that take hours to tackle apiece, it’s a slog in some spots. You’ll likely require a palette cleanser afterward, but a familiar one, and we have the perfect recommendations!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b56946dd13d14a6261d615a45b37dff0" data-recommend-id="image://b56946dd13d14a6261d615a45b37dff0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arthur Morgan involved in a robbery in Red Dead Redemption 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Arthur Morgan involved in a robbery in Red Dead Redemption 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rockstart</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b56946dd13d14a6261d615a45b37dff0" data-recommend-id="image://b56946dd13d14a6261d615a45b37dff0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arthur Morgan involved in a robbery in Red Dead Redemption 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Few open-world story-driven experiences compare to <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. I will stand by the Wild West tale as one of the most perfect forms of entertainment. When you think about it (not too deeply), there are a lot of similarities between protagonists Henry and Arthur. They both ride horses, for example, and sometimes, they even fight bandits. But more importantly, it’s a tale that sticks with you long after the credits roll—the type of experience you tell your non-gaming parents about at a family dinner.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="28c21b2fec640e10cf70e3e65d54d2c4" data-recommend-id="image://28c21b2fec640e10cf70e3e65d54d2c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A combat scene involving knights and Vikings in Mordhau." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A combat scene involving knights and Vikings in Mordhau." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Triternion</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="28c21b2fec640e10cf70e3e65d54d2c4" data-recommend-id="image://28c21b2fec640e10cf70e3e65d54d2c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A combat scene involving knights and Vikings in Mordhau." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In my opinion, the <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> series’ combat is one of the most challenging aspects. It’s frantic, complex, occasionally rewarding, but primarily annoying. That said, if you can’t get enough one-on-one combat against the NPC bandits and knights wandering the world of Bohemia in <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, <em>Mordhau</em> proves an excellent battleground to refine your combat capabilities further. It offers a similar fighting style, with directional-based strikes, and since you’re facing real-world players you can grow accustomed to frenzied fighting styles relatively fast.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5bc33a72359a694cb0d6c860de674521" data-recommend-id="image://5bc33a72359a694cb0d6c860de674521" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A promotional screenshot of a siege from Kingdom Come: Deliverance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A promotional screenshot of a siege from Kingdom Come: Deliverance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warhorse</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5bc33a72359a694cb0d6c860de674521" data-recommend-id="image://5bc33a72359a694cb0d6c860de674521" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A promotional screenshot of a siege from Kingdom Come: Deliverance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s the most obvious choice when discussing what to play after <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>. If you have the time, finishing up or starting the first game will allow you to better understand the sequel’s story, the world of medieval Bohemia, and the characters themselves, many of whom return for the sequel, such as Henry and Sir Hans Capon. All that said, <em>KCD </em>requires a significant investment, as it can take up to 100 hours to finish. I know, I know! Who didn’t play the first game before beating the second? Me, it’s me.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e7c347a32bef1af1d47ec56fd28915a4" data-recommend-id="image://e7c347a32bef1af1d47ec56fd28915a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" A large cavalry charge in Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" A large cavalry charge in Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->TaleWorlds Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e7c347a32bef1af1d47ec56fd28915a4" data-recommend-id="image://e7c347a32bef1af1d47ec56fd28915a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" A large cavalry charge in Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Another title with similar combat, but a bit more depth than <em>Mordhau</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>is<em> Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</em>, the long-awaited action RPG from TaleWorlds Entertainment. With similar, albeit more forgiving, directional combat, <em>Bannerlord </em>thrusts you into a vast sandbox set in a fictional medieval land full of knights and lords, with trade caravans to raid and men and women to woo. It’s the type of open-world experience that doesn’t hold your hand, allowing you to craft a story and rise to legendary status.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8f5f89f78893d26edf8c9a13b5b024bb" data-recommend-id="image://8f5f89f78893d26edf8c9a13b5b024bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The in-game map of territories in Crusader Kings 3." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The in-game map of territories in Crusader Kings 3." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paradox Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8f5f89f78893d26edf8c9a13b5b024bb" data-recommend-id="image://8f5f89f78893d26edf8c9a13b5b024bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The in-game map of territories in Crusader Kings 3." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you enjoy a game like <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> because of its setting more than its gameplay, then <em>Crusader Kings 3</em> offers a revisionist take on the medieval ages. You choose your noble house, build a dynasty, form alliances, gather troops, and send them to raid or conquer your neighbors, while making decisions in pop-up events that change the course of your life and your family. It’s the perfect medieval game for those who prefer medieval times’ strategy, romance, and politics more than the nitty-gritty blood-n-mud.</p><hr><p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> launched February 4 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. It is a direct sequel to the first game, continuing the story of Henry as he explores Bohemia, finding his path in life following the devastation of his village.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-cheaters-with-lifetime-bans-will-receive-a-second-chance-next-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Fortnite recently released its new anti-cheat policy, which revealed that players with lifetime bans will be offered a second chance in April 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-cheaters-will-receive-a-second-chance">Fortnite Cheaters Will Receive a Second Chance</h2>



<p>Fortnite has confirmed that players who have received a lifetime ban for cheating in the game and have been banned for more than a year can return to matchmaking in April 2025, when the new update rolls out. Players who have cheated in tournaments will not be able to participate in competitive events; however, they can also enter matchmaking in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting in April, Fortnite’s lifetime ban policy for cheaters will change. First-time offenders will now receive a year’s ban, after which they will receive a second chance to return to the game. However, if they cheat again, a lifetime ban will be enforced. Players who sell cheats or break other rules, resulting in a lifetime ban, will not receive a second chance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s new <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-anti-cheat-update-february-27-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">anti-cheat policy</a> also introduces new PC requirements for tournaments. Players should have an Account Level of 350 or higher to participate in tournaments and enable TPM and Secure Boot while playing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many players wonder whether they will see the return of popular content creators who received lifetime bans for cheating. Jarvis, who was banned in 2019 for using cheat software while live-streaming, has also <a href="https://x.com/liljarviss/status/1895161943725613220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a> to Fortnite’s recent announcement about giving cheaters a second chance.</p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite’s Lawless season introduced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-cowboy-bebop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Cowboy Bebop collaboration</a>. Also, Epic Games recently banned a Fortnite cheater and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/epic-games-bans-fortnite-cheater-forces-them-to-apologize-and-give-back-winnings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced them to apologise and return their winnings</a>. What are your thoughts on Fortnite offering cheaters a second chance?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

HAS. COME.</blockquote><blockquote>A daemon-engine of unspeakable horror, an abomination of iron and heresy, a thing that should not be, and yet — here it is.</blockquote><blockquote>The warp has opened, and it has delivered unto us something far worse than any Black Crusade.</blockquote><blockquote>🔥🚂 THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE IS READY FOR WAR. 🚂🔥</blockquote><blockquote>His whistle drowns out the cries of the fallen.</blockquote><blockquote>His smile is an unblinking omen of annihilation.</blockquote><blockquote>The Emperor weeps. The Omnissiah recoils.</blockquote><blockquote>And yet, it is we who must bear witness.</blockquote><blockquote>Steel yourselves, warriors. Once you see him, you can never unsee him.</blockquote><blockquote>This train has no brakes.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN (as a human from this reality), Tom said he’s also got a few other fun mods in the works, hinting at “a certain green ogre and a particularly mischievous goose.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As far as Thomas goes, while Saber obviously loves Warhammer, I think they were also excited to see some of the more meme-worthy mods — the kind of thing that’s fun to share around the office,” Tom added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There may or may not have been an unofficial understanding that modding tools wouldn’t be released until Thomas made his grand arrival.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-bans-mods-from-public-servers-says-official-mod-tools-are-coming">Saber has had an up and down relationship with Space Marine 2 modders</a> ever since the game’s massive launch last year, but official tools are set to be released to the community further down the line, and the developer has shown a willingness to work with modders and enable them in-game in certain situations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Saber has released early Update 7 patch notes, teased Horde mode, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-stamps-out-live-service-game-talk-amid-backlash-to-fomo-community-events"><u>stamped out live service game talk amid a backlash to 'FOMO' Community Events</u></a>.

To put it in other words, Cena, the WWE's superstar ‘good guy,’ the Make-A-Wish world record holder and all-round much-loved wrestler and actor, became a WWE ‘bad guy’ before we got GTA 6.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/03/gettyimages-2202199096-1740999762452.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">For the first time in over 20 years, John Cena is a WWE bad guy.

No, that doesn’t mean Cena has just leaked his role in GTA 6 (although wouldn’t that be something!). Rather, he’s just leaning into the meme for a bit of social media fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it’s clear that Cena’s a GTA 6 memer at this point, there’s still some speculation that his Instagram post is some cryptic hint about the game itself. Given <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/were-only-a-few-weeks-into-2025-and-already-theres-a-new-gta-6-trailer-2-release-date-theory">the lengths some GTA fans have gone to to try to work out GTA 6’s release date or the release of Trailer 2</a>, perhaps that shouldn’t come as a surprise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So yes, John Cena’s bad guy era has officially begun before we got GTA 6, but it won’t be long before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">GTA 6’s release date after parent company Take-Two committed to its fall 2025 launch window</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December 2023, a former developer at Rockstar <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-rockstar-dev-tries-to-explain-why-gta-6-is-coming-to-pc-after-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s"><u>attempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hits PS5 and Xbox Series X and S</u></a>, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including Take-Two boss Strauss <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6"><u>Zelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Rich Freeda/WWE via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Ubisoft says its goal for the game was to stay as close as possible to the philosophies of mastery and martial arts, as players will be able to focus on investing points in the Mastery skill-trees and gaining ranks in Knowledge.</p><p>Mastery features a traditional gameplay system of earning experience points by leveling up your character through the normal course of play, eliminating targets, and defeating unique enemies like samurai Daisho who lurk inside fortified castles. By earning enough points, players can expand their skills by learning new combo attacks, increasing their proficiency with weapons, and by unlocking new abilities. Yasuke will gain new samurai abilities, while Naoe will gain new stealth-focused skills that will turn her into a lethal assassin.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4452762-ac-shadows-progression.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452762" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4452762-ac-shadows-progression.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452762"></a><figcaption>A closer look at Naoe's Mastery tree in Assassin's Creed Shadows</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4452762-ac-shadows-progression.jpg"></figure><p>What's important to note here is that Naoe and Yasuke share their progression, so if you focus on playing as one character specifically, the other won't be under-leveled when you decide to tag out. "With the unique Mastery trees, we want to give players the freedom to dedicate themselves into a specific weapon, playstyle, or archetype, and ensure they can deepen their mastery of it," associate game director Julien explained in a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/1uXFMBPEpXS1vSH7lPICnN" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>. "The points you invest in a Mastery tree also unlock additional bonuses for that weapon or archetype, further reinforcing your progress."</p><p>Mastery essentially allows you to specialize the direction in which a character grows, but if you ever get tired of the archetype you've developed, these builds can be reset at any time and you can funnel the refunded points into different skills to change up your playstyle.</p><p>When it comes to Knowledge, this can be upgraded by exploring the world around you through non-violent activities. The higher your rank, the better the upgrades you'll unlock for Yasuke and Naoe. Some of the activities you can take part in include finding Lost Pages in temples, praying at shrines, doing some Kuji-kiri Meditation for Naoe, or learning new Kata for Yasuke. Any Knowledge gained by one character will be shared with the other, letting both of the Shadows leads benefit from the exploration done by their counterparts.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-director-reveals-why-game-was-delayed-a-second-time/1100-6528995/">After a few delays</a>, Assassin's Creed Shadows will officially launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on March 20. If you're looking to avoid spoilers, you might want to steer clear of social media as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-out-assassins-creed-shadows-is-out-in-the-wild-spoilers-abound/1100-6529667/">physical copies of the game have made it into the wild</a> and several people are posting spoilers online.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-director-kenji-ozawa-sasanqua<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>director Kenji Ozawa has announced that he's founded his own studio by the name of Studio Sasanqua.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/former-dev-from-netease-games-ouka-studio-establishes-his-own-company-that-wont-push-the-responsibility-of-management-onto-developers/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, the website for Studio Sasanqua went live yesterday, along with a teaser trailer (which is entirely in Japanese) announcing the studio and its name. The studio will apparently begin by working on smaller-scale projects before transitioning to larger games.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, Ozawa <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-director-quits-ouka-joins-square-enix" rel="nofollow">left his previous employer</a>,&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>developer Ouka Studios, back in December. His departure came after the studio reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-layoffs-netease-report" rel="nofollow">laid off a large amount of its employees</a> on the day of the game's release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-new-studio-kenji-ozawa-sasanqua.jpg?itok=Zt_82rBS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-new-studio-kenji-ozawa-sasanqua.jpg?itok=SdUr78gS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>director Kenji Ozawa has founded his own studio.</figcaption></figure><p>Speaking to Automaton, Ozawa said that he was moved to start Studio Sasanqua because he frequently saw managers not taking responsibility for failed projects. Ozawa believes that "management needs to protect creators", and that seems to be what he's intending to do with Studio Sasanqua.</p>

<p>According to Automaton, Ozawa will begin by developing small-scale games in Unreal Engine, but eventually, the goal is to transition to "full-blown, original PC/console games" (that's Automaton's wording, not Ozawa's).</p>

<p>You can check out the brief teaser trailer for Studio Sasanqua right here. Again, be aware that the whole trailer is in Japanese, and there aren't any English subtitles, so you might have to do a little interpretation if you don't speak the language.</p>




<p>Ozawa's previous employer Ouka is just one NetEase-funded studio to be hit with layoffs, project cancellations, or outright closures in recent months.</p>

<p>Others include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">Worlds Untold</a>, the studio run by BioWare veteran Mac Walters, as well as&nbsp;<em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>creator Christofer Sundberg's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/liquid-swords-layoffs-just-cause-creator" rel="nofollow">Liquid Swords</a>. Neither studio has released, or even properly announced, its first game yet.</p>

<p>NetEase also recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">closed down the Seattle studio</a> responsible for working on<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Marvel Rivals</em>, despite the fact that the game has attracted 40 million registered users since launching in December. Sadly, it seems NetEase isn't quite the industry veteran haven it seemed a year or two ago.</p>

<p>Netease recently spoke about their plans to grow Marvel Rivals as a franchise, and one avenue they are focusing on is “crossover events and promotions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/marvel-rivals-crossover-events-and-promotions-with-other-media-confirmed-by-netease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, Netease spoke about its growth strategies for Marvel Rivals during a Q&amp;A section of its Q4 2024 <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netease-inc-ntes-q4-2024-070339624.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a>. When asked about marketing expansions, the developers confirmed that Marvel Rivals will receive “crossover events and promotions with other media to expand the user base.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from crossovers in Marvel Rivals, the developers also spoke about the “wide acclaim” the game has received since the release of Season 1. Moreover, their investments in development and marketing have continued following a “long-term operational strategy”. Regarding esports, the team has a plan in the works and will announce it soon to “enhance the gaming ecosystem”.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has massive potential for crossovers with a name like Disney behind it. Players will also look forward to collaborations with the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well as other games. A game like Fortnite already has its own Marvel Universe; imagine if Marvel Rivals were to join the fray, too. </p>

            <p>Praise Cheesus! We are all absolutely wild for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' cheese naan.</p>
<p>Early in Monstrer Hunter Wilds, players will get the opportunity to partake in an in-game feast which features a delicious-looking cheese naan dish. In fact, I am salivating just thinking about it, brie-lieve me. The dish in question is a generous slab of naan-like bread covered in hot, oozy cheese and yes I may have to now take a break to go and recreate it in my own kitchen.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am clearly not the only one to be won over by how gouda this dish looks. This scene has seemingly caused sales of actual cheese naan to be feta than ever.</p>

<p>A quick search of Monster Hunter Wilds Cheese Naan on social media will bring up a number of users either sharing footage from the game itself, images of their own real-world cheese naan dishes, and yes - a Tokyo restaurant saying the game really  has caused its sales to surge.</p>
<p>For context, here's a look at Monster Hunter Wilds' in-game cheese naan scene.</p>

</p></div>

<p>And here's Tokyo-based Nepalese restaurant Salam Namaste, which thanked Monster Hunter Wilds for boosting its cheese naan sales over the weekend.</p>
<p>"Cheese naan is too popular," the <a href="https://x.com/salamnamaste01/status/1896188428393537908">restaurant wrote on social media</a>. "I had a lot of cheese with me, but it was running out, so I had no choice but to go to Inageya to get some. Thank you, Monster Hunter" (computer translated). Yes, that looked Cheddar Gorge-ous. </p>

<p>The game's cheese naan is certainly proving popular. One player stated they will probably manage to get "100+ hours in Monster Hunter Wilds" before they actually make it beyond the cheese naan scene. "Just rewinding the scene over and over while drool covers the controller," <a href="https://x.com/JoshBeardVO/status/1895631808018202946">they wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Plenty of players have now ventured into the wilds of the takeaway and restaurant world to savour cheese naan for themselves. "I have fulfilled the desire," <a href="https://x.com/doka_pan/status/1896415906508816803">one X user wrote</a> with an accompanying image of naan and curry goodness (see below).</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Xianirth/status/1891447855786705299">Another added</a>: "Because of this particular cutscene in Monster Hunter Wilds, me and the princess got ourselves Cheese Naan at our local restaurant."</p>

<p>"That's hilarious - Monster Hunter Wilds really said, 'Let's make cheese naan the MVP of 2025! 'It's wild to think a game's gooey cheese pull could spark a culinary craze like this," <a href="https://x.com/Jake29972746993/status/1896379721820037450">another social media user wrote</a> in response to the cheesy goodness the Monster Hunter Wilds team has blessed us with. </p>
<p>"Maybe Capcom should send that Nepali restaurant a thank-you note or at least a cheese care package to keep up with the hungry hunters!"</p>
<p>If you want to make your own Monster Hunter Wilds-inspired cheese naan, I had a quick google and have <a href="https://foodess.com/cheese-naan/">saved this recipe to try out later</a>. Hopefully my efforts will be met with similar praise from my family and friends. They will tell me it is grate, or something along those lines, I am sure...</p>
<p>Anyway in the meantime, here's our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-meals-monster-hunter-wilds">guide to the best meals in Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has proved extremely popular for Capcom, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">crossing over the one million player mark on Steam on its debut</a>.</p>
<p>It hasn't all been sunshine, cheese and roses for the game, however. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-responds-after-monster-hunter-wilds-steam-success-is-marred-by-performance-complaints">User reviews for Monster Hunter Wilds remain "Mixed" on Steam</a>, with the PC performance being an ongoing issue. In the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">words of Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia</a>, "lower-end graphics cards with lower VRAM allocations should avoid Monster Hunter Wilds until these issues are rectified".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-capture-monsters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While the word hunt immediately brings death to your target in mind, hunts in Monster Hunter Wilds don't always have to end with the actual demise of your target monsters. On the contrary, there are some good reasons not to kill any of the giant monsters you will meet on your journey in the Forbidden Lands.</p>
<p>Capturing monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds is quite simple, but you will need a few items, which must be used at the right time. These items are <strong>Pitfall or Shock Traps</strong>, and items that can put the monster to sleep once they have fallen into one of the traps, like <strong>Tranq Bombs</strong>, <strong>Tranq Blades</strong>, which can be used as Slinger ammo or <strong>Tranq Ammo</strong>, which is only used with the Bowguns.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250303125731_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The right time to use the items above to capture a monster in Monster Hunter Wilds is when it has been <strong>weakened enough</strong>. You will know a monster is weak enough to be captured when <strong>it starts limping, if its heartbeat is going flat, or if you see a small skull icon on top of the monster's icon on the minimap</strong>. Once you have assured the monster is weak enough, place <strong>one of the two traps on the ground</strong>, wait for the monster to get <strong>caught in it</strong>, and <strong>use any of the Tranq items twice</strong>. Once this is done correctly, the monster will be captured, and your current hunt will be completed successfully, even without having actually taken the monster down.</p>
<p>While capturing monsters is a good way to end hunts slightly faster in Monster Hunter Wilds, there's another good reason to do so if you're farming certain items, as ending hunts by capturing monsters<strong> increases the rarity of quest rewards</strong>. At the same time, some monster parts can only be obtained by killing the monster, so depending on the items you are seeking, you should always consider both options to complete hunts.</p>

            <p>Sonic Unleashed is finally available on PC thanks to a fan-made port with modern quality of life features.</p>
<p>Unleashed is the Sonic game with the rubbish werehog bits, but its actual Sonic levels are brilliant - their mix of sidescrolling and 3D styles formed the basis of games in the series ever since - and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-generations">Sonic Generations</a> in particular.</p>
<p>The game was originally released for PS3 and Xbox 360 (as well as PS2 and Wii), and now the 360 version has been unofficially ported to PC as Unleashed Recompiled.</p>

<p>New features include an uncapped framerate, comprehensive visual options to customise, ultrawide support, built-in achievements, and controller icons for whichever controller you use.</p>
<p>In short, this is now the best way to play Sonic Unleashed, although you'll need a legitimate copy of the Xbox 360 game to get it running. You can <a href="https://github.com/hedge-dev/UnleashedRecomp?tab=readme-ov-file">download Unleashed Recompiled on github</a>.</p>
<p>Almost all the modern Sonic games are available on Steam at present, including Sonic x Shadow Generations, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-frontiers">Sonic Frontiers</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-superstars">Sonic Superstars</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-colours-ultimate">Sonic Colors: Ultimate</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-adventure">Sonic Adventure</a> 1 and 2, the Sonic racing games, and even Sonic Lost World.</p>
<p>Sonic Unleashed, then, is a curious omission from Sega. Should this fan-made port be a success, perhaps an official version could be released in future.</p>
<p>Sega's last release was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>, which does include an Unleashed-themed level as part of the original Sonic Generations. The new Shadow levels are fantastic.</p>
<p>It's unknown what's next for the series, though Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka said Sonic Frontiers' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-frontiers-is-cornerstone-of-future-sonic-games-says-sonic-team-head">open zone style is now the "cornerstone of future Sonic games"</a>.</p>
<p>In film land, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-movie-gets-a-release-date-but-its-still-a-few-years-away">Sonic the Hedgehog 4 has already been greenlit</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has been racking up the skulls, attracting well over a million simultaneous Steam players this weekend despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review">a mixed player reaction</a>, with particular scorn reserved for its technical performance.</p>
<p>Now begins the process of patching the behemoth to address some player-reported problems with certain quests. Patching is sort of like slaughtering a Monster in reverse: sewing on horns and tails rather than chopping them off, re-embowelling the shackled form of the creature so that it can gallop across the plains, monstrous and free.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Capcom's first hotfix - <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1896145626158772460">now live on Steam</a> - isn't actually about the Monsters, mind you. It gets rid of an issue with the Smithy whereby "weapon upgrading tutorials are repeatedly shown, disabling certain options in the menu." They've also gone after a technical bungle whereby "the 'Grill a Meal' and 'Ingredient Center' features can't be unlocked, even though the progress criteria is met by the player." 
</p>
<p>
There's already another hotfix update coming down the pipe for problems with the Ingredient Center and Grill a Meal. This second update also tackles a more severe bug whereby a crucial NPC wouldn't appear during the mission "A World Turned Upside Down", blocking your progress. It <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1896522237118734658">launches today</a>, March 4th, at 12am PST and 8am GMT.
</p>
<p>
Capcom are aware of additional reports that players can't complete the main mission quest "Omens", in which you "investigate the regions and raise your Hunter Rank", if they've already reached the Hunter Rank cap. This appears to be more of an in-game miscommunication, however: even if you have reached the cap, you'll still be able to finish this quest by collecting HR points through optional quests or side missions. "We apologise that the mission description was not comprehensive on this occasion," Capcom <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1896159434776215583">comment</a>.
</p>
<p>
I suspect many of you reading this are more interested in tune-ups for the frame-rate. In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-best-settings">Monster Hunter Wilds PC settings and performance guide</a>, James called the game a "graphics card torture device" that, amongst other things, tries to use frame generation as a crutch. "Wilds is just unusually demanding in a general sense, sometimes granting a few moments of smoothness in a tight cave or confined tent yet collapsing to a nearly half that performance level once you get out into the wide open world," he wrote.</p>
<p>Capcom's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/534343407476147387?l=english">launch-day troubleshooting guide</a> leaves much to be desired, suggesting that players update their graphics drivers and try running the thing in administrator mode. Perhaps you should experiment with turning your PC on and off as well, or throwing a towel over it. Meanwhile, Capcom are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youll-need-to-pay-to-edit-your-monster-hunter-wilds-character-beyond-the-first-free-redo">taking the piss as ever with their DLC</a>.

<p>The main mission 5-1: Omens asks players to "Investigate the regions and raise your HR", but some players have already reached the Hunter Rank cap and have been unable to progress.</p>

<p>Capcom's latest game in the series is seeing meteoric success, not only peaking on Steam at 1.3 million concurrent players, but propelling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-propels-steam-to-highest-ever-player-count">Steam to its highest ever concurrent player numbers</a>.</p>
<p>Still, the launch hasn't been without its issues - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">PC version in particular has poor performance</a> that's been heavily criticised.</p>
<p>At least Capcom is speedily investigating and fixing any smaller issues that arise.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mods-address-biggest-issues/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A couple of new Monster Hunter Wilds mods that were released online in the past few hours address one of the game's biggest issues: its low challenge level.</p>
<p>The first one of these mods is the self-explanatory <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/136?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hard(er) Mode mod</a>, which comes in multiple variants that increase either the damage dealt by a Monster or their HP or both at the same time. This mod should also be safe to use for online play, although it is advisable not to use it to play with random players as they may not appreciate the increased difficulty over the vanilla game. As for which combination of damage and HP increase is the best, it really depends on the player. I have completed a few hunts with the 1.6x HP and 1.6 ATK option, and I have found it balanced enough with tier 7 Artian weapons and some late High Rank gear and Decorations, which are far from being the absolute best the game currently has to offer.</p>
<p>The second Monster Hunter Wilds mod that attempts to rebalance the game to offer a more challenging experience is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/171?tab=files">Reasonable Palico Nerfs mod</a>, which comes in two variants. The first reduces the efficacy and frequency of healing to 40% and 1/3, respectively, while the unreasonable variant nerfs healing further while also significantly reducing the frequency of tool usage.</p>
<p>Besides the low challenge level, Monster Hunter Wilds also suffers from significant performance issues, which have yet to be properly fixed. As highlighted by a <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/">tech analysis</a> shared last week, the issues found in the PC version may be caused by how data streaming to the GPU is handled.</p>
<p>While the game not being challenging enough is completely subjective, Monster Hunter Wilds' performance is a real issue that does impact the experience, which is a shame, as the game is tons of fun. You can learn more about what makes it a really fun experience in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"> review.</a></p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> developers Saber Interactive are pushing back on player calls to add an even-harder difficulty mode, following the introduction of an Absolute difficulty setting this spring via game update.</p>
<p>Apparently, some of you muscleheads have been finding Absolute "a bit easy", or at least, not enough of a shake-up from the preceding Lethal difficulty. Saber are open to suggestions, here, but game director Dmitriy Grigorenko also reckons that "we are almost at our limit in terms of how we can make the game harder without making it unfair and not fun". 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Posting in <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update">a community note</a> on publisher Focus Entertainment's website,  Grigorenko described Saber as "quite happy with how intense" Absolute is, on the whole. "We see that it requires a lot of concentration and we feel like it's fun in terms of how many enemies you have to face, how hard they hit you etc," he wrote. "At the same time, we see some comments that it's a bit easy. Yet on the other hand we don't want to mess it up and would like to hear the voice of the community first."
</p>
<p>
He's got some "data and context" to justify his fears about messing things up. Argh, context! It burns, it burns, etc. Briefly, the average win rate on Absolute difficulty is around 60%, which is "a bit higher than we expected" and around 10% higher than the average for Lethal difficulty. This can be explained, however, by the fact that Absolute difficulty has to be unlocked, so all the people smashing their faces against it are pretty seasoned. Also, only around 12% of average daily play time has been spent in Absolute, and only around 15% of weekly active players play at least a single match on Absolute difficulty. 
</p>
<p>
In short, "only a small portion of very hardcore and well-prepared players are playing the Absolute difficulty", so it doesn't make sense to devote overmuch resources to pumping up the challenge even further. Besides which, Grigorenko doesn't think there's much to be gained in general from making Space Marine 2 even more of a meat-grinder.
</p>
<p>
"I will be completely honest," Grigorenko continued. "I think we are almost at our limit in terms of how we can make the game harder without making it unfair and not fun. We can't significantly increase the number of enemies for performance and memory reasons. Greatly increasing enemy damage and hp will make it so players will die randomly and will make enemies bullet sponges, which will not be fun.
</p>
<p>
"We do not want to implement a new difficulty, because that would split the matchmaking pool even more. We have to stick to the existing 6 difficulties." 
</p>
<p>
Saber are, however, looking to introduce a new set of modifiers, similar to the controversial Tight Formation multiplayer mechanic, which punished players for straying apart in Lethal difficulty, and was removed a week after its introduction.</p>
<p>Grigorenko hopes that the "combination of [these modifiers] would make each challenge unique", and is happy "to announce that we are already working on the system, however this will take some time." Beyond that, he's set up some reader polls for possible smaller tweaks to Absolute, such as limiting ammo and adding more Terminus enemies.
</p>
<p>
I haven't really played Space Marine 2 since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">rambling about Warhammer 40,000's fascist sensibilities</a> last year, but I wonder to what extent Saber's difficulties with game difficulty are exacerbated by the Space Marine mentality of securing a righteous death against unwinnable odds. There is no act of martyrdom Absolute enough for these lads.

<p>Forza Horizon 5 developers haven’t planned a physical release for the PS5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Playground Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> late last month that their highly popular racing title is finally arriving on PS5 after being an Xbox exclusive for years. Forza Horizon 5 will arrive for PS5 on April 29; however, it will only be a digital release; the developers have “no current plans” for a physical disc at the moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the official X announcement, many players asked whether Forza Horizon 5 would receive a physical release on the PS5. The developers <a href="https://x.com/ForzaHorizon/status/1895217916506747364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ForzaHorizon/status/1895218127073394945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reiterated</a> several times on the thread that they have “no current plans” for such a release. The developers also confirmed that there are no cross-saves between Xbox and PlayStation 5.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-5-on-ps5-nbsp">Forza Horizon 5 on PS5&nbsp;</h2>



<p>On the PS5, players will be able to experience Forza Horizon 5 in two modes: Performance (60 fps) and Quality (30 fps). The game will also receive PS5 Pro support on release, with increased fidelity for Performance mode and ray-traced car reflections in Races and Free Roam for Quality mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game comes in three editions: Standard, Deluxe, and Premium. Standard provides the base game with free content and the upcoming Horizon Realms update. The Deluxe edition will add an extra 42 cars through the Car Pass. The Premium edition will include all the previous content along with both Forza Horizon 5 expansions (Rally Adventure and Hot Wheels), VIP Membership, and extra perks that are included in the Welcome Pack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pre-ordering the premium edition will also provide players with early access from April 25, 2025. Normal pre-orders will reward players with a special bundle.&nbsp;</p>

The dust is still settling on this weekend's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-not-over-yet-quest-steps-rewards-and-black-or-white-best-choose-path-choice-in-pokemon-go">Pokémon Go Tour Unova</a>, but the game is already getting ready for the next big public event - and the highlight of the game's annual calendar - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> Fest 2025.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of its official announcement, the logo for Go Fest 2025 has popped up online, courtesy of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1j285jx/go_fest_2025_logo/">top Pokémon Go fan reddit TheSilphRoad</a>. And, as ever, Pokémon fans have determined which super rare creature will be the focus of the event, via some not-so-subtle clues.
</p>
<p>
This year's logo prominently features several golden gears, which nods to the Mythical Pokémon Magearna. This Steel and Fairy creature was introduced in Gen 7's Pokémon Sun and Moon. 
</p>
<p>
Each year, Go Fest traditionally adds another Mythical creature to the game. Last year's event added Marshadow, while others have added Diancie, Meloetta and Shaymin. (One day we'll get Arceus, hopefully.)
</p>
<p>
Other elements of the logo - its blue and magenta flourishes - strongly hint at Gen 7's Legendary duo Zacian and Zamazenta, meanwhile. These have been released in Pokémon Go previously, but not in their flashier Hero of Many Battles alternate forms. It seems likely these will debut during Pokémon Go Fest 2025 as well.
</p>
<p>
In-person dates for Pokémon Go Fest 2025 have already been announced for the event's big continental meetups - with its European leg taking place in Paris from 13th to 15th June. 
</p>
<p>
Over the pond, Go Fest 2025 is being held in Jersey City, New Jersey from 6th to 8th June. In Japan, Osaka hosts the event from 29th May to 1st June. There's been no word yet on when the event's Global edition will run, though typically it is after all of these.

			<p>An unofficial PC port of Sonic Unleashed is now available for download, allowing PC users to experience the PS3/Xbox 360 era entry in the series natively with some visual improvements and additional features not available in the original releases.</p>
<p>The Unleashed Recompiled port, which can be downloaded from&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hedge-dev/UnleashedRecomp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and requires a copy of the Xbox 360 version of the game, has been created through the process of static recompilation and features no original assets whatsoever, which should make it safe from any takedown from SEGA. While the visuals have been recreated from scratch, the development team took extra care to make them as accurate as possible while also improving them where needed with up to 4K resolution support, MSAA levels over double, enhanced motion blur, and more. In addition, the port also supports unlocked framerates, although any framerate above 60 FPS could lead to issues.</p>
<p><iframe title="Unleashed Recompiled - Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TJreGbVPDx0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sonic Unleashed is one of the very few entries in the series worth playing that are not officially available on PC, so the release of this unofficial port is quite welcome. The game's most defining feature, which was not implemented in any subsequent entry in the series, is the Werehog gameplay segments, which featured slower gameplay compared to the day stages that sported modern Sonic gameplay and focused on combat sequences.</p>
<p>The latest 3D entry in the series is<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-frontiers-review-wheres-the-fun-in-being-careful/"> Sonic Frontiers</a>, which was released in 2022 on PC and consoles. The game was followed by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-gamescom-hands-on-preview-shadow-frontiers/">Sonic x Shadows Generations remaster</a>, which introduced new solid content to what was already a pretty solid Sonic game and one of the best in recent times.</p>

            <p>A mod for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has been created that allows for unlimited character and palico edits, essentially bypassing Capcom's monetisation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-you-can-change-your-monster-hunter-wilds-character-once-for-free-before-capcom-makes-you-pay-up">As we reported last week</a>, editing your character after the initial setup requires special vouchers that can be bought for £5.79, although Capcom does provide a voucher to change your characters once for free.</p>
<p>It's an egregious inclusion that nonetheless has been part of the games since Monster Hunter World. But thanks to modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/133?tab=description">Ridog8</a>, PC players can have unlimited character edits.</p>

<p>The mod still uses edit vouchers, but they're set to zero and will continue to work. Surely Capcom will find a way to patch this out?</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds only released a few days ago, but already there are plenty of mods available for PC players looking to improve the experience.</p>
<p>For instance, Monster Hunter Wilds includes an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-to-turn-on-arachnophobia-setting-monster-hunter-wilds">arachnophobia mode</a> in its accessibility settings, but frustratingly that only applies to the smaller eight-legged creatures that crawl around the wilds and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-arachnophobia-mode-turns-eight-legged-critters-into-amusing-blobs">turns them into blobs of goo instead</a>.</p>
<p>But there are larger monsters to hunt that are especially spider-like: the Lala Barina, for instance, with its spindly legs and scarlet webbing; or the Nerscylla that swings like Spider-Man over each battle arena.</p>
<p>Thankfully, modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/143?tab=description">Tea Common Shark</a> has created a mod that extends the arachnophobia mode to these larger monsters - they're not quite giant blobs, but at least their spider-like features are mostly disguised.</p>
<p>"I did this mainly because it's funny," the modder joked, "but it might also help those who can't bear to look at them."</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Other mods look to improve on some of the key criticisms of Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>Modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/136">Furiante</a> has created a harder difficult mod that increases monster HP and damage, with multiple values available so hunters can customise the experience to their liking.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/16?tab=description">GreenComfyTea</a> has created a mod that adds health bars to monsters, though I'd argue half the fun is not knowing the numbers and watching for that telltale limp instead.</p>
<p>Another complaint are the drab, somewhat washed out visuals of the game, but beyond playing with the game's brightness and saturation options, modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/168">SchiggyCGN</a> has created a reshade that makes the game considerably more vibrant. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/94">Other modders</a> have done <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/97">similar work</a>.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Perhaps most ambitiously, modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/88">Velasquez</a> has created a mod with new graphic presets in a bid to optimise the game's performance. Considering the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">poor performance of Monster Hunter Wilds on PC</a>, it's great to see modders getting to grips with optimisation before Capcom does.</p>

            <p>
Steam hit another new player record this weekend, with more than 40 million people online at the same time. 
</p>
<p>
Last Friday was, of course, the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> - which soared to a peak of more than 1.38 million concurrent players on Saturday night. That same total was then repeated on Sunday, when a peak of 1.37 million concurrent players jumped back into the game.
</p>
<p>
Currently, Monster Hunter Wilds is the second-most played game on Steam, behind evergreen <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, but ahead of other stalwarts such as PUBG and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">Monster Hunter Wilds has clearly been a huge hit</a>, with a Steam play count three times higher than any previous Monster Hunter game, let alone anything else publisher Capcom has ever launched, Resident Evil included.
</p>
<p>
It's not all been plain sailing for the game, however. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-responds-after-monster-hunter-wilds-steam-success-is-marred-by-performance-complaints">User reviews for Monster Hunter Wilds remain "Mixed" on Steam</a>, with only 53 percent of players currently saying they'd recommend the game, and a fair amount of criticism for its technical performance on PC right now.

<p>
Digital Foundry echoed that on Friday, going as far as saying the team "can't recommend the PC version" as "substantial technical problems must be addressed".
</p>
<p>
"To sum up, lower-end graphics cards with lower VRAM allocations should avoid Monster Hunter Wilds until these issues are rectified," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia wrote</a>. "Higher-end hardware can brute-force the game's shortcomings to some degree, but it's still hard to recommend such a flawed technical outing - or even derive optimised settings."
</p>
<p>
Other criticism has surfaced for the series' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-you-can-change-your-monster-hunter-wilds-character-once-for-free-before-capcom-makes-you-pay-up">need to pay if you want to keep changing your Monster Hunter Wilds character</a> - though you do get one edit for free.
