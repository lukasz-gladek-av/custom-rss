<p>Focused on expanding anime IP and more</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Digimon Story Time Stranger" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bd357dd40df66/digimon-story-time-stranger.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In some more Sony news, the PlayStation maker has this week acquired a 2.5% stake in Bandai Namco.</p>
<p>It's described as a "strategic business alliance agreement" with a focus on "expanding the fan community for IP such as anime and manga around the world and strengthening engagement". It reportedly sets Sony back "around $464 million" (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712901/sony-buys-a-stake-in-bandai-namco">via The Verge</a>).</p>
<p>Here's some additional PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Bandai Namco and Sony have historically collaborated on various projects in the fields such as games, anime and music, and they plan to extend this collaboration to a broader range of areas. The two companies intend to implement initiatives including the expansion of works as well as products and services based on IP developed by Bandai Namco, leveraging Sony's strengths in areas such as the production and distribution of anime and other video content, as well as merchandising. They also plan to engage in detailed discussions regarding the joint development and promotion of IP such as anime and manga, in addition to planning and technical collaboration on experiential entertainment. Furthermore, the two companies plan to explore opportunities to support creators by jointly developing and operating entertainment-related technologies and services, and to engage in joint investments and business alliances in fan engagement areas."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Sony has previously invested in Kadakowa (the parent of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> developer FromSoftware) in a new "alliance" last year.</p>
<p>As our pals at Pure Xbox mention, this latest partnership makes "transmedia opportunities" tied to areas like anime and manga "the priority". Sony also owns platforms like the anime streaming service <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/crunchyroll">Crunchyroll</a>, which is available as an app on multiple platforms including Switch.</p>

<p>"Your memories will be recorded here"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>This year marks the tenth anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> and the game's creator Toby Fox is wanting to reflect on this time with your memories.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/tobyfox/status/1948945089939788235">post on social media</a>, he's revealed how he's seeking "your memories" and wants to "turn back together". He's hoping for a quick turnover – further noting how it would be "great" if fans could submit their responses within the <strong>next 24 hours</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Toby Fox:</strong> "Hello. It's almost been 10 years since UNDERTALE released. Now, I'm looking for your memories. Let's turn back together. Face the flower and speak."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems the website where you can record your memory is already being overloaded with responses as well, so try again later if you have any trouble submitting your memory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There are so many submissions, the site is having trouble... If your submission is stuck on 'Submitting', please try sending it again later. Your submission should be auto-saved in your browser."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So head on over to <a href="https://memories.undertale.com/">memories.undertale.com</a> and record your memory now!</p>
<p>Although it has been almost ten years since original release, this title didn't arrive on the Switch eShop until 2018. It's also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/09/sans_from_undertale_is_coming_to_super_smash_bros_ultimate">led to cameos</a> in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> and Toby releasing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a>, which was recently made available on the Switch 2.</p>

                <p>Are you curious about New Game Plus in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers/" data-ref-id="5000-538251"><strong>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</strong></a>? This mode is a staple in soulslike and role-playing games, letting you restart your adventure with the goodies that you've found during your first playthrough. That said, there are some caveats that might surprise you with how Wuchang handles this concept. Oh, and before we continue, please be reminded that this article contains <strong>minor spoilers</strong>.</p><h2>What to expect in New Game Plus in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</h2><p>New Game Plus mode is unlocked after completing the campaign and obtaining an ending. After the end credits roll, you'll be sent back to the main menu. Unfortunately, we're not allowed to show an image just yet, but you should see an option called "Causality Reversal," which is the term that the game uses for New Game Plus mode.</p><h3>Should you start New Game Plus mode?</h3><p>Here's the surprising part: You're actually <em>forced</em> to start Wuchang: Fallen Feathers' New Game Plus mode after beating the game.</p><p>It doesn't matter if you pick "Causality Reversal," "Continue," or "Load Game." All these options bring you back to the game's intro for a New Game Plus run. <strong>Worse, your original save file will be overwritten, too</strong>.</p><p>This can be a bit problematic, especially if you missed a few items or spells during your initial playthrough. It's also different from how other games handled this feature--i.e. there's an option to try New Game Plus via the main menu, but you can still load your original save.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4538239-wuchang-fallen-feathers-new-game-plus-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538239" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4538239-wuchang-fallen-feathers-new-game-plus-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538239"></a><figcaption>Wuchang wakes up in the same cave upon starting New Game Plus.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4538239-wuchang-fallen-feathers-new-game-plus-1.jpg"></figure><h3>Is there a way to avoid New Game Plus mode?</h3><p>If you're not ready yet for New Game Plus in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, you need to have a backup save before you conclude the campaign. This is how we did our workaround for the PC (Steam) version of the game:</p><ul><li>Prior to obtaining an ending, we exited the game so we could have a backup of the save state.</li><li>The files/folders that you need are in the "C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Project_Plague" directory.</li><li>Copy the whole "Saved" folder and place it somewhere else.</li></ul><p>If you need to revert to a previous state, simply place the "Saved" folder in the "Project_Plague" directory and overwrite everything there. Then, launch Wuchang and pick "Load Game" from the main menu.</p><p>The save file might say "Causality Reversal 1"--i.e. New Game +1--but that's fine. This is mostly due to cloud functionality. Upon loading it, you should find yourself at the same spot as your original save.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4538240-wuchang-fallen-feathers-new-game-plus-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538240" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4538240-wuchang-fallen-feathers-new-game-plus-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538240"></a><figcaption>Items that can't be duplicated grant you Red Mercury blood resources instead.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4538240-wuchang-fallen-feathers-new-game-plus-2.jpg"></figure><h3>What carries over and what changes in New Game Plus?</h3><p>Here's what you can expect in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers' New Game Plus mode:</p><ul><li>You carry over all your equipment/gear pieces, Red Mercury, unlocked skills, spells, temperance needles, and the like.</li><li>Enemies will be tougher this time around.</li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-best-jade-pendants-guide/2900-6798/" data-ref-id="2900-6798"><strong>Jade Pendants</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-best-benedictions-guide/2900-6799/" data-ref-id="2900-6799"><strong>Benedictions</strong></a> that you pick up have a +1 coefficient, which means their effects are more potent.</li><li>Vendors still sell the same items.

<p>Now, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/rumor-lots-of-pokemon-champions-details-leaked/">as highlighted by Nintendo Everything</a>, there are supposedly new details about the game emerging. This information is apparently based on some previous leaks, which have now at least been "partially verified" following the latest broadcast:<strong><br></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo Everything:</strong> "During the broadcast, The Pokemon Company shared more information about the battle-focused game. One of the things we heard about are Victory Points, which were accurately described in the leaks."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsprvmx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>While we won't be directly sharing the <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/rumor-lots-of-pokemon-champions-details-leaked/">gameplay or content leaks</a> here, we will mention how the leak claims the release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_champions">Pokémon Champions</a> is early next year. Additionally, it's expected to be a free download on all platforms, including Switch 2.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just a rumour for now, so nothing mentioned in the leak has been officially confirmed (<em>at least yet</em>).</p>
<p>Previous news about Pokémon Champions has revealed there will be certain limitations when this game does arrive, with only <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/pokemon-champions-limited-to-select-pokemon-at-launch">"select Pokémon" to be available</a> for use at launch, with plans to seemingly expand the roster as time goes on.</p>

<p>The description mentions how this role will shape and execute the company's global commercial strategy for "PS Studios software titles" across all digital platforms (including Nintendo), and will lead a team "focused on multiplatform expansion".</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vza2oSKedQs" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4bcd6euxilrg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vza2oSKedQs" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>"<em>Reporting to the Vice President, Commercial Management as Senior Director of Multiplatform &amp; Account Management, you will play a critical leadership role in shaping and executing the global commercial strategy for PS Studios software titles across all digital platforms beyond PlayStation hardware, including Steam, Epic Games Store, Xbox, Nintendo, and mobile. This role is accountable for optimising title profitability, ensuring cross-functional alignment, and leading a high-performing team focused on multiplatform expansion, mid-range commercial planning, and platform partner management."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This role will also reportedly include maintaining relationships with rival platform holders, with the application name-dropping Nintendo twice.</p>
<p>This latest listing follows Sony previously releasing games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_horizon_adventures">LEGO Horizon Adventures</a> on the Switch. It's also been making its first-party console exclusives available on PC for some time now, and is again branching out with Helldivers 2, which offers live service content.</p>
<p>As our colleagues at Push Square have noted, the advertised role doesn't necessarily confirm a shift or change in Sony's current strategy, and it could simply be planning to continue what it's been doing up until now.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alien-rogue-incursion-%E2%80%93-part-one-evolved-edition-gameplay-revealed-ahead-of-september-release.1253946/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><strong>Update 25/07/2025:</strong> A spokesperson for Survios has confirmed to Wccftech that those who already own Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One as a VR game <strong>will have to buy the Evolved Edition separately</strong> if they want to play the new flat-screen version. </p>



<p>"<em>Currently those who own Alien: Rogue Incursion will have to repurchase the Evolved Edition</em>," we were told in an email. </p>



<p>It's possible, of course, that this changes from now to the September release date. But it's unfortunate to know that for now, players who have already paid for the game, who might've also wanted to try it out as a flat-screen title, can't do that without buying the whole game again. Hopefully, for those players, Survios changes its mind and makes it available as a free update for current owners. Or at least an upgrade path is introduced, with a reduced fee to get the new version as well.</p>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One first launched last year on PS5 and PC as a VR game for PS VR2 and PC VR before heading to Meta Quest 3 earlier this year. In <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-rogue-incursion-part-one-evolved-edition-announced-no-vr-headset-needed/">May</a>, developer Survios announced that a new version of the game, which makes it playable as a flat-screen title called Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One: Evolved Edition, and today, during San Diego Comic-Con, the studio revealed the first look at gameplay for the new version arriving on September 30, 2025.</p>



<p>The trailer shows a few quick shots of how the new version essentially boils down the VR shooter to a more run-of-the-mill horror shooter.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition | PS5 &amp; PC Gameplay Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LnfXZJdOkGk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Pre-orders are also live as of today, and if you don't already own the Evolved Edition, then you can grab it for $29.99 USD, with the digital deluxe edition for $39.99 USD. While we've asked Survios for clarification, it's not exactly clear if the Evolved Edition will be available to players who already own VR version of the game as a free update, or if this is an entirely new SKU and needs to be purchased separately.</p>



<p>So if you wanted to shoot Xenomorphs in a more classic shooter fashion without having to don a VR headset, then you might need to be ready to buy the game again. We'll update this story if Survios releases a clear statement on the matter.</p>



<p>And in the meantime, if you've already played the VR version, then you can rest easy knowing that Surivos is <a href="https://x.com/Survios/status/1931110743933645240">still working on Part Two</a>, though the studio has not given any indication as to when Part Two will arrive.</p>

<p>Star Wars Outlaws releases on Switch 2 this September</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Star Wars Outlaws" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/343efa136838a/star-wars-outlaws.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ubisoft's CEO Yves Guillemot mentioned recently how he was hopeful the Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> could <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/ubisofts-yves-guillemot-is-hopeful-that-upcoming-switch-2-port-can-revive-star-wars-outlaws">potentially revive the game</a>. While there's always a chance, beyond this adventure, the future doesn't sound very promising for Kay Vess and Nix.</p>
<p>According to a new scoop by Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson, a sequel to Outlaws was originally planned but was recently scrapped in the "very early" stages. This information was shared on the <a href="https://youtu.be/1bFaIYn9H3g">same outlet's weekly podcast</a>. Here's exactly what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"They [Ubisoft] also recently cancelled Star Wars Outlaws 2, because that was planned and in the works. It didn’t enter production, as far as I know. It wasn’t set in stone."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ubisoft <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/ubisofts-disastrous-2024-may-lead-to-the-company-going-private">hasn't had the best run over the past year</a> – with multiple titles, including Star Wars Outlaws, falling short of the company's financial expectations, along with delays of games like <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-rating-spotted-online">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a></strong> (a title which could also potentially be on the way to the Switch 2 in the future).</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws will launch for the Switch 2 on <strong>4th September 2025</strong>. If we hear anything else about the supposed sequel and its cancellation, we'll let you know.</p>

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Yesterday, I mentioned how GPD is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/713576/gpd-win-5-ryzen-ai-max-395-strix-halo-tease">teasing the most potent handheld yet made</a> — a GPD Win 5 that will house the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip, with AMD’s most powerful integrated graphics yet, inside a PlayStation Vita-shaped machine.</p><p>If you’ve been wondering how that huge chip could even fit, handheld expert Cary “The Phawx” Golomb <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udFaxaVvtQs">now has the answer</a>: the 7-inch handheld will apparently have no internal battery taking up space. The Win 5 is designed to either be plugged into the wall, with a gaming laptop sized 180-watt charger providing the juice — or powered by a big 80 watt-hour external battery “backpack” that will (only? additionally?) be sold separately.</p><p>We can see the full spec sheet for the new Win 5 in the Phawx’s video, and as he notes, GPD had to make its Win 5 larger than the Win 4<em> even before</em> you add that backpack battery.</p><p>While the Win 4 is a compact 6-inch handheld with a 45 watt-hour pack, the Win 5 with its 7-inch screen will be narrower but thicker than the Asus ROG Ally X handheld — which is an apt comparison, considering that handheld similarly pairs a 7-inch screen with an 80 watt-hour battery pack.</p><p>Here, though, the battery will add extra girth: it’s roughly 4 inches (110mm) wide and tall, and 0.7 inches (18mm) deep; it’s not clear how it attaches yet, as GPD has only shared the one dark video of the Win 5 filmed from the front, but the spec sheet mentions a “Battery to Host Dedicated Connector<strong>” </strong>as an accessory, so it might require plugging in a cable.</p><p>If you’re curious what the handheld’s controls might look like in better light, I tried brightening it up:</p><p>Other intriguing things we can see in the full spec sheet include:</p><div><ul><li><span>A 120Hz variable refresh rate screen, where the Win 4 was limited to 60Hz</span></li><li><span>Two configs: AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 (16C/32T/ Radeon 8060S) or AI Max 385 (8C/16T/ Radeon 8050S)</span></li><li><span>32, 64, or even the full 128GB of unified memory AMD offers for these chips</span></li><li><span>USB-4 with 100W PD charging and 8K/60 DP output</span></li><li><span>Two fans and four heat pipes for cooling</span></li><li><span>An optional HDMI and USB dock with a “battery charging slot,” presumably for the external battery</span></li><li><span>No mention of any integrated keyboard, whereas previous Win devices had a hidden keyboard underneath a sliding screen</span></li></ul></div><p>You can peruse the whole sheet at your leisure in the Phawx’s video or the screenshots we took from Phawx (with his permission) below.

The history of Manga Video itself is a fascinating and complex topic, an offshoot of the legendary record label Island Records. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AnimEigo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AnimEigo</a> recently interviewed both Andy Frain and Guinness separately. If you have any interest in the early history of anime distribution, both videos are a fascinating deep dive with two people who have <em>very </em>different tellings of how things went down.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Laurence Guinness stated that members of Bush worked on The Guyver, although the company "Mad Dog Winston" is credited.

The Manga Video dub of <em>Space Pirate Cobra </em>was rescored using the music by Swiss duo Yello (most notable for the song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jJkdRaa04g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oh Yeah</a>” from <em>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</em>), and Guinness claims in the video that Gavin Rossdale and Nigel Pulsford from Bush were commissioned to work on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNRRjiINRKA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intro</a> for <em>The Guyver</em> (although if they do not appear to be credit in the original release.) </p><p><strong>(Update: the company "<a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/153787-Mad-Dog-Winston-Music-Ltd?redirected=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mad Dog Winston</a>" is listed as the publishing company for Bush. This is who is credited in the Manga Video release, so this does scan with Guinness' telling.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Anime Business - Andy Frain and the story of Manga Video" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ToXPQL1CDOs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The Spice Girls revelation comes near the end of Guiness’ interview. For a brief time Manga Video experimented with not just distributing anime but co-production as well. At one point Guinness mentions that a Wu-Tang Clan anime called <em>The Imperial Warrior</em> was far along but never materialized. He then goes on to several production stills from what he claims is a pitch for a Spice Girls anime produced by Production I.G, the studio that would produce both Patlabor movies, <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, and much more. </p><figure><figcaption>Credit: <a href="https://youtu.be/RKAljpMpnj4?si=UhR6jo-WeV_LAI6a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AnimEigo</a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>Credit: <a href="https://youtu.be/RKAljpMpnj4?si=UhR6jo-WeV_LAI6a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AnimEigo</a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>Credit: <a href="https://youtu.be/RKAljpMpnj4?si=UhR6jo-WeV_LAI6a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AnimEigo</a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>Credit: <a href="https://youtu.be/RKAljpMpnj4?si=UhR6jo-WeV_LAI6a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AnimEigo</a></figcaption></figure><p>It’s unproductive to mourn things that might have never been, but looking at production cells of Baby Spice running from a T-Rex like child Gohan, the whole crew posted up like Dirty Pair, or Posh Spice looking sick as hell on a motorcycle in front of a pre-9/11 skyline hurts to think about. Manga Video had bigger problems near the end and would eventually fall apart, but if the Spice Girl anime had snuck by like that, imagine how sick it would have been.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lollipop-chainsaw-game-reboot-anime-woke-nonsense-dei-back-in-my-day"><h3>Let’s All Read A Shitty Video Game Press Release Together</h3></a><p>'The development process will prioritize staying true to the distinctive tone and spirit of the original work, without...'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ozzy-osbourne-death-blizzcon-2009-world-of-warcraft"><h3>Ozzy Osbourne Played A Video Game Convention In 2009, And It Ruled</h3></a><p>"The kids had a great time.

At the time, MCU fans didn’t know who exactly would go on to play The Sentry in Thunderbolts*, but the rumor mill pointed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/invincible">Invincible</a> star Steven Yeun. So when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-walking-dead-star-steven-yeuns-top-secret-mcu-role-revealed">Invincible creator Robert Kirkman let slip that Yeun would be playing Robert Reynolds</a>, aka The Sentry, in Thunderbolts*, Marvel fans went wild.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s that original quote from Kirkman two years ago:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, he [Yeun] called me, he went in for a costume fitting. I hope I’m not... I don’t think this is a spoiler or anything that will get anybody in trouble. I don’t know, maybe. We’ll see. I don’t care. I don’t work for Marvel.

But at the time, Yeun as The Sentry felt like a sure thing. After all, Kirkman had confirmed it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, it seemed, caused Kirkman all sorts of trouble. In an interview with IGN at San Diego Comic-Con 2025 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robert-kirkman-teases-massive-roster-of-playable-characters-for-invincible-vs-thats-a-spoiler-i-might-get-in-trouble-for-that-sdcc-2025">to promote fighting game Invincible VS</a>, we asked Kirkman <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aang-avatar-movie-adds-invincibles-steven-yeun-to-its-cast">who Yeun will play in the upcoming animated The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender movie</a>, given how much he seemingly knows about the actor's schedule.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don't want to lose any more sleep spoiling Steven Yeun news!” Kirkman said. “I cannot tell you how much that Thunderbolts thing affected me.” Then, Kirkman joked: “Why would you guys bring that up? I'm so angry.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Avatar: The Last Airbender Episodes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirkman wenton to reveal that he actually <em>does</em> know who Yeun plays in The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender, but this time stopped short of spilling the beans - perhaps with his Thunderbolts / Marvel run-in in mind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The best part is he told me who he's playing in The Last Airbender and I was like, ‘I wish I didn't know. I wish I didn't know.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirkman continued the joke, saying Steven Yeun is set to play Abraham Lincoln in the unconfirmed hit TV show based on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skinbreaker-skybound-exclusive-preview-robert-kirkman-david-finch">Skinbreaker</a>, his new comic book series he’s working on with artist David Finch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At Comic-Con this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-season-4s-dinosaurus-has-a-voice-actor-robert-kirkman-says-7-9-seasons-needed-to-do-the-complete-comic-arc-jokes-season-5-will-be-out-in-2032-sdcc-2025">Kirkman announced Invincible Season 4's Dinosaurus voice actor</a>, revealed how many seasons the show will need to complete the story of the comics, and joked Season 5 will be out in 2032.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Michael Buckner/Variety via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

During Chapter 2 Season 7, aliens led by the nefarious Last Reality tried to take over the island and would abduct players during matches and force them to play mini-games for loot.</p><p dir="ltr">We don't know if this rumored new invasion would have anything to do with the previous one, or if it might <em>Herald</em> (<a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=8338" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cough cough</a>) the return of some old favorite characters like Dr. Slone, the Cube Queen, or the IO.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4538431-fortniteinvasion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538431" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4538431-fortniteinvasion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538431"></a><figcaption>The Fortnite island previously suffered an alien invasion back in Chapter 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4538431-fortniteinvasion.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_battle_pass">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 battle pass</h2><p dir="ltr">There haven't been any specific leaks about what will be on the Chapter 6 Season 4 battle pass yet, but there were a number of bug-themed skins on a recent survey that Epic sent to some Fortnite players. <a href="https://youtu.be/p46Bubo-rx4?si=qA4CZ1IM2s3p7a5A" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">This video</a> from content creator Nerpah highlights some of them--just keep in mind that the video contains no leaks or confirmed info about battle pass skins, and is purely speculative based on leaks about the theme.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_gameplay_changes">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 gameplay changes</h2><p dir="ltr">There haven't been many detailed leaks aside from the season theme itself, but a couple of notable things have come through, like a new "<a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1948212946145833017" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bug gauntlets</a>" item, and the return of mud. We don't know what the bug gauntlets are, but it would likely be a weapon or utility item like this season's Bass Boost (movement and a knockback attack) and Myst Gauntlets (fires a flock of birds).</p><p dir="ltr">As for <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1948212946145833017" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mud</a>, we last saw that mechanic back in Chapter 4 when Epic added a jungle biome to the center of the island. Players could use the mud puddles for quick movement, and in the process would cover themselves in mud that would make them invisible to thermal scopes. So if mud returns, it may bring some other things with it, like more items with thermal sights.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnitemares_2025">Fortnitemares 2025</h2><p dir="ltr">Ever since Fortnite moved to yearly chapters starting with Chapter 3, each year's Season 4 has been the home of the annual spooky Fortnitemares event that goes down each October. Fortnitemares usually involves a collab with a horror-themed IP--2024's collabs were Saw, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and the Disney Villains, and the year before that brought Halloween, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Alan Wake. None of this year's Fortnitemares collabs have leaked yet, but there will almost certainly be multiple new item shop skins on par with the collabs mentioned above.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_map_changes">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 map changes</h2><p dir="ltr">We don't know yet about new additions to the map for Season 4, but it's probably safe to assume that most, if not all, of the Star Wars locations will remain, along with Superman's Fortress of Solitude. Spots added in the middle of a chapter are not usually removed until we move on to a new island entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, the places we'd expect to be swapped out for new stuff are locations that have been there since the chapter began. Which would be Shogun's Solitude, Canyon Crossing, Shining Span, Flooded Frogs, and Pumped Power. It's also possible major new locations will be added in spots where there is currently nothing, as Epic recently did when it added the Fortress of Solitude.</p>

But a lot of work is still needed, something the studio acknowledged in a community update announcing the delayed <em>Hitman</em> mission and future patches. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1m8ykoy/july_update_from_the_studio/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1m8ykoy/july_update_from_the_studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On July 25</a></span>, an official representative of Build A Rocket Boy posted an update on Reddit about <em>MindsEye’s </em>future. The bad news is that a planned crossover mission featuring Agent 47, which was teased before <em>MindsEye</em>’s launch, has now been delayed. </p><p>“We apologise that the release of the <em>Hitman </em>x<em> MindsEye</em> Mission, originally scheduled for July, has been postponed to a later date,” said the Build A Rocket Boy spokesperson. “We look forward to delivering this exciting crossover when the time is right and will provide further updates as soon as we’re able.”</p><p>The whole reason Agent 47 was going to show up in <em>MindsEye </em>is that the game was published by <em>Hitman </em>studio IO Interactive, so it was a bit of brand synergy. But now, it seems the team behind <em>MindsEye </em>is more focused on getting the game fixed up and improved before adding any new content. </p><p>Build A Rocket Boy laid out two updates, one coming in August and one arriving in September, that will bring “additional performance improvements, bug fixes,” and community-requested features. This includes the option to skip cutscenes, as well as user-published missions being “instantly accessible” on PC. </p><p>The studio did warn that moving forward, future updates might be less frequent, but the plan is to make them bigger and more substantial and to include more fixes. While this plan makes sense and it’s reasonable for the devs to focus on improving the game instead of adding a fun crossover mission, I can’t imagine anyone involved with <em>MindsEye </em>was hoping to be in this terrible situation post-launch. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mindseye-worst-game-2025-update-hitman-crossover-delay-1851787011]]></content:encoded>

It raised an estimated $11 million in funds and signed over a dozen names, including Vtubers with millions of fans like Ironmouse. But those same Vtubers recently accused the company of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBxw80mZoWI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBxw80mZoWI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">failing to pay them the money they were owed</a></span>, including $515,000 raised for charity by Ironmouse last fall in a record-breaking subathon on Twitch. Days later, VShojo announced it was shutting down. </p><p>It was one particular part of CEO Justin “Gunrun” Ignacio’s apology that’s been galling fans the most, however. “I acknowledge that some of the money spent by the company was raised in connection with talent activity, which I later learned was intended for a charitable initiative,” he wrote in a statement posted on X. No long after, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/i/birdwatch/n/1948540194770084045&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/i/birdwatch/n/1948540194770084045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a community note</a></span> proving that wasn’t true was attached to the post, which continues to go viral on the platform. </p><p>“Justin claims to not know the purpose of the funds, but he personally congratulated Ironmouse on the completion of her charity fundraising event and reposted Ludwig directly mentioning that half the funds would go to charity,” it reads. There were links to the past tweets in question, which include Ignacio writing, “YOU DID IT MOUSE!!” A tweet from VShojo’s Japanese X account <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MyrdinTV/status/1948452975451820315&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MyrdinTV/status/1948452975451820315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also acknowledged the fundraiser</a></span>. <br></p><p>Another Vtuber, Veibae, who left VShojo back in 2023, responded to Ignacio’s claims by mentioning her own past problems with the company. “I only found out I didn’t get paid for any of my sponsors after I had already signed the NDA,” she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Veibae/status/1948509619543822703&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Veibae/status/1948509619543822703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on X yesterday</a></span>. “After 2 years, I have still not been paid back fully. To add insult to injury, they also demanded I had to pay them back 10k for some of the anniversary assets which when they sent me back months later, were half finished.” She also accused VShojo of allegedly trying to lowball revenue splits and sabotage her departure with rumors seeded on 4chan. </p><p>According to Ignacio, the agency “prioritized creators and community over short-term profits,” but not many Vtubers seem to feel that’s true. Ironmouse has yet to respond to the claims directly. “My brain is running on empty at the moment,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ironmouse/status/1948794001253171664&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ironmouse/status/1948794001253171664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">she wrote on Friday</a></span>. According to a YouTube video released earlier in the week, Ironmouse is currently pursuing legal action against VShojo.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/vshojo-ironmouse-vtuber-ludwig-veibae-ceo-1851787012]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting together for a game day with your group of friends is a special experience. Imagining what you will play, finally getting those couple of games to the table to try, or being surprised by what new thing your friend got is all just part of the charm of these events. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some games, however, are events unto themselves – games that take most, if not a whole, day (or more) to play. That's where the games on this list fall. Titles that may require a weekend getaway with your close friends to one of those nice cabins in the woods, or on one of those giant tables you can find at a game convention. It may take a while to plan, but playing these games will still provide you with memories that can last a lifetime.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in This Article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're too busy playing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board games</a> to read blurbs, you can see all the games on the list in the catalog above. But if you want to dig deeper into what each of the games is, keep on scrolling and reading.</p><p id="axis-allies-1940"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Axis &amp; Allies: 1940"><strong>Axis &amp; Allies: 1940 Global (A&amp;A 1940 Europe + 1940 Pacific)</strong></h2></p><div id="225829" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Axis &amp; Allies: 1940 Europe Second Edition</h3></p></div><div catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0" id="225830"><div id="225830" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Axis &amp; Allies: 1940 Pacific Second Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Axis &amp; Allies series of wargames has been around for over 40 years at this point, letting fans of World War 2 fight one another to their heart's content. Composed of two separate games – Axis &amp; Allies 1940 Europe and 1940 Pacific – Axis &amp; Allies: 1940 Global is by far the largest of the franchise, with a combined board that dwarfs the already impressive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/axis-allies-40th-anniversary-edition-board-game-review"><u>Axis &amp; Allies 1940 Anniversary Edition</u></a> and requires a large table to play on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with its large footprint, this game still accommodates between <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two players</a> and six players, with one team assuming the roles of the Allied Powers and the other the Axis, as they take turns buying units, moving them around, and rolling dice to wage war. Even with experienced players, this is a game you should plan a weekend to play, when factoring in short breaks for things like food or sleep. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These versions of Axis &amp; Allies add in new types of ground and air units, different types of factories, and other adjustments that make Europe, Pacific, and Global arguably the most intricate of entries of the main series, and may not be the best option for folks new to the games. But, if you do plan to play this option a lot, it may be worthwhile to invest in the <a href="https://zdcs.link/akK0X5?object_uuid=0c69ce94-1081-4ba2-9419-d8d18336260e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">neoprene map</a> Renegade offers, which is the global map and is scaled up slightly to make it easier to fit all your units on spaces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To get a better idea of just how long this game can take, the world tournament that's held at <a href="https://www.gencon.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gen Con</a> has a rule that limits the game time to nine hours. A nine-hour match for folks who are considered experts in the game, and even then, sometimes it isn’t long enough!</p></div><p id="twilight-imperium-4th-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Twilight Imperium: 4th Edition"><strong>Twilight Imperium 4th Edition + Prophecy of Kings Expansion</strong></h2></p><div id="225831" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Twilight Imperium: 4th Edition</h3></p></div><div catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0" id="225832"><div id="225832" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Twilight Imperium 4th Edition - Prophecy of Kings Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Out of all the games on this list, Twilight Imperium is probably the one whose legend is most known for how long it takes to play, and the most current iteration, 4th Edition (especially when paired with its Prophecy of Kings expansion) continues that Legacy. Twilight Imperium is a massive space 4x game (eXpand, eXploit, eXpore, eXterminate) where players not only have to navigate the hazards of space, but also of one another. It's a game I'm quite fond of, ranking it among one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games"><u>best wargames</u></a> on the market. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While at first glance TI may appear to look like just another wargame set in space, you spend more of your time negotiating and making deals than shooting out missiles if you want to succeed. While it’s almost a running joke that anyone who owns this game never actually plays it, if you should find yourself so lucky to play it or have the tablespace for it, there are few games out there that can offer such a memorable experience. If you start a game in the morning, you should be able to complete a game in a single day, even though you may be a little late getting home.</p></div><p id="mega-empires"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Empires">Mega Empires <strong> (The East + The West)</strong></h2></p><div id="225833" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Empires: The East</h3></p></div><div catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0" id="225834"><div id="225834" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Empires: The West</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like Axis &amp; Allies: 1940 Global, Mega Empires is also the amalgamation of two large games, merged into an even larger monolith that can accommodate 18 – yes, you read that right – players. Despite its size, the actual flow and play of game isn’t all that complicated, with players taking control over advancing a specific ancient civilization, spreading out their troops, building cities, and trading resources with one another in an effort to create large pairs of the same type of resource, with more matching cards earning more victory points. There isn’t much in the way of war in this game, as it's much more focused on trading and negotiating trades with your neighbors to get cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big twist, however, is that in addition to having to trade at least three cards, you only have to tell the truth about two of them, which can be dangerous as the person who is promising you one thing, could be in fact, handing over one calamity card, too. These make for all sorts of trouble, but they also keep things exciting and tense. This game you should probably factor in a weekend to play comfortably, though it does have rules specifically for when players have to leave the game partway through. That should tell you just how long a game can last.</p></div><p id="war-of-the-ring-2nd-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="War of The Ring 2nd Edition">War of The Ring: 2nd Edition</h2></p><div catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0" id="225835"><div id="225835" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>War of The Ring 2nd Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Often described as “Lord of the Rings in a box,” War of the Ring by ARES Games puts players in the role of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth and the other as the Shadow as they rewrite the epic confrontations from Tolkien’s masterpiece. How would things play out if Boromir didn’t fall in battle, or the Strider split off early from the group to rally the people to war? Do you think you could have won the war for the Dark Lord where Saruman failed? Well, it’s time to put your gold where your dragon is and prove it! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For experienced players, this is a game that won’t take all day, and can be played in a few hours, but you will still feel exhausted and worn out from just how tense this game can get. And for newer players, you can expect a good six-plus hours of gameplay ahead. Between its strategic army play, action cards that can turn the tides of an encounter, and the slow-but-steady progression of the Fellowship towards delivering the One Ring to Mt. Doom, this game is a must-own for fans of Lord of the Rings. Here at IGN, we think its one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time"><u>best board games that you should play this year</u></a>.</p></div><p id="diplomacy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Diplomacy">Diplomacy</h2></p><div catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0" id="225836"><div id="225836" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Diplomacy</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in 20th-century Europe prior to the outbreak of World War I, Diplomacy places up to seven players in the roles of the heads of Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey as they strive to gain territory. This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games"><u>classic board game</u></a> is far less about rolling the dice and waging war, but is more about making backroom deals with other players and backstabbing each other for your benefit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each turn begins with a 15-minute phase where players can go and negotiate their deals and decide on their plans, before returning to the board and writing their orders out – yes, you physically write out your orders – for their armies and naval fleets. No dice rolling is involved. Your goal is to be the first person to control 18 of the various Supply Centers around the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Diplomacy is jokingly referred to as “the friend killer” as this game can be nasty, and lead to tempers rising, but that is also part of the fun. If you have a good group of friends, you can make a game of this into the event, perhaps with period-appropriate food and dress from the country you are controlling for added fun.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

                <p>Fans of Happy Gilmore will want to keep their remotes handy after watching the sequel, Happy Gilmore 2, on Netflix. The streaming platform has just released a new tie-in video game: Happy Gilmore: Golf Mayhem ’98 Demo, available to all subscribers for free.</p><p>The retro-style game, <a href="https://amberstudio.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">developed by Amber</a>, can be played on TVs and desktop devices. According to Netflix, the game offers a nostalgic '90s arcade experience, blending chaotic golf gameplay with combat-style mechanics reminiscent of Mortal Kombat. Players can golf, battle familiar characters, and wreak havoc across a cartoonish golf course--all in a short, punchy game packed with Easter eggs for longtime fans.</p><p>While the game takes place during the first Happy Gilmore movie, it's actually a nod to the opening scene in the sequel, where Gilmore has become a video game star a la Tony Hawk.</p><p>Netflix has also partnered with Spotify for a separate interactive experience, the Happy Gilmore 2 Tournament. Available within the Spotify app, the tournament features film-inspired golf challenges, classic audio clips, hidden references, and even a custom playlist to blast while you play.</p><p>Over the past three years, the company has expanded its library to over 100 titles, moving beyond mobile to include more web and TV-compatible games. While it continues to develop games tied to popular Netflix IPs such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/squid-game-unleashed-lets-you-play-in-a-cartoonish-version-of-the-shows-capitalist-hellscape/1100-6525995/" data-ref-id="1100-6525995">Squid Game: Unleashed</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-adds-another-game-to-its-library-based-on-a-black-mirror-episode/1100-6530778/" data-ref-id="1100-6530778">Black Mirror: Thronglets</a>, and Blood Line: A Rebel Moon Game, the streamer is now focusing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/netflix-will-remove-all-of-these-games-in-july-2025/2900-6698/" data-ref-id="2900-6698">less on acquiring indie games</a> and more on developing more games tied to their original programming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It has not been a great couple of weeks for Steam, Itch.io, adult games, or our right to freedom of expression. First payment processors came for Steam, forcing Valve to change its policies and remove a number of adult games, and now they’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/itch-io-nsfw-adult-content-remove-payment-processors-collective-shout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so thoroughly backed Itch into a corner</a> that it temporarily deindexed nearly all of its NSFW content. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we talk about why it’s maybe not super great that payment processors wield this kind of unilateral, unchecked power. Just a thought!</p><p>This time around, we’re&nbsp; joined by Isla Hinck of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EasyAllies/videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Easy Allies</a>, aka the Aftermath of YouTube. Isla and I met just one week ago, at <a href="https://aftermath.site/warframe-old-peace-world-war-one-interview-tennocon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this year’s TennoCon</a>, the official <em>Warframe </em>convention (yes, <em>Warframe </em>has an official convention), so we regale Chris with tales of our time at a refreshingly positive show attended by fans who just seem to… love a thing? In 2025? I’m as surprised as you are. We also got to explore developer Digital Extremes’ office inside a dead mall, which was a trip unto itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we discuss a significantly more dispiriting piece of news: Payment processors, urged on by a militantly censorious group called Collective Shout, have brought their anti-porn crackdown to Steam and Itch.io, an attack on free speech that will almost certainly not end with porn. Finally, decide which kind of Hideo Kojima-created guy we’d like to be, and then we tease what Aftermath has planned for the rest of the year.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we, too, can have an office inside a dead mall in London, Ontario – perhaps even the same one as Digital Extremes. We’ll get the (literal) inside scoop on all things <em>Warframe </em>and eat at Subway every day. It’ll be great.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Isla: </strong>It’s when a company can just editorialize on what they think is moral, is where things get really murky.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> As Luke said in our article: "The idea that faceless, unaccountable payment processors – which enjoy vast monopolies over the world's commerce, and by extension its marketplaces – can wield their power so swiftly, as they've increasingly been doing now for years, is downright terrifying."</p><p><strong>Isla: </strong>Yeah, late stage capitalism’s a hell of a drug!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Whenever you’d go to the top-selling games on Itch, you’d always see the most extreme eroge game. I remember one that was about sawing a doll lady in half. You’ve just gotta be comfortable with the fact that what people find attractive in terms of kink shit sometimes – illegal stuff notwithstanding – is gonna be fucked up. It’s not necessarily tethered to you as a person. And I’m pretty absolutist about NSFW games being there, because what? Are you gonna go to the video game store [to buy them]?</p><p><strong>Isla:</strong> I’ve done some work in film and interfacing with horror filmmakers and stuff like that, and almost across the board, some of the nicest people I’ve ever met are horror buffs. People who are into the sickest shit you’ve ever heard of are the nicest, most well-adjusted people you’ve ever met. Whereas some of the people I’ve met who are in more repressed or controlling communities can be real assholes. So what’s better?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Real assholes who generally want to, as a result of the communities they’re a part of, control and repress others. Because they think that’s how things have to be.</p><p>But I think it’s pretty much impossible to disconnect all of this from the larger crackdown on art and works around and by queer and trans creators. This is the foot in the door, saying, “Oh, there are these things that are obscene, and we can’t allow that.” Then you just declare any sort of queer art obscene, and then there you go: Now you also have payment processors on board with eliminating that as well. Eventually all you have left is a homogenized straight soup that is akin to what the powers that be approved of in the 1800s or whenever.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>It is also funny that they finally found a way to censor video games for real. They found an actual form of censorship, which is just “You can’t buy them.” Visa and Mastercard are saying, “This is a legal liability for me, so fuck you.” It’s really disheartening that we have to live with that. And I don’t think any of this is popular. People don’t want this broadly. It’s the weird moment we’re living in: You see the swings that are happening from a very vocal right, but most of the policies being enacted are largely unpopular.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, and if we’re talking about the anti-porn movement, that’s been around for a minute at this point, and again, it’s a thing that starts in one place with a goal of ending in a much more repressive place. The initial messaging was like “Porn is bad for you. It distorts your mind and your views on what sex is,” but the movement is not actually anti-porn; it’s anti-sex work. And it’s not surprising that the anti-porn movement really took root around the time that things like OnlyFans were becoming popular. Suddenly sex workers were able to make money more independently and have more direct control over their lives and careers.</p><p><strong>Isla:</strong> God forbid a woman, largely, gains any kind of financial independence. To boil it down, it’s about commodity and the commodification of women’s bodies – and owning that. If someone is doing that outside the normal channels, [powerful people] want to monetize for themselves, and if they can’t, they’ll crack down on it.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It’s just crazy that [groups like Collective Shout] found this way to do it. You can only go so far in terms of direct censoriousness – in terms of leveraging laws that were constructed at least nominally with the idea of free speech in mind – to make sure that somebody can’t do or say something. So they’re like “Well, let’s just skip all that. Let’s go around that and go through payment processors, which have all this normal control that most normal people never think about.” They do not think about just how powerful the companies in charge of how we spend money are: some of the most powerful in the world, far and away.</p><p><strong>Isla:</strong> Especially in a world where I don’t think I’ve touched cash in a year. I pay for everything with my phone. I don’t even use an actual card anymore. The entire structure of my getting food every day is based on Apple Pay and DoorDash – all services I’ve agreed to a terms of service on that I never read, because no one ever does. It could all just be taken away at any time because of this, that, or the other thing. The house of cards on which everything is built is so intricate and so terrifying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/spice-girls-anime-production-ig"><h3>I’m Mad We Didn’t Get A Spice Girls Anime</h3></a><p>Look I'm not saying it would have been good, but just look at how cool it looks!</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lollipop-chainsaw-game-reboot-anime-woke-nonsense-dei-back-in-my-day"><h3>Let’s All Read A Shitty Video Game Press Release Together</h3></a><p>'The development process will prioritize staying true to the distinctive tone and spirit of the original work, without...'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ozzy-osbourne-death-blizzcon-2009-world-of-warcraft"><h3>Ozzy Osbourne Played A Video Game Convention In 2009, And It Ruled</h3></a><p>"The kids had a great time.

<p>If the leak is correct, EA and PopCap Games' remaster of the 2009 tower defense game will be launching on Switch on 23rd October 2025 for 19,99 €. We'll also be hearing about Replanted officially within the next month — that could mean Gamescom, but it could also mean <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">a Nintendo Direct</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="PA87rC9nG4k" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f11fuvjxgp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA87rC9nG4k" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Plants vs. Zombies Replanted was originally spotted on EA's servers very briefly, before the publisher removed it. Not before video footage of the game being discovered was shared online, of course (above).</p>
<p>So it seems pretty inevitable, then. The original game was available on DS and DSiWare, but hasn't been made available on other Nintendo consoles. Considering how well loved the OG is, the remaster will probably be pretty well received.</p>

Public visibility brings more scrutiny, and you can’t find an actor in Hollywood more visible than Pascal these days.

Pascal has been a successful actor for a while, but he’s definitely become a staple of franchise entertainment in recent years. He was in <em>Game of Thrones</em>, is in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-mandalorian-season-3-baby-yoda-games-books-tv-1840299667&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-mandalorian-season-3-baby-yoda-games-books-tv-1840299667"><em>Star Wars </em>show</a></span><em>, </em>and is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-mandalorian-grogu-baby-yoda-new-movie-2024-1851152136&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-mandalorian-grogu-baby-yoda-new-movie-2024-1851152136">getting his own movie next year</a></span>. Add on his role in <em>The Last of Us </em>and now the MCU, and Pascal is everywhere toxic fandoms exist. But also, right now you can go to a movie theater and see him in three different films: <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>, <em>Eddington</em>, and <em>Materialists</em>. Oh, right, he was just in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gladiator-2-paul-mescal-pedro-pascal-trailer-date-1851570038&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gladiator-2-paul-mescal-pedro-pascal-trailer-date-1851570038"><em>Gladiator II</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/robot-movies-kids-children-ranked-walle-the-wild-robot-1851658849&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/robot-movies-kids-children-ranked-walle-the-wild-robot-1851658849"><em>The Wild Robot</em></a></span>, too. The man’s getting his bag, but you can be a good actor starring in quality stuff and still get backlash for people never hearing the end of you. It’s an “I can’t miss you if you won’t leave” sort of deal.</p><p>Unlike some celebrities who get this brand of weird fatigue-based backlash, Pascal has the distinction of being pretty likable, and has gone viral plenty of times for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU7-KMGZ4bc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU7-KMGZ4bc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being personable and funny in interviews</a></span>. So if he’s not on your TV screen, he’s probably on your glowing slab giving a sound bite. But those interviews and public appearances are now precisely the place where the actor is getting the most backlash. Pascal is currently promoting <em>Fantastic Four </em>alongside his co-star Vanessa Kirby, who plays his character’s wife. The two have been notably touchy-feely on the road, and this has led to many presumptuous accusations about the two’s relationship and Pascal’s treatment of his female co-stars. This all goes back to a viral clip from San Diego Comic-Con in 2024, in which the two held hands on stage while promoting the film. Kirby herself has gone on the record in an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/pedro-pascal-cover-story?&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/pedro-pascal-cover-story?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Vanity Fair</em></a></span> saying that both the actors were nervous to be on stage talking about the film, and that it was a grounding moment for both of them.</p><p>“What happened is we were both incredibly nervous going out in front of thousands of people who love this comic,” Kirby told <em>Vanity Fair</em>. “He wanted me to know that we were in this together, and I found it a lovely gesture and was very glad to squeeze his hand back.”</p><p>But that’s not the only footage of Pascal and Kirby getting close, and now a subset of the internet is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JohnEkdahl/status/1948159649527513282&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JohnEkdahl/status/1948159649527513282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turning on him</a></span>, accusing him of inappropriate behavior in these interactions despite it being very obvious that Kirby <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/sakotrak/status/1947672425275314287&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/sakotrak/status/1947672425275314287" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is initiating plenty of the contact</a></span>, the existence of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pedro-pascal-oscar-isaac-cuddle-new-photo-response-online_n_67cf2cbde4b04dd3a4e5a2bd&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pedro-pascal-oscar-isaac-cuddle-new-photo-response-online_n_67cf2cbde4b04dd3a4e5a2bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">footage of him also being touchy with male co-stars</a></span>, and explanations about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a65488380/pedro-pascal-anxiety/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a65488380/pedro-pascal-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor’s struggles with anxiety</a></span> as a contributing factor for his asking for person-to-person contact.</p><p>One important piece of context is that Pascal has become especially vocal in his support for trans people in a time when the grifters of the culture war will wield anything they can to try and take down people they perceive as enemies. The actor attended the <em>Thunderbolts* </em>premiere <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/style/pedro-pascals-trans-women-tee-intl-scli&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/style/pedro-pascals-trans-women-tee-intl-scli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wearing a shirt in support of the transgender community</a></span>, has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2025/06/30/the-feud-between-jk-rowling-and-pedro-pascal-explained/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2025/06/30/the-feud-between-jk-rowling-and-pedro-pascal-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called out <em>Harry Potter </em>author J.K. Rowling</a></span> for her anti-trans efforts, and been a vocal supporter of his trans sister, actor and activist Lux Pascal. Yes, Pascal is having a moment, and some people online are probably tired of seeing him in big movies, but there’s an unmistakable bigoted corner of the internet that is looking to tear down someone they see as a powerful, influential enemy in a smear campaign. </p><p>Ultimately, whatever genuine concerns people may have about Pascal’s behavior are rooted in a parasocial assumption that we’re all experts in reading people we’ve never met. The internet treats real celebrities like they’re characters whose goals and motivations are all up for interpretation. Every viral video or tweet is treated like a lore drop to be dissected for your favorite or most-hated character in the multimedia franchise of life. Innocent until proven guilty only applies to the public figures you like, I suppose? Unless someone actually comes forward, this entire controversy feels manufactured, but reality has never stopped nonsense from persisting.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-anxiety-touch-controversy-1851787007]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wildgate-review-in-progress.1253721/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It only took one match of Wildgate to see the potential in its spacefaring PvPvE mayhem. Now, after just over 20 hours of playtime, I’m also noticing where there is still room for it to build on that compelling concept. The intensely cooperative chaos of managing a spacecraft, delving into PvE dungeons for loot, and fending off rival crews makes for complex and exciting contests of teamwork and communication. Unfortunately, that level of coordination doesn’t always lead to great outcomes when matchmaking with random crewmates, where silent players or, worse yet, insanely toxic personalities can make for a bad time. But when a matchmade crew manages to come together, or you bring your own friends to the party, Wildgate’s simple but solid gunplay and multifaceted ship-to-ship combat give <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-review-2020"><u>Sea of Thieves</u></a> a run for its money. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wildgate is a unique multiplayer sci-fi shooter that sends five teams of four players out into the most dangerous section of the galaxy, called the Reach, to battle it out for loot and glory. Their ultimate goal is to find the all-important Artifact hidden somewhere in space and escape with it out of the Wildgate, but since there’s the little issue of only being one to go around, a clash of crews in tumultuous FPS combat is all but inevitable. To improve your chances of survival (and search for the Artifact along the way), you’ll want to hurriedly touch down to enter as many of the small PvE dungeons as possible, killing enemies and solving simple puzzles to claim whatever loot they’re hiding. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Upgrading your spacecraft with better shields, weapons, defensive measures, and stat improvements (like improved turning speed) can make all the difference when an enemy vessel nears and all hell breaks loose, which make for Wildgate’s tensest moments. If you’re able to find and escape with the Artifact, or simply murder all the enemy crews before they’re able to extract it themselves, then victory is yours, and in matches that can run over 40 minutes each, the taste of triumph is one of the sweetest there is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no story to be found in Wildgate, or at least not one outside of little snippets you can read from a menu between matches, but the world definitely has a distinct and endearing personality to it. That could be in the baddies you run into like raiders and alien life forms who look like booger people, or the playable characters, called Prospectors, who span from a big dog-looking alien to an aquatic creature in a mecha fishbowl. Each Prospector has their own interesting set of traits and abilities they can use to contribute to the team’s success (or demise). Ion, the four-armed alien can use his brawn to damage the hulls of ships just by smacking them with his fists, while Venture the robot serves as a great starter character since they don’t require oxygen to survive, regenerate health faster, and get warned when enemies are behind them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve had a lot of fun trying each one out to see which suits my playstyle, with my favorite being Mophs the winged, bird-like humanoid that can turn invisible, which is absolutely invaluable when boarding enemy ships to perform subterfuge. But as is the case with lots of stuff in Wildgate, the biggest issue is simply a scarcity of options, because it doesn’t take long at all to unlock and try each of them out. Seeing the same handful of familiar characters aboard each ship just feels a bit underwhelming in an endless galaxy of possibilities.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It could have some real legs with updates, but I already feel like I’ve seen just about everything right now.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Though matches have been a lot of fun to play repeatedly the past few days, with only one game mode, seven characters, four models of starship, and a handful of weapons to use, it all feels a tad thin at the moment. If developer Moonshot Games comes out the (wild)gate swinging with regular updates that introduce new weapons, enemies, characters, and ships in the fashion of something like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-review"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a>, then I can definitely see Wildgate having some real legs. But, at the moment, it feels like just a taste of what will hopefully be a game with a lot more variety down the road, and I already feel like I’ve seen just about everything that can happen across the matches I’ve played so far. There’s still a ton of fun to be found in getting better at winning, and knowing what I know now about the types of dungeons to be found and loot to be claimed has made me a lot more strategic with how I play, but I stopped being surprised by things I saw out in the Reach pretty quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve got plenty more of Wildgate to play before my final review – I didn’t even talk about ship-to-ship combat yet, for example, since I’m still in the process of trying all of the different vessels out – but so far it’s been a lot of fun to play with friends marred by much less fun matches when on matchmade teams (the amount of slurs I heard shouted over the proximity voice chat on day one was frankly startling). I’m hopeful the Moonshot will be quick to add new content, because there’s the makings of a great live-service game here, and I’m eager to dive back in.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite 4-Player FPS Games</h3></p></div></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/wildgate-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>I maintain a to-do list of story ideas to write at Ars, and for about a year "monthly column on DOS games I love" has been near the top of the list. When we spoke with the team at GOG, it felt less like an obligation and more like a way to add another cool angle to what I was already planning to do.</p>
<p>I'm going to start with the PC game I played most in high school and the one that introduced me to the very idea of online play. That game is <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fdescent"><em>Descent</em></a>.</p>
<p>As far as I can recall, <em>Descent</em> was the first shooter to be fully 3D with six degrees of freedom. It's not often in today's gaming world that you get something completely and totally new, but that's exactly what <em>Descent</em> was 30 years ago in 1995.</p>
<p>Developed by Parallax Studios and published by Interplay, the game was a huge success at the time, moving millions of copies in a market where only an elite few had ever achieved that. It was distributed in part via shareware and played a role in keeping that model alive and bringing it from the just-retail-and-friends-sharing-floppies era to the Internet-download era.</p>
<p>And fittingly for this list, <em>Descent</em> is also a part of GOG history. For one thing, it was one of the launch titles for GOG's open beta in 2008. Later, it and its sequels mysteriously disappeared from the platform in 2015. It came out that the game's publisher had not been paying royalties as owed to the developer, leading to a breakdown in the relationship that resulted in the game being pulled from all storefronts. In 2017, the <em>Descent</em> titles returned to GOG and other digital sales platforms.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the story of the studio that evolved from the one that originally made <em>Descent</em> ended sadly, as is so often the case for classic studios these days. Parallax morphed into Volition, the company that most recently made the Saints Row games, among others. Volition was acquired by Embracer Group, a holding company that has made a reputation for itself by gutting storied studios and laying off industry luminaries. Volition was among the ones it shuttered completely.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>So, let's pour one out for Parallax-&gt;Volition and take a flight through the memory of <em>Descent</em>'s evil-robot-infested mines.</p>
<h2>Single player</h2>
<p>I played <em>Descent</em> when I was a teenager. Obviously, some of you were older, playing it in college or well into adulthood. Others reading this probably weren't even born when it came out. But for me, this was a defining game of my teenage years, alongside <em>Mechwarrior 2</em>, <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>, <em>Meridian 59</em>, <em>Civilization II</em>, and <em>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</em>.</p>
<p>I remember my friend giving me the shareware demo, telling me that it was the most technically impressive and visceral thing he'd ever played. I installed it and launched it, and the whole vibe immediately resonated with me: It was just the kind of gritty, corpo-sci-fi I loved then and still do today.</p>
<p>It took some getting used to, though. The default keyboard controls were not great, and it was a lot to learn trying to operate in so many axes of movement and rotation. I'll admit I had trouble making it stick at first.</p>
<p>That changed a few months later; the same friend who was obsessed with <em>Descent</em> often played the tabletop game <em>BattleTech</em> with his brother and me, and so we were all eyeing <em>Mechwarrior 2</em>—which launched not long after <em>Descent</em>—with great interest. I had never purchased a flight stick before, but that seemed important for <em>Mechwarrior 2</em>, so I did, and that was the secret to unlocking <em>Descent</em>'s charms for me.</p>
<p>(Of course, the <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fdescent">GOG version of <em>Descent</em></a> and various community patches offer mouse support, so it's far easier to get into without extra hardware now than it was back then.)</p>
<p>Once my flying went from chaos to control, I became completely hooked. I beat the game more than a dozen times, though I'll admit in the later playthroughs I made liberal use of cheats (gabbagabbahey!).</p>
<p>I loved the loop of destroying the reactor then escaping through the labyrinthine tunnels—something I don't think many other games have truly copied since then. I loved the music (though <em>Descent 2</em>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP4QFb0gzb0&amp;list=PLRCWcYuqfcLzO2RzvZ63Jem1h8ckOewKF&amp;index=11">astoundingly good soundtrack</a> by Skinny Puppy far surpassed it) and the process of getting better at the movement through practice.</p>

      The story is minimal, but something about the vibes just work for me in that '80s anti-corporate sci-fi sort of way.

<p>I played so much that as I improved, I found even the harder difficulty levels were not enough to challenge me. That's when the world of online deathmatches (or Anarchy, as <em>Descent</em> called the mode) opened to me for the first time.</p>

<h2>Multiplayer</h2>
<p>To be clear, I had played some multiplayer games online before, but up to that point, that only included text MUDs. I loved MUDs and still do, but there's nothing like a fast-paced, action-packed online deathmatch.</p>
<p>It started with playing with my friends via direct dial-up; I have distinct memories of <em>Descent</em> Anarchy matches that were interrupted at pivotal moments by parents picking up the phone to make a call and inadvertently killing the connection.</p>
<p>As a side note, it turns out that my colleague Lee Hutchinson was also heavily into <em>Descent</em> matches with his friends, and he was so kind as to provide a short clip of one of those original matches from 30 years ago to include here, which you can watch below. (Unfortunately, I was not so forward thinking as Lee, and I did not preserve my replays for posterity.)</p>

<p>I was the first of my friends to put in the effort to test my skills against the wider world. My memory of the details is fuzzy, but as I recall, online matches were arranged through Kali, an MS-DOS emulator of the IPX protocol for TCP/IP connections. It was nontrivial to set up, but it could have been worse.</p>
<p>I still remember, like it was last week, the Friday night I spent playing <em>Descent</em> online for the first time. It was a defining moment of my gamer origin story.</p>

<p>I'm not saying it was the best-balanced game in the world; balance was barely a thought then, and multiplayer game design was nascent. But the range of skills, the trash talk (which I'm not into now, but at the time I enjoyed, being the young punk I was), the rage-inducing lag: these were all a taste of an experience I still enjoy to this day in games like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>The Finals</em>, and <em>Overwatch 2</em>, among others.</p>
<p>Maybe it's pure nostalgia talking, but there was nothing quite like playing <em>Descent</em> on Kali.</p>
<h2>Entering the mines in 2025</h2>
<p>For this article, I spent several hours playing <em>Descent</em> for the first time in I don't even know how long. It was just as fun as I remembered. I was surprised at how well it holds up today, apart from the visual presentation.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the game's community has done an amazing job with patches. <a href="https://www.dxx-rebirth.com/">DXX-Rebirth</a> and <a href="https://dxx-redux.com/">DXX-Redux</a> add support for modern display resolutions, bring much-needed quality of life and input changes, and more. In my opinion, you shouldn't even launch the game without installing one of them. The <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fdescent">GOG version</a> has the essential tweaks to make the game run on modern systems and input devices, but these community patches go the extra mile to make it feel more like a modern remaster without sacrificing the art or vibe of the original release in any way.</p>
<p>Single-player is easier to get into than ever, and you might be surprised to learn that there are still people playing multiplayer. A "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/descent/comments/146grks/descent_getting_started_guide/">getting started guide</a>" post by Reddit user XVXCHILLYBUSXVX lists Discord channels you can join to arrange games with other players; some have regularly scheduled matches in addition to impromptu, ad hoc matchups.</p>
<p>If you <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fdescent">give it a shot</a>, maybe you'll run into me there. Or at least, you'll run into my mega missile!</p>
