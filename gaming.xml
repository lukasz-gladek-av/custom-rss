            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a> will soon receive updates that let you earn more XP per shootbrawl, rank up faster, and unlock gadgets and weapons attachments sooner. The tweaks are coming in response to frustrations about sluggish progression that have seen players pack the game's community servers with XP-farming matches against bots.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"We've heard your feedback around the pace of progression," the developers cry out to us <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979107918185157116">from the corpse-strewn deserts of social media</a>, "especially how long it can take to unlock hardware such as gadgets, and weapon attachments. We know progression is an important part of feeling rewarded for your time on the battlefield." 
</p><p>
So what changes are they making? Firstly, they're bumping up XP from match completion and daily login bonuses by 10% and 40% respectively. Secondly, they're reducing the XP required to unlock the first 20 attachment ranks, meaning you can "start earning useful attachments almost twice as fast". Be warned that if you're already making headway with a particular weapon's unlocks after the update goes live, you might see some weirdness on the UI, "but this should resolve itself once a match is played while using that weapon". 
</p>
<p>In other news, assignments (multiplayer challenges to earn cosmetics and such) that once required career ranks 20, 23, and 26 will now require career ranks 10, 15, and 20, respectively. The devs are aware that this doesn't address wider misgivings about assignments, without going into details - they're "actively working on reviewing them, but it will take more time to develop, test, and implement these changes."
</p><p>It's all in the name of making Battlefield 6's online arsenal-growing feel "smoother and more rewarding while still keeping that sense of achievement when you complete a milestone". It's also in the name of stemming the flood of bot factories in the community servers section.
</p>
<p>"Over the past week, many of you noticed that we reached maximum capacity on community servers," the devs go on. "After reviewing the data, we found that a large number of these servers were created primarily to earn XP, inflate player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots. 
</p>
<p>"We completely understand the motivation behind this, like faster progression and a way to test setups without pressure, but it's led to some unintended side effects. With so many servers focused on farming XP rather than active play, it's become noticeably harder for players to create and find experiences to play with other people."
</p>
<p>Battlefield's Community Experiences, EA rather primly point out, are "meant to be a space for creativity, experimentation, and connection, where you can easily find and enjoy great modes with your friends and squadmates". They're not supposed to be Operation Firestorm-sized treadmills. There's an overfamiliar op ed to write here about how live service operations of Battlefield's stature routinely grind away their own sense of play. I will spare you that. Instead I'll say that some of my most relaxing experiences during the Battlefield 6 review write-up were bot matches. It's so cute how they play-act at flanking and taking cover.
</p><p>Aside from greasing the progression chute, EA are "developing adjustments that are intended to diminish the number of XP farms taking up server space while further emphasizing playing with friends on both custom and verified experiences." Once they've carried out the associated backend maintenance, they expect that "all experiences, both custom and verified, will need to be republished by players before they can create an active server". 
</p>
<p>Look out for these updates "within the next week, potentially sooner depending on testing and verification". The devs close by acknowledging other complaints about "visibility, weapon bloom, vehicles not spawning, and more". They'll be patching those issues down the road, having already wrestled the hydra of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-gets-a-hotfix-targeting-bugged-hit-damage-and-ea-are-busy-inspecting-bouncy-ladders">bouncy ladders</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-backend-tweaks-tune-down-some-sniper-rifles-and-shotguns-as-ea-keep-fiddling-with-little-knobs">overclocked sniper rifles</a>.</p>
<p>Seems like the new field-battler is a hit, clogged-up levelling system notwithstanding. Yesterday, EA announced that it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-battlefield-6-is-best-selling-entry-in-the-series-7m-copies-sold-172m-online-matches">the best-selling Battlefield so far</a>.</p>

"The truth is simple: I did not make that choice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure.

"Ubisoft has been my home for all my professional life, and I will always be grateful for the people, the projects, and the belief that together we could create worlds that inspire millions. But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly: I did not walk away. I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As someone who grew up inspired by Star Trek (TNG!), in the later years of my career I came to see myself as the captain of the Assassin's Creed ship, someone who leaves only once every soul on board is safe. And that is exactly what I have done for as long as I could."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Côté joined Ubisoft in 2005 as a software engineer, and began working on Assassin's Creed series in time for Brotherhood. Subsequent projects saw Côté take on increasingly senior roles for Assassin's Creed 3, Black Flag DLC Freedom Cry, Assassin's Creed Syndicate, and then Assassin's Creed Odyssey, for which he served as senior producer.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In March 2022, as Ubisoft sought to re-establish the series under a more singular vision, Côté stepped up to lead overall development. It was Côté who laid out plans for a string of Assassin's Creed projects (including Shadows, the upcoming witchcraft-focused Assassin's Creed Hexe and a fresh multiplayer project), and Côté who spoke out last December to defend the series and its developers amid a firestorm of discourse surrounding Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft is expected to hire a new Assassin's Creed franchise boss in the coming months, ahead of a busy 2026 filled with further additions to Shadows, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stop-removing-the-modern-day-assassins-creed-fans-react-as-black-flag-remake-reportedly-cuts-everything-outside-the-animus">highly-anticipated reveal of a Black Flag remake</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Andrej Ivanov/AFP via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

One aspect of the game that some Japanese fans have been getting excited about is simply chilling with your Pokémon outside an in-game cafe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">YouTuber and blogger Koiwa Hawawa posted on Twitter / X: “What I’m most looking forward to in Z-A is having tea with Pokémon. But could it be that your Pokémon is just staring at the desserts? Is there anything more cruel?”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">ZAで一番楽しみにしているのがポケモンとお茶することなんだけど<br>もしかしてポケモンはただお菓子を眺めているだけ？🥺<br>そんな酷いことある？ <a href="https://t.co/cHq5AplYtF" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/cHq5AplYtF</a></p>— 小岩井はわわ (@chandelure115) <a href="https://twitter.com/chandelure115/status/1977699248234774685?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">What Hawawa noticed is that while the trainer relaxes over a cuppa and cake, their Pokémon just sits on the other chair with nothing on the table in front of it. As evidence of possible Pokémon cruelty, Hawawa posted screenshots. The last image highlights Totodile, whose wide eyes and open mouth make him look like he is salivating at the thought of some sweet treats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This post quickly attracted views (1.3 million at the time of this article's publication) and comments from other users, with many questioning whether or not Pokémon can eat sweets meant for humans without getting <a href="https://x.com/Holstein1382/status/1977994594228015224" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>some serious indigestion</u></a>. However, as many pointed out, Pokémon have a history of eating <a href="https://x.com/dragoodin12/status/1977942828396495096" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>all sorts of things</u></a>, even curry and sandwiches (in Generations VIII and IX respectively). One user even posted <a href="https://x.com/MfmmKPcPlp19684/status/1977972421962707411" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an image</u></a> of Meowth and Rocket Team members stuffing themselves with ramen.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">ロケット団は一緒にラーメン食べてるのに！ <a href="https://t.co/iTV6ul0CCk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/iTV6ul0CCk</a> <a href="https://t.co/7xpbQFrvM3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/7xpbQFrvM3</a></p>— プルプルマン (@MfmmKPcPlp19684) <a href="https://twitter.com/MfmmKPcPlp19684/status/1977972421962707411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">One thing fans were in agreement with was that the Pokémon should also be snacking on something alongside their trainer. “Whether it's a Poké Block, Poké Puff or Poffin, just give it something delicious,” one <a href="https://x.com/yana_piyo/status/1977968594396008456" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user</u></a> implored. Another added: “The only food on the table is the protagonist’s, so for me that’s a bit of a negative.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But maybe the Pokémon are content with just watching you eat? Discovered cafes in Legends: Z-A serve as fast travel points, and visiting them has several benefits. Firstly, sitting with a particular Pokémon strengthens your bond, which could be helpful for evolving them later on. Plus, buying drinks at a cafe restores your entire party’s health and removes status effects, so maybe your Totodile is sneaking a sip when you are not looking? </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you have already picked up Pokémon Legends Z-A and are wondering which initial Pokémon to pick, see our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/pokemon-legends-z-a-which-starter-should-you-choose"><u>tips for choosing from the game’s three starters</u></a>.

It’s an issue affecting every class from Engineers to Recon, especially when exiting a building or, even worse, aiming down sights (ADS) while looking outside from the inside of a structure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's my main issue right now,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o40tn9/comment/nizcris/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one Reddit user commented</u></a>. “It actually gives me a headache.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Footage of the issues plaguing Battlefield 6 players is hard to ignore, and we here at IGN have experienced them, too. Simply walking around on outdoor maps rarely presents any issues, but the instant you try to leave a building, nearly the entire screen turns white from the sheer power of the sun. It’s the kind of thing that would be annoying for any game, much less a relatively competitive military shooter where every bullet counts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear if bright lights in Battlefield 6 affect more players on PC, PlayStation 5, or Xbox, or if the issue is present across all versions of the game. While few have tried to argue the bright light adjustment effects are realistic and should stay, the vast majority of players seem to disagree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I got people sledge hammering drones riding up to the sky hitting 500m shots but my operator forgot sun protective glasses?

		<p>Last year, Ubisoft confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/11/the-crew-motorfest-and-the-crew-2-are-both-getting-offline-modes/">The Crew Motorfest and The Crew 2 would both be getting offline modes</a>, and now that is a reality for The Crew 2. Ubisoft has released the Hybrid Mode update for The Crew 2, which allows players to continue playing the game online or to play The Crew 2 offline. If you are connected to the internet you can choose to play online or offline, but if you are not connected to the internet The Crew 2 will automatically launch into offline mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Crew Showcase 2025: new playground, race creator, offline mode…" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aydLtR1KzvQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>However, it has to be noted that online and offline saves are separate. While online data can be exported offline, offline save data cannot be exported to online. In addition, any online save data that is transferred to offline will overwrite any offline save data. This means any offline progression you have made that does not match online will be lost. When it comes to rewards and DLC, these need to be claimed online then exported to the offline save so these items can be used there. The Crew Credits balance is included in offline save data so you can buy cars offline, but any items or bundles only available in the online Crew Credits store cannot be purchased offline. Ubisoft has listed what is not available in the offline mode:</p>
<ul>
<li data-sleek-node-id="HiVDq7">Crew Credits purchases (vehicle bundles, vanity items) and the Far &amp; Beyond shop in all 4 Hubs.</li>
<li data-sleek-node-id="J7tW7S">LIVE Summits.</li>
<li data-sleek-node-id="FW7W7e">All multiplayer content, including PvP, Crews, crew features, news feed, leaderboards, ghosts, and statistics menus. Only your own best times will be recorded per race.</li>
<li data-sleek-node-id="wuQTXL">UGC features, including the Race Creator and Livery Editor. Custom liveries will not transfer to offline saves.</li>
<li data-sleek-node-id="VGMvxu">Some Hobbies and Achievements (Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Ubisoft Connect) that require online-only actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no detail yet when The Crew Motorfest will get the Hybrid mode to add offline to that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>What do you do when you’ve already made one of the best game controllers of all time? If you’re Victrix (or Turtle Beach, its parent company), you take a look for any missed opportunities and set to work again. That’s why we now have the BFG Reloaded. It’s a revision, rather than a revelation or revolution, but Victrix are steadily moving closer to peripheral perfection.</p>
<p><iframe title="Victrix™ Pro BFG™ Reloaded Wireless Modular Controller" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wdVQfElG71s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The BFG Reloaded is a wireless and wired, pro-styled modular controller, available for both the PS5 and Xbox Series consoles, with either iteration also playing nicely with PC. The BFG was named after the ultimate weapon in Doom, and while they might be stretching that metaphor to its logical conclusion, Victrix made a controller that can make <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/27/victrix-pro-bfg-controller-review/">a decent claim for it being the ultimate weapon for gamers</a>… and they’ve now reloaded it for another devastating blast.</p>


<p>In the box, you’re getting the controller itself, a sturdy hard case, modular units for the new Hall Effect left and right analogue sticks, and a revised six-button layout for fighting game aficionados that has shifted the inputs to make them more comfortable.</p>
<p>Besides that, there’s a thick braided cable in the requisite Victrix purple, alternate height analogue sticks, two further D-pad styles, as well as different-shaped gates for each analogue stick. All these options allow you to set the controller up exactly how you would want it, and there should be enough variety for everyone, no matter your skill level.</p>


<p>It’s a smart-looking piece of kit. If you were to turn up to a tournament with this in tow, you’d be certain of a few admiring glances. Our review unit came in black, but there’s also a white edition if that’s more your bag. It exudes modernity, edging towards futurism, but it doesn’t overdo the Cyberpunk, industrial vibes. In terms of visuals, I think it looks better than either Microsoft or Sony’s official controllers from this generation. Then again, at £170, it’s basically three times as expensive, so you’ll want something that bit more special.</p>
<p>Built from solid-feeling plastic, there’s rubberised grip sections at the front and wrapped around the rear grips, so it won’t slide about, even if you’re particularly prone to sweaty hands. These feel comfortable under your hand, and avoid the type of roughness you might experience with the P<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/13/powera-ops-v3-pro-wireless-controller-review/">owerA OPS V3 Pro</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/gamesir-cyclone-2-controller-review/">Gamesir Cyclone 2</a>.</p>
<p>Modular controllers are the Swiss Army Knife solution for pro controllers. Like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">Thrustmaster eSwap</a> series, the BFG Reloaded has alternate units that you can take out or swap in, allowing you to shift from a symmetrical to an asymmetrical stick layout, or to wholly change the controller setup by bringing in more face buttons for fans of games like Street Fighter 6. If you play a variety of different games to a competitive level, it makes more sense than most, as the BFG Reloaded can easily fulfil multiple roles.</p>

<p>It’s made particularly easy because you have a mini hex-shaped screwdriver in the case. Undoing each control unit is very straightforward, and you can whip the different parts out in a minute or two. To be honest, it’s fun just swapping the parts, never mind actually using them to play a game.</p>
<p>Visually, there’s little to differentiate the BFG Reloaded from its predecessor. This is fundamentally the same core controller, enhanced by the now-expected Hall Effect sticks and the improved fightpad layout. It is marginally more comfortable, but then, I didn’t have any problems with the original unit.</p>
<p>Amusingly, some members of the gaming community are now already decrying Hall Effect sticks as being a poor cousin to TMR sticks, even though the technology is a clear and distinct step up from the old-school potentiometer sticks we’ve had for years that have a nasty tendency to develop stick drift.</p>

<p>TMR sticks are admittedly newer and capable of being more precise, but Hall Effect sticks are still tried and tested, with proven durability that will last far longer than standard potentiometer sticks. The majority of players won’t be able to tell the difference between TMR and Hall Effect, and even at this price, I’m still happy to see Hall Effect sensors in place, and they feel excellent in the Pro BFG Reloaded.</p>
<p>The standard face button layout is enhanced by four further ‘pro’ inputs on the back, and I really like the way these are flared out, and differently sized so that they fit perfectly beneath your ring and middle fingers. They’re firm enough that I didn’t find myself accidentally hitting inputs, but quick enough to reliably perform in the heat of a Star Wars Battlefront II battle (my current multiplayer obsession).</p>
<p>At the rear, you’ll also find the lockouts for the triggers. Now, in the original version, I did find myself catching these at first, but I didn’t do that at all with the Reloaded edition, though perhaps that’s due to muscle memory. The lockouts reduce the travel of the triggers, and in doing so drastically improve your reaction time – generally a very good idea for games where you’re trying to shoot other people. Uniquely, you can set these at five different depths, and they’re independent of one another, giving you another level of customisation you won’t find elsewhere.</p>

<p>There are a few negatives though. The BFG Reloaded is coming out at the tail end of a year that’s seen multiple extremely competitive and advanced pro controller releases, and the triggers and the face buttons aren’t quite on the cutting edge that we’re seeing elsewhere.</p>
<p>The trigger shapes are excellent, comfortably rounded and perfectly flared, but they feel a touch too light and, in fairness, a little cheap and clacky. There’s also no mechanical switches in the standard control module – they are in the fight pad module, though – or in the trigger lockouts, and when that’s increasingly the norm that we’re seeing from manufacturers like Gamesir, it’s hard not to pine for the instantaneous feel you get from them.</p>
<p>The Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded still feels fast and responsive in use. Turtle Beach list it as having 5ms of input lag, though I can only imagine that this is in the wired mode, or based on its polling rate, with further testing generally finding that it hovers around 9ms.</p>

<p>This is still very fast, but it does put it behind the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/23/dualsense-edge-review-is-sonys-first-ps5-pro-controller-essential-for-gamers/">DualSense Edge</a> or the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/07/nacon-revolution-5-pro-controller-review-ps5/">Nacon Revolution 5 Pro</a>. If you want the absolute fastest, this isn’t it, but equally, I prefer the way the Pro BFG Reloaded feels in the hand over both of those options.</p>
<p>Few controllers have the customisation and modularity of the BFG Reloaded, and if you’re the type of gamer who’ll repeatedly hop between Street Fighter 6 and Battlefield 5, or who’s looking to create a very particular setup, there’s no better option out there. I really like the construction materials and the way it feels in the hand, but there are still missed opportunities in terms of mechanical inputs throughout, and the triggers aren’t in line with the competition anymore.</p>
<p>On PlayStation, your only other option for modular-style control is the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/10/turtle-beach-stealth-pivot-controller-review/">Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot</a>, which sees the extra controls hidden away in the body of the controller. The Pro BFG Reloaded is far more comfortable, though the Stealth Pivot is considerably cheaper at £120. On PC, if you’re looking for modularity, it’s well worth considering the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">Thrustmaster eSwap</a>, which has also just received a Hall Effect update, though this only comes in a wired option, and is better suited for larger hands.</p>

<p>You and meme</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Ah, the humble Metroidvania. We've seen more additions to this genre than we can count in recent years and now — with all other bases covered, presumably — even memes are being adapted into the format of non-linear exploration.</p>
<p>After a successful Kickstarter campaign, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/this_is_fine_maximum_cope">This is Fine: Maximum Cope</a> takes KC Green's iconic dog meme and bends it into a metroidvania complete with perilous platforming, challenging bosses, nasty enemies and unlockable abilities. Oh yes, and it all takes place in the anxiety-riddled mind of the central character, Question Hound.</p>
<p>It launches on Switch in <strong>March 2026</strong>, promising adventures through five wild worlds of Humiliation, Fear, Failure, Loss, and Regret, plenty of collectibles, coffee sips and burning 'This is Fine' rest points — because of course.</p>
<p>We're not sure if we're completely sold on the above trailer's speed just yet; that said, the funny little dog animations are a nice touch, and we're getting hints of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cuphead">Cuphead</a> from some of those grizzly-looking boss battles. Who knows, maybe memes make for great games!</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from its Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explore the landscapes, beat bosses, unlock abilities, and access new chapters. This is a metroidvania. As you platform your way through each world you’ll encounter enemies, each an embodiment of everyday worries. Through navigation and persistence, you will ultimately face the challenging bosses unique to every area. Defeat them and acquire the abilities needed to progress further (and explore previous areas in more depth)!</p>
<p>Be sure to stop at every burning Rest Point to save, sip coffee, and pretend everything is fine for a brief moment. Collect Coffee Beans as you explore; your currency used to purchase perks and refill your healing coffee cup. Keep your eyes peeled everywhere you go if your heart is set on finding every quirky collectible!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Publisher Numskill Games and developer Hero Concept have also announced that a Switch physical version is on the horizon, so keep an eye out for more information on that one in the coming months if you want to add a bit of meme memorabilia to your shelf.</p>
<p><em>What do you make of this one? Does it look... fine? Take your coffee sips to the comments and let us know.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new skirmish wargame is coming courtesy of Osprey Games. <em>Warriors of Athena</em>, the newest project by Joseph McCullough, brings quests and nail-biting fights set during the time of Greek myth.</p>

<h2>The <em>Warriors of Athena</em> Announcement</h2>

<p><em>Warriors of Athena </em>will release in two books. Those books will feature illustrations by Hazem Ameen, whose work has been featured in Minos: Dawn of the Bronze Age and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pathfinder-adventure-card-game-review-co-op-excellence" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</em></a>.</p>

<p>These titular heroes are demigods, larger-than-life human beings blessed with the divine power of the Greek gods. These scenarios can be played solo, two-player co-op, or with an Oracle scripting and presenting scenarios for players to overcome.</p>

<p><em>Warriors of Athena: Quest</em> is a book packed with how to craft these scenarios. It contains four prewritten campaigns, advice on how to make your own, and a bestiary full of gods, monsters, and foes ready to challenge heroes.</p>

His body of work includes many beloved narrative-rich skirmish games such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/frostgrave-limited-deluxe-edition-celebrates-10-years-of-skirmish-mayhem" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Frostgrave</em></a>, and <em>Rangers of Shadow Deep</em>. But this game may be his biggest release yet. McCullough stated from the official press release the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Warriors of Athena</em> has allowed me to indulge in my childhood love of Greek myth while building upon my previous games to push tabletop miniature gaming into new narrative spaces. It’s also an excuse to paint some cool Greek heroes, centaurs, minotaurs, and maybe even a god or two!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Warriors of Athena</em> will be supported by a new line of miniatures by Osprey Games and North Star Military Figures. Both books are available for pre-order on Osprey's website in both hardcover and PDF format. They are expected to ship February 24, 2026 in the US and February 26, 2026 in the UK.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you had any doubts over the legitimacy of the recent wave of gargantuan Pokémon leaks, then The Pokémon Company COO Takato Utsunomiya calling for them all to be removed is probably the most telling piece of evidence you can ask for.</p>



<p>October 13 saw a seismic influx of Pokémon leaks hit the internet. We learned about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-wind-waves-gen-10-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Generation 10’s Wind and Wave</a>, a bunch of new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-games-and-dlc-roadmap-allegedly-revealed-in-new-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon games, and the DLC Roadmap</a>, not to mention potential Pokémon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-leak-reveals-boss-fight-and-mmo-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MMO Details</a>!</p>



<p>It’s been a rip-roaring few days, and we don’t think The Pokémon Company has taken too kindly to it all.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-wind-amp-wave-and-other-leaks-asked-to-be-taken-down">Pokémon Wind &amp; Wave And Other Leaks Asked To Be Taken Down</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’ve learned so much already. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Centro LEAKS</a> has become one of the go-to accounts in all of social media where Pokémon leaks are concerned. Some would argue it’s the account everyone refreshes. It posted a bunch of leaks ahead of Pokémon Legends Z-A, and it’s a regular source of Pokémon leaks for Pokémon Pocket and other associated media.</p>



<p>The page reported on October 16 that it had been contacted directly by The Pokémon Company.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Mr. Takato Utsunomiya, the Chief Operating Officer of The Pokémon Company, has personally sent an email to Centro Leaks / X to take down the Pokémon leak images.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Centro LEAKS has reiterated that it will not be removing any such leaks or images. In fact, the page has doubled down on its findings and revealed that among the images they want removed are the alleged Pokémon Wind and Wave logos.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The social media page has now pinned a message from Oct. 17, 2024, saying: “If only he knew that laws don’t exist in Perú.” </p>



<p>The message was presumably another instance of copyright issues between the page and The Pokémon Company, and it’s clear that Centro LEAKS’ stance won’t change in 2025. So, unless The Pokémon Company has something stronger in mind, Centro LEAKS will have all the original leaks on its page for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>Which of the leaks has intrigued you the most? Do the new Wind and Waves designs look good?

		<p>505 Games and Supernova Games Studios alongside KUNOS Simulazioni have announced Assetto Corsa Rally, and those who want to get hands on will not have to wait long as the game will be launched November 13th into Steam Early Access.

<p><iframe title="ASSETTO CORSA RALLY ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ueDItr3A3KM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Feeling the lack of a modern rally simulator, we’ve built a team and developed a technology to create one ourselves, with the support of drivers, engineers, collectors, mechanics, and industry experts.”</em> said Mauro Notarberardino, Supernova Studio Director. <em>“A special thanks goes to&nbsp;KUNOS Simulazioni, whose partnership was crucial in maintaining the signature feel of the series – especially in terms of the driving model – in this new chapter. Today marks an exciting new beginning for Supernova and Assetto Corsa Rally, and we can’t wait to share the journey with you.”</em></p>
<p><em>“A rally version of Assetto Corsa, when?! It has been one of the most frequent questions I’ve received over these years, and I can finally provide an answer.”</em> said Marco Massarutto, Co-Founder of KUNOS Simulazioni and the Assetto Corsa franchise and Executive Manager for KUNOS Simulazioni.</p>

<p>When Assetto Corsa Rally launches into early access, the content players will have access to includes 33km of fully laser scanned real life roads, four Special Stages with 18 variants, set across gravel roads in Wales and tarmac roads in Alsace, 10 iconic rally cars, including Group B, WRC and Rally2 vehicles,<br>
five game modes, and triple screen support. The content aim for the full release includes over 120 km of laser scanned real life roads, ten Special Stages with more than 35 variants across 5 international rallies, with new roads and content added continuously, a car roster featuring over 30 vehicles, new game modes, a rally school, a career mode, and complete VR support. A release date for all of that additional content has not yet been confirmed. Assetto Corsa Rally will also feature an advanced damage system which will show both visual damage and impact car performance.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Dragon Ball Game Project To Be Revealed In January 2025]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new Dragon Ball video game project will be announced in late January 2026 during a special celebration of the franchise's 40th anniversary.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/DB_anime_info">As confirmed on X by the official series anime profile</a>, the new game project will be announced during the Dragon Ball Genkidamasturi event on January 25, 2026. The event, which will be held at Makuhari Messe in Chiba, Japan will also feature other announcements, discussion panels and events hosted by Masako Nozawa (Goku voice actress), Akio Iyoku (executive producer) and Hironobu Kageyama, the composer of some of the series' most iconic opening tracks like Cha-La-Head-Cha-la and We Gotta Power, the opening themes for the classic DBZ anime.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Bandai Namco hasn't confirmed any other details on this new game project, so even speculation is difficult at this time. The fighting games <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-fighterz-super-saiyan-god/">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-an-explosive-love-letter/">Dragon Ball Sparking! ZERO</a> are still receiving updates and new content, as is the role-playing game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-authentic-ambitious-adequate/">Dragon Ball Kakarot</a>, Dragon Ball: The Breakers, and multiple free-to-play games like Dokkan Battle, Legends and Gekishin Squadra.</p>



<p>As hyping up a new game announcement so far ahead of time wouldn't make sense for a minor project possibly belonging to video game genres that are still actively represented by other titles, there's a solid chance this new announcement could be something unique and unexpected. Hopefully, it will be an adequate game to celebrate the legacy of Akira Toriyama, who sadly <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-akira-toriyama-dies-68-gaming-legacy/">passed away last year.</a></p>

            <p>Former Assassin's Creed series lead Marc-Alexis Côté's departure from Ubisoft after 20 years in various roles was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft">announced earlier this week</a>, and the developer's now put out a post in which he says that leaving wasn't his choice. Instead, Côté asserts that it came after he was asked to step aside as Assassin's Creed boss by Ubisoft as part of a corporate restructure, then offered a reduced role as part of the company's Tencent-backed Vantage Studios subsidiary.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin’s Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it," Côté wrote in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marcalexis_the-past-24-hours-have-been-deeply-emotional-activity-7384672277055012864-87QR/">post on LinkedIn</a>. "The truth is simple: I did not make that choice."</p>
<p>He continued as follows:</p>
<blockquote>Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure. A different position was mentioned, but it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years. I want to be clear that I hold no resentment. Ubisoft has been my home for all my professional life, and I will always be grateful for the people, the projects, and the belief that together we could create worlds that inspire millions. But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly: I did not walk away. I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside.</blockquote>
<p>Côté's departure came as a bit of a shock, given it followed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/assassins-creed-shadows-success-shows-that-the-threat-of-negative-campaigns-is-overblown-opinion">success earlier this year</a>, an important win for what's been a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-push-back-some-of-our-biggest-games-and-announce-further-cost-cutting-after-a-challenging-year">struggling publisher</a> over the past few years. This restructure around the formation of Vantage Studios, a subsidiary created to oversee Assassin's Creed, FarCry and Rainbow Six going forwards as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">a €1.16 billion deal with Chinese conglomerate Tencent</a>, has seen Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot appointed as its co-CEO. Yep, that's Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot's son Charlie, who has <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ubisoft-spinoff-ceos-christophe-derennes-charlie-guillemot-1236453661/">insisted his appointment wasn't just down to nepotism</a>.</p><p>I reached out to Ubisoft for comment and the publishers stuck to their statement guns from earlier this week, with a spokesperson saying: "Following the organizational restructuring announced in March 2025, Marc-Alexis Côté has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft.While we are saddened to see him go, we’re confident that our talented teams will carry forward the strong foundation he helped build."</p>
<p>"We are deeply grateful for the impact Marc-Alexis has had over the years, particularly in shaping the Assassin’s Creed brand into what it is today," they continued. "His leadership, creativity, and dedication have left a lasting mark on our teams and our players. We thank him sincerely for his many contributions and wish him continued success in all his future endeavors."</p>
<p>Côté was also very forthright in his defense of Shadows' devs in the face of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-warn-staff-not-to-celebrate-assassins-creed-shadows-launch-as-part-of-anti-harassment-plan">online vitriol over Yasuke being one the game's protagonists</a>, in contrast to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/our-goal-is-not-to-push-any-specific-agenda-ubisoft-ceo-tries-to-mollify-gamers-who-wont-stop-being-mad-about-a-black-samurai-in-assassins-creed-shadows/">the elder Guillemot</a>. Here's hoping that Derennes and baby Guillemot are willing to do that kind of thing, but I'm doubtful until we see it.</p>

            <p>
There is a woman trying to get into my supermarket. She's banging on the sliding door glass, an urgent silhouette against swirling fog and darkness. My manager told me it's not safe outside at night, but the woman doesn't seem afraid, for all her banging. She is smiling. Not a nice smile. A Skibidi smile, all teeth and gums and painfully stretched skin. 
</p>
<p>
I do not think I should let the woman in, but she explains to me in text dialogue that I have it all backwards. <em>She's</em> not outside the store. <em>I</em> am. So really, if I let her in I'm only letting myself in. I do not find this gnomic insight reassuring. I tell her to clear off. She doesn't press her case, but comments before drifting away that there might be consequences later. I silently observe that I would rather have consequences later than consequences right now.

This is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hellmart">Hellmart</a>, a grubby first-person job simulator in which you spend your days stocking shelves, cleaning the aisles and manning the checkout, and your nights attempting to secure the premises against a nebulous Evil. 
</p>

The daytime stretches are squalid and oppressive but relatively non-horrific. True, you might have to deal with paranormal antics such as self-slamming doors. True, the boxes of pasta on your shelves look vaguely like pictures of guts and eyeballs. True, the CCTV feeds on your computer by the till often reveal things that aren't there, or which hopefully aren't there. True, a lot of your customers sport that Skibidi smile, and true, it's unclear where they're from, exactly. The store sits in a waste of snow and forest, with locals emerging from behind a distant hill.
</p><p>
But that's all peanuts compared to what happens when the sun sets. I haven't progressed far enough to encounter some of the entities brazenly given away by the Steam page (and the below trailer), but it's telling that you can board up windows. The security measures immediately feel inadequate. Being able to padlock the doors is of minimal comfort, given the presence of patently xenomorph-friendly airvents. The option to hide in fridges just feels like offering yourself up as a snack.</p>
<p>The store isn't huge - it's a handbaskets-only joint, barely roomy enough to justify the supermarket label, but the head-high shelves carve it up into a larger labyrinth that is pleasingly efficient in its jumpscare potential. And then there are the people [citation needed] who bang on the glass. Some of them are probably safe company: it's up to you decide, based on the things they say.

There's been a slight trend in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror games</a> about Letting The Right One in over the past year or so. Mark recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-was-terrified-of-answering-the-door-before-playing-this-freaky-faced-apocalyptic-horror-and-honestly-it-hasnt-helped">wrote</a> about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-im-not-a-human">No, I'm Not A Human</a>, in which you are a post-apocalyptic hermit appraising the bona fides of night-time wanderers and Visitors. There's also the earlier <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3373660/Look_Outside/">Look Outside</a>, in which you definitely shouldn't open the curtains, and the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quarantine-zone-the-last-check">Quarantine Zone</a>, a chilly piece of military border policing that is hopefully alive to its own inhumanity. 
</p><p>
It's tempting to make connections with Covid lockdowns and lingering agoraphobia, but these are emotions that date back much further, of course - back through games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/papers-please">Papers, Please</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights At Freddy's</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkwood">Darkwood</a> to zombie fables about the possibly infected and folk legends about vampires and thresholds. The major difference I sense in games like Hellmart is that the monsters often don't particularly bother to hide their monstrousness. The ghoulish thrill of these games is letting nocturnal callers cross the lintel even when you're 70% sure they're bad news, just to see what mayhem they wreak.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3762550/HELLMART/">Find the Hellmart demo on Steam</a>. I'll conclude with the anecdote that I used to be a Tesco store cleaner, and the scariest thing that ever happened to me on-shift was two old ladies power-dunking jars of pesto and cream at either end of the store simultaneously - the janitorial equivalent of a Double Event in Pacific Rim. Mind you, now that I've played Hellmart, I realise how glad I am that I never had to lock up after dark. That Tesco was huge. So many sightlines. Pretty sure it had a meat locker as well.</p>
<p>It's out "soon". Bulgaria-based developers Gaze in Games are a new outfit founded by a former member of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zoochosis">Zoochosis</a> developers Clapperheads. If you're sold on the premise and don't want to wait, there's also the lower-fi <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3126330/Kiosk/">Kiosk</a> from Serbian developer Vivi.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dead Space 4 is a wishlist game for many survival-horror fans. Glen Schofield is the genius behind the original title, and while he didn’t have any direct involvement in its sequels, the creator wants to return and get horrible again with Dead Space 4.</p>



<p>It was almost a year ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/glen-schofield-dead-space-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schofield revealed EA turned down Dead Space 4</a>. There’s a wide belief that the Dead Space Remake didn’t meet sales expectations for Krafton. This is likely why we haven’t heard a sniff about a <a href="http://Dead Space 2 Remake Shelved for Battlefield, It’s Claimed – UPDATE: EA Denies Claim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Space 2 Remake</a>, let alone a fourth game. However, Schofield has reiterated his desire to return to the world of nail-biting terror and necromorphs.</p>



<h2 id="h-glen-schofield-wants-to-make-dead-space-4">Glen Schofield Wants To Make Dead Space 4</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One more round? Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Schofield declared in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-save-you-30-40-million-on-the-idea-i-have-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-already-making-calls-about-dead-space-4-now-ea-has-new-owners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I have quite a few ideas that I’m ready to go with, and one of them is Dead Space 4. The fact that EA just got bought, I think there’s an opportunity. I’m already making calls.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He revisited his trip to EA, which we’ve already mentioned above, and doubled down on the fact that EA has seemingly moved on from Dead Space:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I went to [EA] recently and they’re like no, we’re not interested anymore. I said, I can get back the leadership team. I need the models from EA Motive [Dead Space Remake creator] and I can save you 30 to 40 million dollars on the idea that I have. And, they’re like, ‘no.'”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Dead Space creator believes the $55 billion takeover of EA could lead to some changes, though: “I am more optimistic because somebody new could buy [the rights to the Dead Space IP].”</p>



<p>EA did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-space-remakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ask if fans were interested in more Dead Space Remakes</a> shortly after the 2023 release. However, it appears that all plans are on hold for now. Would you like to see a Dead Space 2 Remake? Or can we go one better and finally get the Dead Space 4 sequel we’ve all been waiting for?

		<p>Pathea Games has announced that the alpha playtest for My Time At Evershine will begin on October 24th, and it will be for those who pledged $35 or more to the Kickstarter campaign for the Steam PC version of the game. Steam keys are going to be going out on October 21st and redeemable through PledgeManager, with My Time At Evershine then being available to download on October 24th. The key that is being sent out is not for the full game, as a separate key for that will be sent when the game is ready to release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Reveal Teaser| My Time at Evershine" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ubgnFCW2m3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Those who have backed My Time At Evershine on Kickstarter but chose a console version are not eligible for the alpha playtest. However, that can be changed by following these instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fill out the&nbsp;<b>[<a href="steam://openurl_external/https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fforms.gle%2FM4qmMVsc6uVHAw1TA">Google Form here</a>]</b>&nbsp;to register your request. &nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>If you already selected Steam (PC) previously, you don’t need to fill out this form – unless you now want to switch from&nbsp;<b>Steam</b>&nbsp;(PC) to&nbsp;<b>console</b>&nbsp;instead.<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>We’ll collect all responses and upload them to PledgeManager.<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Once processed, you’ll receive a new invitation email to reopen your PledgeManager survey and select Steam. If you can’t find the invitation email, simply log back into PledgeManager to check your survey.<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>The deadline for this first batch of console-to-PC requests is&nbsp;<b>October 22nd, 18:00 (UTC+8)</b>. That’s&nbsp;<b>03:00 AM PST / 06:00 AM EST / 12:00 PM CET.</b><wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Please double-check your selection when switching to Steam. Once your Steam key is assigned, your&nbsp;<b>Alpha platform</b>&nbsp;will be&nbsp;<b>locked</b>&nbsp;and cannot be changed again.<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>This round only covers&nbsp;<b>console-to-Steam switches for Alpha access.</b>&nbsp;Other cases – like switching between consoles or standard PC (non-Alpha) keys – will be handled later.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This is just the first round of keys being sent out for the My Time At Evershine alpha playtest, with this running until the game is released properly. If you do get into the playtest you will not be allowed to share any images, videos or thoughts about My Time At Evershine outside of the Pathea Games official channels.</p>

<p>Glen Schofield co-founded Sledgehammer Games and would later go on to become the CEO of Striking Distance Studios. But it’s at Sledgehammer where the director was able to flex his creative chops on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Advanced Warfare, and WWII.</p>



<p>Schofield left Sledgehammer in 2018, and new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-the-haunting-2025-unveiled-poster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> titles have appeared across multiple studios: Black Ops Cold War, Vanguard, the modern-day Modern Warfare Remakes, and new Black Ops games. The former Call of Duty director believes the quality of the games has diminished in recent years.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, Modern Warfare 3 (his CoD directorial debut) was the last Call of Duty to win Action Game of the Year, and my other two games were nominated for it. But now, you know, you don’t see them.” Schofield said to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/interview-glen-schofields-plan-to-save-the-games-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>.</p>



<p>He was asked about the ‘Call of Duty machine’, and it operates now. The franchise continues to make ridiculous sums of money, but there’s constant criticism about the direction of games, their content, and many other issues.</p>



<p>The former director thinks that it hasn’t been the same since he left Sledgehammer and stopped having creative and directorial input into Call of Duty.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’ll give you one selfish example, I hate doing this, but since I left&nbsp;Sledgehammer, none of the games have been very good. I mean, the last one [Modern Warfare 3 (2023)] was a 50. They still sell well. They just aren’t as good. They aren’t the same.&nbsp;Treyarch’s still really good but you know…I&nbsp;got lucky. I feel like I was at the heyday of EA during my time there. I mean, it was a who’s who working there. And then when I got to Activision, I made Modern Warfare 3 (2011).”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Schofield is currently enjoying a break after leaving Striking Distance Studios, following the unsuccessful launch of The Callisto Protocol.</p>



<p>Do you agree that Call of Duty games haven’t gotten near the level of 2011’s Modern Warfare 3? Can CoD ever get back to these glorious heights?

            <p>Former Call of Duty series lead Glen Schofield has expressed he's "immensely worried" at the state of the modern FPS series under Microsoft, in a recent interview.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/former-call-of-duty-director-says-hes-immensely-worried-about-the-future-of-the-series-under-xbox/#google_vignette">Speaking to VGC</a>, discussed the future of Call of Duty, stating: "what's happening to Gears of War, where's Halo... you know what I mean? And you look at EA, you look at these big companies, and I'm like where's the Strike games? Where's this game? And there's so many that just fall by the wayside.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, once you're assimilated by one of these companies, I think you take on some of their traits. The other thing is, I don't know, but I would imagine that the Call of Duty bonus system is out, and now you have theirs, and people are going to go 'that isn't that'."</p>

</figure>
<p>Further elaborating on his thoughts, Schofield mused on what he believes has caused the decrease in quality in recent Call of Duty games, laying the blame also on the absence of key developers. This includes himself.</p>
<p>"I hate doing this, but since I left Sledgehammer, none of the games have been very good. I mean, [Modern Warfare (2023)] was a 50. They still sell well. You know, that happens. You move. I always wonder 'why did you take that guy out, it's not going to work later', and very few times does that work.</p><p>"They just aren't as good. They aren't the same. Treyarch's still really good but you know... I feel like I got lucky. I feel like I was at the heyday of EA during my time there. I mean, it was a who's who working there. And then when I got to Activision, I made Modern Warfare 3 (2011).</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact, Modern Warfare 3 was the last Call of Duty to win Action Game of the Year, and my other two games were nominated for it. But now, you know, you don't see them."</p>
<p>In recent years, Schofield has himself had mixed results when attempting to create great games. After joining Krafton in 2019, he and the team at Striking Distance created <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-review-a-dead-space-alike-built-on-simpler-pleasures">The Callisto Protocol</a>. This spiritual successor to Dead Space - another series he worked on - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-share-price-falls-as-the-callistol-protocol-fails-to-hit-its-sales-target">failed to meet sales targets</a>. Schofield ultimately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-departs-callisto-protocol-studio-after-flop">left Striking Distance voluntarily in late 2023</a>.</p>

            <p>Former Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Côté has clarified the reasoning for his departure from the series, stating he "did not walk away" but was asked to "step aside" by Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, news emerged of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-formation-of-tencent-subsidiary">Côté leaving Ubisoft following the formation of the new Tencent-backed subsidiary</a> Vantage Studios, which will develop future <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a>.</p>
<p>In an internal memo, Vantage Studios CEO Christophe Derennes reportedly stated Côté had "his own expectations and priorities related to Vantage Studios' creation and future", while a statement from Ubisoft affirmed Côté had "chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft".</p>

<p>Now, in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7384672277055012864/">LinkedIn</a>, Côté has clarified that while he was offered another role in the company, it did not "carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work [he] had been entrusted with".</p>
<p>"Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin's Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it," Côté's post reads. "The truth is simple: I did not make that choice.</p>
<p>"Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin's Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organisational structure.</p>
<p>"A different position was mentioned, but it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years."</p>
<p>Côté continued that he holds no resentment towards Ubisoft, which has "been [his] home for all [his] professional life".</p>
<p>"But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly: I did not walk away," he said. "I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside."</p>
<p>Côté has left Ubisoft after almost two decades at the company, joining the Assassin's Creed team for Brotherhood before leading the series' future.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">Ubisoft and Tencent announced Vantage Studios earlier this month</a>, which will now be responsible for the company's biggest franchises, such as Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six Siege.</p>

            <p>Dead Space creator Glen Schofield is "already making calls" to EA's new owners in the hope he can make Dead Space 4.</p>
<p>Schofield was executive producer on the first Dead Space game in 2008, and while he wasn't involved in its two follow-ups, he later developed the spiritual successor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> at Striking Distance Studios in 2022.</p>
<p>He then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-departs-callisto-protocol-studio-after-flop">left Striking Distance in 2023 after the game flopped</a>, and it seems is now courting EA to make a new Dead Space game - though he's so far been unsuccessful, despite suggestions he could save the company millions of dollars.</p>

<p>"I went to [EA] recently and they're like no, we're not interested anymore," Schofield told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-save-you-30-40-million-on-the-idea-i-have-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-already-making-calls-about-dead-space-4-now-ea-has-new-owners">IGN </a>in an interview at Gamescom Asia. "I said, I can get back the leadership team. I need the models from EA Motive [who built the Dead Space remake in 2023] and I can save you 30 to 40 million dollars on the idea that I have. And, they're like, 'no'."</p>
<p>Despite this rejection, Schofield has not been deterred. EA recently announced a proposed private acquisition, which has reignited Schofield's ambitions.</p>
<p>"I have quite a few ideas that I'm ready to go with and one of them is Dead Space 4," said Schofield. "The fact that EA just got bought, I think there's an opportunity. I'm already making calls."</p>
<p>"I don't know where EA's head is right now, I don't think they made money on [the Dead Space remake]," he continued. "Dead Space needs to be adapted to different mediums - movies, TV series, it would be great.</p>
<p>"But I am more optimistic [since the sale of EA], because somebody new could buy [the Dead Space IP]."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">EA is set to be privately acquired in a $55bn deal</a> by a group of investors, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Affinity Partners, led by President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p>
<p>As such, there's speculation less financially successful parts of the business could be sold to pay off a hefty debt EA will need to cover as part of the acquisition. Video game union workers have since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-union-workers-rally-against-55bn-saudi-backed-private-acquisition-with-formal-petition-to-regulators">launched a petition against the acquisition</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Schofield posted on LinkedIn the games industry is "tough" after failing to obtain financial backing for his latest project, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-hints-at-retiring-from-game-development-after-struggling-to-fund-latest-project">hinting he may have directed his last game</a>.</p>

		<p>Marvel has announced the first ever PvE mode for its free to play hero shooter Marvel Rivals, with this crossover being suitably in season. From October 23rd, a new Zombies mode inspired by Marvel Zombies will be released for Marvel Rivals, allowing players to team up and take on hordes of the undead until they become overwhelmed.</p>
<p><iframe title="First-Ever PvE Mode: Marvel Zombies I Announce Trailer | Marvel Rivals" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6xBptgEhiok?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There are some limits to the Marvel Rivals Zombie mode such as the playable characters. Players will only be able to play as Thor, Jeff, Magik, The Punisher, or Blade. Eventually, after the hordes get dealt with you will face off against bosses Zombie Namor and The Queen of the Dead. Each playable hero will have a unique ability to deal with the zombie waves. Jeff will be able to charge through groups, Blade will be armed with a bouncing Moon Blade, Thor will be able to shock zombies in his Awakened state, and Magik has an unlimited Darkchild form.</p>

Two brand-new Team-Up Abilities are coming: Bestial Hunt (Daredevil – The Punisher) and Deep Wrath (Hela – Namor).</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-ptr-tests-big-core-changes-itemization-monster-combat-progression/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-iv-ptr-tests-big-core-changes-to-itemization-monster-combat-and-progression-ahead-of-season-11.1327378/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard Entertainment has unveiled a new Diablo IV PTR, version 2.5.0, which is testing major core changes to the game that should go live in Season 11. To start with, monster combat has been overhauled. Enemy AI and formations have been rebuilt to make Sanctuary more threatening, providing monsters with unique combat roles and adaptive tactics. Players will find less grouping, smarter targeting, and stronger affix synergy. Over 20 new monster affixes are being introduced. Moreover, Champions will form thematic packs, and Elite minions inherit leader affixes.</p>



<p>Blizzard also made significant tweaks to Tempering and Masterworking in an attempt to reduce RNG. For Tempering, Diablo IV players will now pick the affix directly from a recipe, removing the randomness involved. Only one tempered affix per item is allowed, though Tempering charges can be restored infinitely. As for Masterworking, it no longer increases affix rolls; instead, it increases item Quality (boosting base armor, damage, or resistances). Each Masterwork adds between two and five Quality levels (up to a maximum of 20). A “Capstone bonus” at max Quality upgrades a random affix into a Greater Affix, which is rerollable without losing Quality. Finally, non-unique items now have four base affixes, up from three.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>A new feature called Sanctification is also being added to the game. The Heavens have noticed the players' work against the Evils and are granting the adventurers a small amount of power. When Sanctifying an item, there's a chance it will:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gain bonus Legendary powers</li>



<li>Enhance or replace affixes</li>



<li>Add unique “Sanctification affixes”</li>



<li>Become indestructible</li>
</ul>



<p>There are two ways to obtain these power boosts: through Heavenly Anvils or Heavenly Sigils (the latter reserved for Torment‑tier items). Do note that once Sanctified, items cannot be modified further. As such, this is meant to be the very final upgrade you want to apply to an item.</p>



<p>Blizzard is also adding a whole new stat called Toughness, which summarizes the player's average defense against each damage type. Healing is being revamped: potions will be capped at 4, regardless of Renown. Each potion heals 35% instantly of total HP and regenerates every 30 seconds. Potion upgrades were removed and are now part of natural health scaling. Life on Hit returns as a potential affix, and other life‑sustain affixes have been buffed.</p>



<p>Season 11 will mark the return of the Lesser Evils to Diablo IV. Duriel, Belial, Andariel, and Azmodan will be invading endgame modes, each one targeting a specific mode:</p>



<ul>
<li>Duriel is in Helltide, which will now rain parasitic maggot reinforcements alongside the mode's signature meteors.</li>



<li>Belial Eyes will appear randomly within The Pit. Once destroyed, they will stun nearby enemies and summon a pack of Belial apparitions. If players destroy several Eyes, the final boss will be replaced by Belial himself. Killing the Lesser Evil grants an additional Glyph upgrade and reward.</li>



<li>Andariel is in Kurast Undercity, where players will find three new Undercity Tributes. Each boost Undercity rewards and guarantees Andariel spawns as the final boss. These specific Tributes also add Dungeon affixes to the Undercity run.</li>



<li>Azmodan stalks the Sanctuary open world as a formidable new World Boss appearing in multiple locations. This Lesser Evil can also be summoned at will from three Summoning Altars; each altar will invoke Azmodan with powers from one of the other three Lesser Evils.</li>
</ul>



<p>In Season 11, players will obtain Divine Gifts from the angel Hadriel. Each Divine Gift has three components: a reward, a Corrupted Gift, and a Purified Gift. When slotted, the Divine Gift activates the reward bonus associated with it, increasing the rewards for that specific Divine Gift. Corrupted Gifts make each related activity more difficult, but still grant the reward bonus on the Divine Gift. Purified gifts remove the negative effect, add a positive effect, and double the reward gained. Corrupted Gift slots unlock automatically. Players must progress through the Seasonal Reputation board to unlock the Purified Gift slots.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Diablo IV is also getting a new competitive dungeon challenge called The Tower. Each Tower run is  a multi‑floor timed dungeon (with a 10-minute limit) unlocked in Cerrigar. There will be random layouts, affixes, and Pylon buffs across four Shrine types. Adventurers must kill enemies or collect Orbs to fill a progress bar, which will spawn bosses. Completion records will appear on global Leaderboards subdivided by:</p>



<ul>
<li>Solo Classes</li>



<li>Party tiers (2‑4 players)</li>



<li>Normal / Hardcore</li>



<li>Platform filters</li>



<li>Clan/Friends views</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, Renown is now permanent only in the Eternal Realm. Seasonal progression becomes Rank‑based. Each rank requires completing a Capstone Dungeon to advance. Rewards grant skill points, Paragon points, Smoldering Ashes, and cosmetics.</p>



<p>Blizzard appears to be significantly updating the game in an effort to lure back some lapsed players ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next year's second expansion</a>. Whether they will succeed remains to be seen, but you can test this patch on the PTR between October 21 and October 28.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>KONAMI has confirmed in <a href="https://www.konami.com/videonews/movie_view.html?movie_url=6382868806112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new video report</a> posted on the publisher's official website (as <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/silent-hill-2-remake-shipments-and-digital-sales-top-2-5-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by Gematsu</a>) that the Silent Hill 2 remake has now surpassed two and a half million units sold. Meanwhile, the series as a whole has finally surpassed ten million units sold to date.</p>



<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-over-2-million-units-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had reached two million units in late January</a>. Clearly, sales have greatly slowed down since, but the game is still a commercial success. Indeed, KONAMI has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that developer Bloober Team would also remake the first entry in the survival horror franchise.</p>



<p>Before the game's launch around a year ago, there were many skeptics about Bloober Team's capability to deliver a remake worthy of the revered original. However, the final product swept those worries away, winning widespread acclaim from critics and fans alike. I<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">n Wccftech's review</a>, it earned a 9 out of 10 score from Chris Wray:</p>



<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>



<p>Even better for the series is that even the new game made by NeoBards Entertainment, Silent Hill f, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earned the same score</a>. Here's what Francesco De Meo had to say about it:</p>



<p><em>With an engaging story full of haunting, disturbing sequences, a finely tuned balance of everything that makes survival horror great, and combat deeply rooted in resource management, Silent Hill f is a triumphant return for the series after its long hiatus. Its short length and minor PC performance issues may disappoint some, but no fan of the franchise, or the genre, should miss one of the best survival horror releases in years.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent trademark filing, it was discovered that Jimmy ‘MrBeast’ Donaldson, the world’s most-watched YouTube creator and a prolific entrepreneur, is planning to open a financial institution. The filing names the endeavour as ‘MrBeast Financial’, and categorizes it as ‘downloadable software in the nature of a mobile application for banking services’.</p>



<p>The filing went on to explain that MrBeast Financial would be used to provide short-term cash advances, cryptocurrency exchange services, investment banking services, and consumer lending services.</p>



<h2 id="h-from-youtube-to-big-banking">From YouTube To Big Banking</h2>



<p>Jimmy ‘MrBeast’ Donaldson is more than ten years into his journey as a YouTuber, and in that time, he has risen to become the number one personality on the platform. He’s worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and from chocolate bars to restaurants, his entrepreneurial spirit has led him to kickstart many spin-off labels.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=99440901&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent filing</a> with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, it was discovered that Donaldson’s next foray might be into the financial world, with MrBeast Financial, a banking app, having been uncovered.</p>



<p>The MrBeast Financial platform has been described as:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Software as a service (SAAS) services featuring software for banking services, investment banking services, investment management services, providing financial advisory and providing financial consultancy services.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/mrbeast-files-trademark-for-banking-app-with-a-focus-on-crypto-3269568/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>The entity would have the power to provide cash advances, issue debit cards, process electronic credit card transactions, and operate a cryptocurrency exchange, amongst other things.</p>



<p>This is all up in the air, as while the application has been submitted, it’s not a promise that such a platform <strong>will surface</strong>.</p>



<p>What are your expectations of the MrBeast Financial app? Let me know what you’re predicting on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Former Assassin’s Creed Boss Confirms Ubisoft Asked Him To ‘Step Aside’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-confirms-ubisoft-asked-him/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-boss-confirms-ubisoft-asked-him-to-%E2%80%98step-aside%E2%80%99.1327333/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The news broke recently that Marc-Alexis Côté, a Ubisoft veteran and strategic leader of the Assassin’s Creed series, had departed the company after more than two decades. In the reports that surfaced after Côté’s withdrawal from the firm, it was suggested that he was offered a leadership role in the newly formed Vantage Studios, but wasn’t happy with the position and stepped back.</p>



<p>In a new post on social media, Côté has set the story straight and explained that he remained business as usual until Ubisoft asked him to step down. He expressly confirmed that <strong>he did not walk away </strong>from the company he has called home for twenty years.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-truth-of-why-cote-left-ubisoft">The Truth of Why Côté Left Ubisoft</h2>



<p>In a lengthy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marcalexis_the-past-24-hours-have-been-deeply-emotional-activity-7384672277055012864-87QR/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn post</a>, Marc-Alexis Côté explained why he’d departed Ubisoft after twenty years, the latter portion of which had been spent managing the strategic direction of Assassin’s Creed. In his words, it wasn’t his choice, and he did not walk away willingly:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin’s Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it.</p>



<div><p>The truth is simple: I did not make that choice.</p><p>Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure.<br>A different position was mentioned, but it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years.</p></div>



<p>But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly:</p>



<p>I did not walk away.</p>



<p>I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It mostly gels with what the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/head-of-assassins-creed-has-left-ubisoft-after-20-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original report</a> referenced, in that Côté left the company because of a situation related to the new Vantage Studios, formed after the merger between Ubisoft and Tencent.</p>



<p>Côté’s statement indicates his expectations were that he would <strong>lead </strong>the direction of the Assassin’s Creed franchise at Ubisoft, but that wasn’t the case. When that didn’t come through, Côté took it very personally and turned down whatever else was offered as a compromise, ultimately being asked to step down by Ubisoft because he (most likely) had no home in the new organization.</p>



<p>Côté wrapped up his post by saying:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As someone who grew up inspired by Star Trek (TNG!), in the later years of my career I came to see myself as the captain of the Assassin’s Creed ship, someone who leaves only once every soul on board is safe.</p>



<p>And that is exactly what I have done for as long as I could.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Were you surprised to see Côté leave Ubisoft, or are you expecting these kinds of departures as the merger continues to take shape? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
