		<p>Not Knowing Software has released Chapter 1a for Cleared Hot, its take on the classics like Desert Strike and Jungle Strike. The major addition as part of the Chapter 1a release is a brand new helicopter, the RAH-66 Comanche, which is an agile craft but is susceptible to taking damage rather quickly. That is not the only addition, with a new test flight area, and more fixes. Plus Cleared Hot is now confirmed as Steam Deck Verified.</p>

              <p>Need an additional Xbox controller? It’s always a good idea to have an extra in case you want to play with a friend or have one on reserve if you run out of battery. We’ve found one that you can grab right now for a great price, this close to the holidays.</p>
<p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Gaming Controller is built for players who want more control, comfort, and customization from their gaming sessions. It feels great in your hands, with textured grips and a balanced design that helps you stay comfortable even during long play sessions. No matter what kind of games you like to play, you’ll find this model comfortable and easy to get used to.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6519/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A hardcore Xbox controller that’ll soon become your main</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6519/">You can get the Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Gaming Controller right now for just $110, down from its usual price of $150.</a> That is a discount of $40 and 27% off. This is a top of the line controller for the Xbox, so you’re getting a pretty decent price here, considering you’ll usually pay nearly $50 more.</p>
<p>Right out of the box the Elite Series 2 Core feels like an upgrade from a standard controller. The thumbsticks are responsive, the buttons click with just the right amount of feedback, and the overall feel is one of quality. It connects wirelessly to your Xbox or Windows PC, so you can enjoy gaming without cords getting in your way. The Bluetooth support also means you can pair it with other compatible devices for more flexibility.</p>



<p>One of the biggest benefits of this controller is how customizable it is. You can change stick sensitivity, remap buttons, and fine tune settings to match your personal play style. Normally, core Xbox controllers aren’t so easy or versatile when it comes to personalization, so you get a lot more options here to work with. That’s especially useful if you like to change things for shooters or even fighting games to better fit the way you play.</p>
<p>The Elite Series 2 Core also includes additional components you can swap in and out. Different thumbsticks and paddle options let you tweak the feel and response of the controller, so you can tailor it to different genres.</p>
<p>With a solid mix of premium build quality, customization options, and wireless convenience, the Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Gaming Controller stands out among controllers in its class. For this price, you should go ahead and snatch one up before they raise in price again. Everything gaming-related seems to be getting a price hike, after all.</p>

            <p>Larian hope to offer "more insight" into their usage of generative AI via an ask me anything session set to take place in the new year. It'll also be a chance to ask more general questions about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/divinity-larian">Divinity</a>, if you fancy. Naturally, this all comes after the Geoff announcement of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> devs' next RPG was swiftly followed by comments from CEO Swen Vincke which revealed the studio are making limited use of generative AI.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a second response to backlash against his assertions regarding Larian's use of genAI "to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text" - you can get the full context in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-want-to-release-divinity-in-three-to-four-years-and-theyre-making-limited-use-of-generative-ai">our</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-boss-responds-to-criticism-of-generative-ai-use-its-something-we-are-constantly-discussing-internally">other</a> recent pieces - the CEO's announced that the studio'll be hosting an ask me anything chat in the new year. Arguing that "a lot has become lost in translation" following Divinity's announcement, Vincke wrote that this back-and-forth is aimed at offering "the opportunity to ask us any questions you have about Divinity and our dev process directly".</p>
<p>While he put a pin in revealing a concrete date for the chat for now, writing that one'll be forthcoming once the calendar flips over to 2026, the CEO did take this opportunity to offer a bit more of his view on the subject "Larian’s DNA is agency," he wrote. "Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, and players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make.</p> <div>

<p>"In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes."</p>
<p>To be fair to Vincke and co, you can't accuse them of simply burying their heads and going quiet as the backlash has swirled. The CEO's tried to offer <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001011042642505833">explanations and clarifications</a> in a number of formats, as has Larian's publishing director <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2001014486627705252">Michael Douse</a>. I'm not sure the latter's retweeting of <a href="https://x.com/ALegendaryDrops/status/2001908027214176682">posts</a> from <a href="https://x.com/WolfheartFPS/status/2001034796357837262">YouTubers</a> coming to Larian's defense or attempt to <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2001011867154833538">meme up the situation</a> have really helped, but hey, if you reap the rewards of being an abundantly active tweeterperson, you're usually doomed to fall on that same sword at some point.</p><p>If you want what I assume to be a meme-free discussion about Divinity itself, you can check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-talk-divinity-their-next-rpg-after-baldurs-gate-3-its-almost-as-though-its-the-first-in-the-series">Edwin's chat with Vincke</a> from earlier this week.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Happy holidays and Merry Christmas. This is the time of the year when radio stations start playing holiday-themed music nonstop and commercials are filled with festive tunes. But not all Christmas music is good. In fact, I’d say at least 80 percent of holiday jingles are old, boring, and terrible.</p> <p>However, I won’t toss all Christmas music under the bus; some holiday tunes have a way of making you feel the warmth and merriment of the season. With that in mind, here are the 15 best tracks to play this year if you want to get into the festive spirit but don’t want to listen to boring old crap. Christmastime is a fun time of year, when people should be feeling good and enjoying time off and the company of loved ones. Or at least getting cool presents. Why ruin that with some slow, sad song from the 1930s?</p>

 <p>So here are some good, fun tracks that range from newer hits to oldies that won’t make you fall asleep. And if you work in retail, I am so sorry that you have to spend, like, five weeks listening to all of these and more over and over again, and you all deserve huge bonuses for that torture.</p> <p>Oh and let us know what your favorite Christmas songs are in the comments below. I’ll be waiting for someone to share <em>Grandma Got Ran Over by a Reindeer.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>Father Christmas – The Kinks</h2>  <h2>Santa Claus Is Comin’ To Town – Bruce Springsteen</h2>  <h2>Linus And Lucy – Vince Guaraldi</h2>  <h2>Last Christmas – Wham!</h2>  <h2>Run, Rudolph, Run! – Chuck Berry</h2>  <h2>Feliz Navidad – José Feliciano</h2>  <h2>All I Want For Christmas Is You – Mariah Carey</h2>  <h2>Christmas Wrapping – The Waitresses</h2>  <h2>Christmas (Baby Please Come Home!) – Darlene Love</h2>  <h2>You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch&nbsp;– Thurl Ravenscroft</h2>  <h2>Holly Jolly Christmas – Burl Ives</h2>  <h2>Santa Baby – Eartha Kitt</h2>  <h2>Rockin’ Around The Christmas Tree – Brenda Lee</h2>  <h2>Underneath The Tree – Kelly Clarkson</h2>  <h2>I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus – The Jackson 5</h2>

<p>NVIDIA is offering a free GPU to the best Fortnite players in the world during an upcoming tournament in the game, amid the growing shortage of the gear.</p>



<p>The price of GPU and RAM has skyrocketed in recent months amid growing shortages, driven by the increased use of AI, pricing many out of the components. However, the door has been opened for a limited number of players to claim an NVIDIA GPU in Fortnite.</p>







<h2 id="h-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-gpu-available-in-fortnite-tournament">NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 GPU Available in Fortnite Tournament</h2>

<p>On December 21 and 22nd, with the precise date depending on your region, Fortnite is hosting the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/competitive/events/s39_nvidia?lang=en-US&amp;region=NAE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NVIDIA GeForce RTX Cup</a>, a solo tournament where players can face off to secure grand prizes, including an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 GPU for the “top competitors.”</p>



<p>While earning the GPU requires being one of the best Fortnite players in your region, the shortage and growing price of components makes playing in the Fortnite tournament potentially an easier option than splashing out on the market.</p>



<p>The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 GPU starts at $999.99 on the NVIDIA website, with prices on the secondary market being even higher.</p>



<p>Participation in the tournament also opens the door to earning a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rare-fortnite-cosmetic-finally-returns-after-seven-year-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rare cosmetic that has not been available in Fortnite for seven years</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-fortnite-rust-bucket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rust Bucket Back Bling</a>, which will be distributed to all players who earn at least eight points during the tournament.</p>



<p>There are restrictions to competing, however, as players need to have participated in at least 14 tournaments in the past 180 days to be eligible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/terminator-2d-no-fate">Terminator 2D: No Fate</a> is packed with Terminator references and Easter eggs, but this one is perhaps for hardcore fans only.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bitmap Bureau’s retro action game has an Easter egg that can only be accessed once you’ve unlocked its hardest mode, Judgment Day. Once you’ve done that, play through the game on Judgment Day difficulty and reach the Biker Bar level, which is only the second level in Arcade Mode if you want to get there quickly. The instant the level loads, you’ll immediately notice that the previously naked Arnie is now wearing some very bright, ultra ‘90s neon Zubaz shorts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why is he doing that? It’s a reference to how The Governator actually dressed on-set during the filming of the biker bar scene in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. That’s right: naked Arnie in Terminator 2 is a lie, and you can get a glimpse of those incredibly colourful shorts in this footage from behind the scenes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We thought we’d check in with the Terminator 2D development team to find out more about this cheeky Easter egg, and they explained how it came together:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When planning the game we did a lot of research on the movie; watching it scene-by-scene, going through materials such as the illustrated screenplay and also looking at making of content which is where the shorts idea came from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After looking at how some of the older T2 games handled the naked Terminator for the bar scene (for example in the SNES game where it was behind a strategically placed wooden fence) — Mike [Tucker, designer] jokingly had the idea of making a pixelated crotch effect for Easy Money mode. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But we decided the shorts from behind-the-scenes pics would be a hilarious Easter egg and you can only unlock it on the Judgment Day difficulty!</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/gettyimages-1203004089-1766144042028.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ohhh, that's a bad idea, fella! Photo by CBS via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We also had an internal thread where we gathered ideas for Easter eggs to include, and we managed to fit plenty of them into the game. For example, retro game lovers may enjoy the custom ending of Arcade Mode which we hope is a nice reward for sticking with that challenge and completing it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For the biker bar level itself, we made a lot of adjustments throughout the development as we continued to polish. Like adding the two licensed music tracks, adding the boss fight, the guy getting griddled, giving the Terminator a line asking for clothes, boots and motorcycle, the waitress idle animations etc and then we added a few more moves such as the backfist, headbutt, and shoulder barge for depth.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So there you have it! That’s why the Terminator is wearing retro shorts in Terminator 2D: No Fate, and if you didn’t already know about its origins, now you have some fun movie trivia to impress your film buff friends with!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Terminator Movies in (Chronological) Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Arnie's shorts aren't the only call-back to Terminator 2. In June, IGN reported on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/maker-of-new-terminator-2-video-game-tracked-down-actor-who-played-future-war-john-connor-back-in-1991-to-include-his-likeness"><u>how the developers tracked down the actor who played future war John Connor back in 1991 to include his likeness</u></a>, and in doing so found out why Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-2d-no-fate-review">Terminator 2D: No Fate review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Terminator 2D: No Fate is a wonderfully realised tribute to one of the single greatest movies ever made, punctuated with pitch-perfect music, exquisite pixel art, and brilliant Easter eggs.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in Terminator movie news, creator James Cameron has said he plans to make a new film once the dust has settled on Avatar: Fire and Ash, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-safely-say-he-wont-be-in-it-james-cameron-says-arnold-schwarzeneggers-time-as-the-terminator-is-officially-over-as-he-plots-new-movie">but insisted Arnold Schwarzenegger's time as The Terminator is officially over</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

    <p><span>Ye Shunguang's debut, enhanced optimizations, and additional rewards.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 2.5 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [29 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “To Be Fuel for the Night,” will launch on December 30, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [217 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-1016391"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>The major update propels Proxies into the culminating chapter of Season 2, introducing the upcoming Void Hunter Ye Shunguang, the popular Zhao, a series of highly anticipated events—including expanded Hollow gameplay and multiplayer combat—and extensive optimizations. To celebrate the new year and express gratitude for the Proxies’ support, Version 2.5 will also grant Proxies a free S-Rank Agent Zhao, 1,000 Polychromes, a new outfit for Jane, and additional rewards.</p><p>Ye Shunguang, the young senior disciple of Yunkui Summit, rises as the first dual-form Void Hunter. With her unique attribute Honed Edge, Ye Shunguang can enter the Enlightened Mind state and activate her signature Ether Veil to unleash massive Honed Edge damage while applying a vulnerability effect to enemies. Accompanying Ye Shunguang is her sidekick Bangboo Sprout, who peppers enemies with volleys of flying swords. Joining them is the unbeaten legend of Krampus, Zhao, who is an S-Rank Ice Defense Agent. Despite her adorable appearance, Zhao weaves swiftly across the battlefield and launches assaults with her massive weapon to suppress enemies. By accumulating Frostbite, Zhao can trigger Ether Veil: Wellspring, granting powerful buffs for the entire squad.</p><p>With strengthened allies, the new chapter unveils the final moments of Waifei Peninsula’s escalating crisis. The legendary Qingming Sword has begun to resonate with the primordial power of the Creator—an overwhelming force that assisted Proxies in past battles but now threatens a profound backlash for Ye Shunguang. Meanwhile, mysterious white flowers—once found only within the Hollows—have begun blooming across Failume Heights, signaling the dangerous expansion of the Lemnian Hollow. Proxies shall venture deep into the Lumite Mine ruins, using their new Perception Technique and teaming up with allies to uncover the truths hidden within the Hollow’s depths.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1016393"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>The adventure continues in the epilogue Sword Seeker Chronicles as Proxies support Ye Shunguang in seeking a remedy for the Qingming Sword’s backlash. The investigation showcases Ye Shunguang’s Bladeflash Mirage ability and offers exclusive rewards, including a brand-new W-Engine. Multiplayer combat arrives in the limited-time event Joint Investigation: The Divine Maze, where three-member squads face fast-paced cooperative challenges that reward coordination and tactical timing. Outside combat, the newly added Proxy Outpost allows Proxies to join or create outposts, facilitate discussions, and post or accept commissions, making New Eridu more connected than ever.</p><p>Version 2.5 also introduces quality-of-life updates that refine combat and progression. The existing Agents Soldier 11, Grace, Soldier 0 – Anby, Ellen, and Burnice will be enhanced with updated mechanics and performance boosts, with additional agents in the standard Stable Channel scheduled for future enhancements. Meanwhile, improvements to Shiyu Defense and Deadly Assault further polish the gameplay loop, while the new sweep function for Combat Simulation stages lets players consume Ether Batteries to instantly gather promotion materials and Drive Discs, easing the burden of day-to-day progression.</p><p>To welcome both new and returning Proxies, all players can jump directly into Version 2.5’s story through Advance Screening, while expanding their squads with a lineup of limited-time channels. The channels for Ye Shunguang and Zhao will run throughout the entire version, and a special rerun channel in the latter half guarantees the first S-Rank signal obtained will be a selected character among Alice, Soldier 0 – Anby, or Astra, along with their signature W-Engines returning with the same guarantee mechanic.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,113 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,504 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [25,151 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers and the version 2.5 special program below.

            <p>The oft-delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a> is now being planned for a release in several years time, with the latest date simply being "2028".</p>
<p>Ark 2 was announced all the way back in 2020, with a rather unexpected trailer featuring Vin Diesel of The Fast and The Furious fame. So, five years later, and we still don't have a firmer release date beyond that <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel">newly-announced 2028 window</a>.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, developer Studio Wildcard said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-delayed-survival-evolved-official-servers-to-shut-down-later-this-year">Ark 2 had been delayed until the "end of 2024"</a>, having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-survival-evolved-gets-new-cinematic-trailer-with-vin-diesel-coming-2023">once been planned for a 2023 release</a>. It has kept pretty quiet on any actual release date at all since then, though.</p>
<p>As Matt reported last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-scene-setter-and-anime-crossover-expansion-comes-to-ark-survival-ascended-this-december">the upcoming sequel didn't feature in the Ark content roadmap released earlier in the year</a>, which led many to speculate it won't arrive until sometime after December 2026. They were right!</p>
<p>As well as starring in Ark 2, Diesel is also serving as the executive producer on the project, bringing his game development skills to the test. Previous reports said that Diesel has played over 1,000 hours of the original game. Also, did you know his real name is actually Mark Sinclair?!</p>
<p>"Survive the past. Tame the future," reads Ark 2's official blurb. "Suddenly awakened on a primal world filled with dinosaurs and humans struggling for dominance, you must team-up with legendary heroes to confront powerful dark forces.</p>
<p>"Saddle up, and join the definitive next-gen survival experience with Ark 2!"</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Ark-related news, back in the summer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-dlc-trailer-slammed-for-its-blatant-use-of-ai-slop">Snail Games' Aquatica expansion for Survival Evolved came under fire after it released a trailer that was clearly made using AI</a>. The video - which is no longer available to view on YouTube - featured footage such as a single person using three hands to hold onto a spear gun, as well as fish phasing in and out of existence, an octopus with the wrong number of tentacles and a human with flippers where there should have been feet.</p>
<p>Soon after this trailer for Ark: Aquatica went live, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-developer-shifts-blame-for-disastrous-ai-trailer-onto-marketing-team">Snail Games moved to distance itself from the video</a>, blaming its marketing team.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Amazon MGM’s live-action <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tomb-raider/">Tomb Raider</a> show has signed up another Hollywood star with Jason Isaacs joining the cast in an undisclosed role. Given that he is English he could be playing Lara’s father or more likely, the bad guy. Isaacs was recently seen – quite explicitly – in The White Lotus where he played Timothy Ratliff. He has also voiced one of the villains in <a title="Baldur's Gate 3" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_3">Baldur’s Gate 3</a></p>
<p>He will be joining Sigourney Weaver who has confirmed herself that she will also be in the show. Phoebe Waller-Bridge will be writing and executive producing the series. Lara herself will be played by Sophie Turner.</p>


<p>Turner, whose breakout role came as Sansa Stark in the Game of Thrones series, before she played Jean Grey in X-Men: Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix, will be the third actor to play Lara Croft. She follows in the footsteps of Angelina Jolie, who starred in two films in the early 2000s, and Alicia Vikander, who had one shot at the role in 2018.</p>
<p>Turner said she was “thrilled beyond measure” and that “[Lara Croft is] such an iconic character, who means so much to so many – and I am giving everything I’ve got.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsungs-57-odyssey-curved-gaming-monitor-hits-a-record-low-with-nearly-1000-off-in-a-year-end-clearance-deal-2000654703</link>

              <p>Some gaming monitors get touted as being “ultra-wide” but this one really earns that namesake. The Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 gaming monitor stretches an intimidating 57″ across. If you’re in the market for a monitor that is just one step shy of spanning 360 degrees around you’re head while you play, well, this might be exactly what you’re looking for. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/">Amazon has the Samsung monitor listed right now for a staggering $850 off. That brings it to $1,450—about 37% off its original price.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="772" data-end="826">Performance That Extends Beyond Your Field of View</h2>
<p data-start="828" data-end="1339">Samsung proudly markets the Odyssey Neo G9 as the world’s first dual UHD gaming monitor. The screen is essentially the equivalent of two 32-inch 4K displays fused side by side, creating an ultra-wide canvas that delivers incredible clarity across an almost unfathomably wide viewing area. Thanks to Quantum Mini-LED technology paired with HDR 1000 support, the monitor reaches stunning levels of brightness, contrast, and color accuracy that make games and visuals feel strikingly lifelike.</p>
<p data-start="1341" data-end="1683">Speed is just as impressive as image quality. With an ultra-smooth 240Hz refresh rate and full support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, the Odyssey Neo G9 minimizes screen tearing, stuttering, and frame drops. As long as your gaming PC has the horsepower to keep up, you can expect fluid motion and responsive gameplay across the entire display.</p>
<p data-start="1685" data-end="2071">The screen’s aggressive 1000R curvature is designed to match the natural curvature of the human eye, making the monitor feel as though it’s wrapping around you. When positioned at the proper viewing distance, the display stretches from the far edges of your left peripheral vision all the way across to the right, creating an incredibly immersive experience that few monitors can rival.</p>


<p data-start="2073" data-end="2353">For connectivity, Samsung includes the latest DisplayPort 2.1, ensuring access to the some of the highest bandwidth and best performance available today. The monitor also supports HDMI 2.1 and features a USB-C hub, giving you plenty of options for connecting PCs, consoles, and other devices.</p>
<p data-start="2355" data-end="2742">Because of its immense width, the Odyssey Neo G9 excels at multitasking. Picture-by-picture mode allows you to display content from two different input sources simultaneously at their native resolutions. Samsung’s Auto Source Switch+ further can automatically detect newly powered-on devices and switching to the correct input without requiring any manual adjustments.</p>
<p data-start="2744" data-end="3034">On the back of the monitor, CoreSync and Core Lighting+ add some extra flair by matching ambient RGB lighting to the colors displayed on screen. If the ultra-wide monitor doesn’t capture you’re entire vision, the area around it will be illuminated to feel as though the screen extends even further than the absurd lengths it already does.</p>
<p data-start="3036" data-end="3400" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The monitor sits on a highly flexible, ergonomic stand that supports swivel, tilt, and height adjustments. It’s easy to dial in the perfect viewing position for any desk or user.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Next ARC Raiders Map Condition Named ‘Toxic Swamp’, Data Suggests]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/next-arc-raiders-map-condition-named-toxic-swamp/</link>

<p>ARC Raiders players are busy exploring every inch of the new Cold Snap update, which introduced the Flickering Flames event and maps blanketed in snow and harsh conditions. However, thanks to a clever trick, some are poring over what’s coming next to ARC Raiders, including a new map condition called ‘Toxic Swamp’.</p>



<p>We’ve taken a look at what’s coming in ARC Raiders, including the next few weeks of Trials and this mysterious map condition.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-arc-raiders-calendar">How to Check ARC Raiders’ Calendar</h2>



<p>If you want to see what’s coming next in ARC Raiders, you’ll need to be on PC. Simply boot the game, alter your system’s date to reflect one in the future, and you’ll see the game update to reference future events.</p>



<p>Of course, this means that things are still subject to change, so take anything you see with a pinch of salt.</p>



<p>In the next few weeks, players will be diving into Cold Snap-related challenges in the form of the Trials circuit:</p>



<ul>
<li>Search Frozen Raider Containers</li>



<li>Throw Snowballs at Rocketeers</li>



<li>Throw Snowballs at Bastions</li>
</ul>



<p>Things change midway through January, as Cold Snap ends on January 13. For a week, Hidden Bunker will return as the map condition of choice, and then on the week starting January 19, a new condition called Toxic Swamp opens up.</p>



<p>We don’t know exactly what that means, but it’s a relatively safe assumption that it’ll be a condition tied exclusively to Dam, given that the map already has a prolific swamp region. The newest missions added to ARC Raiders also reference growing toxicity in the swamp, which could be a precursor to the new map condition.</p>

<p>One of the rarest cosmetic items in Fortnite is finally available after a seven-year wait, although there are still some major restrictions on getting your hands on the item.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-fortnite-rust-bucket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rust Bucket Back Bling in Fortnite</a> has not appeared in the Item Shop since April 2018, where it was available across seven days after releasing before vanishing into the void. Now, though, Fortnite has made the item available again.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-rust-bucket-back-bling-returns">Fortnite Rust Bucket Back Bling Returns</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Back again. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The news of the return of the item comes from the ever-reliable <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/2001674471896170583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ShiinaBR</a>, who reveals that it is distributed as a reward during the NVIDIA Cup taking place in various regions this weekend.</p>



<p>Any player who participates in the event and secures a minimum of eight points will receive the Rust Bucket Back Bling as a reward, although the tournament is not open to all players and there are eligibility requirements.</p>



<p>To complete, players need to have participated in at least 14 tournaments during the past 180 days, have multi-factor authentication enabled on their account, and meet the age restrictions.</p>



<p>Due to these limitations, the Rust Bucket Back Bling will remain as one of Fortnite’s rarest and most exclusive items, with no suggestion that it will be available for direct purchase in the Item Shop anytime soon.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?source=shop&amp;sort=shop-longest-wait" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite.GG</a>, the Rust Bucket Back Bling is the second-rarest item across all of Fortnite, having not featured in the Item Shop for over 2,800 days, and is only behind the Mako Glider, which has not been in the Item Shop for over 2,900 days.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Oh, the weather outside is frightful, but your backlog is so delightful, that you will certainly have something to play over the holiday period. Are you waiting for something new under the Christmas tree? Or will you hunker down and play your favourite titles as that’s just a little more cosy. I’ll be continuing my own cosy return to Monster Hunter World, which has come back into regular rotation thanks to the fact that the end game is still more satisfying and in depth that Monster Hunter Wilds. That said, there’s a new update there, so I’ll check that out over the weekend too. Besides that, I’ve really enjoyed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/18/neon-inferno-review-the-new-run-n-gun-king/">Neon Inferno</a>, Rogue Trader, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/16/aaero2-black-razor-edition-review/">Aaero2: Black Razor Edition</a> and Demeo X Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked with Tef which has kept things pretty varied.</p>

<p><strong>Jason</strong> was the first to pop in, and he’s been playing Shape of Dreams, calling it, “A really fun roguelike with MOBA-style abilities you can customise with gems and a really nice aesthetic.” That’s not all though, as he continued, “I’ve also downloaded a bunch of games to my Steam Deck, and am hoping to get through some Shadow of Wardor too in the brief window of time off I have.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has returned to his regular stomping ground by playing Destiny 2 just a little bit, but he’s mostly playing the annual favourite “How do I keep both my mother and the mother-in-law happy over Christmas.” He’s also been playing a game of ‘getting the stupidest gifts possible.’ He explains, “My cat is giving my boyfriend a year’s supply of antihistamines as he’s allergic to cats.” Sounds pretty thoughtful for a cat.</p>
<p>Having finished Dispatch this week, <strong>Gamoc</strong> said, “It’s great, but too short and too episodic! Playing through it is like playing MGS5, with all the repeating credits and stuff.” He’s also tried a litany of things: CloverPit (Balatro for slot machines), News Tower, Megabonk, This Ain’t Even Poker, Ya Joker (an idle clicker with cards and poker hands), Destropolis, and Mycopunk, with the latter he said, “It seems really good but my PC barely runs it.” He also played ‘starting Stranger Things from the beginning since it’s now finally finishing’. His review? “Pretty good.”</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing Star Wars Outlaws. He says, “I’ve only had it since last Christmas… I’m enjoying it just exploring the planets, flying around space, and completing contracts as I go.”</p>

<p>Next up was <strong>Ade</strong>, and told us, “Along with playing the roguelike Wizards of Legend 2 with Laura (surely we must be getting close to defeating the first boss?!) I’ve also been on with the online coop shenanigans of Warhammer 40k Darktide (such a fun game!) And Metroid Prime 4.” He continues, “With Metroid Prime, I really can’t decide if I like it yet! Exploration is as brilliant as any other game in the series but there’s also a lot of fairly weak combat to slog through. Also, I can’t get over why this advanced species of psychic aliens are obsessed with motorbikes, so much so that the suit they’ve given to Sames makes her look like she’s competing in the Isle of Man TT. It’s a bit weird.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been getting back to clearing some of his physical media as he spent time in bed recovering from his bout of flu. What did he get up to? “I set up my 360 on an old monitor with headphone output and ploughed through the boring God of War clone Hellboy and the Science of Evil (only to discover that the real ending of the game is locked behind DLC that is no longer available…). I then started Quantum Theory which is the most 2010 game ever. Lots of Gears of War corridors and waist-high cover. In less physical gaming I played through some demos that were lurking from the last Next Fest to clear some hard drive space. And finally, I sat and played Sword of the Sea through which was a wonderfully chill and meditative time with awesome visuals and music.”</p>

<p><strong>Laura</strong> received a lovely treat from Ade: unadulterated horror! He thoughtfully bought Silent Hill f for her birthday this week. She said, “It’s been great fun going straight from Silent Hill 2 into playing the new one. I’m loving the traditional Silent Hill vibes but set in 1960s Japan. Everything I loved from 2, with spot-on tweaks to the gameplay elements. A birthday treat indeed!”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has been dipping in and out of a few games this week. I started by finishing up Ghost of Yotei which doesn’t have the most exciting ending, but I’m looking forward to exploring the open world and cross off some more bounties. I’ve now started playing Mafia: The Old Country which does an excellent job of slowly easing you into its early 1900s Sicilian setting – it’s been a couple of hours and I still haven’t fired a gun! Speaking of guns, I pulled the trigger and dove into Arc Raiders. For a PvP extraction shooter, the other players I’ve come across have all been surprisingly friendly, leading to cool impromptu encounters, helping each other take down Arcs and haul our loot to the exit zones.</p>
<p><strong>Miguel</strong> kept things short and sweet by playing a bunch of Fear &amp; Hunger: Termina, and a pinch of Fortnite, and finally, I gave it away in the opening, but <strong>Tef’s</strong> main gaming this week has been Demeo X Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>

              <p>Looking to finally invest in a Nintendo Switch? Now’s the time to lock one in, especially now that the holidays are here. Whether you like sitting on the couch, taking gaming on the go, or playing with friends at a get together, the Switch OLED version is a great console to bring home. It’s now the more affordable cousin of the Switch 2, and it’s available at an even lower price than usual.</p>
<p>If you think you’re ready to buy a Switch to start your new library of titles, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6170/">Amazon has the Nintendo Switch OLED Model w/ Joy-Con (Renewed) for just $308, down from its usual price of $385.</a> That is a discount of $77 and 20% off. Now, keep in mind that this is a Renewed version of the console, so it’s not brand new, but it’s still well worth grabbing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6171/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>One of Nintendo’s best portable gaming consoles</h2>
<p>One of the first things people notice about the OLED model is the display. It is wider and more vivid than the standard Switch screen, so colors look bright and bold whether you are on the go or playing in tabletop mode. This can make games feel more immersive and enjoyable, from exploring open worlds to playing puzzle games with friends.</p>
<p>Even though this unit is renewed, it still gives you the full Nintendo Switch experience. You can dock it to play on a TV just like a brand new model, or you can use it in handheld mode when you want gaming freedom without being tied to a screen in your living room. The joy con controllers are easy to detach for multiplayer games at a party or a family game night. You can also use the touch screen for compatible titles, which adds another layer of interaction.</p>



<p>The renewed model goes through inspection to make sure it works properly, which means you get the same game library and capabilities without paying full retail price. There may be a few cosmetic imperfections, but you’ll mostly be getting a blemish-free unit that’s been guaranteed to work.</p>
<p>With a huge library of games from all kinds of genres, the Switch is great for kids, teens, and adults who like variety in their play. From racing to role playing to fitness and rhythm games, there is stuff here for nearly everyone. It has become a go to portable console because it stays fun and fresh with new titles releasing regularly.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6170/">For just $308, down from $385, the Nintendo Switch OLED Model w/ Joy-Con (Renewed) gives you plenty of value with a ton of ways to play.</a> Whether you’re giving it as a gift or keeping it for yourself, it’s a good idea to go ahead and lock yours in.</p>

            <guid>1388083</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Doomed Xbox blockbuster <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled">Perfect Dark</a> had "entire chapters" of performance capture work in the can before its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">shock cancelation this summer</a>, according to Joanna Dark actress Alix Wilton Regan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/joanna-dark-perfect-dark-reboot-cancellation-details/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheGamer</a>, the voice behind Dragon Age's Inquisitor and Cyberpunk 2077's Alt Cunningham says she recorded scenes for The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot over the course of several years, beginning in 2023. "Lots" was done in 2024, with work continuing in early 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To my knowledge, we were pretty far along, I'd done entire chapters of this universe," Regan said, adding that she was shocked to learn that Microsoft was pulling the plug, with The Initiative itself also set to be closed down as part of a wave of funding cuts and layoffs. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was as shocked, surprised, and devastated as everyone else was when the funding was pulled, and the studio was closed," Wilton-Regan continued, saying she learned the studio's fate at the same time as it was announced publicly. "I did not see it coming. I was absolutely blindsided when the project was defunded," she added. "It was devastating. So many people lost their jobs. An entire workforce was disbanded."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A further blow would come as last-ditch talks to salvage the project also fell through — a process Wilton-Regan admits she had insider knowledge of. Interestingly, the actress mentioned that Perfect Dark may have changed in scope had it been saved, with a "slimmed-down" version ultimately seeing the light of day instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I couldn't say too much about it because I knew The Initiative was in talks to keep Perfect Dark up and running in some shape or form," Wilton-Regan revealed. "Possibly a slimmed-down version, possibly something slightly different. But certainly, everyone was working really hard behind the scenes to bring Perfect Dark back. And then one day, I heard from the creative director that the deal hadn't gone through, and that really everything had fallen apart, and production was fully stopping."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Perfect Dark Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report from Bloomberg</a>, which IGN corroborated from its own sources, previously revealed that there had been a plan to keep Perfect Dark alive via the team working on the project at Tomb Raider studio Crystal Dynamics, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-initiative-is-teaming-up-with-crystal-dynamics-to-develop-the-new-perfect-dark-game">which had been serving as a co-developer</a>. Leadership from both Crystal and The Initiative reportedly spent two months looking for a new publisher and funding source. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While multiple parties expressed interest, the most likely candidate turned out to be Take-Two Interactive. However, the two groups couldn't come to an agreement, at least in part due to disagreements over long-term ownership of the property. As a result, the deal fell through, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-more-following-perfect-dark-cancelation">resulting in layoffs</a> at Crystal Dynamics as all hope of the project being reinstated vanished.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, it was reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-hires-former-perfect-dark-leads-for-brand-new-2k-studio">Perfect Dark studio head Darrell Gallagher and director Brian Horton had now been hired by 2K</a> to start a brand new outfit. No details have yet emerged as to what the new studio will work on, or if any other former Perfect Dark employees joined them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Wilton-Regan, while she may have lost the Joanna Dark gig, this month's big Tomb Raider reveal at The Game Awards revealed that the actress was now the official new video game Lara Croft. She'll star in next year's reimagining of the original Lara Croft adventure, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis"><u>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</u></a>, as well as all-new blockbuster <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-catalyst">Tomb Raider: Catalyst</a>, due in 2027.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>Sony and Honda have announced its new car will include PlayStation Remote Play, so passengers can stream PS4 and PS5 games on the go.</p>
<p>The Afeela 1 will be the first car from the joint venture Sony Honda Mobility, established in 2022 to produce electric vehicles. The car will be available in California first in 2026.</p>
<p>PlayStation Remote Play will be integrated into the Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment system, so you'll need a PS4 or PS5 console at home to make use of the feature.</p>
<p>The vehicles will also feature an integrated display and premium audio system with which to play games. Presumably, you'll need to take your PlayStation controller with you on the road.</p>
<p>Note this use of Remote Play is separate to streaming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PS Plus games</a> via the cloud.</p>
<p>"The introduction of PS Remote Play embodies Afeela's vision for mobility: transforming the traveling space into a captivating and emotional one," said Izumi Kawanishi, representative director, president and COO, Sony Honda Mobility Inc.</p>
<p>"Through this integration, we are elevating the customer's entire travel experience to an unprecedented level of entertainment."</p>
<p>This is by no means the first time we've seen in-vehicle gaming. Back in 2022,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/casual-games-will-be-playable-on-a-bmw-next-year"> BMW announced it would begin offering casual gaming in its cars</a>, controlled using smartphones.</p>
<p>That same year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tesla-rolling-out-steam-integration-in-cars">Tesla announced in-vehicle Steam integration</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tesla-pulls-steam-from-new-vehicles-as-its-new-gaming-computer-is-no-longer-capable-of-playing-steam-games">18 months later it was dropped</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game of the Year 2025 – Best Puzzle Game]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/19/game-of-the-year-2025-best-puzzle-game/</link>
            <guid>1388068</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As Dr. Kawashima’s low polycount face reminded us all in the early 2000s, working out the brain is important to keep it sharp, and there’s one genre that works out your brain more than others. At least you would hope so, and that is the puzzle genre. The puzzle genre is wide in scope, with experiences that range from simply putting pieces together to other experiences where you need a notebook to write down everything so you can refer back them as things get more complicated. Our winner is definitely on the complex side of the puzzle genre.</p>

<p>Blue Prince is a massive achievement in the puzzle genre, providing an experience that just has <em>so</em> many layers to it. What seems to be a simple premise of finding a way to a secret room in a mansion, eventually spirals into a major multiroom and multirun experience where anything in the environment could be a clue for something else.</p>


<p>Blue Prince is a game that has spawned whole communities working together to figure out the different conundrums that pop up, from uncovering switches to open new areas, to working out what certain objects across different rooms actually mean and deciphering their importance. Blue Prince is the ultimate puzzle game of 2025, and it will be one that confounds new players for years to come.</p>
<h3>Lumines Arise – Runner Up</h3>
<p>Enhance and Tetsuya Mizuguchi have seemingly made it their mission to make games about making blocks disappear in a sense overloading explosive celebration. The team smashed it out of the park with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/11/09/tetris-effect-review/">Tetris Effect</a> in 2018 and has now shifted focus back to Mizuguchi’s own Lumines to revolutionise it for a new generation. Lumines Arise takes the puzzle element of building up your score by repeatedly forming blocks of matching colour, and presents it in such a way that you become utterly engrossed in the action.</p>

<p>Lumines Arise is a stunning audio and visual package which doesn’t just provide an environment in which to solve the puzzles, but pulls you to be enveloped by music and art which are as essential to each puzzle as the blocks themselves. Lumines Arise is proof that puzzle games can be some of the most breath-taking games imaginable.</p>
<h3>Is This Seat Taken? – Runner Up</h3>
<p>One of the biggest social challenges we face pretty early on in life is finding a place to sit, be it at school or family gatherings. Choosing a seat is more than just finding a comfortable place to plonk yourself, it determines who you could be interacting with for the duration of being seated. And what if you sit somewhere when the person already sitting there wants to be left alone? Is This Seat Taken? takes that situation and makes a game of putting people in the correct seats while they go on a journey.</p>
<p>Is This Seat Taken? is a nice and simple premise that creates ever increasing challenges as you figure out where people should be seated, while keeping everyone happy. If you have ever done a seating plan for a party or wedding, you know how difficult that is. The game gives you different issues to deal with. Someone might be very chatty and want to sit with someone who will indulge them in conversation, while someone else might be a bit smelly so hardly anyone wants to sit by them, and some people will want to be left alone. While not the most difficult of puzzle games Is This Seat Taken is certainly unique, taking a relatively normal part of human life and turning it into an engaging experience.</p>
<p><strong>Honourable Mentions</strong> (in alphabetical order)</p>

			<p>In yet another <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/">unionization effort within the last seven days</a>, this time on the north side of the North American border, 74% of the Ubisoft Halifax team voted in favour of a wall-to-wall union and have joined the CWA Canada Local 30111, alongside <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2024/07/01/game-workers-file-to-unionize-with-cwa-canada/">Bethesda Game Studios Montreal</a> and the Montreal Gazette staff. </p>



<p>The news was announced with a press release on the <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2025/12/18/ubisoft-halifax-workers-win-certification-vote-officially-join-cwa-canada/">CWA Canada website</a>, with the move adding 60 Ubisoft Halifax staff to Local 30111. Altogether, the staff represent several branches at the studio, including <em>"producers, programmers, designers, artists, researchers, and development testers</em>."</p>



<p>In a mission statement, the studio calls the union a move one made "<em>not in opposition to Ubisoft, but in partnership, with the goal of ensuring our studio remains a beacon of equity, excellence, and innovation</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>In an era marked by industry-wide uncertainty,</em> <em>studio closures, layoffs, and increasing instability, we want to make clear our commitment to one another and to our craft</em>," the statement reads. "<em>We believe that creativity flourishes when workers feel secure, supported, and empowered</em>."</p>



<p>The most recent studio to vote in favour of a wall-to-wall union was id Software, with 165 developers joining the CWA just last Friday, December 12. 2025 has also seen the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/">ZeniMax Workers QA union finally reach a deal with Microsoft</a> after two years of negotiating, another <a href="https://wccftech.com/450-diablo-developers-vote-in-favor-unionizing-cwa/">450 Diablo developers voting in favour of unionization</a>, and nearly <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-overwatch-2-team-at-blizzard-just-unionized-the-second-wall-to-wall-union-at-blizzard/">200 developers from the Overwatch 2 team at Blizzard voting for unionization</a>.</p>



<p>Ubisoft Halifax is right to call out the uncertainty lurking in the industry. Microsoft, the defacto biggest publisher in the industry and one of the three big console manufacturers, has <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-denies-report-it-could-have-shut-down-xbox-business-in-2021/">denied reports that it would shut down the entire Xbox platform</a>. But with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-call-out-microsoft-mass-layoffs-inhumane-disgusting/">number of layoffs Microsoft has had in its gaming division</a>, it's understandable why people would even ask the question, and it's not a great sign for the industry to be in a place where people are earnestly asking this question.</p>



<p>Ubisoft has had three instances of layoffs this year. First, in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">January 2025, at its Ubisoft Leamington studio in the UK</a>, followed by layoffs at <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">Trials developer Ubisoft Redlynx</a>, and layoffs at The Division, Star Wars Outlaws, and Frontiers of Pandora developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-massive-entertainment-layoffs/">Massive Entertainment</a>.</p>



<p>Now that the team has voted in favour of unionizing, the studio will begin to negotiate a contract with Ubisoft. "<em>Now let’s get to work negotiating a first collective agreement that recognizes the talent and dedication of these workers</em>," said CWA Canada president, Carmel Smyth.</p>



<p>CWA Canada has also been active elsewhere in the country, <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2025/12/12/cwa-canada-urges-competition-bureau-to-scrutinize-55-billion-electronic-arts-buyout/">calling on Competition Bureau Canada</a> to closely scrutinize <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">EA's buyout deal</a> to ensure it protects Canadian developers and consumers from a labour and security perspective, and organizing a protest outside of Rockstar Toronto in solidarity with the 34 workers fired from Rockstar this past October. </p>



<p>Since that continent-spanning dismissal, with 31 workers fired across the UK and three in Toronto, Rockstar has been accused of union-busting, though the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-rockstar-reaffirms-claims-fired-employees-dismissed-for-distributing-confidential-information/">denies the accusations and claims the fired workers had been</a> <em>"discussing and distributing confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum</em>."</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/">Wccftech attended the protest to speak to those demonstrating, and also talked with one of the three workers fired from Toronto</a>. The CWA Canada representatives who organized the protest, and the fired worker, both say that all the workers were doing was discussing their working conditions and organizing efforts in a private, employees-only and union-representatives-only Discord server. </p>



<p>"<em></em><em>The official story from management is that they were, quote unquote, leaking sensitive information</em>," said Nasr Ahmed, one of the CWA Canada representatives who organized the protest. "<em></em><em>But we know that this is patently false.</em> <em> They [Rockstar] have not provided any proof for these claims,</em>  <em>either for the Canadian workers or the UK workers. At the end of the day, discussing workers' rights and discussing working conditions is not against the law as far as I know, in either Canada or in the UK, which is exactly what these workers were doing.</em>"</p>



<p>One of the three workers fired from Rockstar Toronto said that "<em></em><em>We were there mostly to talk about working conditions. Sometimes we would socialize, but the only reason we would ever be there was to discuss working conditions among the studio. I will also mention that we had a very thorough vetting process</em>."</p>



<p>They also added, "<em></em><em>We just want to get back to work on the game. We poured our heart and soul into</em> <em>it, and to be let go just for discussing our working conditions amongst ourselves and wanting the company to be better, it's heartbreaking</em>."</p>

			<p>Although the Halo series has faced some challenges lately, it's undeniable that the franchise remains one of the most popular modern gaming series ever. Halo Studios is well aware of the current general perception of their series, and by reportedly <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"giving the Covenant back their bomb"</em>, and remaking Halo 2 and Halo 3, it wants to ensure the franchise's new era doesn't fail with a new game whose reception is uncertain.</p>



<p>Well-known<span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">&nbsp;and reliable series insider&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@RebsGaming" target="_blank"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Rebs Gaming</strong></a>&nbsp;took a close look at the c</span>urrent series rumors, which claim that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/halo-2-3-remakes-in-the-works-halo-7-multiplayer-experience/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">remakes of the second and third entries in the series</strong></a> will follow next year's <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Halo: Campaign Evolved</strong></a>, providing some additional information&nbsp;straight from reliable sources, including an alleged former developer.</p>



<p>Hints that a Halo 2 remake could be coming in the future were already discovered back in April 2024, when Dan Gniady joined Halo Studios and later added the iconic <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfD9WbdXoI8"><strong>"Giving the Covenant back their bomb"</strong></a></em> quote from the game to their LinkedIn profile. </p>



<p>A few months later, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://x.com/TechnicalHalo"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)">big baby beluga (TechnicalHalo)</strong></a> revealed correct information on the Campaign Evolved remake one year before its official announcement, proving they had access to insider information. This insider also claimed that remakes of the second and third entries in the series were planned, as the studio reportedly believed that reselling the series on new platforms, rather than porting the Master Chief Collection, had higher revenue potential.</p>



<p>As they say, where there's smoke, there's fire, and it seems like these remakes are, at the very least, being planned. Rebs Gaming claims to have spoken with a former Halo Studios developer who said that Halo 2 and 3 are being remade, but couldn't share more due to an NDA. </p>



<p>Even so, in terms of scope, these two remakes shouldn't be too different from Campaign Evolved, doing away with their multiplayer components and keeping faithful to the originals' stories, although they may not stick to the original endpoints. Additionally, the two remakes are expected to launch from the same game or hub.</p>



<p>In addition, a reliable source backed up Rebs Gaming assumption that <em>"Microsoft and Halo Studios leadership wants to ensure that Halo’s new era doesn’t fail by playing it safe and avoiding risks. Specifically, they want to avoid making another new Halo game that is heavily criticized by the OG Halo fans. So they’re playing it safe by remaking the original games because they can’t afford to fail again and the original Halo games were very successful and many people still play them."</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>As Halo Studios is focusing on Halo: Campaign Evolved, it will be a while before we learn if the all classic entries in the series will be remade at some point. Still, considering the rift that opened between the community and the series with the launch of Halo 4 and continued to widen with the following games, it makes quite a bit of sense to begin the new era by returning to the games that fans love, building a solid foundation upon which future new entries in the series could stand.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Epic Games has confirmed a significant restructure to Winterfest rewards distributed in Fortnite, which could result in some players missing out on the full slate.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s annual Winterfest event kicked off on December 18, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-winterfest-2025-all-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">total of 16 rewards available</a> to claim for free, but an immediate bug was encountered, which was later fixed alongside confirmation that players will need to be active for the majority of the event to claim all of the rewards.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-winterfest-rewards-won-t-stack">Fortnite Winterfest Rewards Won’t Stack</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Limited. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unlike previous Winterfest rewards, including last year’s, the gifts available in the cabin to claim do not stack, with a maximum of one opening per day, <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/2001798607070970065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite confirmed on Twitter</a>.</p>



<p>This means that players who may be travelling or busy during the festive season could miss out on the biggest rewards, including the two exclusive skins, which are unlocked by claiming a total number of rewards and can’t be claimed individually.</p>



<p>There are 14 total rewards distributed from the daily gift claim in the cabin, meaning less than seven days of the entire three-week-long event can be missed if you want to claim all of the rewards.</p>



<p>To claim the Glacial Dummy Outfit, seven days’ worth of rewards need to be collected, while the Cheeks outfit is unlocked once 13 days of presents have been opened.</p>



<p>Players have already hit out at Epic Games regarding the changes over social media, pointing out that the priority for players won’t be logging into Fortnite daily over the holidays, and will instead be spending time with friends and family.</p>



<p>While it doesn’t take long to log into Fortnite and claim a Winterfest reward, the requirement for daily activity will still cause trouble for plenty of players.</p>

            <p>Marathon art director and veteran Bungie developer Joseph Cross has announced his departure from the company, mere months ahead of the extraction shooter's release in 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-joseph-cross-stepped-down-marathon-franchise-art-director/">First spotted by The Game Post</a>, Cross updated his LinkedIn profile and social media profiles to indicate the end of his 14-year-run at the renowned sci-fi FPS studio. He later announced the news on X with a farewell statement.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/josephacross/status/2001888322071990744">Cross wrote</a>: "I'm incredibly proud of the visual world we built for Marathon. Getting support at this scale for something a bit different is rare, and the art team at Bungie is the best in the biz. I'll be enjoying playing the game as a fan with all of you. Massive thank you to everyone who has supported through all of it."</p>

<figcaption>Here's the new Vision of Marathon developer deep dive.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjzmhROTv28" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>This sudden change in artistic leadership follows a plagiarism scandal that rocked Marathon, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">it was discovered the extraction shooter used artist Antireal's work without permission</a>. Earlier this month, Antireal stated the situation had been resolved: "to my satisfaction".</p>
<p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-leaves-bungie-2000654665">Ethan Gach at Kotaku contacted Cross</a> to ask if his leaving Bungie was of his own volition, or a consequence of said plagiarism scandal. Cross responded, stating it was his own choice, as well as: "I'm super proud of the project and what the team accomplished over the last six years."</p>
<p>This comes shortly after a fresh gameplay deep dive from Bungie on Marathon, which showcased a gigantic overhaul of the title. It now has a solo queue, proximity chat, more challenging PvE UESC enemies, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/TauCetiGG/status/2001727624096424106">The tagline for the game has also seemingly been changed</a>. Previously, Marathon's tagline was: "Escape will make me God", though now it appears to be "Death is the first step". Why this has changed has not been explained officially, but it's worth noting that after the plagiarism scandal a popular joke of sorts emerged online, with the game's detractors posting: "Plagiarism will make me God".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-troubled-extraction-shooter-marathon-still-aiming-for-release-by-march-2026">Marathon is set to release in March 2026</a>, with all eyes fixed on whether Bungie can turn the public reception of the game around and pull a big success out of the hat after a rocky start.</p>

            <p>Larian is set to host an AMA in the new year to follow-up on its use of generative AI, following a huge backlash earlier this week.</p>
<p>In a statement shared on social media, Larian CEO Swen Vincke stated it would be "irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies" and the company's successes "come from empowering people to work in their own way".</p>
<p>It follows backlash against the company after Vincke told Bloomberg <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated">the studio is using generative AI</a>, but its newly-revealed Divinity game won't include anything AI-generated.</p>

<p>"Holy **** guys we're not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/holy-fck-guys-were-not-pushing-hard-for-or-replacing-concept-artists-with-ai-larian-ceo-responds-to-genai-backlash">Vincke responded on social media</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, the studio uses "AI tools to explore references", and its developers are hired for "their talent" and "not for their ability to do what a machine suggests".</p>
<p>Still, the debate around using generative AI has erupted in the wake of Vincke's statements, so much so the company will now provide an opportunity for fans to ask further questions in the new year.</p>
<p>"It's been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation," wrote Vincke last night on social media.</p>

<p>"Larian's DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, and players. A better work day, and a better game.

<p>"In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/samson-will-feature-elements-mad-max-just-cause-main-story-10-hours-bump-to-25/</link>
            <guid>1388029</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-tyndalston-story-open-world-game-protagonist-fighting-out-of-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiling</a> of <strong>Samson: A Tyndalston Story</strong> at the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025 Showcase, developer Liquid Swords has now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3634520/view/524236943144256435?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a detailed FAQ</a> on what players can expect in the game.</p>



<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that Avalanche Studios founder Cristofer Sundberg <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-like-open-world-game-shows-off-photorealistic-visuals-in-debut-images/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">established Liquid Swords</a>, the studio confirmed that there will be elements inspired by two of that team's most renowned titles: Mad Max and Just Cause. When it comes to the latter, Just Cause players will recognize an emphasis on physicality, momentum, and emergent systems interaction, although Samson won't feature an exaggerated spectacle and chaos for its own sake, opting for a more grounded approach instead. As for Mad Max, this new game reminds it with its heavy, personal melee combat as well as the vehicle combat mechanics, although of course there are many differences due purely to the setting. </p>



<p>Beyond the comparisons with those games, Samson's combat, whether on foot or on a vehicle, rejects stylization in favor of functional, purposeful violence. Rather than accessing predetermined weapon loadouts, players will utilize environmental tools (wrenches, tires, brick piles, to name a few) and create opportunities through improvisation. There's a large variety of melee weapons and these can be stored in vehicle trunks for tactical preparation, but the surroundings always provide immediate alternatives. Damage carries visual and mechanical weight; impacts break environmental elements and visibly mark both the player character and enemies.</p>



<p>Driving is a key component of Samson. Liquid Swords stressed that vehicle handling emphasizes weight, impact, and physical sensation, with intentional differentiation between vehicle types. Players can drive any vehicle they find, although strangely, the developers explicitly mentioned that civilians won't be removed from the vehicles, unlike in Grand Theft Auto. That seems to suggest the player character would be effectively kidnapping them, too, although that is unconfirmed at the moment. Of course, stealing will elicit a response from law enforcement that escalates further based on the player's actions. But other NPCs react, too, responding differently to aggression (fighting back or fleeing).</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Samson_Car_Chase-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>Samson is priced at just <strong>$24.99</strong>, so it makes sense that the main narrative would be relatively short. While the game offers freedom to explore the open world, the experience won't be virtually endless, focusing instead on missions and the overarching story (Samson's attempt to pay off his debt as the clock goes against him). Indeed, Liquid Swords confirmed it should take around <strong>10 hours</strong>, but side content can bump that to approximately <strong>25 hours</strong>. These include vehicle-based jobs such as high-stakes hits, underground races, and daring getaways, as well as theft, hand-to-hand combat, and tailing missions to gather critical information. Completing these jobs will contribute to the player progression system, which includes skills and perks that support various playstyles.</p>



<p>There won't be any difficulty settings, so players will have to experience the game's level of challenge as it was intended by the creators. Finally, Liquid Swords acknowledged the challenges of optimizing an open world game, but claimed that they have been working on it since the beginning and also received the support of Epic Games (Samson is powered by Unreal Engine 5).</p>



<p>The objective is to launch in early 2026 on PC, with console versions following later due to the team's small size.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> is set for some big changes as part of an overhaul targeting a 2027 release, Riot Games have confirmed following a report on the coming revamp by Bloomberg. Yep, the MOBA's devs have pulled the trigger on their official announcement a little earlier than planned, waxing lyrical about laying "the groundwork for League’s next era" now, rather than waiting to reveal all in the new year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Starting with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/riot-has-a-secret-plan-to-remake-its-league-of-legends-game?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a>'s report (paywalled), the site alleged this this League makeover is currently dubbed "League Next" and will arrive in 2027. The report pegged it as the sort of serious facelift which arguably amounts to a full remake or sequel-lite sort of reimagining. Bloomberg also claimed that Riot have announced some sort of internal reorganisation, but didn't provide any more details as to the effects that'll have.</p>
<p>Shortly after the report's publication, Riot put out a video which saw League studio head Andrei van Roon and executive producer Paul Bellezza confirm the lion's share of the reported big changes are coming and the 2027 target date. "We were planning to share this video with you in early January as part of the bigger season start moment, but since some early speculation is making the rounds, we felt we should share it earlier," van Roon explained <a href="https://x.com/RiotMeddler/status/2001780724853276988">a tweet</a>.</p> <div>

<p>The confirmed changes are as follows: A new "around-game" client which is "fully integrated with the in-game experience", rather than being a separate app. A "full visual overhaul" of the Summoner's Rift map, plus "gameplay changes tied to that visual update". Some tweaks to runes and how pre-game choices are made. Finally, the pair made clear that a key part of this overhaul's aimed at dragging more fresh faces into the MOBA, with Bellezza emphasising that once planned changes to the newbie onboarding experience have been made, it should be "the best time ever to get your friends into League".</p><p>"This work is part of our efforts to refocus on what we believe matters most to you," van Room summarised in his tweet. "Over the past year, we hope you’ve been feeling this in the changes we’ve been making. This next phase builds on that momentum—and lays the groundwork for League’s next era." He added that Riot plan to reveal more details about the overhaul between their Mid-Season Invitational and World Championship League tournaments next year, including a more concrete time within 2027 when you can expect the revamp to arrive.</p>
<p>Well, at least that gives folks plenty of time to get some more current League under their belts beforehand, as former RPS reviews guru Ed Thorn did with some egging on from streamy people <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-sad-to-announce-im-considering-playing-league-of-legends-again">earlier this year</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> is getting a massive overhaul in 2027, with everything from the games' client to the in-game visuals receiving significant changes to "lay the groundwork for League's next era."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/riot-has-a-secret-plan-to-remake-its-league-of-legends-game?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NjA5NjE4NCwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NzAwOTg0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0hLMzhLR1pBSzYwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJGRUIzODlCNUI2ODI0RTY0QjY5MENEODE1RTBDREZGRCJ9.UPpzbjNqabzTLwz-1lVVBK4cfd1jmlT9gxz17gLhVrA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">This first popped up via a scorching report by Bloomberg.</a> It broke the news late last night that this update, dubbed internally as League Next, would include various ambitious updates to the 16-year-old MOBA. According to the report, an internal restructuring at Riot has been announced coinciding with this project.</p>
<p>Following the publishing of Bloomberg's article, <a href="https://x.com/RiotMeddler/status/2001780724853276988">Riot Games released a snippet of an upcoming Dev Update</a> as well as a brief overview of what would be changing. It did so, according to head of League studio Andrei van Roon as: "early speculation was making the rounds."</p>

<p>This video confirmed that League of Legend's vast update will include a refresh to the game's dated PC client, a full visual overhaul to the Summoner's Rift game mode, gameplay changes tied to that overhaul, changes to Runes and pre-game systems, and an improved new player experience.</p>
<p>Andrei van Roon stated more details on this League of Legends renovation will come later in 2026 at some point between the MSI and Worlds competitive events, which take place in June and October respectively.</p>
<p>League of Legends has received its fair share of bold innovations recently, including a new thematic seasonal approach as well as controversial new WASD keyboard controls aimed at making the game easier to get into for new players.</p><p>

The game has been poised to change drastically for a few years now. Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-a-behemoth-sustained-by-a-determination-to-change">deputy editorial director Chris Tapsell returned to the game</a> in the midst of a substantial damage creep adjustment. He noted: "The state of League of Legends, midway through 2022, is that it is utterly gigantic. You've probably heard that many times before - but it's also gigantic in a way that feels unusually stable. For one, this is because LoL has achieved what seems to be the ultimate goal for many video games: to expand into things that are not video games."

            <p>A new report claims that The Last of Us and Uncharted studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> recently ordered its employees to take on "mandatory" overtime, often known as 'crunch',  in order to finalise a demo for its next game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic">Bloomberg</a>, staff at Naughty Dog were asked to work a minimum of eight extra hours a week to get back on track after several missed deadlines, but no more than a total of 60 hours a week.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>In addition to the extra hours, sources at Naughty Dog said developers were instructed to come into the office for five days a week. This was up from the previous three days a week office mandate. </p>
<p>A knock-on effect of this change left many employees needing to source extra child and pet care. According to the report, studio management has told employees its in-office mandate will return to three days a week for January. Sources added this period of additional mandatory overtime at Naughty Dog came to an end this week for many, having begun in late October, though some wonder if it will happen again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the demo for Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which staff were crunching to finalise for parent company Sony, was apparently completed this week. Allegedly, Naughty Dog is aiming to release the game some time in mid-2027.</p>
<p>Neither Sony nor Naughty Dog has commented on the report's claims.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crunch-once-again-in-the-spotlight-after-damning-report-on-the-last-of-us-2-developer-naughty-dog">Naughty Dog was previously the subject of a damning report in 2020</a>, again regarding crunch at the studio. At this time, it was said development on its then-upcoming The Last of Us Part 2 resulted in burnout which caused several members of Naughty Dog's staff to leave.</p><p>In 2021, the studio's then co-presidents Evan Wells and Neil Druckmann addressed crunch at the studio. At this time, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2021/08/28/naughty-by-nature-naughty-dog-leadership-reflects-on-the-studios">Wells said</a>: "I have definitely personally worked very hard over the years. I think some of that has helped me get to where I am in my career."</p>
<p>Druckmann, who remains at the studio, added: "We're looking at quality of life for preventing burnout, to employ the brain power we have in our studio, and we started coming up with working groups to talk about the areas in the studio where we can improve… Everybody has a different definition of what crunch means. And I guess for us, we think of it as, how do we look out for the well-being of our colleagues and everyone that works at Naughty Dog, which is some combination of how many hours you work and how much stress you're feeling, whether that’s something that's going on in the office or at home.</p>
<p>"We find that there is no one solution that fits everybody. Everybody has a unique situation we might need to address."</p>

<p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet was first announced at the end of last year, with a trailer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">featuring a retro futuristic energy that introduced us to Tati Gabrielle's bounty hunter</a>, Jordan A Mun.</p>
<p>While we still don't know a huge amount about Naughty Dog's upcoming release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion">Druckmann revealed in March that Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophecy explores the topics of "faith and religion"</a>. It will also be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-naughty-dogs-most-expansive-and-expensive-game-says-neil-druckmann">studio's "most ambitious game" it's "ever made"</a>.</p>
